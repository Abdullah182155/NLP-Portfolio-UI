I'll now turn the call over to Scott for his brief opening remarks before we move to Q&A. Good afternoon. Thanks everyone for joining today. We had a strong close to calendar 2017. This quarter we grew revenue 43% year-over-year and generated over $67 million of free cash flow. We now have more than $112,000 customers in total and after adding 4,825 net new customers during the quarter. This is the most net new customers we’ve ever added in a single quarter and another milestone in our way to serving a Fortune 500,000.
We saw solid demand across all our deployment options: cloud, server and data center. We continue to expand the customers of all sizes and across numerous industries and geographies. While alongside the growth of our business, Mike and I both are humbled and excited by the rapid expansion of the vibrant ecosystem surrounding Atlassian.
There are thousands of developers and vendors outside of Atlassian's who are creating apps that make our core products even more powerful and our customers even happier. Today our marketplace vendors offer more than 3,500 apps. And during the quarter, the Atlassian marketplace surpassed $350 million in total lifetime sales since its inception in 2012. In our shareholder letter, we highlighted three of our vendors who are helping to drive this growth.
Our developers and vendors combined with our global customer and partner base formed the foundation of the thriving Atlassian community. We will soon be going on the road on our first Atlassian team tour to spend more time with our community, to unveil new product updates, share the latest in team practices and discuss the future of team work. We will kick the tour off on February 8th in Amsterdam and then across the globe with a total of 10 stops on three continents.
Before we move to Q&A, I'd like to say a heartfelt thanks to our CFO, Murray Demo. This is his last earnings call with us before James Beer takeover as our new CFO. It's been a privilege to work with Murray over the past years, both in his capacity as CFO and as an Atlassian Board member before that. We wish him the best.
With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator to Q&A. Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the time Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Thanks guys and congrats on another great quarter. Couple of things for me. First of all on Stride it's still in limited access, early access. Can you give us some color on the feedback you’ve been getting from customers? What are some of the good things and bad things you’re hearing from customers and how soon we will see it generally available in the marketplace? Thanks for the question. It's Scott here. You are right. I mean, Stride we had an early access program and we put away within -- we had so much demand for the product and the feedback we’ve had so far has been overwhelmingly positive. Our customers really liking -- they’re liking the differentiated features. The fact that Stride is -- it allows you to get work done and also with the whole communication platform rather than just a shared product, so they’re giving exact feedback about that. The differentiated features, actions and decisions which we put in, in order to help people progress work, we are getting a lot of great feedback around that. And so -- and in the coming months we will move it from a early access sort of waitlist [ph] program to the general availability, but we don't have the exact release date at this time. Got it. And then a second question, Murray, maybe you could give us a little bit more collar on -- very nice customer addition count. Is there are any color you can give around that in what product areas it was stronger than what you thought? What areas where maybe a little bit softer? And then also just one question on the tax rate, just given the change in the tax procedure here in the U.S, how should we think about modeling your non-IFRS tax rate going forward? Hey, Ittai. It's Murray. I will turn it over to Jay to talk about the customer count and then when he is done we will come back and talk about the tax rate. Yes, just quickly to Ittai, obviously we’re really pleased with the add in the quarter. There was pretty strong demand kind of universally across all products and platforms, no real colors to highlight. Net customer adds does move around a bit quarter-to-quarter and so even though we’re really proud of the nearly 5K we added this quarter. It's kind of a drop in the bucket around the Fortune 500,000 we are chasing. Yes, in terms of the tax rate, couple of things to kind of point out makes us a little bit different. First of all, our fiscal year, half the year is at the 35 rate in the U.S., the other half is at 21. So we’re not like other calendar companies where they’re starting the calendar 2018 where you get a full-year of benefit of the rate. And secondly, we are a U.S and Australian company and so you’ve got a blend that way. When you kind of put all that together for fiscal '18, sort of the second half of the year for us, we are not seeing a whole lot of benefit. That’s going to show up in fiscal '19, we get a full-year of the U.S benefit in other activities that we’ve got is where we see that. Also just since you bought up the tax rate, I just want to comment on one thing regarding our Q3 and Q4 EPS. While our Q3 EPS target, our implied Q4 EPS target in the full-year, we’ve got quite a swing in the tax rate that’s embedded in the EPS targets for Q3 and implied for Q4 and it's strictly from IFRS. The full-year nothing is changing. Just under IFRS it's quite different from GAAP. We are not just in a position to smooth it out like you can in GAAP and we get these wild swings, there's nothing going in there other than just the way IFRS calculates it. And so the focus should be more on what our full-year rate that’s sort of implied in the EPS targets and not to get too focused on the Q3 EPS and imply tax rate in the Q4 rate. Is there a way then to think about what the full-year fiscal '19 tax rates could be, some sort of a bracket range around that? You know we are not providing any targets for fiscal '19, but we'd expect to see a lower rate as we go into '19 and we will provide more details on that as we get to the point of giving our fiscal '19 guidance. Got it. Good luck guys. Thank you. The next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company. please go ahead. Okay. Thank you and congratulations everyone on a good all-round quarter as well. Scott, you said that cloud, server, and data center all did well. But over the course of the last six months or so, have you seen any change with respect to the mix of new or existing customers adopting your cloud offerings? Or do you say that that’s been stable overall? Gregg, good question. The -- as we’re seeing for a long time the trend is towards cloud clearly from us and other companies you see. But nothing has really changed over the last quarter. We still continue to see strength in cloud, server, and data center, and so there is some particular inflection point and we think there is a still a long business in there behind the firewall server deployments for a long time. Okay, perfect. And then just a question for Murray. I’m wondering if you could help us or parse for us the impact, if you will, to Q2 billings and revenue from any early maintenance renewals from customers who perhaps wanted to get ahead of the Jan 1 price increase and part of the reason for my asking the question is also to sort of make sure the street has some help with respect to modeling the March quarter appropriately as well? Thanks. Yes, Gregg. That’s a good question. It's obviously something that we’re very focused on as well as trying to understand any of this if you want to call it pull forward bookings that’s related to the change in pricing. One of the things that we’ve learned through the change in pricing on server, but also in cloud is that the customers are most sensitive price. They tend to take action fairly quickly around the time of the announcements. And what we saw is actually that we probably saw even a little more of this sort of pull forward bookings in the first quarter than we did in the second quarter, because we announced it in the first quarter. And what we also saw that was a little bit different was some of our customers chose to go multiyear and you can see that on the balance sheet under the long-term deferred revenue. So they’re locking in with us for a number of years. They made a decision they wanted to go ahead and buy server maintenance revenue for multiyear upfront, and we saw some of that. But as you got into this -- later into the second quarter, it seem to be all kind of behind us and it was more pronounced in the sort of September, October timeframe is where we saw it. So we’re pleased obviously to have that, but obviously a longer term we'd rather had them renew under the new pricing, because that wouldn’t necessarily be a little bit of less revenue for us over the longer term, but we’re always happy to see customers that are committed to us for the longer term. That’s great. And Murray have you seen any uptick in churn following the cloud and server price increases just over the past few months or so? So what we saw there was in the first couple of months which was Q1, which we talked to all of you about during that call and everything is that, we expected some customers to kind of downgrade from being a -- call it a customer on monthly and kind of drop to the 10 user level where they could get the starter pricing. Some went to annual and we had factored all that into our calculations. All that kind of activity just -- kind of went away as we got into the second quarter and part of the reason why we saw a stronger customer account is actually lower churn in cloud. So, our customers that were sensitive to price, they did with a -- wanted to do around that, but it's really been -- as Jay said, well received. Its behind us. We continue to be a leader obviously in low price, high value and it's always very successful. We are on track with the guidance we provided around the change in the cloud pricing of low single-digits for the year that’s right on track. And so, at this point after five months, we’re very pleased with the results we’ve seen and how highly correlated it is to all the modeling that we’ve done in advance. That’s very helpful. Thanks very much guys. The next question comes from Bhavan Suri with William Blair. Please go ahead. Hey guys, can you hear me okay? Yes, definitely Bhavan. Yes, great. Thanks and congrats. Yes, hi, guys. So, I guess, two questions. One for maybe Jay and the guys here. So that we seem sort of continued momentum around Service Desk, JIRA Service Desk, you guys certainly talked about it, talked about in last quarter a lot. I guess, when you think about some of the larger deals you’re seeing there and you think about the main competitor there, what do you think in terms of is the gap there? When JIRA was early on, there was a sort of gap with Rally. No one really talks about Rally anymore. So now comparing that to JIRA Service Desk and some of the competitors there and obviously investment side, do you think there is a material gap and sort of how far behind those guys do you think you might be from an enterprise deployment perspective of JIRA Service Desk versus say ServiceNow or some of the other smaller guys like Cherwell [ph] or whatever? Yes. Hey, Bhavan. This is Mike. I can take that. Look, obviously we remain really excited about JIRA Service Desk, right. It is as you mentioned one of our fastest-growing product areas. As we said, I think last quarter it was past 25,000 organizations now. So we are really happy about how it's coming along. I do think it's pretty differentiated to the competition, specifically in the way we think about service teams. It does a great job in IT and technical teams, but we see a much broader blue Ocean in the service teams within an organization, much more focus on the broader business team, so legal, finance, HR and all the other teams that are effectively servicing other groups within an enterprise. And I think that's the main differentiation that flows from a philosophy into the product and into everything else. At the same time, one of the other differentiations of JIRA Service Desk obviously is bringing our ecosystem to bear. You’ve seen it is a great quarter for the marketplace and the ecosystem is really humming along nicely inside JIRA Service Desk of providing expansions, use cases and useful value in different parts of a business. That’s helpful. Thanks. Then -- and then one quick follow-up here just on R&D. You guys have sort of talked about R&D allocation, you’ve talked about a fair amount of effort replatforming for the cloud, the team platform on Mobile, but as you think about optimizing R&D and obviously that’s really the biggest expense you guys have, how do you guys think about through '18? And then I'm not asking about '19, because I know Murray will shoot me down about '19 targets, but over the next 3 to 5 years sort of the optimization allocation R&D, just sort of how you guys think about that will be helpful? Thank you. So in terms of R&D, Bhavan, yes, we were not talking about '19 right now, but we are going to continue to invest. It's -- we just think we have got such a large market opportunity here. There is so many things we can do. We are going to continue to invest. It's been one of the clear differentiators and competitive advantages that we have in the marketplace and we are going to continue to invest and try to drive revenue growth and get margin expansion through leverage. At this point, there is nothing that -- sure, we’re going to look to optimize everywhere we can in terms of being efficient, but we are going to continue to invest for the long-term that's been what Scott and Mike and the team have done here for the 15 years and we are not going to change that approach. Got it. Thanks guys. Congrats again. Thank you. The next question comes from John DiFucci with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Thank you. I have a question for Murray and it's kind of a follow-up to Gregg's question, Murray. And it's try to get some help in modeling this going forward. No matter how you look at the numbers, they look strong, but in this quarter billings growth and even more importantly the current billings growth, so again the change in short-term deferred revenue it was about equal to revenue growth. Whereas in the recent past, frankly over the last year and half, billings growth has been greater than revenue growth. And I was just kind of trying to figure it out, I mean, you’re in the low 40s percentage growth which is pretty amazing given your scale. But should we start to see that -- I mean, the guidance implies that the growth comes down a little bit, but frankly the guidance has implied that for a while now. But when we are looking forward just so we’re sort of prepared, it seems to me that with that sort of an indication that we will start to see the growth still be very meaningful, but not continue to accelerate like it has -- with the revenue growth it has over the last year and half. Does that make sense? Well, it's a great question. There is a lot of things going on there. I think if you look at the first quarter and the second quarter, one of the advantages we have had is that we are getting bookings and we are getting revenue from Trello that didn’t exist in the prior year. And as we go into the second half of this year now, we are going to have the Trello compared. Obviously there is no purchase accounting haircut on bookings, it's just on revenue. So in Q3, Q4 we have got the Trello bookings from last year that we’re now going to be comparing to. So we’ve got some of that. We also have when these price increases kind of worked a way through, we will see some of that where the bookings in revenue can shift. And in the first quarter, we just had an easier compare. Q1 of '17 was a tougher quarter as we had talked before just because we believe the Olympics and the Euro Soccer and all that stuff that was going on in Q1 of '17. We saw this a little softer on the booking side and then we came back stronger in the second quarter '17 and so that gave us a more favorable compare in Q1 of '18. The -- but as we go into the second half of the year, a big part of what you're seeing is the compare relative to having Trello now in the base. Over the longer term, obviously there is going to be a lot of large numbers et cetera that we will be facing like any company, but as far as here in the second half, it's the Trello compare that’s -- it's causing some of this -- it looks like the growth rate isn't what was in the first half. Okay, great. That's helpful. And if I could, just a quick follow-up. And I know it's really early, a few weeks into the quarter, but have you seen any change in business momentum? I know you have a pretty linear quarter. I mean, which is really unique in the software space. But have you seen any change in business momentum over the last few weeks after the price increase? Well, again on -- if we look at the cloud, the price increases went in around July 31, that’s well passed us. On server, we had -- John, as you know that on license it was October 1, and then now maintenance is on Jan 1. And the business in general is -- the environment is good and so we’re not like commenting specifically, but so far -- through the end of December we’re quite pleased and there is nothing has changed in the tone of business sense. Got it. Okay. Thanks a lot. Nice job guys. Thanks, John. The next question comes from Michael Turits with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Hey, guys. I’ve two questions. First, I know you said that you did well across all deployment models, but can you comment and drill down a little bit on datacenter and the stalked bundle? And then talk about how much of a shift there might be there if successful? How much benefit that has been to billings? Then I have another question. Hey, Michael. It’s Jay. It just continues to do well. We are pleased with it. No outsized contribution relative to past quarters. There continues [technical difficulty] server base. For customers largely with more than 500 employees that are looking to move to datacenter that provides better high visibility and architecture to support the kind of scale. And the other indication in datacenter growth we talked about in the past, I think it shows kind of the broader standardization as companies move from technical teams to IT to business teams. Stack is kind of a small part of removing purchase friction. For companies that want to buy all those of the data center family at once, Stack makes the purchase of all datacenter family products once easier. But there is going to be a handful of customers that do that. A lot of them are going to start maybe with JIRA and then expand to Confluence and expand with JIRA Service Desk etcetera. And then finally just the channel is a really important contributor to data center growth. They work with a lot of our larger customers and tend to help them move from the original server deployment to the data center one. Thanks. Thanks, Jay. And then my follow-up perhaps is for you as well. As you’re getting more adoption across the enterprise, obviously you are sticking with your frictionless model, but has there any change at all in go-to-market as you have to deal more with centralized ISIT [ph] with procurement? Obviously, you’ve got the enterprise advocates. How is that transition going? It's not only transition we got enterprise advocates in the business for a couple of years and there isn't a material change in the model at all and we described it in detail at the Investor Day. The focus for the company is just to make purchasing easy for customers, especially at scale. And so, we do that by building a product that people can try on their own, by publishing pricing, so they don’t have to call us and ask us what it is by creating service teams like the enterprise advocates and then through our channel to help them when they need extra help if there is things that they can't do on their own. And I think the results of the business -- I think is validation that’s working and we’re really pleased with how it's going. Okay, great. Thanks, Jay. Again great quarter everybody. Thank you. The next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Great. Thank you. A lot of the questions have been answered, but I just wanted to know if you could share with us a little bit about the momentum you have been seeing with Trello and kind of how you’ve seen that evolved since the acquisition, and the type of customer synergies you might be seeing in kind of leveraging the vast installed base that you guys already had? Yes. Thanks, Heather. It's Mike. Look, Trello continues to power along and we're really happy with its progress. As we’ve said previously, we are not even at the end of year one in terms of an integration program of the business, the team et cetera. And our main goal is maintaining the momentum of the product and business that Trello already is before we look at the opportunities potentially in combining the customer bases and we have a lot of time to go through and continue to do that. We're pretty happy in how the Trello team fits with the culture of the border Atlassian family, and I think on all sides it's been a great success so far. The one thing we are doing is we’re certainly not standing still. So the product of Trello has had a number of improvements over the last period of time. And if you are looking at shareholder letter you can see that we have officially introduced Trello to the Japan market as a single example in November. We have the localized products and some partnerships and some marketing and things that we did down there, which is a good example of something that Atlassian brings to the table we already had. The office there in Oklahoma, so we could use that as a leverage point to get Trello into the Japanese market, but a lot of the things you talk about is still ahead of us. Okay, great. Thank you very much. The next question comes from Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Thank you very much and happy New Year to the team. Murray, maybe I want to start with gross margins that has been trending down for several quarters now and I’m sure that’s related to the accelerated depreciation. Can you give us a sense of how we should think about gross margin going forward? Is there a quarter when gross margin starts to plateau after we get through this accelerated depreciation base? Yes, Sanjit. So in terms of the gross margin, that's correct. We have been going through a transition here where we have been accelerating the depreciation on the server equipment that we’re running around data centers. Obviously, we are really excited about the fact that what the engineering team has done to get us to our new cloud platform and we have actually reassessed the need for the remaining equipment and its useful life and its going to depreciated through the third quarter which is what we are in now and we'll come to a close. And that's kind of depressing the gross margin here in the third quarter than its going to be -- the implied numbers on the fourth quarter it gets better. As we kind of go on from there, it's just going to be the -- obviously we are going to have a little bit of a benefit in '19 versus '18 because they don't have the accelerating depreciation. But at the same time, our business is moving to the cloud and the cloud runs at a lower gross margin like in all the other SaaS companies where we’ve to incur the cost of hosting the application, servicing those applications. And so as you look at '19 there will be sort of a little bit of a battle between the relief we get on the accelerated depreciation versus more transition to the cloud. And then as we kind of go on from there, that transition continues to -- that secular trend moving to the cloud, there just got be a modest probably impact on lowering the gross margin over time as that transition goes to cloud. But we are obviously very pleased with our overall gross margins where we stand today. The server business which has very good gross margin is not going away overnight. So it continues to be very strong, you can see that in our results just this past quarter. So that's also been a good lift for us from a gross margin standpoint. Great. That’s super helpful. And the follow-up is on sort of the HipChat customer base. Any sort of details on how they are thinking about potentially upgrading to Stride or maybe sticking with their deployments or even potentially moving off to a comparative solution? What are the conversations been like with the HipChat customer base and how do you see their deployment plans moving forward? Yes, good question. It's Scott here. We recommend all of the HipChat customers in the cloud upgrading to Stride and we actually have really strong migration parts for all of those customers. It's a very famous process and we are already migrating customers from one to the other. And so we're seeing great excitement amongst the HipChat base for all the new features and the -- through the change in the product when they move from HipChat to Stride, so that's really going well. And we continue to sell HipChat behind the firewall for those customers that want something that they can deploy inside their network. In terms of getting them migrated, getting the cloud customers migrated over, is there any sort of timeframe that we should think about or was that happen over the next two quarters or a year, any timeframe that makes sense? At least as you know publicly stating a timeframe where it's sort of -- have all the pieces in place to gracefully [ph] move customers, but we want to be sensitive to their timeframe tables to make sure they will have a great experience. So we haven't got a sort of definitive end day on that at the moment. Got it. Thank you very much, Scott. The next question comes from Richard Davis with Canaccord. Please go ahead. Hey, thanks. Most has been asked, but basically one of the questions I have got from investors was last year you bought Trello, so you obviously had a bunch of people, but you did pay higher revenue multiple. What is your opinion right now kind of the valuation expectations for possible M&A targets and how does that inform your interest in future purchases? Thanks. Yes. Hi, Richard. It's Mike again. Look, I mean, we obviously didn't comment on the target or valuations of where other people sit at. I think there is a very complicated times in working out what works for both parties at a given time in a given market and for given opportunity. Again, we continue to use M&A as one of a series of tools that we have over the last 15 years to build the business both on small sort of tuck-in acquisitions through to obviously more transformative ones like Trello and we keep scanning the market that’s out there. Again we’ve been very efficient stewards of the capital over time. I think our record speaks for itself there and we intend to continue to be so. Okay. Thank you. The next question comes from Jonathan Kees with Summit Research. Please go ahead. Hi, great. Thanks for taking my questions and my congrats also for the quarter. Just wanted to ask a couple of questions. One being on more strategic part. You talked about before your Atlassian expand strategy with corporate customers, and I'm sure the bulk of it like with this quarter is still the traditional JIRA and Confluence and selling the more usage and additional products. Just curious if during the quarter, have you seen any change in terms of the Greenfield for like Service Desk or even Bitbucket and HipChat in terms of those sales and even the other way where they are selling up to JIRA and Confluence? Jonathan, it's Scott here. Our business is always depending on what’s sort of landing and expanding from a lot of different products and so you’re right we’ve landed JIRA and Confluence, but Bitbucket lands a large number of customers as it does Trello, as HipChat and Stride. And the cross-sell parts aren't sort of linear. There are sort of other companies out there in the market that have one very clear LAN [ph] product and then they expand and have sort of tuck-in add-ons on the back of that. We haven't got that, we actually sort of have been lucky, we got a large number of areas that we land with. And so as -- with Stride comes out in the market we say that lands new customers. Obviously the acquisition of Trello helps us win more customers than we were previously. But there is nothing over the last sort of period of time where that’s an inflection point on landing with one particular product or a change in the mix. It's just that all the products get better at landing customers as we add more features and as we have more brand awareness in the marketplace. Okay, great. That was helpful. And my last question is more of a housekeeping. You have in the past talked -- given a count for like Trello customers. Even the Service Desk count you just referenced last quarter is kind of greater than 25,000. I'm sure an updated number will be greater than 25,000. Is it greater than 30,000. And for Trello, we will be curious what the latest number would be? I’m sure its greater than 25 million, which is what you refer to last quarter. You guys have been great in terms of providing those numbers in the past and obviously you’re proud in terms of the performance, you’ve been happy with the performance, so any updated numbers in terms of that will be great. Yes. Hi, Jonathan. We don’t have any updated numbers to either of those two. We continue to be happy with the performance of both. Again the 25 million users in Trello is from summit last year, so it's only 3 or 4 months ago. Okay, great. Jonathan, just to clarify that 25,000 is organizations, not customers. Okay, great. Thanks for the clarification. Good luck, guys. Thank you. The next question comes from Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. Please go ahead. Oh, great. Thank you. Let me add my congratulations. So I would love to drill down a little more on Bitbucket and to understand -- you guys like to talk about sort of the philosophy and the differentiation and in this case maybe sort of the philosophy and the differentiation when compared to GitHub and how the whole open source development plays into that? Yes. Great question. Bitbucket has millions of users that use it on a monthly basis. It's a very, very popular card hosting service. Years ago we chose to differentiate from some competitors by really focusing on where you go to do work as opposed to sort of host open source projects and that differentiation actually flow through the numbers of the features that we put into the product that make it appealing to businesses who want to do work around security features, around performance, around even just how teams are organized in the products. Look, the integration with JIRA continues to be a big differentiator for that product as well because people don't choose these products in isolation and one of our team's great strength is that not only do we interact with ourselves and our competitors, but as we add more products and as we sort of have more of a solution for our customers and increasingly look to ask for -- to provide more their solutions to their problems. Obviously, the fact that it's an Atlassian product and works with the rest of the products are a big differentiator as well. Great. Thank you. And then if I could sneak one more in. In my model, you are about three quarters away from hitting that $1 billion run rate, which has been an oddly difficult hurdle for a lot of software companies. And I'm just wondering how you guys think about that? Is it sort of a totally artificial barrier and you can just keep doing exactly what you're doing or do you think -- have you been thinking sort of hard about how we scale through that? It's Scott again. Look, years and years ago, we’ve always set big ambitious goals for Atlassian when we were I think a handful of people in a shared office we set a goal of having 50,000 customers and that took us about 10 years to get there and that was a really big celebration. And we’re setting goals for active users and so forth, adding to the future as well. And so revenue goals are really nice and I think it's great for us to be up there with a very few select companies that have reached that milestone, if and when we do cross that milestone. But for us the sort of things we get our staff engaged and get me and Mike excited about the impact we have in the world which is often around usage and size of the customer base versus a dollar metric. Okay, great. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Nat Cunningham with Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Hi, guys. On Atlassian Home, it sounds like you've been getting good feedback so far. And I realize it's early, but have you seen any behavior like increasing engagement or more multiproduct usage among customers that are participating in that beta? It's Scott again, just on the Atlassian Home. We are still very early in that rollout and we've been doing tests with customers and we do see great results there, but not as great as the other prepared to sort of share them publicly and we’re still early in the rollout of Home across all of our products. And so while we are seeing a lot of engagement sort of on a one-to-one product basis, we are still early in the sort of multiproduct engagement cycle. We’ve done some experiments in that area and we are seeing some great improvements to how we are cross-selling or cross promoting products, but nothing I could give you concrete numbers on at this stage, apart from this being very happy with those results. Thanks, Scott. Seeing no further questions, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I’d like to turn the conference back over to Mike Cannon-Brookes for any closing remarks. Yes, I just like to say thanks everyone for joining the call today. We appreciate your time and look forward to keeping you updated on our progress. And I just like to send out a final thanks to Murray Demo in his final earnings call. Thanks everyone for today. The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

Thank you for joining Atlassian’s Earnings Conference Call for the Third Quarter of Fiscal 2018. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of Atlassian’s website following this call.
I will now hand the call over to Ian Lee, Atlassian’s Head of Investor Relations. Good afternoon, and welcome to Atlassian’s third quarter fiscal 2018 earnings conference call. On the call today, we have Atlassian’s Co-Founders and CEOs, Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes; our Chief Financial Officer, James Beer; and our President, Jay Simons.
Earlier today, we issued a press release and our shareholder letter with our financial results and commentary for our third quarter fiscal year 2018. These items are also posted on the Investor Relations section of Atlassian’s website at investors.atlassian.com. On our IR website, there is also an accompanying presentation and data sheet available. We’ll make some brief opening remarks and then spend the rest of the call on Q&A.
Statements made on this call include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Forward-looking statements represent our management’s beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made.
Further information on these and other factors that could affect the company’s financial results is included in the filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time-to-time, including the section entitled Risk Factors in our most recent Forms 20-F and 6-K.
In addition, during today’s call, we’ll discuss non-IFRS financial measures. These non-IFRS financial measures are in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. There are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-IFRS financial measures versus their nearest IFRS equivalents and they may be different from non-IFRS measures used by other companies. A reconciliation between IFRS and non-IFRS financial measures is available in our earnings release, our shareholder letter, and in our updated investor data sheet on our IR website.
I’ll now turn the call over to Mike for his brief opening remarks before we move to Q&A. Good afternoon. Thanks, everyone, for joining today. We had a great start to 2018. This quarter, we grew revenue 40% year-over-year and generated over $86 million of free cash flow. We also added 6,587 net new customers, the most we’ve ever added in a single quarter and a big step towards our goal of serving the Fortune 500,000.
In February, we kicked off the Atlassian Team Tour, where we’ve been unveiling product updates, sharing the latest in team practices, and discussing the future of teamwork with almost 3,000 users and partners. We’ve almost completed our tour across 11 cities worldwide, and it’s been fantastic to speak directly to customers and hear about the different ways teams are using our products.
We’ll be making our final stop in Tokyo on May the 23rd. This quarter, we announced the opening of our newest office in Bengaluru, India. This new location will add to our world-class R&D and customer support centers around the world.
As part of our earnings today, we announced two exciting updates to our Board of Directors. First, we are pleased to announce that Shona Brown has been appointed as the new Chair of the Board. Shona has been a Board member since November 2015, and has been a great mentor to Scott and myself.
We’re also excited to welcome Sasan Goodarzi of Intuit to our Board. Sasan brings with him almost 15 years of experience, driving product leadership and growth at Intuit and will be a valuable addition to the Board.
Finally, we’re pleased to have our new CFO, James Beer, on the call with us today. James joined the team in February and will play an important role for Atlassian as we grow past $1 billion in annual revenue.
And with that, I’ll pass the call to the operator for Q&A. Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Alex Kurtz with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Yes, thanks for taking the question, guys. Just Stride, any kind of adoption trends you saw in the quarter? I know, it’s new product and maybe how you see that playing out over the next six months or so? Thanks, Alex. It’s Scott here. Just a reminder for everyone on the call, Stride is our communications product that we built entirely from the ground-up to put voice, video and team chatting to one product. And as we know, the communications space is a sort of large and nascent space. With Stride, we’re still in the early learning mode with our customers and we – I don’t have the adoption metrics, but we’re getting a lot of feedback from our early users. And this is James, I would just add. I don’t expect Stride to be a material revenue driver in fiscal 2019. All right. Thanks, guys. Okay. The next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Hi, thank you. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about trends on the deferred revenue side and deal signings. And I was wondering if there’s anything you could share with us kind of about the linearity of deferred in the quarter? And if there’s anything you could share with us about how customers maybe might be seeing the price increase in the market? Thank you. Well, let me start with that. So in terms of the deferred revenue, obviously, I’m sure you know about the price increases that we announced in August of last year. And some of our customers took advantage to pull forward either their maintenance renewals, in some instances, new business, upgrade business and so forth. And so that benefited Q1 and Q2. And so we saw the other side of that effect in Q3, as we saw that pull forward revenue that otherwise would have played out in Q3.
The other thing I would have mentioned particularly about Q3 deferred revenue and so forth is, of course, this is the first full quarter of Trello. We’ve now lapped the acquisition that occurred midway through Q3 this time last year. And then anything… And in terms of the price increases, we very much feel as though the effect is on track as we expected, so that’s going along very much as planned. And James, could I just ask a follow-up, if I may, about Q4 deferred revenue trends? If the early renewal slightly impacted Q3, should we be expecting that to also have a seasonal impact on Q4 just as we think about setting our models? Well, I think that pull forward effect is likely to decline as the quarters go by. So I wouldn’t want to overstate the effect that you’ll likely see in Q4 there. So no, I think that will be a more in line, if you will, in terms of the run rate around deferred revenue. One of the other factors that we have to think through is, obviously, the cloud business is growing very fast. And so you have to think about the mix of whether our customers are electing the annual subscriptions or the monthly subscriptions. Okay, great. And anything you could share with us on what they’re electing? What’s the trend in the annual versus monthly? Well, it moves around. We’re pleased with the response to both. I think, what’s important is that, we’ve got options out there for our customers. We’re really addressing their needs in a variety of different ways. Thanks. Thank you very much. Okay. The next question comes from Bhavan Suri with William Blair. Please go ahead. Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. I guess, I’m going to touch a little bit on Service Desk here. Just as you’ve seen customers and partners start to deploy it and it’s now been a little while, it’s been the fastest growing product for a while. Just some color on sort of the sizes of deals and sort of are you starting to see them expand?
And then just touching on a couple of cases where we chatted with partners, we see coexistence with ServiceNow or just sort of an idea of how that exists and also maybe do you view that as a potential replacement over time? Yes. Hi, Bhavan, it’s Mike, I can take that one. Look, as we’ve said before, JSD is growing very quickly and we’re very excited about its opportunities in all sorts of fashions inside of enterprises. We do see the growth is both in small and large accounts. Obviously, in the larger accounts, there’s the potential to go further afield, because just the size of the company is greater, the amount of service opportunity between teams is larger.
So we do see a correlation with larger businesses, obviously, moving it into other functions outside of IT. So it moves into finance, HR, legal, lots of different teams. Interactive marketing is particularly popular one. Any team that tries to help other teams is a part of their team’s job. So we’ve disclosed more than 25,000 organizations use Jira Service Desk and it continues to be one of our largest products alongside Jira Software and Confluence.
Look, we do see ServiceNow. We do come up against it occasionally, but by far the largest is attacking greenfield opportunities. As a reminder, they target kind of the Global 2000 and we’re the Fortune 500,000. So more often than not, you see very happy coexistence in a lot of different ways, and they probably see us far more than we see them I would suspect. Got it. And a quick follow-up just on product investment. You obviously talked about the new location in Bengaluru. But as you look at product investment R&D spend, I guess, how should we think about sort of split between sort of optimizing, enhancing existing products and then sort of newer stuff you might be working on that maybe you haven’t sort of built out, so either gaps in existing products or brand-new sort of sets like Stride? What would that mix be? And sort of how do you think about that sort of in the long-term? Thank you. Bhavan, it’s Scott here. The – one of the things I’m really proud of is our investment in R&D and turning that into valuable products for our customers and we’ve done that for 15 years and that’s not going to change. We’re going to continue to invest in R&D, because that drives our business more than other competitors or other companies that drive more sales-driven approach we really lead with R&D. So that’s not going to change.
The relative amount we spend on optimizing, enhancing changes from year-to-year, I’d say, this year with some of our moves to AWS, we probably spend a bit more on kind of internal re-architecting, which is showing more sort of infrastructure benefits for our customers, reliability, speed, latency, we can put data centers close to our customers’ scale.
So those types of benefits is what our customers get from those infrastructure investments. Now that that’s happened, we’ll be doing more investments in sort of more front facing user features. But it changes from year-to-year as we listen to customer needs. That’s very helpful, guys. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Okay. The next question comes from George Iwanyc with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Thank you for taking my question. So impressive new customer additions. Can you give us a sense of where they’re coming from how much from Jira and other products? Hey, George, this is Jay. We don’t break-out individual products. I mean, I think the story of the customer account was just the business overall was firing on all cylinders like especially on a cloud side, all core cloud products drove strong customer adds. And remember, the number in the quarter – number between quarters are going to move around a bit from quarter-to-quarter. But obviously, we’re super proud of the result of both the adds in the quarter and just the future expansion opportunity that it gives us. But remember, it’s still a drop in the bucket on the way to the Fortune 500,000, which is what we’re chasing. Okay. And Trello looks like, it’s continuing to see good adoption with new users. Can you give us a sense about how that cross-selling is going with that, or have you started to do that and the monetization opportunities? Sure, I can take that one down here in Sydney. Look, I mean, as we mentioned in the shareholder letter, we just passed the one year mark of the closing of the acquisition of Trello. And I can honestly say that no one on the team has been more excited than we are now about Trello. We continue to get more excited quarter-on-quarter about the potential and opportunities of Trello.
As we’ve said a number of times now, our focus to date has been just allowing to continue its impressive momentum and user growth. These user base continues to grow quickly as Trello spreads around the world. So with regard to monetization, we certainly aren’t rushing into cross-selling into our existing base. We’re looking to do what makes most sense for the businesses. But you can expect to see it continue to come closer and closer to the family as it continues to grow by itself.
We previously mentioned that we expect Trello to contribute $20 million of the revenue in FY 2018. We expect to meet or exceed that at the moment, so we’re well on target. We have been standing still with Trello, I suppose is the other important point to make. As we noticed last quarter, we introduced Trello into the Japanese market, as well as partnerships with a whole series of local companies.
So we continue to use our strengths at Atlassian to take Trello to places it couldn’t have got to by itself. And as we mentioned, we passed the million users now in four different countries individually, so in the U.S., Brazil, UK, and France. So I think Trello demonstrates our ability to successfully do acquisitions and to grow the product family to maintain those acquisitions and their momentum. And then we’ll continue to do what we’ve done historically, which is to bring a family closer together over time. All right. And the last question for me on the tax rate. How should we look at that as we look forward to FY 2019? Well, in terms of the tax rate, I think, Murray has probably described to you in the past how under IFRS, our tax rate is calculated in each of the geographic entities in which we operate. And so based on the mix of income and the mix of deductions that are appropriate to take in each of those geographic entities, that can move the rate around from quarter-to-quarter more so than you would see under the GAAP approach. And that was, in fact, how things played out in Q3.
So Q3 benefited, I would expect that to somewhat reverse out in Q4. And I’m comfortable with what I’ve seen in terms of the overall tax rate for fiscal year 2018 and we don’t guide yet for fiscal 2019. So we’ll get back to you with that with more color around that story in a quarter or so’s time. All right. Thank you. Okay. The next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Okay. Thank you very much and apologies for the background noise. Jay, how did data center subscription do this quarter relative to your expectations? Hey, Gregg, I hope you’re on hands free. It was great. I mean, it performed – we’re happy with the performance performed in line with what we expected, continues to be a really important and large expansion opportunity for us into bigger enterprise organizations on the server side. I think, nothing special really to highlight outside of there’s really good momentum. The data center business is still in early product line with, I think, a lot of room for growth and we’re pleased with how it performed. Okay, thanks. And then, James, you spoke about pull forward into Q1 and Q2, and the company had noted that previously as well. But since this was the first quarter with the maintenance price increase in effect, just wondering if you saw any change with respect to end-period maintenance renewals rates? No, in terms of renewal rates, again, we’re very comfortable with the customer reaction to the price increase initiatives generally. And in Q3, obviously, yes, the new maintenance rates went into effect at the start of the quarter. But obviously, others had in essence locked in that lower pricing. And so we’ll have those older prices in place for a number of quarters for a portion of our customer base. Okay. Thank you. Okay. The next question comes from Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Thank you for taking the question, and I welcome James. Nice to have you on Board. Maybe I wanted to start off a little bit on the some of the model dynamics. So, James, I’m wondering if you could remind us as we move more to subscription, I think, 80% of new product sales are now cloud. What impact does that have on the model, particularly when we’re thinking about top line revenue growth? Well, as we continue to develop very, very strong momentum around cloud, but not only cloud, as Jay was just mentioning, the data center products as well. They’re both accounted for in the subscription line. So we’re seeing very strong growth rates there.
The other side of that coin is, you would expect that our server business that’s sold on a license and annual maintenance basis is not growing at that same pace, it’s growing nicely. And you particularly see that in our statistics around license revenue. So those were in the single-digit growth numbers this quarter. Just a very clear illustration, when you contrast that growth rate to subscription how customers are moving increasingly to the cloud.
So in terms of the dynamics, in terms of revenue recognition, then obviously, subscription taken ratably over the period of the subscription length, whereas that sever business has a component – the license component that’s taken upfront. So as that license revenue component is growing at a significantly lesser rate than the subscription, then you’ll see the overall model trending towards, in essence, a more ratable, predictable type structure. Got it, that’s helpful. And then maybe in terms of Mike and Scott as well, maybe a high-level product question for you. In that project management space, particularly among business teams, whether it’s a project management or task prioritization, there definitely seems to be just sort of a lot of options for users. And so what is the central value proposition that you guys are driving to get customers to use Altassian versus what seems to be a ton of options out there in the market? Is it the integration back to Core Jira, or what’s going to funnel that demand on to the Altassian platform? Yes, look, I can take that, it’s more of a philosophical question that we normally get on that – on earnings call. Look, I – there has been project management software for the last 25 years and I would expect there will continue to be project management software for the next 25 years.
Obviously, with Trello and with Jira, specifically Jira Software and even a little bit with Confluence, you could say that we manage projects in a lot of different ways for teams of knowledge workers depending on the types of projects that they are running.
The more structured your project is, the more you have a large number of people, very defined workflows and structured content than you need, the more Jira Software and to some extent Jira Service Desk and Jira Core come to help your project succeed. So that’s sort of the biggest difference between Jira Software and Trello would be around the structuring and the control elements that you get. The larger business gets the more structure and control it tends to need in the way it runs the project.
At the core though, both Jira Software and Trello would be the notion of workflow. So it’s not as much about managing tasks as you would do as an individual in a task management application you might have your on your phone, which is more like to do items, buy the milk, get the laundry and tick them off if they’re done or not done.
Once you get into a team of people collaborating, you need to have great collaboration fundamentals, which Atlassian has baked into our DNA in terms of exchanging information, bringing people into the project, making sure the right people are aware of the right information.
And then secondly, you need to have workflow capabilities to be able to move work around to understand the core work items, the things that need to be done, who is currently responsible for doing them and then connect out as we do with all of our integrations and marketplace add-ons to other applications, where parts of the work may leave.
So if you look at Jira Software, it connects to probably 50 or more different applications that might store source code or builds or documents or whatever else there is. So that’s sort of the way that we see project management. Fundamentally, it’s about workflow with the difference with Jira Software and Trello being around structure versus unstructured. That’s super helpful. And then maybe the last one for me. So in terms of coming off of Project Vertigo, which seems to be pretty successful. There used to be a sort of user cap on your cloud products, I think, it was around 2,000 users. Now with that lead off, in essence, was there any sort of like pent-up demand? I’m just trying to maybe contextualize the strong net new customer outperformance, but seem to come from cloud. Was that sort of the removal of that that user limits restriction, resulting any sort of pent-up demand that caused that strong net new customer outperformance this quarter? Yes, Sanjit, it’s Scott here. We haven’t officially removed that 2,000 user limit. We’re working with a select number of customers on that. But it’s not something that we’ve lifted broadly. So I can’t answer that. There is demand from our large customers to move and there’s a lot of things that they want in that process.
So I couldn’t answer that. There’s a huge pent-up demand. We’ll see customers transition from server to cloud over a long period of time. Just a reminder, we’re pretty agnostic and people use our server-based products or our cloud-based products. We have a great server and data center business that serves from very small customers to very large customers on behind the firewall, and our cloud business will serve very small to very large customers in the cloud. So we’re really pretty agnostic about that. Appreciate. Thank you for the time, guys. Okay. The next question comes from Michael Turits with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Hey, good evening, everybody. And James, welcome to Atlassian and the calls and great to talk to you after years. I haven’t talked to you since Symantec, so welcome. Yes. Thank you, Michael. So one question for you on first on margins. Margins and EPS guide was just slightly below for next quarter. This was a really great year for margin expansion. So any thoughts on why that we might have been a little bit below the street? And at least philosophically, any thoughts on margin expansion in the next year with the Street looking for just above one point of growth or expansion? Well, in terms of the current year, I’d say a couple of things. We did identify some additional opportunities to spend against our various product investment areas. Second thing I’d mention is that, we’re particularly pleased with the pace with which we’re attracting top talent to both our Bengaluru office across multiple functions and the Mountain View office as well. So I’m excited about that.
In terms of the longer-term, as we think about margins, obviously, last year, I think, at Investor Day, the company committed to continuing to have modest increases in both operating and free cash flow margins over time. And we’re very fortunate to have such strong market opportunities in front of us excellent R&D capabilities.
And so we will have more opportunities to invest in ways that will drive very strong returns to our shareholders. And what we’ll do is back that up with a robust process of driving accountability within Atlassian for spending wisely. And I think, that will be a good outcome for shareholders. Got it, thanks. And then, I think for Jay, just any – can you give us an update really on how things are going with the channel? Any changes there, whatever particular partners you want to talk about, including some of the recent ones, which seem to be expanding? And how they’re working with some of the personnel inside, including technical account managers to drive some of the larger deals? Yes. Hey, Michael, I mean, no material changes. The channel, as you know, it’s been an important part of the model, important part of Atlassian for the better part of the past decade continues to be. So both in terms of reaching new markets – geographically new markets that we’re targeting like as an example with your Service Desk and sort of like the IP landscape as well just reaching new customers and then expanding existing ones.
They do over index around larger enterprises in part, because the complexity, the expansion, the opportunity for the services and engagement that they offer is larger. And I had the opportunity to meet a number of them during the Team Tour event that we highlighted. And everyone I spoke with share positive signals about, both the current business and the opportunities that they see in front of them. So I would just say all things on them. Great. Thanks very much. Okay. The next question comes from Keith Bachman with the Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead. Hi, many thanks. I also want to ask two questions. I was hoping you could give us a little bit of sense about the puts and takes involved in the June quarter guidance. To a previous comment, you said you felt like the pricing increase had manifest themselves in the December and March quarters. If I look at the guidance for June though, you’re guiding to even at the top end 5% sequential growth. In the last two years, June 16 and June 17, you grew 8% and 9% sequentially. And so just hoping if you go through what are some of the puts and takes we should consider as we’re running through our models related to the June quarter? Thank you, and I have a follow-up? Yes. Well, as you think about the June quarter, I know it’s important to recall that we’ve now lapped Trello year-over-year. So that effect will be… Yes, sorry. My comments were sequential. So Trello wouldn’t really impact that? In terms of the sequential process, I think, again, you’ll see that similar to one of the answers I gave a little earlier. As you’ve got cloud and data center continuing to grow very fast, the license revenue line obviously growing at a much, much lower rate than that.
You’ll see the revenue model orientation become more ratable. The deferred revenue component in essence rises somewhat relative to the recognized revenue component. So underlying this, we continue to have strong demand across the product set and I’m very comfortable with the fundamentals of the top line. Okay, thank you. And my follow-up question then does relate to pricing. You’ve had a few sets of price increases depending on the category subscription maintenance license, et cetera. And at the Analyst Day last year, you talked about you envision annual price increases. And I just want to see if is that still the way we should be thinking about Atlassian models we look out over the next couple of years is that price increases will be an annual event? Thank you. Yes. One of the things with my sort of outsider lens on, if you will, that I’ve been really struck by is the remarkable ratio in terms of price to value that Atlassian offers right across its product set. And so that obviously underpins what has been said in the last year or so about a philosophy of being able to apply annual price increases on the server and cloud side of our businesses.
So and, of course, we’ll always be very thoughtful about current market conditions and so forth. But I think, that is a part of the model that you should expect to see going forward. Okay, many thanks. Congratulations. Okay. The next question comes from Adam Holt with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. Hi, everyone. I’ll also echo the congratulations and welcome for James. James, it’s also been a long time and glad to have you back. Yes. Thank you. I had two – absolutely. So I had two questions. In the shareholder letter, you had some nice language and some numbers around Confluence, which I don’t think I had seen for awhile. But a lot of detail around how you’re extending outside of the IT and sort of the core IT organization. And I was hoping maybe you could touch on, in general, how the efforts have been to extend outside of IT and really monetize that that non-IT opportunity? Then I had a follow-up for James. Yes, I can talk to that one. Look, Confluence has continued to be one of the great success stories of Atlassian over the last decade and passing 40,000 customers individually. Obviously, it continues to be our second biggest product and grow strongly.
So it was a good moment to celebrate all the achievements of Confluence in the clouds, server and data center realms. It’s certainly one of the products that pushes the furthest and the fastest outside of technology teams, and it’s continued to do so in terms of marketing, finance, sales, all the other functions inside of a company. That is, it continues to be a long-term trend as a business as we highlight in data, in customer examples and as you see in some of the Confluence part of the shareholder letter.
We continue to land strongly in software and IT departments in companies and continue to grow across the enterprise into all teams. And then alongside that continuing to land also a little bit more broadly if you think of something like Trello, it lands sort of all over the map even going as far as home teams and different forms of cross-company collaboration. And we continue to see that as an important part of our model is the strength to be able to land in certain types of teams. And then having a product depth and breadth to be able to expand across an organization to all types of teams. Thank you. And then for James, the perpetual number, the license number in the quarter was a little shy of consensus. And I wanted to know did you all hit your number internally in the quarter.? And how should we think about the quarter-on-quarter in license? So we as an analyst community make sure that, that we get that right going into the next quarter. So we’re more in line with your thinking? Thanks. Well, on the perpetual license line, also just going back to one of my earlier answers. And as we think about the pull-forward effect that we saw activity into the first-half of the year as customers look to get ahead of price increases, yes, certainly, the primary effect there would have been around customers renewing maintenance contracts and so forth.
But there was also a certain element of customers bringing forward new purchases, upgrades to current installations and so forth. And obviously, that would have helped the perpetual license line, excuse me, the license revenue line in the first-half of the year. And so that drags some of that activity out of Q3 and to some effect, I think, we’ll see that in Q4 as well although I would expect that effect to dampen out as time goes by. Great. Thank you. Okay. The next question comes from John DiFucci with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Hey, guys, Zach Lountzis for John. Jay, there were some helpful comments you gave on the data center trends earlier. But within there, are there any updates on how Atlassian stack is doing? I remember a few quarters ago, you said over 50% of customers with 500 or more users have three or more products, which, I guess, helped drive the creation of this discounted suite. And then what are your thoughts on offering something similar for cloud specifically? Thanks. Yes. Hey, Zach. You shouldn’t consider that to be a material driver of data center growth. I mean, it’s really offered as simpler packaging of multiple products and a nominal discount for a company that’s going to basically swallow the blue pill and take all of them all at once. And it’s – that’s – it’s going to be rare, but it’s there for customers to remove friction if they want to do that to basically do it easier.
I think, the more common pattern is the customers is going to adopt Jira data center when they’re ready to do it Confluence data center, when they’re ready to do it JIRA Service Desk data center, when they’re ready to do it and those might be at different times. So, it’s there. It’s – it removes friction for them when they want to do it. But I’d focus sort of overall on the growth of the data center business on whole, which is good. Okay. Sure. Thank you. Okay. [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. Please go ahead. Oh, great. Thank you for taking the question. I appreciate. So James, welcome and forgive me for beating a dead horse here, I know there’s just too much to say. But should we expect the perpetual license rate to decelerate from Q3 into Q4? Well, we don’t get that granular in terms of the guidance thought process. But I think, the core trend here is that more and more of our customers are choosing cloud as the way in which they want to consume our products. And I would expect that that will continue. So when you add to that, the fact that many of our larger customers on the server side of our business are choosing to deploy our data center products. And both data center and cloud are part of the subscription revenue line. Then I think it’s reasonable to infer that it’s going to be lesser proportion as time goes by going through the license revenue line. That said though, that’s still a very important and robust part of our business. That’s very helpful. Thank you. And then, Scott, bigger picture, I just noticed in the letter you talked about how you’re transitioning from the Chair of the Board role and I was super impressed by the academic background of your successor. But I was just wondering why this is the – why you feel like this is the time for that? Yes. Pat, look, we’ve always surrounded ourselves – Mike and I always surrounded ourselves with the best people we can in order to grow this business, whether that is the Board. And I think we have a very impressive Board for all of our Board members, all the management team we have. We can’t do this alone and we really want the best people in the world to help us along that.
And having Shona as the Chair will free up my time to be more detail and involved in the business and also provide the opportunity for Mike and I to sort of enhance our learning from her and for her to have a better opportunity to help other businesses. So I’m very excited by that. Mike and I have never sort of coveted the chair position for many sort of ego perspective or anything like that. It’s really about just getting the right people around us to make a successful company. Okay great. Thank you very much. Okay. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to the management team for any closing remarks. Hey, it’s Scott here. I just want to say thanks, everyone, for joining the call and we appreciate your time and look forward to keeping you updated on our progress. Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation.

Thank you for joining Atlassian's Earnings Conference Call for the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2018. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of Atlassian’s website following this call.
I will now hand the call over to Ian Lee, Atlassian’s Head of Investor Relations. Good afternoon, and welcome to Atlassian’s fourth quarter fiscal 2018 earnings conference call. On the call today, we have Atlassian’s Co-Founders and CEOs, Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes; our Chief Financial Officer, James Beer; and our President, Jay Simons.
Earlier today, we issued a press release and our shareholder letter with our financial results and commentary for our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2018. These items are also posted on the Investor Relations section of Atlassian’s website at investors.atlassian.com. On our IR website, there is also an accompanying presentation and data sheet available. We’ll make some brief opening remarks and then spend the rest of the call on Q&A.
Statements made on this call include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Forward-looking statements represent our management’s beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made.
Further information on these and other factors that could affect the company’s financial results is included in the filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time-to-time, including the section entitled Risk Factors in our most recent Forms 20-F and 6-K.
In addition, during today’s call, we’ll discuss non-IFRS financial measures. These non-IFRS financial measures are in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. There are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-IFRS financial measures versus their nearest IFRS equivalents and they may be different from non-IFRS measures used by other companies. A reconciliation between IFRS and non-IFRS financial measures is available in our earnings release, our shareholder letter, and in our updated investor data sheet on our IR website.
One final note on our new revenue recognition reporting standard IFRS 15. The Q4 2018 and fiscal year 2018 results been provided today are based on a revenue recognition standard IAS 18. The financial targets we provided today for Q1 2019 and fiscal year 2019, are based on the new revenue recognition standard IFRS 15 which is equivalent to the revenue recognition standards ASC 606 which many of you are familiar with.
For compare, we have provided recast historical financial statements under the new standard IFRS 15 for full year, as well as fiscal 2017 and the full year and quarters of fiscal 2018 on our Investor Relations website.
I'll now turn the call over to Mike for his brief opening remarks before we move to Q&A. Good afternoon. Thanks everyone for joining today.
Fiscal 2018 was another year of significant growth for Atlassian but financially and organizationally as we continued our mission to unleash the potential of every team. The fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 kept up the year with strong customer additions, revenue growth and free cash flow expansion. We added more than 6,600 net new customers, expanded revenue by 40% year-over-year and generated more than $64 million of free cash flow.
We ended the year with more than 125,000 customers, grew revenue by 41% year-over-year to $874 million and delivered approximately $281 million worth of free cash flow which equates to a free cash flow margin of 32%.
We passed several milestones during fiscal 2018. The migration of all cloud instances for Jira and Confluence users to our new AWS-based infrastructure, passing 100,000 cloud customers,, the one-year anniversary of the Trello acquisition, the launch of our new brand identity, $500 million in lifetime Atlassian marketplace sales, and 2.5 thousand employees worldwide including those in our new Bengaluru office.
Today as we look forward to fiscal 2019, we shared two updates to our strategy and product family in our shareholder letter. First we will be doubling down on supporting the needs of IT teams across companies of all sizes what we call the Fortune 5000.
Serving departments is an adjacent market we’ve been serving for years, yet we barely scratch the surface of the significant opportunity. This year you'll see us placing more emphasis on the IT market through our R&D investments, partnerships and marketing.
Second, we announced that we formed a strategic partnership with Slack. Atlassian currently has two offerings in the real-time communications market Stride and HipChat. As we completed our strategic planning coming into fiscal 2019, we concluded that although this market remains large the additional investment required to compete effectively is unlikely to generate returns that are comparable to those of our other products and the opportunities around us. We’ll be exiting our direct participation in the communication space with this partnership.
Slack has acquired the intellectual property for Stride and HipChat cloud both of which we will discontinue. We will also discontinue HipChat server and data center and will be working with Slack to provide a migration path for all our customers across the four products.
Going forward will be deepening the existing product integrations between Atlassian and Slack as well as building new ones and will also be working together on marketing, sales and channel enablement activities.
As part of our partnership we've made an equity investment in Slack to reinforce the long-term nature and significance of this relationship. We’ll be sharing more information on this and many more highlights at our Summit Event in Barcelona from September the 3 to September the 5. Scott and I look forward to talking with all our customers and partners in Spain.
And with that, I’ll pass the call back to the operator for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. This is Matt Broome in for Greg. So congrats on a very good quarter and the announcements of a very interesting partnership with Slack. I've got two questions there, firstly do you think that the revenue synergies can be meaningful going forward. And secondly you mentioned that you expect upon Slack around marketing sales and channel enablement, what does that means to the model? And will that undo changes to your go-to-market structure? Yes, I can take the first one Matt. I'm not expecting that - as we said in the last call the Stride would have been material to our 2019 revenues and so we’re not making any comments specifically today about the opportunities in terms of working with Slack around go-to-market opportunities. I’d just like to say they're embedded within the guide that we've issued for fiscal 2019. This is Jim, I got a market question. No material changes at all to the model the way that we approach going to market with Slack. We already share many, many joint customers and that are using existing integrations between the two products. I think as we mentioned in the shareholder letter we’re excited both companies were excited about improving those integrations and building more integrating between two products and actually both companies have similar go-to-market model already. So we think that you know that for the most part we’ll do what we've been doing. And just one last one, are you able to give any color on the terms of the equity investment? No, we’re not disclosing that. It’s relatively modest investment but we’re not going beyond that. The next question comes from Richard Davis with Canaccord. Please go ahead. So one question you know we had some other excitement by the way good job on making the move. But anyways we had some excitement with GitHub right and so you know there's some interesting things going on there particularly in terms of your business. So kind of you guys had put some - whatever press release is out but can you talk to us about kind of how you see early days what you think is happening longer-term, what you think is happening. And I guess as an ancillary question. As my developer friends are all jazzed up about some company called or some business called [Getlab] which I guess is similar to that but do you have any point of view on those guys? Thanks. Thanks Richard, Scott here in Sydney. Obviously we followed Microsoft acquiring GitHub. We believe that Microsoft acquired GitHub largely for GitHub's strength in the open source community. And the business rationale there is to get the open source developers to buy [indiscernible]. We don't believe that GitHub to compete with Atlassian or to compete with our enterprise hosting solutions. What we do with the bucket and the developers.
Now we always had to invest in R&D and we've always invested well with R&D with well priced products and that’s driven a bit in all of our products. So we don’t expect that to change. The GitHub sales has 1000 of customers 10,000 of customers including 60 are Fortune 100 and across put the bucket into software across our cloud and server environments we touch more than 30 million user accounts. So we believe we’re priced well competitively versus GitHub and Getlab and nothing really changes there with the acquisition by Microsoft. The next question comes from Rob Oliver with Baird. Please go ahead. I just wanted to drill down a little bit on the commentary around increasing emphasis on the IT market in 2019. It does seem like a logical adjacency and clearly you guys have really good sense for how your customers are already using those products. So I want to get sense may if you can give us a little bit more color as to what some of those areas might be where you feel like there might be a need. And then how you would think about that relative to internal development R&D or perhaps acquisition? Thank you, guys. Thanks for the question Scott again. The IT market is really appealing for us it is very logical adjacency for us. As we think about what we've done historically it’s not just your service desk that says IT. Confluence has used very heavily in IT departments. IT departments build all the software if your software gets used there as IT departments build and run software that use status page to communicate with their customers uptime and reliability. And so we already hear a lot of things for IT today.
And what we’re findings is we’re get increasingly pooled by IT departments to do more for them. A few reasons for that, one is that there why many of our customers are attracted by our relatively while pricing and our great feature parity and feature we provide. Two, those IT departments build more software and software becomes the more important part of what IT teams do and natural strength play very well into that.
And so you'll see us invest more in the R&D side of things in our marketing and go-to-market and across product development and what we bring to market. So I think you’ll equate to see a word from us across a range of our products. The next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. I had two questions I wanted to start out with you gave really impressive gross profit growth forecast for next year I guess for the current fiscal year. So I wanted to touch vis-à-vis, can you talk to us a little bit about how you're getting that gross margin benefit as you’re shifting more to the cloud. Are there some aspects of the economics that we should be keeping in mind and have you - is there anything you’re talking about in terms of how we should be thinking about that trending over the course of the next few years.
And then the other question would be just with Slack taking those communication assets that you mentioned. Just wondering how do you think about what the next leg of growth is if we look out a couple years down the road for Atlassian and kind of what do you see as kind of taking the reins from obviously what's a great business with Confluence and core Jira? Thank you. Heather it’s James, let me start off with addressing the gross profit question there. We in Q4 drove a non-IFRS gross margin of 85%. So this was as we expected higher than the sequential figure Q3 recall was back at 83% and that’s because in Q3 we were still going through the process of accelerated depreciation against the internal these central assets that have now being replaced now but we have converted our cloud hosting over to AWS. So we did expect the Q4 would drive a higher gross margin and indeed it did.
So coming off that, we're expecting FY 2019 to drive 85% to 86% in gross margins terms. So it's really more of a continuation of the full year effect if you will of getting passed that accelerated depreciation that particularly hit some of the quarters of last fiscal year.
Stepping back from that I think you're right as we continue to move more of our mix to the cloud. We've said in the past and I would confirm that we would expect that there would be something of a gradual very gradual decline in gross margin as cloud becomes a bigger proportion of the overall Atlassian revenue mix. It’s Mike here I can take the second half of the question or your second question. Look I think in terms of the next leg of growth you need to look around the business to say that's sort of already happening right. We have a plethora of opportunities around the business in the broad collaboration space in the software teams and in the IT team spaces.
And you’ve seen us make a series of moves over the last few years in the marketplace in Trello and more recently Atlassian Access. So we have great confidence in the opportunities we have around us and continue to make I think very pragmatic and fiscally responsible decisions to chase those markets that we are going after. The next question comes from Nikolay Beliov with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to go back to the change in strategy refocusing on the IT market. Just wanted to get some color on the focus going forward on the non-IT space do you guys feel like you need a land project like Jira here to kind of like gain more traction. Are you pulling back investment in the non-IT areas and really just like doubling down on IT going forward? Nikola, yes Mike I can take that. I am not sure I quite understand the questions. We’re going to be increasing our focus on IT for sure as we've explained in the shareholder letter. At the same time we do believe the other areas we’re in we’ll continue to invest.
Trello is clearly a land product in the old team collaboration area with tens of millions of users and continuing to grow really strongly we feel very excited about the prospect there as it gets closer and closer to the Atlassian family.
Confluence obviously does very well across all sorts of all team collaboration and that’s before you get to Jira core, and Jira service desk enabling workflow activities in a business, as well as obviously service driven teams of all kinds into service desk. So definitely not an area that we are pulling away from in any major way we will continue to invest there. And James the question for you billings accelerated this quarter from 34% in Q3 to 41% this quarter. Maybe you can just go through the puts and takes here and would billings in fiscal year 2019 follow a more normalized trajectory versus fiscal year 2018? Nikolay yes we were pleased with the Q4 billings results. Particularly we benefited from strong growth around our data center business around the cloud side particularly on the annual subscriptions to the cloud but also strong quarter on the service side with good upgrades and maintenance renewal performance as well.
So there is already nice mix across the board. In fiscal 2019 obviously in 2018 we discussed on our last call a certain amount of pull forward related activities that benefited the first half of fiscal 2018 and made things more challenging in Q3.
And that call forward was driven by the price increase activity that we rolled out particularly on the service side of the business back in October of last year. So nothing to specifically layout in terms of price initiatives for fiscal 2019 but safe to say that there is some presumption pricing activity embedded within our guide.
So we’ll obviously tell you more when we're ready to discuss the specifics there and it will really be the resulting customer behavior that will drive the billings profile that we would expect quarter-to-quarter as a result in fiscal 2019.
We just further observed of course that the specifics of any price increases are very important here in terms of the timing within a quarter that we would announce such an increase. And the amount of the advance warning that would go along between the announcement date and the effective date for any price increase.
So those will be the things that I would expect to drive the billings profile quarter-to-quarter somewhat in fiscal 2019 and we’ll keep you up-to-date on all of the specifics there as the year proceeds. The next question comes from Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Thank you for taking the questions. I wanted to revisit guidance and make sure I understand some of the dynamics here. You guys came in above what sort of we were expecting and I think what the rest of us were expecting. And that to be clear that doesn’t include HipChat or Stride. Can you give a sense of what the contribution from HipChat and Stride was in fiscal year 2018. Well let take that Sanjit. Perhaps I can just frame it more in terms of fiscal 2019 and that the announcements that we've made today around the communications space just provide a very small headwind to what otherwise would be in our plan for fiscal 2019 so just of the order of $1 million or so in revenue. Understood, I appreciate that. And then I guess from a resource allocation standpoint you guys raise $1 billion there won’t have to be anymore efforts to support HipChat or Stride in terms of those extra resources , how are you guys thinking about deploying those recent anecdotes involved where new product innovation or M&A or was it just more resources in existing portfolio? Look its Mike again. We’ve always maintained that we continue to demonstrate philosophically strong fiscal and operational discipline and a pragmatic the way we put our resources which is exactly why you see this decision.
We believe there are many, many opportunities around the business that we are investing in and as a result it's about choosing the best of those opportunities to put the resources that we have. We have absolutely world-class R&D and engineering team. We’re continue to grow it really strongly including as you see the new office in Bengaluru and we’ll continue the same way that we've been going for 17,18 years now in terms of investing continually. As we would say incrementally in the existing products that we have and also building out the new products that we continue to reduce in the market. The next question comes from Bhavan Suri with William Blair. Please go ahead. Thanks for taking my question and nice job on that reacceleration there. I guess I just wanted to first start off strategically if you think about communications you think about collaboration and you think about documents. You got compliments you got your service desk sort of workflow and obviously underlying all that is communications and I guess I just wanted understand a little more the thought process you guys obviously invested in Stride both HipChat and obviously okay we might see that the Slack or at least partner with Slack for that.
Just do you feel like that convergence of communications collaboration are something that could be softer partnership or do you feel like maybe communications a little more commoditize just sort of the thought process you guys went through this strategic view of sort of saying we’re not going to do we’re not going the communication piece of Stride and potentially partner with that just how you guys viewed that integrated environment because to me obviously it feels like it should be totally integrated I love to get thoughts on that? I mean as I said it’s all about pragmatic decision-making and operational discipline for us. As we went into our FY 2019 planning we concluded that the communications space remains very large but that the level of investment required to compete wasn’t likely to generate the same returns as all of the other opportunities that we have around the business. And so it's about choosing where we’re going to invest and at the same time we believe we can effectively benefit from the market through this long-term partnership rather than through direct product investment.
We also think that net-net that's the best thing for the customers in the long-term across the products that we’re going to build and the products that will be served through the partnership and by continuing to build deeper and deeper integrations between Slack and the Atlassian family of products that's the way we believe will be the best for the future of the business. And then I’ll just quicker to Jira service desk I guess just as you look at that business I love to understand sort of where you’re seeing growth and is your service desk serving a sort of a landing point for new customers that may not be subscribed to other product. So is it starting to be sort of standalone initial sale and sort of love to get some color of growth existing versus new? Thank you. It’s Scott here. Jira service desk as we said before many times its one of our faster growing products in the Atlassian's suite. It does serve a couple different audiences it serves some customers that want to service their customers externally so somewhere our customers used it for external helpdesk. But many of them use it internally as both serve and IT helpdesk and also we're seeing increasingly for people to use it for other workflow applications inside the business and not just typical IT helpdesk but our HR team provides service to their customers.
The legal team provide service to their customers we see those use cases as well. Originally we sold very heavily into existing base. You can imagine we have realized customer base and so that’s the place we start with. We are seeing that more sale beyond the customer base and as we turn our hands more to IT, we’ll be looking to win more customers outside of their existing customer base with not only Jira services desk but all the other products I mentioned earlier that several IT customers. The next question comes from John DiFucci with Jefferies. Please go ahead. I had two questions about the Slack partnership so when I think of Atlassian customer satisfaction or customer delight it's always been an important tenant in the business of Atlassian. The good news is Slack has a similar approach regarding its customers but how involved are you going to be in this transition of customers of four products to Slack products I guess I don't know maybe it seems important to me? John it’s Mike here. Yes, look customer satisfaction is incredibly important to both companies. We’ve already spend a lot of time working with them on how we’re going to manage that and our teams will continue to work on it going forward. It’s obviously of critical importance that customers are able to continue their communications infrastructure being up and running and at the same time migrate the data migrate their history their file that have shared et cetera across if they choose to migrate services.
So that’s something we’ll be working together with them on obviously owning the customer experience if you like on both ends of that transition enables us to do a really good job I believe for the customer going forward. Thanks Mike that's good to hear and then and James I think this is one is for you. You said you only could see $1 million or so of headwind in revenue in your guide based on this. But your discontinuing four products I guess I mean you’re obviously not going give us details of this but can you tell us is there a revenue share or something because in understanding those products had more than $1 million in revenue obviously right. So some something more if you can give us yeah? Yes what I would add John is really further to what Mike saying we’re going be very involved in the process of migrating our customers the ones that wish to move over to Slack. And so that process will drive some revenue for us and that will tend to offset some of the revenue that we would otherwise have been expecting to drive out of products like Stride. So the net effect is that small million dollars type headwind in fiscal 2019 versus what we would otherwise have planned. The next question comes from Michael Turits with Raymond James. Please go ahead. I wanted to come back regarding the IT investment strategy and I think double down I think Rob and Nikola asked these questions. But can you try to be more specific on what you'll be doing in terms of that incremental IT investment product and around go to market. And also I guess this was Nikola are we clear there is no change even in the near term but it seems like a prioritization of IT versus non-IT strategy? Michael it’s Scott here. I love to give you all the nitty-gritty data what we’re going to do but we don’t sort of pre-announce product changes and other things before we get them in the hands of our customers. And so I can't get into the exact details apart from just saying as a broad company level initiative where we're looking to focus is IT and we can largely because that our customer base are asking us for that. If you think about the changes in IT - the space is lot more on agile workflows and IT being much more responsive. And then what are the IT departments are also having service driven enterprises both services is in providing services internally.
But they’re also looking to run services in the cloud. And so one of those are practices that IT is adopting really come out of the software world and a lot of things that we have a long history of providing product in. And obviously the extensions as we work with our customers on the things - on the gaps that we have in our product portfolio today.
So I can’t go in great detail apart from this is sort of company level initiative that will you'll see go to market. You will see our pricing and packaging, you'll see in products that we bring to market over the coming years. The product question was just to make it clear that is this sort of is this definitely not a prioritization in the near term of IT versus non-IT because obviously moving outside of IT for teams of all sorts has been a big part of the company mission? Look Michael one of the reasons we’ve made the strategic partnership with Slack announced between us today is the - all the area of the business are having such opportunity that we need. We’ve got plenty of places to invest and we have investments across non-IT which Mike talked about earlier. Then we have investments in IT obviously as a result of increased focus there we are always spending more of our focus on IT than we had historically so you'll see more of that going forward. The next question comes from Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Once again that's Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. I wanted to broaden out a question that was asked earlier I understand why you migrate the properties that you have to Slack it's still not clear to me once those are migrated what are you getting from the partnership. In other words what is Slack going to give you is it a revenue share you're already doing some marketing with them around some of your other property. So once but the transition is completed what is the nature of the partnership with Slack? Sure Keith look we’re not disclosing the individual details of the partnership at a financial level obviously other than the high level that we’ve talked about the timing flows in the investment. I do think we are getting a lot from a closer collaboration with them. We're collaboration company and this by partnership you can see as an example of a collaboration at a company to company level between best-of-breed partners and best-of-breed companies in their own areas for the benefit of our collective customers.
Our focus is going to continue to be on building the best products that we can and the R&D centric model that we have. And so I think you’ll continue to see us doing that. Obviously we’re going to build deeper integrations, obviously we’re going to continue to make sure that our customers can use the product family together with Slack communications platform as efficiently and easily as possible. Then my follow-up perhaps in the context of the guidance going forward, your subscription revenue this quarter was once again incredibly strong. As you think about the context of the guidance you provided, can you give us any puts and takes on how we should think about subscription revenue? Well I would just observe both our cloud products and the data center products the part of - behind the firewall business that are both accounted for in subscription revenue. Both continue to grow very nicely and we’re very pleased by the recent performance and for the plan that we put together for the coming fiscal year. So that's an area that would certainly be looking for a significant strength in the overall accounts.
We will of course be lapping last year's benefit on the cloud side from per user pricing. So we’ll see some benefits in Q1 and then that process will have fully lapped out. And of course recall also that Q4 just finished that was the first quarter, the full quarter where we had lacked the Trello acquisition from a year or so ago. [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Rishi Jaluria with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. Thanks for taking my questions, nice to see some continued momentum in the business. Two questions, I mean first wanted to circle back and talk about GitHub. For some of the folks in the valley I spoke into there has been some negative pushback to the acquisition that some developers are fearing some long-term vendor lock in with Microsoft and then always talking about lots of neutrality. Has there been kind of an ability to capitalize on this with your Bitbucket and may be a strategy to continue to grab these types of customers that turn off hearing a big acquisition like that.
And then on the second question just around Trello acquisition. About a year old now I can you just give us a sense to how it has been trending relative to your initial expectations. Thanks It’s Scott here. When we - the GitHub acquisition was announced we did see a sort of more one-time spike from the sign-ups on our Bitbucket cloud instance. But I think there is a little uncertainty it start and then people had to take a wait and see approach.
We do believe that what we’ve seen over the last couple of months since that announcement is sort of nothing materially changed in our customer acquisition. But I expect to see that play out overtime one way or another, always - something happening on day one. And would Mike answer the Trello question. Look we’ve included Trello obviously going forward and in the past as we mentioned beforehand a year ago I suppose. Trello was around a $20 million of the revenue number for FY 2018. And we were materially over that, I think you could say for the year. So we maintained strong bullishness on Trello as an acquisition and its ability to move all teams forward in a way that they communicate and collaborate as a part of the Atlassian family. We’re all internally really happy with Trello like the culture fit has been fantastic, we’ve narrowed a great management team it really fits like part of Atlassian like we were separated at birth and as Mike said financial performance is being stronger than we had - than we put in our forecast so we’re really happy with that. And the next question comes from Jonathan Kees with Summit Insights Group. Please go ahead. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the quarter. I just have a couple specific question actually. This partnership with Slack is it safe to assume that they’re going to be your partner of preference in terms of communications platform. You have a couple of partners communication platform in your Atlassian marketplace like [858] which also has like a Slack type of service and obviously [indiscernible].
Is this just going to be more of a preference with Slack as the partner of choice? And then second I wanted to ask more of I guess lesser mentioned product status page, you're still meeting expectations and is there - if you can give any qualitative script in terms of the monetization for that and for fiscal 2019 that will be great? Thanks. Sure Jonathan I take the first one, I’ll leave for Scott to take the second one. Look the partnership is obviously made between Atlassian and Slack and we’ll continue to build deeper and deeper integrations between the two products.
At the same time, we do have our marketplace and we do have integrations with lots of other communication vendors through the marketplace and through many other channels. We've always maintained a very open perspective when it comes to the marketplace in terms of APIs that are available and other things.
So I think you’ll continue to see other vendors obviously building on the marketplace to serve their customers need but from our perspective we’re focused on building the best integrations for people that you Slack as a communications’ platform and they use the Atlassian family products across those integrations.
And you can see that the marketplace continues to power along strongly right as does the broad strength of the economy that exists around Atlassian in partners, vendors and in all the people but the work around the company and we’re very happy to have them all. On Statuspage just reminding everyone out there, Statuspage is a small company we acquired I think about year and a half ago. And they provide a way of communicating our uptime or downtime the status of key services to customers. And so companies around the world that are cloud companies use Statuspage to communicate with their customers when their service is up or down.
And that product is going really well, its fits our suite really well in terms of you think about companies moving to the cloud every company is going to need to communicate their availability and uptime to their customers. And so we see an order demand for Statuspage. Now we can’t breakout that individually unfortunately, but it's been a strong acquisition for us. The next question comes from Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. Please go ahead. Congratulations on the execution this quarter. Scott and Mike obviously you guys have been remarkably successful some things that work occasionally some things don't. I’m just wondering what lessons if any you feel like you may have – you’ve take taken away from the HipChat Stride experience? Sure Pat I can take that. Look we have a philosophy about how we approach enterprise software and that comes with a very strong model that you’re well aware of in terms of a high level of R&D investment, a high level of customer focus and delivery. And then a very friction free high-volume approach to the market in terms of sales and marketing.
So that that model comes with certain investments. It requires a lot of discipline, it requires a lot of patience and it requires making high decisions to start things and obviously to move away from things as they go.
You'll see us continue to stick to that model and those philosophies as we move forward as we have for 17 or 18 years now. And we do believe that philosophy in the model ends with the results that you’ve seen and you can feel free to judge us on those. And if I could follow-up just a little bit, what is it about communications what are the investments that we’re going to be particularly difficult is it around the sales? Look it's just as a space. As we said the investments required to continue to compete effectively with all of the players in the market. We didn't deemed to be as worthwhile away to play in a space as a partnership especially compared with the other opportunities that we have around the business. We are spoiled for opportunity in the spaces that we’re in, and we’re continuing to invest in those using the same discipline model that we've had in terms of approaching enterprise software. Okay, seeing no further questions in the queue. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to the management team for any closing remarks. I just want to thanks everyone for joining our call today. We appreciate your time and look forward to keeping you updated on our further progress. Thank you everyone. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

Thank you for joining Atlassian’s Earnings Conference Call for the First Quarter of Fiscal 2019. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of Atlassian’s website following this call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]
I will now hand the call over to Ian Lee, Atlassian’s Head of Investor Relations. Good afternoon, and welcome to Atlassian’s first quarter fiscal 2019 earnings conference call. On the call today, we have Atlassian’s Co-founders and CEOs, Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes; our Chief Financial Officer, James Beer; and our President, Jay Simons.
Earlier today, we issued a press release and our shareholder letter with our financial results and commentary for our first quarter fiscal 2019. These items are also posted on the Investor Relations section of Atlassian’s website at investors.atlassian.com. On our IR website, there is also an accompanying presentation and data sheet available. We’ll make some brief opening remarks and then spend the rest of the call on Q&A.
Statements made on this call include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Forward-looking statements represent our management’s beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made.
Further information on these and other factors that could affect the Company’s financial results is included in the filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time-to-time, including the section entitled Risk Factors in our most recent Forms 20-F and 6-K.
In addition, during today’s call, we’ll discuss non-IFRS financial measures. These non-IFRS financial measures are in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. There are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-IFRS financial measures versus their nearest IFRS equivalents and they may be different from non-IFRS measures used by other companies. A reconciliation between IFRS and non-IFRS financial measures is available in our earnings release, our shareholder letter, and in our updated investor data sheet on our IR website.
I’ll now turn the call over to Scott for his brief opening remarks before we move to Q&A. Good afternoon and thanks everyone for joining today. We had a great start to fiscal 2019. This quarter, we grew revenue by 37% year-over-year and generated more than $74.2 million of free cash flow. We also added over 5,800 net new customers during the quarter and now have more than 131,000 customers in total. At Atlassian Summit Europe in Barcelona last month, Mike and I were privileged to meet with many of our European customers, listen to their feedback and share our latest product and Company updates with them.
In keeping [ph] with the theme of doubling down on IT teams that we discussed last quarter, we made two significant announcements at summit that enable modern IT organizations to better manage one of their biggest challenges, preventing and responding to service disruptions. First, we announced the acquisition of OpsGenie, a leader in incident alerting; second, we launched our newest product, Jira Ops, which is a centralized hub for IT teams to coordinate their work during an incident. Together with our other products, OpsGenie and Jira Ops help IT operations teams resolve outages faster and incur fewer incidents over time.
We’ve provided more detail on those announcements along with many other updates in our shareholder letter that was issued earlier today.
And with that, I will pass the call over to the operator for Q&A.
[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Just to start off a question, either for James or Jay, how would you characterize the amount of pull forward this quarter as compared with what you saw a year ago? Gregg, this is James. In terms of the billings number generally, I was pleased with the result that we recorded in Q1, nice business trends, really right across the board, but particularly around the cloud side of our business. And in terms of the price increase effect, recall that we announced those server price increases a couple of weeks later than we did last year. So, that was only two weeks before the end of the quarter. So, we saw some pull forward. But, really, it was quite a modest effect. And, I would expect to see more of that effect in Q2 as we move forward here. And of course, I’d further expect that that pull forward would be, in essence, drawn, moving billings up from the second half of the fiscal year. Right. That makes sense. And then, a question on Jira Ops. I know it’s in early access for the rest of the calendar year. But, I’m curious how significant you think the attach opportunity is, both for OpsGenie customers as well as for your installed base more broadly, going forward? Thanks, Gregg. It’s Scott. I will take that one. I’ll just get back to explain how we think about the whole space, in order to answer that question. We said in previous calls that this year IT would be increased investment for us, and you’ve seen that. And there is significant changes happening in IT teams around the world. They are investing more in software, and software is a bigger part of what they do. And they are also increasingly collaborative. And both of those changes make us very well positioned to attack the IT space. They are both strength of Atlassian. And incident management is the convergences of software and IT. It’s actually where they come together. And then, as we said about the acquisition, about $700 billion of outages caused every year just in North America. So, it’s a very, very big opportunity, if we can reduce the cost of outages to businesses.
So, we’ve got three products in the space now. OpsGenie, which is sort of call rostering and alerting. [Ph] So, when your developers and your IT teams are on call but they manage all that through OpsGenie. We have StatusPage where we communicate out to end customers soliciting solution for that. So, when you have downtime or outages, you want to make sure, your customers are aware of that, so that they know and build trust with their customers. And thirdly, we’ve got Jira Ops. And the reason, we built that is that many of our customers already manage -- want to manage work in Jira, all the work that they have happen to Jira. And Jira Ops is a specialization of Jira specifically for incidents.
So, we have tens of thousands of customers using Jira already. And we see that incident management is going to be a fact of life for almost every software developer out there as they will move to the cloud and they have to manage things 24x7. And that’s sort of the cultural change for every single developer. So, we see a world where in the coming 5 or 10 years, it would be unusual for developers not to be on call and not be part of an on-call rostering system. So, the combination of OpsGenie, StatusPage and Jira Ops will be sort of something that every developer will need. The next question comes from Bhavan Suri with William Blair. Please go ahead. It’s actually Arjun in for Bhavan. I actually just wanted to follow up on the last question. So, you have three products addressing the IT market now. What role do you see new product introductions play in IT growth strategy into the future? Is there anything you are hearing from customers in terms of product gaps that you can share with us? It’s Scott. I’ll take that again. Well, firstly, we have more than three products we see that target IT. Confluence is used actually overwhelmingly by IT teams. It maybe even our most deployed product because the IT teams use a lot of Confluence for documentation and run books and procedures. And Jira Service Desk is used heavily to answer customer support, queries or internal queries for an IT helpdesk, in addition to the three products. And of course, many IT teams develop software. So, they’re using Jira software for that. They use Jira Core to work across the business. So, I would view our product portfolio is largely already targeting IT teams. Now, I can’t get into specifics on gaps there. We see, it’s pretty well-placed at the moment to serve a lot of IT team needs. There is some specific things that we are looking to improve. But, I wouldn’t say it is an overwhelmingly huge gap in our line-up, because as we get further into this market and we have larger customer base, they will be telling us [indiscernible] want us to deliver for them. The next question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. James, just want to make sure, I get the billings color correctly. So, basically, you are saying that you have less impact from a time standpoint of the increase in the quarter. Therefore, the pull-through effect was not as big as expected, and a lot of it will be absorbed in 2Q before normalizing in the second-half. Is that the way we should think about the pattern of billings in the year. I would say, just a tad differently, because in Q1, we got relatively modest pull forward. But that is what we expected. Again, the price increases were only announced a couple of weeks before the end of the quarter. And that was a couple of weeks later than the price increases that were rolled out a year ago. So, it’s not a surprise to us that there would be a relatively modest pull forward activity in Q1. Therefore, I would expect to see more of a pull forward in Q2. And again, that would tend to be pulled, in essence, billings moving up originally from the second half up into Q2 to some degree.
Now, I also think that it’s important because this is after all the first quarter that we’ve been reporting under IFRS 15. And so, it’s important, as you think about estimating our billings in terms of revenue, plus change in deferred that you do that calculation on a fully IFRS 15 basis. So, if you do that, you get to a billings growth rate year-over-year for the first quarter of 33%. So, you get to a $289 million calculated billings figure. So, it’s a very different figure, if you ended up using some of the old IAS 18 accounting specifics. So, I think it’s important, just to make sure that we’re all focused on this new IFRS 15 world. Thanks for clarifying. Sounds like a lot of fun. Help me think about the license, the perpetual license revenue. We are now down into the single digits. Would you expect that to recover or you think at this point this figure is to continue kind of fade away as your subscription revenue grows. And maybe tying into that, you keep surprising us on the gross margin, even though you keep trying to guide us to expect lower gross margin, given your cloud ramp. Help me reconcile the two. So, first of all, talk about perpetual license. We saw growth during the quarter of 12% year-over-year. And I think this is a good illustration of how more and more of our customers are choosing, either our cloud service offerings or our data center offerings. Both of those of course are accounted for within the subscription revenue line, which grew very nicely at 55% year-over-year. So, this is clearly a customer choice here.
In terms of what is what I’d expect for this line going forward. Remember that we have just rolled out some price increases for the service side of our business. So, that will, over time, help support both the perpetual license and maintenance lines in the revenue part of our equation. So, in terms of license revenue, when a current customer upgrades their footprint with us, so adds more users, then we’d be adding license. And those upgrades would be subject to the new pricing as time goes by. So, I think that will -- different points tends to support the growth rate of that line item.
Moving to your question about gross margins. Yes, we do still believe that over time, as we have more and more of mix of business move to the cloud that we would see a gradual pressure downward on gross margins; in the more short-term, a variety of other factors playing out. So, in the quarter, we just closed, pleased with the gross margin performance. And one of the things that was going on there as we’ve had number of initiatives in-house to ensure that we are utilizing our AWS resources, we use AWS to power the delivery of our cloud services, we’ve had initiatives underway to make sure that we are utilizing those services from AWS as efficiently as we can. So, that helped support the Q1 gross margin.
If you think about gross for the rest of the year, there is also an AWS factor to think about. Because I would foresee that we’ll actually be investing further in that AWS infrastructure in order to support the performance levels of our fast-growing cloud services. So, it will be a few different factors. But, strong gross margin in Q1; I would expect a lower gross margin over the remainder of the year. The next question comes Michael Turits with Raymond James. Please go ahead. This is actually Robert [ph] on for Michael. Just following up on the prior question on OpsGenie. Can you just talk about how the customer response has been so far? And what the integration opportunity is with your service desk? Yes, Robert. This is Scott here. [Indiscernible] really happy, extremely happy. It’s an area, OpsGenie is a fantastic product. We are really excited by the product. It’s also great cultural fit, which is really important for us as a company as well to make sure that they fit very well with Atlassian. There have about 3,000 customers at the moment. And the biggest thing we can do is introduce our 130,000 Atlassian customers to OpsGenie. The product itself is a fantastic product, fully featured. And we are really excited to introduce our customer base to that product. And there’s definitely a big need in the market. So, we had a great reception at our Summit when we announced it and we continue to hear a lot of demands from customers. And maybe just one for me. Can you just talk about [indiscernible] on the quarter and then maybe touch on the current business and go-to-market strategy there? Sorry, what on the quarter? [Indiscernible] [Indiscernible] Right. Yes. It performed in the line with what we expected. So, I think no major -- it tends to be a larger quarter for [indiscernible] and we sort of delivered what we wanted to. The next question comes from John DiFucci with Jefferies. Please go ahead. I think, the first question is for Scott. Scott, I think in your shareholder letter, you said that almost 60% of the attendees at the Barcelona conference identified themselves as part of IT teams. And you just mentioned earlier that you’re sort of -- I’m not sure exactly how you said it, but investing in the IT world. But, I just want to make sure, like I understand what that 60% means. Because does that mean the other 40% were mostly non-IT people? And, I guess -- I think that’s a like bigger number then -- and I know you just can -- you are not sure exactly how many people that are non-IT using your stuff that. But, I think it’s -- I’ve always thought of it as about a third in the past. So, I guess, I’m just wondering, are you seeing adoption of Atlassian products in OpsGenie aside, because that’s pure IT product by non-IT people picking up over the last six months or so. And how should we think about that going forward? Thanks, John. 60% attendees identifying as IT, that people working IT department businesses; there are other software people sort of working in other departments, businesses, and so there will be some of that. But your point around increasing beyond traditional base of software and IT, we’ll continually be happy with that. We know Trello largely used beyond traditional technical user base and we announced this 35 million accounts or users of Trello today, and that’s a huge growth, even a very larger number that continues to be very strong for us. Confluence, as I mentioned before is, sometimes originally deployed by IT, but most successful instances like confluence becomes wall-to-wall inside an organization and becomes the hub for how information flows around a business. And so, we continue to be very happy with how Confluence is performing inside our user base. It’s a bit of -- something that doesn’t get as much focus as it possibly should. It’s a great product. It has a huge number of fans and does get deployed wall-to-wall inside an organization. Okay, great. And I do have a follow-up on something else and really maybe for James on the Slack partnership. I know when you announced it last quarter, you announced it and you announced earnings, and you couldn’t really say whole a lot on any details on the financial side. And I’m just curious if there’s anything more you can share with us at this point, now that you’re a quarter into it? Perhaps on revenue sharing, anything, like even general information because you couldn’t say whole lot last time. And then, maybe James or Scott or Jay or somebody, anything on the status of the progression of that partnership as far as adoption within both customer bases? Hi, John. It’s James. In terms of the financials around developing relationship with Slack, that is proceeding along as I would have expected it to. We see obviously some of our customers, Stride and HipChat already looking to migrate over to Slack. And so, we’re helping those customers make that movement. And Slack is paying us as we expected for those migration services. So, that is moving ahead very much according to plan. That had a very modest impact on our bookings during the quarter, but it was a factor within those results. In terms of go-to-market activity, I think very early days in that regards and nothing material at this stage driving the bookings line in that manner. I think, just another illustration of the strength of the partnership, how it’s developing is we’re very much being at each other’s user conferences very prominently and so forth. So, we’re pleased as to the start that we’re off to. The next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. I just wanted to do another follow-up on OpsGenie and Jira Ops. I was just wondering who are you guys replacing there. Is anyone even using a competitive product or is this done still via Excel spreadsheets today? And how do you see that helping differentiate the Jira Ops offering? And then, the other thing I was wondering is, listening to you guys talk about this. How do you think about this Jira Ops pulling Jira Service Desk into conversations and vice versa? Do you see these as kind of a flywheel to get both products ultimately deployed at a customer? It’s Scott here. OpsGenie competes with other awarding [ph] systems in the market out there, and it does well. We estimate a significant part of our new customer adds come from competition. But, this is an area that is really changing at the moment. I would say, there’s still a very small number of developers today that are on call. But everyone we talked to, said that’s the way that it’s headed. So, this is very, very early in sort of the market adoption of the space. And we expect to play the part -- it’s helping people in that transition. Jira Ops, what we find across our customer base is that people want to manage their work in Jira in one location. And whether that is the development work they have got to do to get stuff out or the marketing team who is working around a launch or the the IT teams who want to manage internal tickets with their internal helpdesk, having that work in one location makes a huge difference for them. So, when we looked at whether build Jira Ops or not, one thing we found was our customers want to manage their incidents in one spot with all the other work but they also more importantly want to manage all the follow-up items from those incidents in one place.
So, the great part of that Jira Ops is, not only is useful during the incident, but it’s even more useful after the incident where you want to track all the actions that come out of that to prevent it happening in the first place. So, the idea is about using Jira Ops, you have fewer incidents in the future and you maintain and track work in one place. So, we see Jira as a platform for work. We’ve done Jira Service Desk, we have Jira Core for the general business work flows, Jira Software for people writing software and now Jira Ops now for people handing the incidents. And you will see more of that over time with just Ops finding ways to help our customers, track more work in Jira. I have just a small thing. This is Mike. At a philosophical level, it’s worth zooming out slightly. Both Jira Ops and Jira Services are extremely customer led. So, in both cases, we have used what customers are already using Jira four, and then built a more specific better version for that particular workflow or use case. Jira has thousands of different workflows and opportunities to track work inside a business. When we saw 30%, 40% of customers using it for service delivery of some kind, we built a far better service desk to handle that workflow with features tailored for that work flow. Jira Ops is very similar. So, a lot of these customers are already using Jira to manage the work during their incidents. We’ve just built a better way for them to do that’s more tailored, more specific to that use case, which will both to get more customers using that but also the existing customers having a better experience. The next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. This is Sanjit Singh for Keith Weiss. Thank you for the question. There has been a lot of focus on the IT side of the house. I guess, maybe for Mike or Scott, or even for Jay, as you think about the non-IT or kind of moving into the business user market, I think it’ll be probably be a little more onerous [ph] on products like Confluence, products like Trello. So, could you give us an update on how the monetization has been progressing with Trello, now that you are up to sort of 35 million users, any sort of update there? It’s Mike here, I can certainly take that. Look, again, if I start at the philosophy level, both software and IT are incredible landing spots for us within an organization. There are teams that actively go out and seek solutions and seek improvements to their workflows. There are also teams that work with a lot of other companies. So, that’s why you see us often landing Jira or Confluence in IT teams in varous different flavors for Jira but then expanding to the rest of the business. So, when we think about all teams in the business, we think about Jira and Confluence as much as we think about something like Trello. It’s worth saying that all of those are when we consider all teams. There is a huge amount of non-IT, non-software work happening in both of those products.
Trello has some of the same semantics. So, it does land in IT teams, it does land in software teams, especially in smaller organizations, but obviously expanse much more rapidly than that and does a huge amount of landing outside of that as well. We obviously continue to be hugely excited about the Trello opportunity. I don’t think we could have been more excited 18 months into the journey with the Trello team. We did say that Trello’s popped 35 million registered users, which is up from about 25 mill a year ago. So, obviously, continues to have great growth. No change in our workload there in Trello. It continues to be priority number one of continuing to grow the Trello business and the Trello product as a -- so the opportunity it has by itself and secondarily, focusing on monetization and integration with the rest of the Atlassian family. We will continue to put things in that order. Trello did, as we said last quarter, meaningfully exceed the 20 mill target for FY18 on the revenue side, which is great. But, we continue to put Trello growth and Trello monetization by itself first and cross-selling and cross-flow second. That’s very helpful. Thank you for that. Maybe for James, just so that I’m clear. So, the customers -- if we go back to last year’s piece increases, so the customers that renewed early and maybe they signed annual contract, or in some cases multi-year contracts. Just so that I -- given the new price increases, if they were up for renewal this year, even next year, they would be exposed to the new price increases. Do I have this dynamic correct? Yes. I mean, you do, at a high level. It’s a rolling effect, if you will. Because in that circumstance, if someone last year in essence pulled forward their renewal, say for a year and it was occurring -- the renewal was coming up right around the time in which we announced these price increases, they could once again, in essence, pull forward the next renewal. But of course, that new renewal would be in essence at last year’s price increased rate. So, you’re just being able to defer to some portion of our customer base decide to cite to early renew and therefore, in essence, extend their old pricing for another year or so. The next question comes from Nikolay Beliov with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Actually Jacqueline Cheong on for Nikolay. For this year, did you see any difference in the customer behavior around the pricing changes versus last year? Could you comment on both the cloud and server additions? And if we could get an update on the home products as well. Sure. I’m going to pass it to Mike on the home products, but really quickly on the pricing -- this is Jay, no differences. As we’ve said before, we just do a tons of analysis to support the changes that we do make around pricing. And do keep in mind that with the changes that we announced in September, the increase for an average customer is pretty nominal, measured in hundreds of dollars. And still our prices remain incredibly affordable relative to what our customers would spend on software that they value less. And then, maybe the only other point is that just from a philosophy perspective, we have stressed this before but it’s worth stressing again that our pricing philosophy is pretty deeply rooted. We want to provide the best value at the absolute best price in every category in which we compete, and that tends to be an Atlassian advantage. Over to Mike for home. I can take the home product down here in Sydney. Again with -- perhaps to reminder, so, the teamwork platform that we have been building out for a couple of years that underpins a lot of our products, not all, obviously, not in OpsGenie, not yet in Trello really in meaningful way, continues to be something that we invest in, for a number of different reasons. Firstly from a cost and R&D perspective, obviously, if we can get more products using a similar infrastructure, we’ve moved almost all our products now to a common identity call for example for login and sign-up and user management, and things like this. That obviously gives us cost advantages in building things. We can invest in building better and more and leveraging that across a number of products. And secondly, it gives the customers a more consistent experience.
We are constantly trying to be pragmatic about the balance between providing a great single product experience and providing a great Atlassian family experience. It’s not an easy balance to strike and we continue to work to do that. One of the areas that we have been working now for about a year and half on is what’s normally called home. One should be careful, it’s a product, yes; it’s not a for sale product. So, you can think about it as something you get free when you have a single Atlassian product, two Atlassian products, three Atlassian products, you get home in the box, and consist of a number of pieces. It continues to be more and more of a default starting location for our customers, whether they are using Jira Confluence or Jira and Confluence to get, and we will continue to do that. There is an advantage obviously, your chances of choosing the second product if you are using home. And it includes the people directory, which is now largely common in cloud, so who is using these products, what are they doing in the products, et cetera. It will just be something that we continue to work on across people, across search, across notifications and various other things. It’s not a for sale product per se, but obviously long-term, it will drive higher customer satisfaction and better cross-flow among the product. And maybe another follow-up. So, the cloud version was a major area of investment. So, now that the cloud version is up and running, are we going to see some R&D leverage going forward? And also, what are the R&D priorities looking ahead? Look, I can take that. I would say one thing that we are cautious on, yes, the cloud version is quite up and running, but it continues to require major investment. There’s still a lot of work we’re doing on continuing to be more and more world-class cloud provider. You can see that on the enterprise side of things. This quarter, we both raised the 2,000 user upper limit to 5,000, so obviously giving our larger customers in cloud a lot more headroom to continue to expand. And obviously, we don’t need to do that if we thought we could support those customers and give them a great experience. And secondly, we’ve launched products like Atlassian Access which launched about three months ago for our common user provisioning, identity control and security management product for organizations that have a large number of users in our cloud offerings. So, there continues to be a lot of work, not least also just in the infrastructure scaling at Atlassian Cloud. We’ve launched a couple of new regions. So, now we’re available in Ireland and Sydney in Australia for the Asia Pacific region, and we announced that we are bringing up two other regions as well in Singapore and in Frankfurt in Germany. So, they all continue to be large areas of investment for the R&D infrastructure side of cloud beyond the historical movement to AWS, which is largely finished now, yes. This is James, I’d just add to your question about leverage that we would continue to expect to record modest annual increases in our operating and free cash flow margins over time. The next question comes from Jonathan Kees with Summit Insights Group. Please go ahead. I just wanted to ask I guess more on the competitive picture. If I can be specific, Microsoft obviously with purchase, and investment now in GitHub and also its new version of project. Are you rubbing elbows more with that? Are you seeing any change in that dynamic. And obviously, since your doubling down in IT, are you also now rubbing elbows more with ServiceNow and IT as well as with their version of service desk in terms like RFPs and in terms of being -- in terms of your competitive wins? Thanks. I’ll take that. In terms of GitHub and Microsoft, we’re not seeing any change there, any material changes in what’s happening there. We -- as I said before, we believe that Microsoft’s key rational for acquiring GitHub is to encourage developers to use their Azure platform. And that’s obviously a very different thing to what we are trying to do with our customer base [indiscernible]. In terms of ServiceNow, we’ve mentioned before, where we both play in the IT space, we don’t come across them very often. They’re largely a top-down sell to the fortune 2000; we sell to fortune 500,000. And so, business models are very different, and the way we go to market is very different. So, we don’t see come across them very often. Great. And last question is, with Trello, it sounds like most of the growth areas just -- especially the focus is just growing Trello first and then second will be cross-selling. It sounds like most of the Trello users are just purely Trello users, they’re not using any of the products, Atlassian products. Just wondering if there’s been any particular strength in terms of Trello? Is it via like country wise, is it more domestic? And at one point you talked about Trello in Japan was going to be a big opportunity, they were looking forward to the inclusion of Trello in terms of the local apps there, and the market there was a very keen in terms of the Trello purchase. Just some more color in terms of the Trello traction? Thanks. Sure. This is Mike again. Look, Trello is a global phenomenon. And one of the things that Atlassian has been able to do since they came on board is do some country-specific launches, as you mentioned, in Japan for example; we’ve also done Sweden and the Nordics, and I believe France as well that maybe just before that came on board. Those country-specific launches tend to have a series of local PR events, often user group events where we’ll get Trello users in the country together, as well as specific power-ups for Trello that deal with local -- popular local applications. That tends to just add topspin to Trello in that particular country. We also should -- I should mention we do localization, although I believe we already had Japan for Trello before that. So, that’s just the way of driving some more energy in a particular geography. We have like Trello users all over the planet. So, it is by far our most widely, geographically global product that has a huge amount of opportunity in lots of different flavors. Again, we have a huge amount of Trello work that happens in Japan, as I mentioned in Nordics, a lot of users in South America, as well as traditional users [ph] of North America and Western Europe. So, it’s just a very, very large product that we continue to invest in growing all over the world. You’ll probably see us do some specific country launches. But I wouldn’t get too distracted by that. That’s just where we try to add little bit of topspin, usually we’re already in country when we’re doing that. And we continue to invest all over the globe in Trello’s opportunity, as well as what people use it for, a lot of home teams, a lot of teams outside of organizations as well as teams inside of organizations. Quite often people start using Trello to manage projects with their partner, with their construction person, whatever may be doing that their trying to mange with their families often, often people get their kids in Trello doing some family management. If that’s successful for them, they often bring that into their workplace, as much as they do vice versa. It’s what makes Trello such a unique product. [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Rishi Jaluria with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. Hi, guys. This is [technical difficulty]. I was just wondering regarding OpsGenie, how much customer overlap you guys have. We haven’t -- it’s Scott here. We disclosed the opportunity of 3,000 customers, but we haven’t got into the overlap. That’s not something we typically disclose between the different products. But, you could imagine, you have 130,000 that you’re going to find a reasonable overlap across the customers bases, but we don’t get any more specific than that, I’m afraid. And then, my second question, I was just wondering how we should think about subscription growth going forward on a year-over-year basis. Yes. We don’t break out the specific revenue lines, if you well, in terms of our guide. But, I would say that since the subscription revenue line encapsulates both our cloud business and our data center business, I would expect that to be a very robust number going forward. So, we clearly see more and more customers moving in those directions. And I think that will be reflected in our results going forward.
So, if we don’t have any further questions, operator, let me confirm that first? There are no further questions in the queue. Okay. Let me just make a few remarks about operating margins. I thought I’d group these remarks, first of all in terms of the first half of the year, then address the second half of the year and then give some quarter-specific comments as well. So, in terms of the first half of fiscal ‘19, I mentioned at the start of the call that we were pleased with the revenue performance in Q1 that certainly drove a strong margin result as a result of our performance right across the business, cloud, server and data center. And it’s fair to say that during Q1, a goodly portion of our recruitment resources were very much focused on a couple of very discrete projects, the first of which was our decision to withdraw from the Stride and HipChat markets and enter into the building relationship with Slack. And so, that drove very much focus on finding the right next career step for the material number of our team who have been developing Stride and HipChat over recent years. And I was very pleased that we were very successful in that regard in terms of finding the good next step further, a very significant majority of that team.
The second major initiative that the recruitment team was focused on of course was the acquisition of OpsGenie, which brought to the company around 200 new employees as well. And so, I would expect that in the second quarter now with much of that work behind us that recruit recruitment team will be able to focus more of their effort around our organic hiring goals.
So, that brings me to some thoughts around the second half margin story in fiscal ‘19. I would expect organic headcount to increase and therefore the second half operating margins would be lower than those recorded in the first half of the year. Now recall, I mentioned earlier in this conversation that we also expected somewhat lower gross margins in the second half of the year, as a result of our AWS investment plans.
More specifically, I would look in the second half of the fiscal year for opportunities to really invest, getting very significant opportunities that we have in the IT team’s area. Obviously, we’ve talked a lot about that on this call in the last 45 minutes or so. And we are very excited in particular about our OpsGenie opportunity. So, I would see hiring, marketing and product development resources all being a part of that focus in the second half of the year.
So, lastly, just turning to some additional quarter-specific commentary on operating margins. First of all just building on that last thought of us really working hard in support of the OpsGenie opportunity. We plan to initiate some targeted marketing spend in Q2. So, I would expect to see a slightly higher ratio for our Q2 marketing spend as a percentage of revenue when we get together in 90 days time. Second, I would expect there to be a decline in margin from Q2 to Q3 as is quite typical because it’s in the start of Q3 that we roll out new salary increases for our team and also reset payroll taxes. And I would further expect that that sequential decline from Q2 to Q3 in terms of operating margins would be pretty consistent with what we saw last year between Q2 and Q3 on an IFRS 15 basis. So, again, it is important that we be working in the new IFRS 15 accounting structures.
So, with all of that said, just again to wrap up, as I mentioned earlier that we would expect ongoing annual modest increases in both operating and free cash flow margins over time. Mike, are you going to wrap up? Thanks James, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. We really appreciate your time and look forward to keeping you updated on our progress in future quarters. Have a kickass weekend. The conference has now concluded.

Thank you for joining Atlassian's earnings conference call for the second quarter of fiscal 2019. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of Atlassian's website following this call. I will now hand the call over to Ian Lee, Atlassian's Head of Investor Relations. Good afternoon, and welcome to Atlassian's Second Quarter Fiscal 2019 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today, we have Atlassian's Co-Founders and CEOs, Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes; our Chief Financial Officer, James Beer; and our President, Jay Simons.
Earlier today, we issued a press release and a shareholder letter with our financial results and commentary for our second quarter fiscal 2019. These items were also posted on the Investor Relations section of Atlassian's website at investors.atlassian.com. On our IR website is also an accompanying presentation and data sheet available. We'll make some brief opening remarks and then spend the rest of the call on Q&A.
Statements made on this include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking results. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Forward-looking statements represent our management's beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made. Further information on these and other factors that could affect the company's financial results is included in filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including the section titled Risk Factors in our most recent Form 20-F and quarterly report on Form 6-K.
In addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-IFRS financial measures. These non-IFRS financial measures are in addition to and not a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. There are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-IFRS financial measures versus their nearest IFRS equivalents, and they may be different from non-IFRS and non-GAAP measures used by other companies. A reconciliation between IFRS and non-IFRS financial measures is available on our earnings release, our shareholder letter and in our updated investor data sheet on our IR website.
I will now turn the call over to Mike for his brief opening remarks before we move to Q&A. Good day, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Q2 was a beauty, a great way to cap off 2018 as we surpassed $1 billion in calendar year revenue for the first time. In Q2, we had $299 million in revenue, up 39% year-over-year. For the quarter, we also generated more than $122 million worth of free cash flow. In October, we closed the acquisition of OpsGenie, a leader in incident alerting and on-call schedule management. We're tremendously excited to have them join the Atlassian family as we double down on IT teams this year.
IT organizations big and small are becoming more service driven and agile oriented and as technology becomes the key ingredient for growth and survival of nearly any business. We're excited about the role we play in helping IT drive that transformation, and OpsGenie plays a key role in strengthening the service and response muscle for IT teams across the Fortune 500,000.
During Q2, we also acquired Butler for Trello, one of Trello's most popular integrations. Butler gives Trello users the ability to work smarter and faster by bringing the power of workplace automation to their Trello boards. Individual users can shrink multiple steps into one, will have things like user assignments or status change based on triggers or rules that they set up themselves. It's a superpower that we're excited to bring to the millions of daily Trello users.
I'm also excited to share that JIRA Software recently surpassed 65,000 customers. This is more customers than the entire company had when we went public just three years ago. Including OpsGenie, we ended Q2 with a total customer count of more than 138,000. We provided more detail on these announcements along with many other updates in our earnings release and shareholder letter that was issued earlier today.
And with that, I'll pass the call to the operator for Q&A. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Bhavan Suri with William Blair. I guess I just want to touch on a couple quick things, and I had just 1 question but with two small parts. When you think about the quarter specifically, I love to understand sort of the impact pricing changes had in terms of pull forward and sort of what the impact of that might have been, just some quantitative and also qualitative commentary on sort of how that played out to the customer behavior you've seen in the past year given the pricing increase, what they thought, share and et cetera, and then the pull forward. Thanks, Bhavan, for that question. The first thing that I really like to emphasize is that our key top line metric that we focus on to measure our business continues to be revenue. And that's because we are not like most traditional enterprise software companies in that the significant majority of our business is made up of either monthly or annual subscriptions or annual maintenance contracts. And we expect this to be increasingly the case as our customers continue to choose our Cloud and Data Center offerings. To further emphasize this point, again, unlike many other software companies, multiyear deals are only a tiny fraction of our business while pull-forward activity, by our customers, ahead of a Server price increase, drives really just a timing difference rather than a change in the scale of our relationship with that customer.
So as a result, we very much believe that revenue is a best reflection of the underlying customer demand for our business when you consider our performance over time. But more specifically to address your question around pull-forward activity, as we indicated on the call last quarter, we did see a significant volume of Q2 transactions coming in ahead of the Server price increases taking effect. And this activity came in the form of both early annual renewals and multiyear renewals. So this pull-forward activity, in essence, replaced what would otherwise have occurred in the second half of our current fiscal year or the following 2 fiscal years as well. In terms of the part of your question around the customer behavior and so forth, again, as expected and I must say I'm pleased by the overall reaction to the price increases that we've had from our customer base, and I think that's illustrative of the way we roll out price increases. We give lead time. And of course, accompanied with those price increases are very significant improvements in the product. We're investing heavily in our product every month, and this comes through in some sort of value we create for our customers. The next question comes from Nikolay Beliov with Bank of America. I just had a pretty basic question for the team. You've highlighted 65,000 JIRA Software customers. Can you please remind us roughly the split between JIRA Core and JIRA Software? And right now, where do you think is the penetration of the potential market for JIRA Software? Are we in the second inning? The fourth inning? Just wanted to get the opinion of the team. Thanks for the question. It's Scott here. We don't break out JIRA Core and JIRA Software. But I think JIRA Core is a relatively recent offering for us, and it's still growing. So it would be safe to say that the majority of our revenue in the JIRA broadly, JIRA family comes from JIRA Software and JIRA Service Desk, and that's still the majority is JIRA Software. From -- I think your -- what was your second question, was around are we in the third, second or third or fourth inning? I think that's an American term. I think you have to translate that to like a cricket term, are we in the third day of the test I guess. And for us, like the way I think about it is the software market is growing incredibly fast, so every company is becoming a software company. So the market itself is growing very fast. We are growing or continue to grow our customer base within that market incredibly well. And then we're also growing our share of wallet within our customer base as we do more things for them such as OpsGenie, which we talked about; the JIRA Service Desk. And we also, as we start going adjacent into more likely teams, we're seeing that as a sort of a new market opportunity for us as well. So I feel very good about the -- both the TAM and the relatively small penetration we have within that TAM today. And just to add 1 point on to what Scott was saying there, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics recently came out with some data estimating that the number of software developers in the world is going to be growing 24% annually through 2026, so a very interesting illustration of the future potential. Got it. And James, quick question for you. Long-term deferred revenue increased sequentially quite a bit. We haven't seen that in a while. What drove that? And what do you think the forward trends will be in the long-term DR over the next couple of quarters? Yes. Well, as you say, long-term deferred revenue sequentially was up around $14 million, and that certainly is a larger bump than we would usually see from 1 quarter to the next. And that was very much driven by this pull-forward activity that I was referring to earlier, in particular, obviously, the multiyear part of that pull-forward activity because the long-term deferred revenue represents activity that will be earned into revenue beyond 12 months from now. The next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. This is actually Ted Lin on for Heather. I was wondering if you could just give us an update maybe on your overall philosophy on pricing. Historically at the teams, like you've gotten a lot of people in at a very low price to help improve willingness to pay. And so for a lot of your customer base, it's pretty high value-to-cost product. So how do you capture more of the value that you're customers are getting longer term? Yes. This is Jay. So I think you captured the philosophy in your question that we believe in providing incredible product in the most affordable price. That's been consistent through the company's history. We also believe on creating opportunities to land inside of customers where we remove prices as part of the friction. And so in OpsGenie, you'll notice that in October, shortly after close, we lowered pricing, introduced a free plan. We are transparent with our pricing. So across the spectrum of what customers can buy and how they grow with us, we basically share those price points so they don't have to ask. And that's effectively the philosophy. Where we work to participate in greater share of wallet is in adding more capability and more premium features that support enterprises as they scale with us. And so we've done that in the context of the data center product family, which we've talked about as growing nicely and continues to grow in the cloud. We've done that in the context of access, which is effectively a premium capability that supports a stronger identity and security management for customers. And I guess, on the core, given the strong outperformance and the strong pull forward that you saw, how should we think about kind of that impacting the shape of the seasonality of deferred revenue and billings kind of for the rest of the fiscal year? Well, I would just sort of reconfirm that, that pull-forward activity would have come from both the second half, both quarters of the second half of this fiscal year as well as the 2 subsequent fiscal years, fiscal '20 and '21. And you're right. By looking at that sequential part of both short-term and long-term deferred revenue, you can get something for a steer as to the balance of where that pull-forward activity came from. The next question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Couple of questions for me. First of all, since you know how many people pulled in revenue, can you roughly tell us what was billing growth without this pull-in effect? And then the second question, more in the competitive front. Now that GitHub is part of Microsoft, you haven't talked much in your prepared remarks about Bitbucket. But can you tell us if anything is changing competitively? How's momentum in that business? Is anything changing out there in the marketplace? Yes, just briefly to the first point. I'd just sort of reemphasize our focus on revenue as the top line metric that we factor to really understand the underlying relationship with our customers at the time. Scott, are you going to take the second one? Yes, I think you have -- acquisition from Microsoft, we haven't seen any material change this quarter in the competitive market. We believe what we have said previously, which is that Microsoft's primary goal in acquiring GitHub was to get more of their developers into Azure, and that's what we continue to see to be the Microsoft focus. So there's no real change in the last quarter on that front even with the changes in how they price GitHub. The next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. I was hoping to sneak in two questions, 1 on OpsGenie and kind of the competitive environment that you see out there, where kind of like the combined offering that you guys are bringing to market is going to sort of be able to gain some competitive advantage. And then on -- maybe one for James on the operating margin side of the equation. Also like a really impressive quarter for operating margin. You saw some real nice year-on-year improvement. The guidance doesn't have that. The guidance is a much -- kind of more muted year-on-year comparing terms of operating margins. Can you talk to us a little bit about sort of where those areas of investment are and sort of why, on a year-on-year basis, it would will be so much lower kind of improvement on operating margin in Q3 versus Q2? Scott here. I'll take the question about the OpsGenie in the competitive market. We feel incredibly bullish and excited about the market for incident management. If you -- so those of you who are sort of new to the story, as developers move their workloads to the cloud, as companies become more -- -- or the software company, developers are increasingly being on call. They're responsible for making sure that their code, it stays up to your production and performance. And when it's not, they need -- the company's being weighted with alerting their developers and coordinating responses. Now the responses could be around down time. They could be around security incidents, all these things that are involved when you're running a code at scale in the cloud. And OpsGenie offers a response and plays in that space, and we've been really very bullish about that. We have OpsGenie that does the incident alerting part. We have JIRA, which handles a lot of the tasks before and after, and we know JIRA is the way that our work gets done in organizations. And so putting those 2 things together is very powerful. And we also have StatusPage, which is the leading provider of -- StatusPage is on the web that need to get with your customers if you're having downtime. And so when customers have problems, they want to know that something's up with the provider, and we use StatusPage for that. So that combination of those three products is, in my opinion, unmatched out there in the market, and we're really bullish about bringing those together. Excellent. And Keith, on the margin side of things, let me handle that. In Q2, obviously, we did see a strong operating margin really driven by some nice performance on the revenue line. And then on the spending side of things, both in the cost of goods sold, we saw some nice benefits there as we continue to work on the efficiency and effectiveness of our hosting expenditures. On the operating expense side, I'd point to some timing issues around the arrival of additional headcount and also some lesser-than-expected spending around certain professional services. So all of that combined to drive the Q2 result. And as you note, we are expecting margins to be lower in the back half of the year. So as you think about the Q3 story, there are a few different things driving that. First of all, Q3 is when we issue additional salary increases to our team, and so that begins to kick in. And also, Q3 represents -- so the calendar year, obviously, and therefore the payroll tax reset associated with our employee expenditures.
And in addition to that, as we talked about on the last call, we've really been putting effort and investment into our hiring engine if you will, and we're pleased with the progress that we're making in that regard. And so while we increased our employee count substantially in Q2, I would expect -- obviously, about half of that was driven by OpsGenie. I would expect the organic level of headcount to continue to increase in Q3 as we particularly invest in our R&D-centric model. And within the R&D area, we see a lot of different opportunities, obviously, right across our business, but I would particularly point to our Cloud products as a whole, to our work on our Cloud platform, which you can think of really as us developing common componentry that we'll utilize across the different cloud services. Of course, this will allow us to build cloud services more efficiently and more quickly as well as helping us adjust our ability, improve our ability to deal with larger deployment sizes while continuing to enhance our security and privacy, compliance requirements, that sort of thing. We've talked a lot about the IT market opportunities, so we'll particularly investing there. I'd call out OpsGenie as one clear example in that arena. And then I'd also point to the data center offerings for our on-premises customers. We've been very pleased with the growth rate in recent quarters there, and I would expect that to continue into the future. The next question come from Richard Davis with DG Financial. CG, but that's okay. So I think it was like 85% of your new customers came on as cloud subscribers. Is there any difference in lifetime customer value for cloud customers versus on-premise? I'm sure there's a different shape in the profitability, but I've just always wondered about that. Richard, this is Jay. Not materially. I think as we've mentioned before, Cloud is a little more expensive than Server. We also have the ability to operate Cloud a little differently than we can in Server because we have kind of visibility into how the product's being used and we have kind of different avenues that we can leverage for cross-sell and expansion and kind of connecting to the customer kind of in product to open up different paths and avenues for cross-selling and other products. But from a lifetime value, I think they're pretty comparable, and that's seeing some strengths, I think, that the products provide themselves and the value they provide to customers. Richard, this is Mike. Just chipping one thing. When Jay says the customer lifetime value is comparable, he means on a customer potential basis. So we tend to calculate, for example, if someone is a 50-person company, going wall to wall in that company, we can sell 50 seats. If someone is a 50,000-person company, we can potentially sell 50,000 seats. So for the size of the company, our potential return or lifetime value is equivalent. Generally, the larger the company, the less likely they ought to choose cloud today. But obviously, that's changing on a sort of on a timescale basis if that makes sense. The next question comes from John DiFucci with Jefferies. This is Zach Lountzis for John. Could you talk a little bit about the Slack partnership, how it's going, the transitions from Stride and HipChat? And then any changes there competitively with Microsoft or anyone else? Mate, I can talk to that. It's Mike. Sure. Look, it's going -- I'd say the partnership's going very, very well. We have a great relationship there. We continue to work together and build out features and functions that help joint customers across our product portfolios to have the best experience that they can. We continue to move through the transition and migration period for HipChat and Stride customers. Again, there's about 1 month and a bit left at that, so we continue to work with big and small customers to help them migrate and to get into that future world. I don't know if we have anything else to call out on the go-to-market side there, but it's been going pretty well so far. And then, James, if I could, the -- you guys raised that convert a few quarters ago. You're at like $800 million or something in net cash today. I was wondering how you guys think about the positioning there going forward? Any additional raises that you might be looking to make and what the ideal balance is really? Yes, I think the converts as well as our ongoing free cash flow generation provides us with substantial financial flexibility. So we're very pleased by that given the scale of the market opportunity that we have in front of us. So we're obviously very pleased with, in particular, the continued progression of our cash flow results. The next question comes from Michael Turits with Raymond James. On the upside on the billings, how much of it was in addition to pull forward? May have been -- is there any particular shift to more data center and multiyear contracts either at data center or on maintenance? Yes. Mike, I wouldn't point to anything in particular other than what I've really commented on already. So remember that the price increases really applied to our Server business. We did not increase prices on the Data Center business. So it was really much more that part of the overall platform that we offer that was driving the pull forward. Got it. And then also a strong quarter on the other line, which includes marketplace. Anything that suggests any particular inflection there? Yes. We were very pleased with the marketplace performance as we have been now for a number of quarters. One additional accounting element sort of in terms of a technical issue is that pull-forward activity related to our customers buying marketplace apps. Our portion of those purchases drop straight into revenue in the quarter that they occurred since we've already satisfied any conditions that we need to be able to execute on at that point. The next question comes from Rishi Jaluria with D.A. Davidson. Two quick ones. First, just the stat you gave around cloud customers, that's definitely really impressive. It's nearly 75% of total customers. Can just give us a sense for how this number has directionally trended over time? And where do you think it'll end up over time, especially given that 85% of net new customers were cloud customers? And I got a follow-up. Look, I can answer that. I mean, directionally, it's clear in the numbers. As I said, it's more than 85% of new customers come into the cloud. I would say we expect that to continue to trend upwards as companies increasingly -- fundamentally, if you zoom out, the cloud can provide a better offering than I think most companies can run themselves, right? It can be more secure. It can be faster. It takes away the operational management hurdles. You don't have to upgrade it. So there's inherent obvious advantages in the cloud. Our belief is it's going to be a decade-long transition. And the majority, the vast majority of software will be run in the cloud. So we're seeing 85% plus of new customers coming in choosing that. It's logical that our overall customer base would trend to that and then continue to trend upwards as that's the case. At the same time, we don't force migrate customers. It should be very clear. We are pro-customer choice, and there's a significant number of companies for whom that's not their choice. That is a distinct advantage of Atlassian over a pure cloud vendor, is that we can provide a better, more holistic offering as companies go through that transition internally over the next decade. That's helpful. And then one follow-up for James on the gross margin guidance. I guess just how should we be thinking about why implied Q4 gross margins should be dropping from where they are? And then with the AWS migration being done, what should the longer impact on gross margins be? Yes. So in the back half of this fiscal year, we'll continue to be investing in some of the data center infrastructure in Asia Pacific in particular, so that will drive some additional COGS for us. Over the longer term, obviously, as Mike was just pointing out, we would expect cloud to continue to steadily grow as an overall proportion of the business. And we know cloud comes with lower gross margins than the -- behind the firewall platform offerings that we have because, obviously, we're doing the hosting work, whereas behind the firewall, our customer is paying for that activity. The next question comes from Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets. I had two quickies and a longer-term question. But was there any inorganic help or was the inorganic help in any way material in the quarter you just reported? In addition, Europe looked like it had some strength there. Was there anything you wanted to call out in Europe as being unusual? Or what was the driver of strength? And then I'll wait to ask my follow-up. Yes. So in terms of inorganic activity, we closed the OpsGenie transaction at the start of the quarter. And when we announced that transaction, we indicated that it would drive around 1 point of revenue growth for us during fiscal '19. So that would be the only factor we would have got a full quarter effect of OpsGenie on the revenue side there. In Europe, what I would point to there is that our channel is a very important component of our distribution generally. And indeed, around half of our channel partners are in Europe, so it's a particularly important part of our European distribution business. And those channel partners in Europe in particular worked effectively with our customers around some of the pull-forward activity that we spoke of earlier. And some of that activity, I mentioned the marketplace activity in an earlier answer, does drop immediately in the quarter to revenue. So that would have also benefited that EMEA growth rate that you see. Okay, fair enough. And then the question I wanted to ask, again, directional and philosophical, is when you're thinking about your revenue growth profile, there's a few things that impact it. One is prices. The other is mix. But I'm just also trying to understand how we should be thinking about subscriber growth as being a driver of future revenue growth. And is there any kind of metrics that we should be thinking about? Is it the key driver of your growth going forward? Or just any kind of categorization of how that impacts the top line. I can talk about that, I guess, philosophically. Look, we've been very clear that we have a lot of different growth sectors in our quite unique business. And that's a constant challenge, intellectual challenge for us to manage between the different levers. But I've think we've done, if you look at our history, a pretty good job so far. When we talk about that, obviously, you get the headline customer number, which was past 138,000, which is a great number. But that only means that, that is a singular domain, and I think it was a singular company that's becoming like a customer. They then have a lot of different ways to grow. As you've seen us over time build out the portfolio, as we add more products, there are more things that, that particular customer can buy. Secondly, obviously, the customers themselves can grow inside the product that they're already in.
So if they land in JIRA Software, they land in Trello, they're on Confluence, they can just literally add more of their company to that. So if they've got 10,000 employees, they might start with a 50-person team somewhere. And our job is to continue to deliver value to them over time so that they will grow into 100-person customer for us, then 1,000-person and hopefully to a 10,000-person customer. And that's just within our stable. The other thing obviously is things like the marketplace, which has been called out a couple of times in the call, which is an ability for that customer to grow outside of things that Atlassian builds. And we provide the platform for that to connect those vendors and the great ecosystem we have with those customers in a transactional way. And then last year, you've seen us, I would say, judiciously exercise our acquisition model over time as another way for the business to grow. So the headline customer number, 138,000, is a very good one, but we have a lot of ways to grow those customers within that number. The next question comes from Jonathan Kees with Summit. It was indeed a ripper of a quarter, and that's impressive given the gloom in June. And you see in the headlines. You read in the headlines in the news. I guess my question is more what concerns you in terms of the macro issues. Or are you not seeing much? I would think you at least encounter stuff like the government shutdown. You do have exposure to government, the federal business. There is indications of IT slowdown, and that would impact software. You obviously don't manufacture in -- stuff in China, so that doesn't impact you. But in general, what are the macro issues that you're seeing and that concerns you? Yes. Jonathan, I'll take that one. We aren't seeing anything specific in terms of macro weakness. As you point out, our exposure to China is really immaterial. And while we certainly wouldn't say that we're immune to a recession, we also believe that, as was quoted back around the IPO times, that our business is very much built for stormy weather. So the company has been able to very nicely weather the last 2 recessions. And I think our low-cost, high-value model is a big driver of that. And another thing to consider, of course, is that the way we distribute our product, it's really chosen by the end users rather than sold top down and pushed onto those users. And so feel good about the business model's ability to withstand a dip economically. Okay. All right. That's helpful. If I can ask one other question, you've mentioned that, James, that obviously, margins could be going down in the second half, specifically operating margins. Sales and marketing ticked up substantially on a sequential basis there and actually over the last several quarters. Is this going to be the new norm? I know in the past, you've talked about initiatives to try to promote Trello, focus on that first, launch across the world and then focus on monetization later. Are we talking about who are going to be seeing increased levels of sales and marketing going forward even beyond second half? Well, on the call last quarter, we spoke about the fact that we were going to enter into a specific marketing campaign around OpsGenie in combination with, as Jay was discussing earlier, the price reductions that we rolled out into the marketplace. And you may have seen some of that activity around the country. So that was a big focus of Q2. And I would say that we do have some plans for the balance of this year to continue to push on that IT market opportunity. The other thing that I would point to is Jira Software cloud was relaunched just back in October, and Jay and his team have been putting considerable marketing effort behind that as well. So I wouldn't necessarily draw a long-term trend around the current level of activity in sales, marketing arena, but we're very pleased with the investments that we've been making there and expect to make for the balance of this fiscal year. The next question comes from Derrick Wood with Cowen and Company. Great. And I guess, on that comment, the relaunch of the Jira Software Cloud and the increase in the user scale capabilities with JIRA and Confluence, I'm curious, are you seeing increased interest from your on-premise base looking to migrate to the cloud? Or you generally see kind of the cloud versus the data center base swimming in two different lanes? Yes. Derek, I'll take that. Migration between server -- from server to cloud has been kind of ongoing with -- as different segments to the market, to the point that Mike made earlier, moved to cloud for all of the advantages that Mike described. We also kind of opened the aperture on cloud to support larger companies where we moved kind of, as you noted, the user limit increase from 2,000 to 5,000 for JIRA Software. And Confluence, Confluence as we do that, it will open up the opportunity for larger customers to move. The data center business continues to grow for companies that, for reasons that they're choosing, want to remain on server but run our products at scale to support thousands to tens of thousands of users. And so I think the way we think about server and cloud still is celebrating the choice of a customer to run the product where it best fits them but provide incredible value in both server and cloud to support where they want to go and where they want to move to. And then can you give us some color on what the reaction has been from your installed base on the OpsGenie acquisition? And I guess, given the price reduction, are you already starting to see transaction volume move significantly higher? Or is there some time needed to digest the offering? Derrick, well, we've been -- it's Scott here. We've been very pleased with the response to all the things we've done. We've acquired OpsGenie. We've rebranded and we changed pricing. We put advertising dollars behind it. We've improved the integration to the rest of our products. So we've been happy with all the results that have come from all those things. We do have examples of many people in the base who have moved from competitive products to OpsGenie purely on the basis of our acquisition and knowing that the increased integrations will come over time. So we're already seeing some of that earlier on. And so overall, we're very happy with how that's working out. The next question comes from Jack Andrews with Needham & Company. It's Khanh Ngo filling in for Jack today. It seems that a majority of the IT first responders are still relying on legacy tools like Excel to manage their loading system. So what gets IT users to shift behavior to next-gen tools like OpsGenie? And how far away are we from seeing like a critical mass of users rely on software to automate their loading processes? I'll take that again. It's Scott here. Look, we've experienced this over a long time. The majority of people 10 years ago were using spreadsheets to manage their software development process too. And as people had to move at a faster pace, those people have to be more collaborative, we see the shift to tools dedicated to this purpose. And we'll see that. We are seeing that today with, I think, first responders. There's a large number out there. And as you have to be more -- if you have to be quicker in response as you have to run more cloud services and increasingly, you become more of a software company, bringing software to your customers, those things need to change. And so I would say there's two areas of this.
One area is still moving from spreadsheets. Obviously, that's a huge opportunity for certain people that just aren't first responders today. Many corporate IT, they don't make change very often. They'll release once a quarter or once a year. Internally, it's a very convoluted release process been on in public cloud. And then as a result, when things don't change, they break away frequently. But we all know that these days the pace of change in the environment is increasing. People are using cloud products. And so whether you're internal IT teams or you're producing software for your customers, that pace of change means that you're releasing more often, you're going to have more downtime. And all those things drive the need for products like OpsGenie to help responders. So our views is like there's a lot of different areas that are going to be growth opportunities here not -- even for people that aren't using spreadsheets today. Okay, that makes sense. And as the features and integrations between Jira Ops and OpsGenie kind of converge, how does messaging around IT change? Do you guys go to the -- try to solve more of a platform solution, kind of emphasizing the synergies that having multiple products bring to the IT user? Yes, that's a really great question. We've now been known for 15 years now of being amazing for software teams and providing all the products that software teams need to get their jobs done from Confluence that handles requirements and documentation all the way through. And over time, we've seen IT teams start adopting those products as well, particularly in the software business but also the JIRA Service Desk across their help desk environment. They'll use Confluence, IT run sheets and run books. So we've had a deep presence in IT for a long time, but what we're seeing now is as we provide more of a solution, we're becoming more of a trusted vendor at a high level of the organization, COOs and down. So we now also are seen as a trusted vendor to provide most, if not, all of what they need in their IT teams. So that's the sort of market shift that we're seeing at the moment. [Operator Instructions]. The next question comes from Patrick Walravens with JMP Securities. Can I step back and ask how you guys think about when you should build it yourself and when you should buy it? And maybe you can use OpsGenie as an example. I'll take that one. Scott here. We have a strong bias to building things. We've got a long history of building -- bringing products to market. We brought Bitbucket server to market. We brought Confluence, JIRA, JIRA Service Desk, Jira Ops. There's a lot of products we bring to market. So that's our strong preference. We also have -- beyond that, if we -- the time-to-market aspect is really the reason we would opt to bring something in, where we want to move faster or there's an existing product out there. We also have a very strong marketplace. And where there's an existing solution in the marketplace, where we believe it's something core to our customers, we'd lean towards acquiring something from the marketplace rather than trying to compete with them. So we sort have a preference there to make things rather than competing with our marketplace. And then down towards that, yes, there's a time-to-market area, we will move to acquire something. On the acquisition side, we've got a very strong track record of success there in terms of products and making sure that they're successful inside the organization. And that comes from our strong bias on acquiring companies that have a strong cultural fit with Atlassian, a strong business model fit in terms of bringing high-volume, well-priced products and also having a fit with our customer base. And OpsGenie fits -- OpsGenie specifically, that fits very strong in all three of those, great cultural fit, perfect business model alignment and fits right into the customer base and the next thing they need to buy. And do you guys have -- are there still major gaps sort of functionally for IT ops? Or do you have most of what you need now? I'd say that's an interesting question. I'd say we provide a huge amount of what IT do today. So if I think internally the areas we're focused on, one is that we're changing that perception. So people do turn to us and will choose stable products and see what we already have to serve them. But we are also building and investing. We have a huge R&D investment to tackle the areas we don't have at the moment, and some of those are very small adjacencies on top of the platforms we already got. And you see with JIRA, we -- JIRA, we got this incredible platform in JIRA that handles all the workflow. And often is the case of just targeting specific workflows, I'd say, on top of the platform that we've already built. Okay, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to the management team for any closing remarks. Thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. We appreciate the time and look forward to keeping you updated on our progress. Thanks a lot. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

Thank you for joining Atlassian's Earnings Conference Call for the third quarter of fiscal 2019. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of Atlassian's website following this call.
I’ll now hand the call over to Ian Lee, Atlassian's Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Good afternoon, and welcome to Atlassian's third quarter fiscal 2019 earnings conference call. On the call today with us, Atlassian's Co-Founders and Co-CEOs, Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes; our Chief Financial Officer, James Beer; and our President, Jay Simons.
Earlier today, we issued a press release and a shareholder letter with our financial results and commentary for our third quarter of fiscal 2019. These items also posted on the Investor Relations section of Atlassian's website at investors.atlassian.com. On our website, there is also an accompanying presentation and data sheet available. We'll make some brief opening remarks and then spend the rest of the call on Q&A.

A reconciliation between IFRS and non-IFRS financial measures is available in our earnings release, our shareholder letter and then now in the updated Investor Data Sheet on our IR website.
I'll now turn the call over to Scott for his brief opening remarks before we move to Q&A. Good day, everyone. Thanks for joining today. We had another great quarter. In Q3, we achieved $309 million in revenue, up 38% year-on-year and also generated more than $127 million of free cash flow. Last week, we got to share many of our written product innovations and announcement at one of our favorite events of year, Atlassian Summit, our flagship user conference. This was our 12th Summit and the first time we've held it in Las Vegas.
When Mike and I had our first Summit 10 years ago, we could barely attract few hundred people, so it's both humbling and awesome to see almost 5,000 people join this year. We shared some of the biggest products announcements in our shareholder letter. Now they are too many to list, but I'll just remind a few.
We launched Premium versions of Jira Software and Confluence in the cloud. We shared a number of new cloud features such as the introduction of Encryption at Rest and the early access launch of support for 10,000 users. We welcomed AgileCraft, the newest member of the Atlassian family and rebranded as Jira Align.
And we showcased Jira Software 8 Server and Data Center and even faster and more powerful version of Jira for our on-premises customers. I particularly like to thank those of you who are able to attend our Investor session at Summit. It was great to see so many of you there in person and see your enthusiasm for Atlassian.
Both Mike and I and the team here appreciate your continued support, and we look forward to chatting again soon.
With that, I'll pass to the operator for Q&A. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Okay. Thank you very much, and good afternoon, gentlemen. Maybe just to start off, I know that you don't guide to it, but your deferred revenue did come in a fair amount lower than most people were expecting. So I'm just curious how you would frame the impact of prior pull forward activity on billings growth and revenue growth this quarter? Yes. This quarter, you're quite right, when you look at the sequence of deferred revenue, we did see a different pattern emerging and this is very much driven by what we talked about last quarter, where in Q2 we saw relatively robust deferred revenue as various customers stepped in front of the price increases that we had announced in the middle part of September last year and that drove an unusual level of activity in Q2.
And so, of course, that activity was drawing from quarters such as Q3 and the fact we think that we will also draw some activity from quarters into the future as well. So, it's very much driven by that moving forward of activity into Q2, driven by customers reacting to price increases that were about to come into play. Okay. Thank you, James. And then just to clarify, are you seeing or have you seen any underlying changes to demand for any of your products or across any of your geos? Well, we've been pleased by the underlying strength. If you look at the subscription line for example, it reflects nice ongoing strength year-over-year, particularly right across our cloud products and, of course, the data center business is accounted for within that line as well and that continues to grow as well. Okay. And then just one last quick one, if I may. Given that you closed the Opsgenie acquisition about six months ago and significantly lowered the price points almost immediately after, I'm just curious to get your thoughts on what you've seen around demand elasticity for that product so far? Thank you. It's Scott here. I'll talk about that. Well, Gregg, yes, eventually we closed Opsgenie, that's in a space we're excited about the natural adjacency to the products that we have today. And we've had a history of pricing our products aggressively to make sure we capture that market share out there and we've done that from the various - with Jira and Confluence, and we've done that with other products since, you continue to see us do that, we think it's a very nice end market and at this stage we're off to capturing market share versus maximizing any individual customer. We know that happens a lot wider as you get a larger customer base. Okay, terrific. Thanks very much. The next question comes from Nikolay Beliov of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Hey, gents, just to follow-up on your comment about the draw forward from 3Q and forward quarters. I would imagine the draw forward from quarters after 3Q will be significant less than the impact in 3Q, correct? Well, I would expect it to be a lower impact as each quarter goes by. Recall when we were doing the call 90 days ago, we noted the pull-forward activity included some multi-year renewal activity. In fact, you saw that quite clearly in the sequential trend of long-term deferred revenue. So there will be a tail to this feature, but I would expect that as each quarter goes by it, it naturally diminishes somewhat. Got it. And you announced the pricing of the Premium addition, Jira Software is 2x higher than the current editions more or less the same for Confluence. Can you describe the genesis of Premium and what do you think the addressable audience is going to [indiscernible] as proportion of the business? Hi, Nikolay. Yes, sure. It's Mike here. I can talk to that. Look, as our cloud offering continues to grow, as we said, we now clocked 100,000 cloud customers. You necessarily start getting more advanced customers with advance used cases that need more specific functionality to tailor to their use case and that's really the genesis of Premium.
We've always tried to be very customer [labor] [ph] in introducing new offerings or additions and Premium is no different as we get advanced Jira Software and Confluence customers in that 100,000 that continue to push the envelope of what they require. That's where the Premium comes from. You're right about the pricing. Obviously, we've only just opened the Early Access Program last week, so more to come about how that's going, very, very early days. Thank you. The next question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Hi, guys. A couple of questions from me. First on the OpEx guidance, I guess the operating margin guidance for the next quarter, James, it implies a significant increase in OpEx now, maybe you can kind of dig into that, what's behind us. I'm looking – last couple of years, the implied increase here is more than double what it was in the two previous years, so any color you can give us on that? Yes, sure. So again, last quarter we talked about the fact that we were going to expect to see lower operating margins in the back half of the year versus those that we recorded in the front half, and that was very much driven by our focus on building up our recruiting engine and thereby driving more new employees joining the company. In fact, that's very much what you've seen. You see that in the Q3 data that we've put out just now.
And we've been doing that, because we very much like the opportunities that we see in front of us, particularly around cloud platform, around cloud products, the IT area in particular. We've talked about quite a bit over the last few calls and of course, the data center area is another important area of investment for us for the coming years. So, that's very much playing through as we expected.
Now, since we were doing this call 90 days ago, of course, we've also announced the acquisition of AgileCraft. When we did that, we noted that there would be some operating margin impact. Now we expect that to be about half a margin point in our Q4 results. Now remember, of course, that that includes the effect of the deferred revenue haircut.
So it's not reflecting the ongoing run rate of AgileCraft, because of that deferred revenue haircut, because the expenses don't get haircut there, it's just the revenue side of the equation, the deferred revenue that gets haircut. So it's really those things that are driving the operating margin story. Very good. Very helpful. Just follow-up on this. In 2016, in your fourth fiscal quarter of 2016 and 2017, you had a similar impact where your margins dropped in the fourth quarter, but you have rebounded fairly quickly within one or two quarters, you're pretty much back to your historical levels, should we think about the same pattern this time around, or you think this investment cycle will be a little bit more sustained this time around? Well, I would just say, obviously, we'll do our annual guide on the next of these calls. I'd just say that we continue to see a lot of margin leverage in the model over time. I talked last week when we were in Las Vegas about us continuing to plan for modest levels of margin increases over time. Got it. Very good. Good luck guys. Thanks. The next question comes from Bhavan Suri with William Blair. Please go ahead. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking for my question. I guess I just wanted to touch sort of strategically on the approach you have with Opsgenie and Align. As you think about them, their higher price and typically the strategy have been lowest price best products. When you think about the low touch go-to-market motion, I guess as you think about the higher priced products, do they need more hands on selling and so you think about sort of the investment in enterprise advocates.
Is that part of what's going on here or do you think these are products that you can get away with selling barely despite the higher price point. I'm just trying to understand how that go-to-market motion works for something that's competitively priced versus things like Jira, which is still sort of substantially lower priced than competitors? It's Scott. I’ll take had the first part in terms of the strategic side and Jay can talk more about the go-to-market motion. Firstly, again, Opsgenie, we don't think is a high-priced product. We think it's a – compared to its peers it's very competitively priced. If you look at and sort of, where we – the price like Jira is becoming the standard really for work across all the new development teams and software and increasingly across all enterprises, and when you have that you then look what other problems the customers have around this and how do you fulfill them.
For Jira Align, that's the case that people are trying to grapple with digital transformation at large-scale and [indiscernible] 1,000 people, 10,000 people. Jira is my standard for work, but I need a way of making sure that that work is tied up to the strategic objectives of the company. And so that's where Jira Align comes in.
Opsgenie is, you find developers and ops people these days are on-call, because they have to deliver cloud products and always on products and so they’re increasingly on-call. And then so for each of these, we look at what is the market for them and what’s the customer base.
In many cases, Jira Align, it will be targeted at the larger customer base. Not in every one of our 170,000 customers will want Jira Align, it's only the very large customers, and so you price according to kind of the market size there. We don't have a significant change to go-to-market there. I will let Jay talk more specifically to that. The only thing I would add is I think with Opsgenie we land as efficiently as we do with all of the other products in the portfolio and then the price point gives us kind of expansion leverage over time. The one thing that Scott didn't mention is that channel is really important leverage point for its sales.
And so we have 550 solution partners around the world, typically not focused on landing necessarily, but where we have landed and there is expansion opportunity either with something like Opsgenie or the rest of the portfolio or with something like AgileCraft, it's a natural expansion point from an established existing Jira Software customer at scale. The channel is basically our sales strategy largely. Sure, Jay thanks. I guess a quick follow-up on the channel. So if you think about it, you look at guys like C1, [Prism] [ph], some of your larger platinum partners and you think about what they were selling or bringing to the table with Jira as your Service Desk, et cetera and now, sort of, you think about the greater focus with IT?
I guess, how does that impact the channel partners, and sort of what's been the initial feedback from them? Are they excited about, sort of, Opsgenie and the various pieces of it versus IT or is that a new sort of channel you sort of cultivate as you go into that given few quarters into that focus on IT. Yes. I mean, I'm super excited. Remember that IT has been our primary selling point for even something like Jira Software and the Fortune 500,000 IT is sort of the port of call that the channel is engaging with to expand the usage of Jira Software across the business. They're super excited about things like Opsgenie and JIRA Service Desk and AgileCraft, I mean, our Jira Align, all the things that we are basically adding to the portfolio, I think, are really [meaty] [ph] for them and where they already placed to help customers expand the usage of the Atlassian. Great. Thanks for the color, guys. The next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Yes. Thank you. I was wondering if we could go back to the commentary about the pull forward from last quarter. So I mean I know you guys don't guide to deferred and obviously we're all kind of trying to guess where you are going to come in at, but there was about $10 million of upside last quarter and you guys kind of mentioned, if you normalize for that, that's what the true number was ex the pull forward?
And I guess you were talking about on the long-term deferred side there, but like this quarter, short-term deferred was impacted by $10 million versus where consensus is. I'm trying to get a sense for your comments, James, about how it's going to continue to get impacted, because aren't you having contracts that are renewing in period now, that are at the higher price points. So that should be offsetting the amount of the pull forward from what's over a quarter ago now. I'm just trying to think through that impact and the offset for the higher prices. Yes, that's right, Heather. I mean, we are obviously now starting to see the impact of the higher prices rolling through on the server side and in the areas of the cloud business where we raise prices. So, yes, there is a variety of layers to this, if you will. And just going back to something I started off the call in Q2 commenting on, this is in part why we're very much focused on revenue as our primary topline metric.
We talked in Las Vegas about very high recurring revenue percentage of our total revenue in the mid-80s percent and then also the fact that predominantly our businesses is sold either in a one-year manner or on the cloud side, now over 75% on a monthly basis. So we very much look at revenue as the way to really assess our business over the long-term in terms of customer-related activity. And, yes, there will be some effect from deferred revenue added into the future, but that will subside as each quarter goes by. So is there any clarity you can help give us just so we can try and minimize kind of – or I guess help us think about the sequential impact on deferred revenue for the June quarter, kind of, parsing your comments that there still going to be a slight headwind. I mean, I don't think any of us want to try and set a high bar for you guys, but it's kind of hard without any more clarity than spend just some of the free things that you're using and I'm also looking at the fact that you guys also have a relatively – if you look at your billings comp next quarter, I think that's harder given we're all thinking about the billings growth rate. Heather, I would just get back to that. Obviously we've guided revenue and then on the deferred revenue side, I think if you look at both the sequential trend last year and then this year for both short-term and long-term deferred revenue, you can see the additional pull forward activity that happened in fiscal 2019 versus in fiscal 2018. And so, I think, while there are a variety of these overlapping type issues that drive the end result, I think that gives you some sense as to how things will play out. So just to be clear, if we look at last year in Q4, you had a 10% sequential growth rate on your short-term deferred and 7% for long-term, you've been running below the seasonality that you posted last year, you're saying we should assume that you continue to run below your seasonality in Q4. And does that normalize then in fiscal 2020, should we think about it that way? Well, I just try one last comment on this. I would describe the pull forward activity that occurred in this fiscal year as greater than that occurred in the previous fiscal year. And so again, you can get us pretty reasonable sense for that by looking at the sequential trend in deferred revenue. Okay. So I think I’ll just leave it at that. Okay, thank you. The next question comes from Michael Turits with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Hey, guys. I think this comes back to Bhavan's question a bit. When you talked about the increased pace of hiring, how much of that is also an increased pace on the sales side? You talked about having 25 enterprise advocates at this point, you get 19 a little over a year and a half ago for whatever reason whether because of more complex sales, more sales up towards IT and top management, is that driving an acceleration in sales headcount growth as well? Hey, Michael, it's Jay. No, not materially. I mean its nominal hiring in the enterprise advocate group. There's other hiring that we do in our field operations group to support the channel, which is where we get most of our sales leverage. Okay. And then just one quick one for James. You talked about that increase in duration last quarter, logical ahead – as part of the pull forward dynamic. Is there any of that still going on that survived past the pull forward that was primarily last quarter, prior quarter? Yes, the pull forward occurred in Q2, not in Q3. Right. In other words, as the duration go back down again from your perspective and so is associated with the pull-forward? Was there anything remaining there? Yes. And that we’ve very much related to normal cause activity. Now with that pull forward activity of Q2 is behind. Okay. Thanks very much guys. The next question comes from Derrick Wood with Cowen. Please go ahead. All right, great. Thanks. I had a question on the geographic growth. It looks like sequential growth in EMEA, and APAC was lower than Americas, which – the Americas are quite strong, but EMEA did – and they had a bigger quarter in December, maybe there’s more pull-forward effects there. But could you speak to some of the dynamics going on there internationally and why maybe that EMEA numbers stand more volatile and Americas has been similar? Yes. The EMEA growth rates, I think you can track very much along to this pull forward point that we've been discussing because it was – there that we have – about half of our channel partners and those channel partners were very organized, anticipating the price increase announcements that came in September of 2018.
And so they were an important part of how that whole pull forward dynamic played out. Therefore, the EMEA growth rate in Q2 is very strong and you're seeing a smaller growth rate in Q3 because of that activity being pulled forward. Okay. And in the shareholder letter, you talked about half of the attendees in Summit were from IT and I'm just curious, would you say that that's been driven by the Opsgenie acquisition or just more increase in interest and core products like Jira Ops, JIRA Service Desk? And then, I guess, as a follow-up, when you do land in IT or do you see any difference in deal sizes versus landing in developer products? Thanks. Yes. It's Mike. I can take that. Look, it's – I wouldn't say it's driven by the Opsgenie acquisition, although obviously that helps accelerate things. Landing in IT is something we've been doing for 10,15 years depending on where the software team is and as we continue to broaden out, Service Desk is probably what, four or five years old now, Confluence has landed very solidly in IT teams for well over a decade.
So it's just continued momentum behind that. We are increasingly seen as a partner to IT at an Uber brand level, at the Atlassian level, in the ways that we help IT in lots of different scenarios, whether that be managing the documentation needs in Confluence across to all of the SM needs and services we can help them with. And obviously that including DevOps and the continued movements there with Opsgenie and other things.
And obviously Jira Software and Jira Core being pretty key pieces of how IT can run all sorts of processes. So I'd say it's just a continued rise, there's no massive change in that focus with Opsgenie. Okay. And any comment on deal sizes, difference with landing with IT versus software developer led deal? No comment on deal sizes being too really different, no. Okay. Thank you. The next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead. Hi. Thank you very much. I had one question, then a clarification, if I could. And the question relates to the cloud Premium available for Jira Software and Confluence. Assuming that the Premium notion gets spread into other categories, does this you think lessen the impact of price changes and what I mean by that is really, A, Atlassian's benefited from price increases, I think, over the past years; in other words, it's been an inelastic pricing curve. And does it, B, perhaps, lessen the impact of the pull-forwards and whatnot that you experienced last quarter and the reverse of that? So I'm just trying to understand, philosophically, the notion of increasing the Premium SKUs, if you will? Do you think it creates less upside in aggregate to the revenue line item and/or impact to what we characterize the seasonality surrounding the price increases? And I have a quick follow-up. Yes. Thanks, Keith. Look, it's worth noting we already have the Bitbucket Premium and have had for, I believe, a year or more on the Bitbucket side of things and obviously Trello and Opsgenie both have addition based pricing. So in a way Jira Software and Confluence, they are just coming into line with other things we already have and obviously have to learned from and understand how those additions pricing works in the cloud.
Philosophically, it's no different than our long history of, I guess, price optimization. Again, I'd say, philosophically, we always like to deliver usage for full value. We'd like to make sure the customers use the product first and then purchases it second, and that's no different with the Premium additions and no different with the cloud. We obviously know a lot more about the customer base in the cloud, and so it can be more precise with our pricing and pricing movements, I suppose.
And at the same time, you've seen us as we talked about at the Analyst Day last week reducing a lot of prices at the same time, for example Opsgenie and JIRA Service Desk, where we believe the market size is still significantly larger than where we are and we have a much larger opportunity in perhaps how competitors view the market size. So, we just continue to be thoughtful about pricing. Okay. Fair enough. Thank you. My quick follow-up is on Align. Obviously, last week there seem to be a lot of interest in Align from your customers and partners and even investors, I was just wondering if you could give us any directional barometers about how we should be thinking about the revenue impact.
You've done that before with Trello and I understand there's a lot of deferred write-off, but it's just hard to understand how we should think about the impact, even if we just look at the next fiscal year. Is there any categorization or growth rates or dollar potential ranges of impact that you could give us to help us tune our models a bit? Well, we've noted that for the current quarter, Q4, we'd expect about $1 million to $2 million of revenue from AgileCraft and that's of course after the effects of the deferred revenue haircut and that haircut effect stays in place for three to four quarters directionally. So obviously, we are excited about the market there. We feel as though it has a lot of potential for us to continue to build-out our impact, particularly larger organizations, but we're not offering a particular steer on the AgileCraft of Jira Align revenue for fiscal 2020. Okay. All right. Thank you. The next question comes from John DiFucci with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Thank you. I believe most of my question has been asked, but just a quick follow-up to that to Keith. I guess, James, you said that AgileCraft is going to be dilutive to margins by 50 basis points this year, and I think you said that for fiscal 2020 that – it was also going to have a diluted impact. I mean, could you give us any help with that, like it will be more dilutive or less dilutive than the 50 basis points. I mean it really dependable how much investment you're going to do over time; I realize that, but just... Yes, John. As you pointed out, we noted when we announced AgileCraft that we would see non-IFRS operating margin dilution in fiscal 2020. Now, obviously, again, that deferred revenue impact starts to trail away once you get into the back half of fiscal 2020. So if you look in contrast to that with the operating margin, non-IFRS operating margin impact that it has on Q4 of this year, I would certainly be expecting that headwind to subside as the quarters of fiscal 2020 go by. Okay. That's very clear. Thank you very much. Okay. The next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Thanks a lot. Thank you guys for taking question. I think most of my questions have been asked, but I guess on the theme of, sort of the acquisitions. For Opsgenie, it's been sort of six months on board already, any kind of indication you can give us on how it's been tracking versus your expectations? And I'm assuming you are not going to give us a sort of a revenue number, what the contribution or what the user number of the contribution is, but any sense you could give us on how that's started to sort of ramp up in terms of contribution into the results. Keith, Scott here, I'll take that one. [Indiscernible] as you pointed out, we're pretty proud. We just – at the summer, we launched the integration with the management, so that allows us to pull users from our products into – from one product to the other seamlessly. We just announced that we've unified the UI, so that makes a lot easier for our users to move from one to the other and sort of maintain their mental context of where they are.
So those things only happened last week. But we did – as has been with the Atlassian brand – ahead of those things, the Atlassian brands, the pricing changes and other things we've done inside Opsgenie have materially improved the run rate as a standalone company and we're really happy with how that is playing out and we expected to further improve as we bring them into the product set. Got it. And then maybe one follow-up for James. Understanding that M&A is a big part of, sort of the operating margin pressure that you guys see in the fourth quarter, but like you said you have stepped up hiring a lot. Can you give us any kind of visibility or any kind of granularity into what are some of the core areas of hiring? What are the core areas of investment you guys have – heading into core that's taken place in Q3 and into Q4? Yes. The focus around our hiring is largely on the R&D side. It talks about our focused investments in the cloud platform and our cloud products in particular and the office that is growing the fastest is the Bengaluru office. And so, really that's the primary focus – is the R&D area. Got it. That's super helpful. Thank you so much. The next question comes from Gray Powell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Great. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe on the product side, at the Analyst Day you flagged 7,500 server customers that have over 500 users that could be candidates for the Data Center offering. I'm just curious, what's the normal catalysts for the customer to upgrade? And how fast do you think you could convert those customers? Yes. Hey, Gray, this is Jay. So the 7,500 were our server customers that had at least one product with over 500 users of server. And so, it didn't include the cloud population. And what we clarified in that slide is that is the population that continues to grow by the way that we can upgrade to data center and try to upgrade the data center. That is also the same population that will potentially move over to the Cloud and Cloud Premium that we announced at Summit.
And so there's two kind of upgrade paths from just the standard server that they're using. The upgrade path to data center from server tends to be the message around data center, there's a bunch of features that are built to support large mission critical scale to scale the usage of the products. And so better performance, better reliability and architecture that allows the proxy to be deployed in a high availability fault-tolerant way and then additional capabilities for administrators to do upgrades without bringing the system down.
And so if you're supporting 500 employees that use it every day of – in every minute of every day, those kinds of capabilities are worth upgrading for. And the naturally the upgrade to cloud, you get a bunch of those things provided as part of the cloud service. Got it. Okay. Thank you very much. The next question comes from Rishi Jaluria with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Mostly it's going to be follow-ups on earlier questions. First James, wanted to clarify your earlier comments on the OpEx and operating margin side. It sounds like excluding AgileCraft, your margin guidance and OpEx guidance for the year would have been consistent with what you've guided on the previous earnings call. Is that a fair statement? That is correct. Okay, thanks. That's helpful. And then, on the EMEA side, I know we talked about the channel partners and some pulling forward of deals, were there any other factors for why EMEA was flat or even slightly down sequentially. Were there any macro factors? Was there FX that drove that? No, nothing material. Okay, thanks. And then now turning to the Cloud Premiums SKU, just wanted to kind of go into what the addressable portion of the customer base looks like. So if there's round numbers of 100,000 cloud customers, what proportion of those are addressable for a conversion from cloud to Cloud Premium SKU? Yes. Obviously we – its Mike here, sorry, Rishi, look obviously bullish about cloud Premium and its prospects. We are not disclosing what we think the proportion would be at the moment, but also it's a bit of a learning exercise for us.
Obviously, we believe that strong customer demand base for the offering among those advanced teams. It's worth noting that Premium is not necessarily about large customers as much as advanced users, advanced team.
So you can be a 50 user cloud customer in need of these capabilities and you can be a 500 user cloud customer and not use these capabilities, because your usage of the product is not at that advanced level yet. So we have to learn those levels a little bit ourselves, but obviously we've done a lot of research to release these, a lot of customer testing and we are bullish about the prospects for both. Got it. Thanks. And then last one for me, and I'll jump out. But going back to AgileCraft and kind of the margin impact, I guess, mainly – I understand there is accounting treatment with deferred revenue write-down, should there be a similar impact on the cash flow margin front as we are seeing on the non-IFRS operating margin front and I think more importantly, would that same kind of dynamic play out next year? Thanks. Well, you would obviously get a different dynamic around the cash flow margin as opposed to the accounting margin. The accounting margin is significantly impacted by this deferred revenue haircut that we've been talking about. It's early, obviously, in the growth of AgileCraft and we have very robust margins at Atlassian.
So the focus here, I think is on the market opportunity, the scale of it and I'll just note how in Q4 here we're guiding to an increased free cash flow amounts. So we've moved that guide up by $15 million at both the north and south end of the range. Got it. Thank you so much. Your next question comes from Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. Please go ahead. Great. Thank you. I guess, I have two questions related to the acquisitions. The first one is, when you acquire a company like AgileCraft or Opsgenie that had traditional salespeople, what you do with them in the integrations going forward? Do they remain in that role or do you transition into something else? Hey, Pat, it's Jay. So in both cases, they had relatively small sales teams. And in Opsgenie's case, the sales function worked very similar to the enterprise advocate function, where we're landing with Opsgenie, with the efficiency that is very similar to Atlassian and then we have direct teams and our channel that can focus on expanding that customer up through Premium in more and more valuable versions of both the customer and to us of the product that they've chosen.
AgileCraft is a little different, where they have a small sales team, they focus on larger accounts and the way that will scale the sales coverage is again through the channel. And so most of the channel is already implanted in our largest customers, because they've supported the expansion of Jira Software, which is kind of the bedrock data source that feeds into Jira Align, AgileCraft once customers take that and that's basically where we're going to get a lot of leverage in continuing to grow and expanding their business. All right. That's great. Thanks, Jay. And so I think the follow-up will be for you too. So as we were walking around and talking to the solutions consultants and people at the conference, there was a lot of excitement about Opsgenie in particular, but when you drill down on it, I would say that the knowledge base isn't there yet for a lot of those solutions consultants, how you educate them? How do we educate the partners? Yes, your partners about Opsgenie. Yes. So we have an enablement organization that basically focused on equipping the channel with education on what the products do and material to help them sell and we co-market with them through development fund, that's sort of ongoing. We have twice a year, relatively large channel kickoffs, channel field events both in Europe and in the U.S., it kind of galvanize the channel around the biggest opportunities for us and for them. And do you feel like you're there or does that take awhile? I mean, it's ongoing. It's ongoing. I mean, Summit is also a big activation point for a lot of the channel because most of our largest and most active channel partners are there in the Expo Hall, you're probably talked to a bunch of them. And so we actually had Partner Day that preceded Summit, which is a big rallying point for all those things that we want them to focus on over the next six months. All right. Great. Thanks very much. [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Jonathan Kees with Summit Insights Group. Please go ahead. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to ask about the segmentation for the products, specifically the marketplace. It grew 36% in the quarter and I guess that's part of the trend. I've been noticing in my model here that it's been decelerating and this is the first quarter in which it's actually growing not as fast as the company average.
I'm kind of surprised, because at Summit there was lot of apps there that were in display, as well as a couple of quarters ago you announced a lot of apps that are going to be made available for the data center. So just trying to understand there in terms of – this is part of just an overall trend or is there just less promotion going on or what's going on with that? We continue to be very pleased with the marketplace, it's an important part of our overall ecosystem and remember that again in Q2 we talked about the fact that there was some pull-forward activity around marketplace, so other revenue because when we take our portion of an app vendors sale that drops immediately into the other revenue line, because we don't have any ongoing obligation to deliver. So you have that immediate revenue recognition. So that was another illustration of this pull-forward topic that we've been talking about on this call. Okay. All right. So in terms of the growth rate, it sounds like you're sort of pleased with it and just it will be up and down, especially around where there's pull-throughs for pricing increases? I think that's a reasonable way to think about it, yes. Okay. All right. Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mike Cannon-Brookes for any closing remarks. Thanks, everyone. Thanks very much for joining our call today. We truly appreciate your time and look forward to keeping you updated on our progress going forward. Have a great day. The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

I will now turn the call over to Mike for opening remarks before we move to Q&A. Good day, everyone. Thanks for joining today. Fiscal 2019 was another outstanding year for Atlassian. We surpassed the 150,000 customers and exceeded the $1 billion revenue mark for the first time in a fiscal year. We achieved this while generating more than $400 million in free cash flow during the year. I am incredibly proud of the work of more than 3600 Atlassians who come together each day to build the great products that our customers love.
Our customers have always been our guiding light. Over the past 17 years, our commitment to these customers has led us to make pragmatic decisions about the evolution of Atlassian and our products. Today, that’s leading us towards the cloud. Demand for our cloud products is increasing both from new customers and from existing customers using our on-premises products.
It’s natural that the cloud is our primary focus and the key driver of our growth. In fiscal 2020, we will continue to invest deeply in improving and expanding our cloud offerings and platforms. We will also be investing to serve larger customers in the cloud, as well as to accelerate the pace of migration of server and datacenter customers to our cloud.
Our pricing and packaging strategies will be vastly aligned with these goals. Scott and I have always been focused on driving sustainable growth over the long-term. Our increasing cloud focus supports this long-term view. In James’ section of the shareholder letter, we outlined the financial implications of our cloud strategies in fiscal 2020 and we encourage you to read his commentary.
And with that, I will pass the call over to the operator for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Bhavan Suri with William Blair. Please go ahead. Hey guys, it’s actually on for Bhavan. Just wanted to start off with the premium model that you talked about in the shareholder letter. It seems like this is a nice shift to the strategy. Just wondering why this is a right time to go premium in the cloud first, specific cloud products. And then what do you think is the benefit over offering a one week or a one month trial for customers? Hey, Arjun. It’s Mike. I can take that. Sure. I guess, I would start by saying it’s, firstly it’s not really a shift in the strategy. We have free versions of a whole series of cloud products today. And we have always tried philosophically to have the lowest entry point price that we can. A lot of our cloud investments over the last couple of years have made this possible.
So this is sort of the – from that point of view the combination of a longer term journey in the cloud. We have always tried to get to get off to the Fortune 500,000. We’ve got to have as many on-rents as possible to get customers onboard as frictionless as possible at the low end.
And then, we deliver them value in terms of the products and then as they grow they will start to become customers. That’s always been our pricing desire. So this is just another step on that journey in terms of getting after the Fortune 500,000. Great. Thanks. And then, maybe a quick follow-up. But just trying to get a better understanding of where customers are in the migration path, especially larger customers from server or on-premise to cloud? Is this something that your larger customers have planned already? Or are we still too early for that and something you expect to play out over the next few years here? Hey, Arjun. It’s Jay. It’s been playing out over a while. I think the signal that we articulated in the letter is that we are seeing increasing demand from a lot of on-premise customers many even larger to consider moving to the cloud. And that’s been ongoing and we anticipate it will be ongoing.
And maybe, there is a couple of great examples of, like really large U.S.-based assets firm that’s beginning to plan a move to the cloud and that’s a large existing server customer that has 8,000 users of JIRA and 10,000 users of Confluence and on the other side of that cloud journey, they can anticipate taking it up to 15,000 users.
There is a large European acrylic clothing manufacturer that’s going through the same journey. And a lot of the catalysts for it is just the broad secularship that’s been happening around us in the market where 90% of new customers are in the cloud.
But a lot of it is these large customers see the investments that we made in cloud and these advantages that cloud brings them in terms of performance, the ability to have the service managed and update it for them. And then more reliability in some cases. Great. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the quarter. The next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Okay. Thank you very much and good afternoon guys. So, I was at Atlassian few months ago where you offered all attendees up to 2000 free cloud software licenses to accompany their on-prem licenses. And obviously, it looks like you’ve now opened this offer up to your entire community. And on a matching basis as well.
Would it be fair to conclude that, as a result you seen high levels of interest in activity from that promotion a few months back. Any color kind of around that in terms of what you’ve seen from customers will be helpful? Hey, Gregg. This is Jay. I think it partly was response, it is in response to the lot of interest in the cloud and the goal of just making the journey that customers are considering easier for them. And part of that is in the offer that you mentioned and in the matching cloud trial license that we are offering existing sort of customers so they can begin to plan that migration.
The other component is just the investments that we made in product and migration tooling. I mean we have the migration tooling has come a long way from where we’ve had the opportunity for customers to export and import and now I think some really innovative work in helping them move project-by-project pieces of JIRA and Confluence from their on-prem installations into the cloud.
Being over the broad backdrop of that is in response to where customers are signaling they want to go and our goal is to make that is as smooth and as friction free as possible. All right. That’s really helpful. Thanks, Jay. And then, congrats as well on pitching 150,000 customers and you’ve now provided another long-term goal of more than 100 million active users versus over 10 million cloud MAUs today. And we look forward obviously as track in that progress as you continue to grow.
But my question there is, if you could talk to the investments required in infrastructure and engineers and in acquisitions that you think are required to make this goal a reality. Also, does this require an accelerated multi-year investment in cloud or would you say that you are currently on a good pace from an investment standpoint? Greg. It’s Scott here. I can take that. The investments we are making on the cloud, we’ve been a cloud company for ten years and we are making continued investments in improving our cloud for our customers.
As Mike mentioned earlier, some of the investments around – we talked about which was moving our cloud off our own datacenters into third-party datacenters has allowed us to reduce our COGS. So we can offer a free version. Investments we’ve made in infrastructure and platform have allowed us to bring access and use management product to market.
They’ve also allowed us to get a premium product to market as well. So we made a lot of investments over the time that are paying off now. As Jay mentioned, we are making investments in migrations as mentioned that Confluence we’ve got a great migration tool and we are continuing to improve it. And that’s going really well.
We are investing in JIRA migrations tool as well which we expect to have be similarly successful. And over time, one of the things this year is, going through that journey of migrating customers with some of the largest customers of us to the cloud. And through that, we will – I am sure that we – little things we discover that we will be working with our customers on.
But broadly I don’t see a change in our investment mix in order to do this. It’s more of continuing what we’ve been doing along. Terrific. Thanks very much guys. The next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Heather, are you there? Heather? Operator, could you move to the next question first please? The next question comes from John DiFucci with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Thank you. So, Mike and Scott, you talk about the opportunity to help your customers migrate to the cloud. I guess, given your new name, are there any thoughts around the undersea opportunity? That’s a bad joke. I am really sorry. But, the real question is… We are laughing, John, a lot. The real question is this. Is there a reason that cloud is better for Atlassian, like pricing, stickiness, or is this just doing what customers want which seems to be part of your DNA and part of your success all along or is there something else though that from a financial perspective, cloud would be better than on-premise deployments? So, John, we’ve always been customer lighting what we do and that’s all we have both deployment options at the moment and we are not trying to pushing our customers one way or another from a financial perspective or any other reason. We are very happy with kind of both sides of our business. The demand is there for customers to go to cloud.
I do think that as, when customers are in cloud, it allows us to – you get free to use this information that allows us to be a bit sharper with our R&D investments. It doesn’t shown up in any balance sheet or P&L or anything like that. But it does allow us to kind of build better products quicker.
I mean, it allows us to cross-sell our products easier, because they are on the same system. They can suddenly, we can expose them to – mean to set anything up playing in their environment. So it allows us to do that. From a reality perspective and helping people sign up to products it allows us to effectively and with all the analytics we’ve got, we can make sure that people go through that journey quicker.
I mean, I think we shared in our shareholder letter that the financial results over the long-term are marginally better for us at Atlassian and we feel good about that as well. Okay. That all makes sense. Thank you. The next question comes from Nikolay Beliov of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Hi, this is actually Jacqueline on for Nikolay. Two questions. First, in light of the fiscal 2019 billing seasonality, how should we think about fiscal 2020 billing trajectory? And number two, how do we think about the use cases of the premium edition? Will the channel be involved in selling premium? Jacqueline, I can take the first one. Now, just a reminder obviously, we very much focus much more on revenue than billings and that’s for the fact that it goes deferred revenue is a relatively small part of our overall sales picture, particularly the long-term deferred revenue, because we really don’t enter into very many multi-year contracts at all.
And then when you add to that across the cloud business growing very strongly as we’ve been discussing and more than three quarters of that comes with the monthly subscription. So those are some of the key reasons why we really focus on revenue as opposed to billings. So, as you know, we then guide to billings in fiscal 2020.
But what I would just observe is that, in the last couple of years, the billings pattern has moved around somewhat based on the timing of price increases that we rolled out. So, for example, in fiscal 2019, last year, we announced some price increases in the middle of September.
And so, there, we saw pull forward activity occurring to benefit Q2 and that benefit was pulling activity from the second half of fiscal 2019 and in fact from fiscal 2020 and even beyond that. Now, conversely, in fiscal 2018, we announced price increases a little earlier, right at the start of September.
And in that year, the pull forward benefit was really balanced between both Q1 and Q2 and that benefit was pulling in part from Q2, but then more so from Q3. So that’s really all I would just remind everyone on, obviously we haven’t made any price increase announcements for fiscal 2020. But that gives you a sense for the recent historical pattern and how price increase activity can impact billings by quarter. Hey, Jacqueline, this is Jay. I’ll tap on to the second part of your question. There is two kind of unique components to the premium cloud additions. The first is kind of common across them which are platform capabilities that offer a higher level, higher service and support level and in some cases depend on the product higher storage levels as an example.
The second component is, premium features that really target more advanced and sophisticated users that are specific to the product. And so, roadmaps in JIRA or usage analytics in Confluence are two of the examples. And so, the customers that premium editions target are, can be small and just more sophisticated users, but more often than not will be larger.
So that’s we were talking absolutely the channel is engaged in selling and supporting customers, both upgrading from standard cloud to premium editions, but in many cases just starting with premium. Thank you. The next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Hi, this is Sanjit Singh for Keith Weiss. Congrats on a very strong Q4. I had two questions. The first is on the sort of cloud unit economics if you will. You had a really nice chart in the earnings letter and it basically shows a breakeven time between cloud and server of about two years and about a 40% higher lifetime value.
So, there may be dovetail on John’s question, what do customers get for that for paying that extra 40% over five years? Is it more about the performance scalability? Or some – is there a feature functionality aspect with this as well that gives the maintenance-based customers that nudged over to cloud? Hey, Sanjit, look, from a pure value point of view, the – probably the biggest difference they get is, obviously we are doing all the operations and maintenance of the software for them. So if you think about someone paying a licensing fee they then have to download, have their own server in-house, run their own upgrades, patches, et cetera of the software, that takes time, as well as integrating it, connecting it to other things, administering it, that is a large list that we can take off them.
That’s often well more than the price of the software itself. Obviously, we can provide that at a small uplift over a multi-year period as you said but we can scale that cost across many, many instances, right. Obviously, we are deploying tens of thousands of servers if you want to think about it virtually on a constant basis, we’ve automated all that and we can spread that cost across a lot of customers.
At the same time, they get a better updated, more frequently updated application that should be faster, more secure, more scalable without then having to do anything. That’s the goal of the cloud is that they just sign up with ten users and they can go all the way to 10,000 without really having to think too much about that scale effect.
That’s exactly what we do in R&D and engineering teams to make sure that all haven’t fallen. And obviously any new innovations, all the way through new security patches, get applied instantly. They just appear sort of magically for them. So, it’s a far better offering. It’s generally the premise behind their cloud software. Understood. That’s really helpful. And if I could revisit the pricing strategy question, so for the last two years, I think about two years ago we moved to this cadence of annual price increases and the view was that was going to be more predictable for the customer base to expect that on an annual basis.
It seems like this year is a little bit of an anomaly and I am wondering is this sort of a – should we look at this fiscal year 2020 as a sort of anomaly given the sort of push to cloud and that we revisit that annual price increase on the server base after fiscal year 2020. Or has the cadence on pricing changed with this cloud push? Well, the first thing I’d say, Sanjay, is that, as we think about pricing and packaging, we continue to be very focused on remaining the high value, low price leader. And we have said in the past and continue to believe that, well within that construct have continuing opportunities to make price changes very much commensurate with the value that we are delivering to our customers.
Now, obviously, we’ve been talking quite a bit on this call already about our focus on the cloud and continuing to really bring more and more customers, be they current, via migrations, or new customers into the Atlassian frame.
And so, I would expect that benefits around price increases on the cloud side of our business would probably be less so in fiscal 2020 than was the case in fiscal 2019. Now, again, we haven’t made any announcements about price increases more broadly. But I think that’s a reasonable thing for you to consider. The next question comes from Michael Turits with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Hey guys. Thanks. I think – can you peel down on Gregg Moskowitz’s question about any change in financial impacts required on investments. Just extended to the long run, obviously they are new in the cloud in any cases seems like an acceleration.
But the relative difference we should think this in the long-term is that OpEx or CapEx framework anything that was a previous impacts on gross margins net of CapEx we anticipated, or any grades that we might expect in terms of significant changes over a multi-year period? Yes, so, Michael, as we think about the cloud continuing to become a larger and larger proportion of our overall business, I would expect that to have some impact on our gross margins. You would expect obviously as Mike was pointing out, we are doing all the work of operating the software on behalf of the customer.
And so, you would naturally expect that to be an increase in the proportion of cost of goods sold. And indeed we have in the last couple of years being investing quite significantly in the sort of physical infrastructure to make sure that our cloud customers wherever they are in the world have the sort of response time, reliability that they would look to receive from a cloud services.
But at the same time, I am very pleased with how as we work with AWS, we find significant opportunities to continue to make more efficient usage of the cloud infrastructure. And so, you can expect us to continue to be focusing on that over time.
And then of course, there are other lines embedded within cost of goods sold and areas such as support and we would look to continue to seek efficiencies there as well. And so, it’s a mixture of a variety of effects around gross margin.
Net, net, I’ve been pleased with how we continue to progress on the gross margin line and in terms of capital expenditure, the way our relationship now works with AWS really the capital expenditure related to cloud infrastructure sits with AWS on their balance sheet. And our capital expenditure is very much driven by our own physical facilities around our primary offices.
So, I wouldn’t expect the growth of our cloud business to particularly be driving that CapEx line per se. We will see that effect flow through operating expenditures as we work with AWS. And then, James, a follow-up for you on the guidance of this year and I don’t know as it related to the cloud push or not. But your guidance, margins, op margins is down quite. I assume some of that is from the Agile acquisition and maybe you can specify what’s that impact is.
But if you look at the - from ops, so as it comes down about six points, I understand both from the math again is about two of that $30 million comes from higher taxes, but – and still more impact to cash flow in the next – taxes. Can you specify that for us? Michael, the first thing I would say about margins is, I am very pleased that we’ve been able to grow in fiscal 2019 both the operating margin up a point and the free cash flow margin up 2.9 points year-over-year. And as you know, we’ve been saying how we will continue to look to build our margins, both operating and free cash flow over time.
And so, the guidance that we’ve put out today, as you correctly indicated in your question, on the operating margin line, one of the key impacts there is the acquisition of AgileCraft now branded JIRA Align, because remember that that has a more of a services components to the business model and of course for certainly the first three quarters of fiscal 2020.
We’ll be working through that typical deferred revenue haircut that comes along with an acquisition. So that will particularly impact that. And then on the free cash flow guide, again, you can correctly reference there, a quite sizable swing in cash taxes year-over-year.
So, in fiscal 2019, we actually received $7 million of cash related to taxes. I would expect that to return to much more normal situation in fiscal 2020. And so, net, net between the two years, it will be a swing of around $30 million approximately in cash taxes. So, that will have an appreciable impact on the free cash flow margin.
The other thing I would note on free cash flow margin of course is the capital expenditure. We have indicated it will be $30 million for fiscal 2020. So that will be down quite substantially year-over-year and that just reflects going back to my facilities point, though we’ve worked our way through some of the key facilities projects that we’ve been working on in fiscal 2019, hence a smaller capital expenditure projection for this year. James, we have still the delta, in other words, it’s still coming down a lot more on cash flow margin and you are on EBIT even accounting for the taxes swing. So why don’t you… Yes, the only thing I would further add is, we are coming off on a very strong year on cash flow. And so, again, we would look for these margins to build over time and we had a very strong build in fiscal 2019. Thanks. The next question comes from Alex Kurtz with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Yes, thanks for taking the couple of questions. I was just going to go back to the opportunity around cloud within sort of expansion rates within existing customers.
Could you just kind of outline for us again what you see as far as adoption and expansion rate maybe by users within your larger customers when one customer goes the cloud path and the other one goes the on-prem path? I mean, is there a way to quantify that for us a bit? Alex, this is Scott here. I've already given the specific numbers around that, but I’ll give some adding thoughts that are very exciting for us. We’ve got a growth team here at Atlassian who run a lot of growth experiments, maybe similar to what you see in some consumer type companies and that team has grown pretty substantial over the last year.
And we’ve had some really successful experiments cross-selling I’d say, JIRA into the – Confluence into the JIRA bytes, which is very well overlapping product in server, very well overlapping product in cloud, but because they are running those products in the cloud, we have the opportunity to run these experiments where we can adopt the unifies promote something in product and see if it works before we spend the effort in productionizing it and rolling that to our entire base.
And so we’ve seen that work in those particular pair of products over the last year which is a focus area. We are expanding that to look at other product components in the coming years. And again stuff that we can do in the cloud, we have done in the server, but it’s a lot harder and takes longer to see the returns. Okay, thanks. And the comment in the shareholder letter around the one point of revenue headwind for the year around these changes that you guys have outlined today. Is there some way to kind of outline, is this a base case assumption on the uptick in subscription in cloud?
Is it back-end loaded as far as how you think that that headwind is going to play out during the year? Just any kind of additional context would be helpful. Yes, I would say, obviously, we talked in the letter about that being really three drivers of that one point. So the free editions, the free cloud trials to our current behind the firewall customers and then the revenue recognition mix effect, that mix effect would be occurring throughout the year.
Obviously, the free cloud trials and the free additions that will start to play through as we implement those initiatives. So you will see that come in the fullness of time during the year. Okay, thank you. The next question comes from Jack Andrews with Needham. Please go ahead. Well, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I want to ask kind of a high level question just about your overall product development efforts. I mean, can you shed some light on, I guess, it’s a framework perhaps that you are using for resource allocation.
I mean, you’ve got a lot of things going on in terms besides the push to the cloud, you are introducing net new categories, things like align and in some cases to a new user base. So, I mean, could you just talk about how you're prioritizing spending more time and efforts are some of these other efforts versus adding incremental functions to your existing products.
Is it a way to kind of rank order your product development priorities? Yes, it’s Mike. I can take that. Look, there is no simple and easy way to communicate that. It's I would say it’s something that we spend a lot of time thinking about. We’ve got a lot of history of doing that.
You mentioned a few acquisitions. Obviously, we realize it’s very important to integrate acquisitions in the right timeframe. Sometimes that’s faster, sometimes that’s slower. If you look at something like Trello, we’ve invested a lot in growing a Trello business, but not so much in integrating it in the short-term and not seeing it the opposite way around.
And so we make, I would say, horses for courses decisions depending on what that is. We at the same time do obviously try to lean into the future. So you can see a lot of our resource allocation is going into the cloud while also the same time being practical a about making sure that our on-premises customers get the improvements that they need in those applications.
I would say, we are constantly making decisions on how we move resources around while also at the same time growing. We also have a global problem to constantly mange where resources are around the globe. We have been doing very well in Bengaluru. I was just there couple of weeks ago. We have passed 200 staffs there now in India and continuing to grow really strongly.
And where we put resources around the world and how new those resources are can affect how – what projects we can put into. So, I would say, we are really good at managing that on a global basis now and pretty comfortable with where we sit. But there is no singular framework we use. Well, that’s great perspective and just as a follow-up, is there any update in terms of how you are thinking about the enterprise advocate role at Atlassian? Do you feel you need to add any more resources in this area just given again the emphasis of the cloud, changes in pricing, things like that? Yes, hey, Jack, this is Jay. I mean, we are growing the team and we’ve been growing the team over the past handful of years. There will be a material change, but we’ll continue to add enterprise advocates in sort of direct sales as we attack the opportunity. I think, keep in mind that the business model, I think what makes our business model so powerful is the combination of three things.
This high velocity flywheel that really focuses on enabling customers to self-serve and that just allows us to reach massive global volume of customers that can start easily on their own. That’s number one. And two is, our direct enterprise advocate sales team and they can focus on targeting high value expansion opportunities that exists within our largest customers.
And the third is the channel. And often times, our direct teams are working hand-in-hand with the channel on the expansion opportunities that tend to be accompanied by and service delivery work that the channel is enabled to help with. And that’s what makes it so great. We can land even the largest accounts really efficiently and we create this really fertile ground for our channel and our direct teams to expand from. Got it. Thanks for taking my questions. The next question comes from Derrick Wood with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one, James, it was a little surprising to see maintenance growth actually accelerate this quarter and then on the flip side, a steeper deceleration on subscription growth.
Are there any puts and takes that you’d call out in terms of the revenue mix this quarter? And then, how should we think about how much license and maintenance growth steps down next year as you focus aligning the cloud? Yes, so for Q4, we are pleased with the maintenance growth rates. Obviously, you are starting to see the price increases from really the last couple of years layering into that figure now. On the subscription growth rate, the behind the firewall component of that subscription revenue line had a particularly strong comp back in Q4 of fiscal 2018.
And so that's really what drove the result there in this past quarter. We are continuing to be very pleased with our cloud business, our marketplace business and our datacenter business in terms of growth. As we’ve been discussing now for the couple of years or so, we would expect that gradually over time, the license maintenance side of the business doesn’t grow strongly.
And that you see that flowing through in the strong growth of the subscription growth line that we gave you a steer on the focus for 2020 with growth expected there of greater than 40%. Great. Thanks. And then, I guess more of a product question regarding the new free cloud license for on-premise customers. Can you give us a sense as to how long those customers will get the free license and at what time period they’ll have to start paying added fees for the cloud service? It’s Scott here. The premium model, you know, there is many different way that the companies do that. We have free trials for many of our products and we have premium for many of our products. For the free trials, there are generally couple weeks.
But what we are talking about here is moving many of our products from a free trial approach to a premium approach where there is effectively a speech out or user limited version of our product that are free forever and we found through the experiments we’ve done over a long period of time the fact that we have multiple products, we use different proxy models that the premium approach while also it has some short-term headwinds in terms of revenue for us actually provides the best long-term sort of revenue for us as a company.
And as Mike mentioned earlier, when you are off to the in a Fortune 500,000 and the markets are so large, that’s the trade up we will make every day of the week trading up some short-term revenue for long-term customer acquisitions. So that’s what we are talking about. We have free trials and moving to a premium feature and user base to our model. Got it. Okay. Thanks. The next question comes from George Iwanyc with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Thank you for taking my question. So, you had really strong growth with your larger customers once over 50,000 and 500,000. Can you give us a sense of the factors that are driving the expansion there and maybe also a sense of the penetration of your newer products with those larger customers? Well, the factors are a couple things. One we’ve created in both the on-prem business and now in cloud with premium edition. Really important upgrade opportunities for those customers as they continue to scale. And so that’s one factor. We’ve also expanded the portfolio. So we have more products to talk to those customers about that are meaningful.
And we are doing that well. I think those are kind of the two things that are contributing to growth in both customers that are spending more than 50K and customers that are spending more than 500k. There is still a lot of latent opportunity for us to continue to do that.
And in concert with the stronger signals of the cloud, I think we are really excited about the opportunity for premium additions in the cloud as both a similar upgrade path for just the existing cloud base that’s on standard. It’s on the version of cloud that exists today.
But also as server customers consider the move to cloud that got the opportunity to either stay on-prem with an upgrade path to datacenter or to move to premium version of our cloud products. And both those are opportunities I think to increase the two cohorts that you described. So, with the multi product opportunities that are opening up, can you give us a sense of just the competitive landscape? Are you seeing yourself go up against more companies with the larger customers? Not materially. I think it is a competitive landscape as we’ve described before it’s different by product and by category. I think we’ve got a really strong – I think advantage with just our existing base and we are extending from a lot of these products are deeply connected into – as an example JIRA.
And so the JIRA forges an opportunity with the champion and it kind of a key fanatical base inside of our customers where they are going to look for the best product that actually allows them to extend or to weave kind of capability to an adjacency like IT operations management or incident management. So, option here is an example benefits a lot from the existing JIRA software base of 55,000 customers.
And part of the momentum that we are seeing and not changes exactly related to that. And so, the competitive landscape doesn’t change. I think we lean into our advantages and we are focused on building the best products in any category. And then using all the levers that we can introduce that product to the customer. Thank you. The next question comes from Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Hi, thank you, James. I am going to start with you. You did mentioned or talked about the pricing impact to subscription. I wanted to extend that. If you thought about the guidance that you gave is pricing net-net still a tailwind as you think about the overall opportunity associated with FY 2020? Yes, it’s a reasonable way to think about it And specifically you said, subscription would probably be less so in 2020 than 2019. Is that broadly true of the balance of the portfolio as well? Well, just to be very clear. My comment was around the cloud part and remember there are two parts to the subscription revenue, there is datacenter, as well as cloud. But for the cloud part of the business, I would expect price increase activity to drive less growth for us than was the case in fiscal 2019. Okay. And if you could just answer that broadly speaking, is that true for the rest of the portfolio or? I wouldn’t really extend the commentary beyond that. Obviously, we haven’t made any pricing announcements yet to our customers. We just wanted to give you a sense on what might be helpful in some of your modeling. Okay, great. My second question is, could you provide any update on align? Just any kind of traction or metrics associated with that particular offering? Hey, Keith, it’s Jay. No metrics No metrics. But in terms of traction really pleased in just the response that we've seen from customers and the momentum we saw in the first quarter. I think the timing of the announcement with summit certainly helped and I think you heard, I think you were absent.
But you heard some of the interest directly from Mike at ANZ Bank on the stage when we talked about their interest in Agile transformation and the consideration set around JIRA Align and AgileCraft prior to that. Q1 was our first full quarter with the team integration pipeline channel enablement, all those things are humming. We're pleased with the results. Okay. Yeah, Jay there did seem to be a lot of interest at your User Group event. So, thanks very much for the questions. The next question comes from Rishi Jaluria with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions. Nice to see continued strong results. Two kind of broad classes of questions. First on the cloud migrations and then I've got a follow-up on Trello. But on cloud migrations side to kind of piggyback off Sanjit's observation earlier, in the chart that you gave us is really helpful when you talk about, it essentially comes out to about a 1.4x uplift from server to cloud or even if we look at year five maybe close to maybe 1.6x, 1.7x uplift.
I know with other software companies when they've talked about migrations to cloud, they've talked actually about a 2x to 3x. So maybe just help me understand why the delta? And it feels silly complaining about it.
But why is that uplift not bigger? And alongside that, in terms of driving the migrations, should we start to see something like cloud-only features or cloud-only products as an incentive to help customers migrate? And then I've got a follow-up on Trello. This is Scott, I'll answer the first part, which is the cloud migrations and the uplift. Firstly, it's an illustrative example we’ve put either the document. At each segment, there is different pricing characteristics.
Two, is that, we have always been patient for revenue with our customers and making sure that there are less barriers to move across to the cloud is very important for us as well. And so, a lot of the pricing, we set there is to help customers move across to the cloud. Okay, got it, thanks. And then, just in terms of from a product perspective, anything in terms of should we expect to see cloud-only features or cloud-only products to help kind of incentivize customers to migrate? Yeah, it's Mike here. We do have a series of cloud-only features and products, if you think about it. So OpsGenie, Statuspage, Align are all cloud-only products that are Align that support on-premises instances in terms of the data it can attract.
And then you've seen us introduce specific cloud-only features like Access and within – even within the JIRA family, within Confluence, there is some slight feature differences between on-premises products and cloud products.
So, yes, there are already, I guess some feature differences, but by and large, if you are using Confluence or JIRA Software or JIRA service, they are still largely the same product on both sides. We do make sure that data compatibility is really important.
So for the customers that are migrating, we mentioned the Confluence migration assistant we released a few versions up during the year and the upcoming JIRA migration assistant. That requires us to be able to move, especially for the large volume of smaller customers to move that data automatically. So we do make sure that data compatibility is really important. But there are feature differences between the two for sure. Got it. Thanks, that's helpful. And then just quickly on Trello. You did mentioned in the material that you had an uplift in customers or paying customers with the result of the kind of the board limits to TV. I think just help us understand what kind of the result of them?
Was that a conversion of free to paying? Was that something else? And then maybe talk a little bit about the traction you've seen with Trello Enterprise? Thanks. Sure. Look, Trello is continue to parallel and very strongly. We are very happy about how it's going. As we've said, look, our primary goal with Trello is still to continue to establish Trello as a brand, Trello as a product and continue to grow the momentum that it has as a standalone business. We are doing more and more integration over time. But that's a long-term journey.
We did introduce some pricing changes throughout the year. You've seen some of the impact of that, as we've called out in the customer number this quarter. Some of that is a one-time benefit that we've talked about, because while the flow of Trello customers will be marginally higher, we are changing some of the free to paid conversion rates.
And that's from a large existing free base. Obviously, you get some of the existing base converting over to a faster rate, which is what we've called out in a customer number there. At the same time, we are focused on Trello enterprise. We've had a really good couple of quarters in Trello enterprise as we continue invest in features there. We put that into the shareholder letter as well.
As businesses adopt Trello with tens of thousands of users and beyond, they do have different sets of requirements that we continue to work with the customers on establishing, when you have hundreds of thousands of boards across a customer you need methods of organizing that content, finding that content, managing large-scale users, etc, which is exactly what we've been doing in the Trello Enterprise product and obviously with such a large install base in Trello, that has a very good future. Got it. Great. Thank you. That's helpful. The next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Great. I just wanted to do an apologize for missing the slot earlier. I just wanted to ask real quickly about OpsGenie. You commented about how it accelerated the pace of additional paid users. And I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about, how you are seeing that cross-sell opportunity into your JIRA installed base. And like, is there any color that you could share about kind of where you are seeing the success of kind of cross-sell across those products? Thank you. Heather, I can't get into specifics. But as you mentioned, we mentioned in our shareholder letter that we've doubled the pace of customer acquisition and we feel really good about that that acquisition. If you look through our internal charts, there is a distinct change when OpsGenie, we came at last June and we feel great about that.
If you - in trading with customers, it is a great product. Sometimes I mentioned at the acquisition, sometimes you require something and you have to add features to it or make it enterprise-ready. And OpsGenie actually scales better than any of the other products out there in the market. And so for us, it was just a matter of getting in front of our customers.
I know it's still very early in the journey of putting it on the Atlassian platform. Now we are really happy with the pace that we've only it’s required less than a year ago. We've already done identity and user interface and stuff like that. So, we're sort of at the - still at the start of what I think of in terms of cross-selling into our existing base. And then Heather, I would just add that when we announced the acquisition of OpsGenie, we noted that it would drive a point of revenue growth on these then revenue guidance for fiscal 2019 and I am pleased to say that we achieved that. So strong momentum. Okay, that's great. Thank you. Just a quick follow-up, is there, is it – so it's net new customers that you are getting from this two plus expansion into the installed base. So you see the opportunity on both fronts, is that correct? That's right. Yes, that's right, very much. Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. Please go ahead. Hi, this is Joe Goodwin on for Pat. I just wanted to ask real quickly about, how is the relationship with Slack going? And can you speak to some of the opportunities that may be on the horizon? Hey Joe. It's going great. I mean, we've got - I think a good relationship, great integration that we continue to improve between the products. We are in the market, I think talking to customers at both of our user conferences and events about the relationship that exists in the value for customers when they integrate them more deeply.
You saw that at Summit where we talk a lot about just how we use Slack internally and extend their products and their users of our products at the same time and doing the inverse. So, it's good. Great. And then just a quick follow-up. Is the monitoring space, a space that you guys would have entered into? It’s Scott here. At the moment, that’s not an area that we are actively looking at. There are a lot of thought players in that space. And there is a – there is no clear winner. We benefited a lot more from integrating with the leaders in that space and we have a great relationship with all the leaders in that space. Again, it's Mike. I might just add, philosophically if you look at our history, we do try to solve human and people problems, not technology problems and so where we strive into areas where you are solving a technology problem, be it language-specific features or analytic-specific features, it's not our core DNA right.
We are a collaboration company around teams of people. Something like OpsGenie where you are coordinating people is much more in our wheelhouse of strength in our DNA as a business around solving people and collaborative problems around technology rather than actually solving a technology problem per se. Thank you. The next question comes from Gray Powell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Great. Thanks. You may have already touched on this. I’ve joined a little bit late. But I just want to make sure I understood some context behind the fiscal 2020 guidance. How should we think about the acquisition contribution to revenue growth in fiscal 2020? And then is there any residual impacts on operating margins, particularly from AgileCraft? Well, we haven't broken out any specific acquisition element of the fiscal 2020 guide. Obviously, we have just been talking about how pleased we are always with OpsGenie and JIRA Align, and so we are looking for those both to continue growing strongly during fiscal 2020.
In terms of the operating margin effect around JIRA Align in particular, we will be working through the deferred revenue haircut that comes along with every software acquisition. And so, that will impact the JIRA Align revenue growth rate during fiscal 2020.
We will still have some of that for OpsGenie as well, but we are three quarters further along that pathway with OpsGenie. So, during fiscal 2020 that their deferred revenue haircut should start to ebb. Okay, that's helpful. Thank you very much. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to the management team for any closing remarks. Thanks everyone for joining our call today. So from the bottom of the sea to the top of the clouds, we continue to work hard to deliver for our customers. We appreciate your time today and look forward to keeping you updated on our progress. The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.","this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of Atlassian's website following this call . on the call today, we have our Co-Founders and Co-CEOs, Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes; our Chief Financial Officer, James Beer; and our President, Jay Simons . this call includes forward-looking statements .",1.0

Thank you for joining Atlassian's Earnings Conference Call for the First Quarter of Fiscal 2020. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of Atlassian's website following this call.
I will now hand the call over to Martin Lam, Atlassian's Senior Manager of Investor Relations. Good afternoon, and welcome to Atlassian's first quarter fiscal 2020 earnings conference call. On the call today we have Atlassian's Co-Founders and Co-CEOs, Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes; our Chief Financial Officer, James Beer; and our President, Jay Simons.
Earlier today, we issued a press release and a shareholder letter with our financial results and commentary for our first quarter of fiscal 2020. These items were also posted on the Investor Relations section of Atlassian's website at investors.atlassian.com. On our IR website, there is also an accompanying presentation and data sheet available. We'll make some brief opening remarks then spend the rest of the call on Q&A.
Statements made on this call include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events.
Forward-looking statements represent our management's beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made. For further information on these and other factors that could affect the Company's financial results is included in filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time-to-time, including the section entitled Risk Factors in our most recent Form 20-F and Quarterly Report on Form 6-K.
In addition, today's call, we will discuss non-IFRS financial measures. These non-IFRS financial measures are in addition to and not a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. There are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-IFRS financial measures versus the nearest IFRS equivalents and they may be different from non-IFRS and non-GAAP measures used by other companies.
A reconciliation between IFRS and non-IFRS financial measures is available in our earnings release, our shareholder letter and in our updated Investor Data Sheet on our IR website.
I will now turn the call over to Scott for opening remarks before we move to Q&A. Thanks everyone for joining today. We’re out of the box in good form in fiscal 2020. This quarter we grew revenue by 36% year-over-year and generated more than $62.4 million of free cash flow. We also added over 7,000 net new customers during the quarter and now have more than 159,000 customers in total.
This quarter we introduced two important new editions of our cloud offerings, Free and Premium. Our disruptive business model continues to win new customers, both large and small, and these new editions offer them more choice and capabilities. We want it to be easier and less costly for teams to get started in the cloud and grow with us as they need to change and become more complex. Premium illustrates the increased sophistication of our enterprise cloud offerings providing large companies the flexibility and the tools they need.
We are also excited to have acquired Code Barrel, the creator of Automation for Jira. As a platform for managing work and workflows, Jira is in a unique position to help automate manual steps in the workflow to help people and teams advance work more efficiently. Automation is [increasing product] [ph] for customers because it helps them move faster and collaborate more effectively. Automation for Jira is already used by thousands of teams and is another important step as we continue to enhance our cloud products.
We've provided more detail on these announcements along with many other updates in our shareholder letter that was issues early today.
And with that, I'll pass the call over to the operator for Q&A. Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Great, thank you so much for taking the question. I wanted to ask a little bit because there has been some concern over the past few days about, you know, if you've started to see any change in the customer buying patterns? I mean, I know you guys don't have a direct sales force, but I know James has obviously seen different cycles from time to time being at different companies, but any sense that there has been any change in the demand environment?
And then I had a followup question just if you could share with us anything about any potential impact you saw from the price changes if there's a way to help think about the impact on the quarter whether we should be thinking about it more similar to kind of the fiscal year 2018 price increase where the timing was more similar or is it potentially more like last year in terms of the behavior in deferred revenue? Thank you. Hey Heather, let me start off with our answers. First of all, I wouldn’t say we've seen any material change in customer buying patterns. You know, we've been pleased by the results, the overall strength right across the product sets and our different deployment options, so no, nothing material in that regard. Reaction to price increase, Jay if you want to start off with that one and then I can come back on some of the timing items? I think similar to how we've reported in the past it was in line with expectations. So I think customers and part of it is just around the plan that we do that goes into the increases that we do communicate to customers in the way we communicate those price increases to customers. So I think we're pleased with how it has been adopted. Yes, and in terms of the timing, we announced our price increases at the start of this past September and so couple of weeks earlier than was the case a year ago, and so more in line with the timing of fiscal 2018. And so for that reason we expected that there would be some additional customer activity in Q1 as there was in Q1 of fiscal 2018 and that there would be potentially some of that bleeding over into Q2 as well again as there was in fiscal 2018. Great, thank you so much. Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho. Your line is open. Okay, thank you very much. Good afternoon guys. I found it interesting just in followup to Heather's question that your EMEA revenue growth actually reaccelerated this quarter just given again some of the macro and other concerns that we've all heard about. Is there anything that you would call out with respect to your strong execution in EMEA? Thank you, Gregg for the question. Recall that over half of our partners are based in EMEA. We have over 500 partners around the world and they have tended to be quite active helping their customers, our customers step in front of the price increases. We saw this in the last couple of years. And while that activity generally impacts our deferred revenue balance there are, you know, I think as we've discussed in the past, a couple of revenue drivers there as well and so that is a part of what's driving those strong results both in EMEA and in APAC as well. Okay, that's really helpful James, thanks. And then just as a followup, I realized that we're only one quarter of course into fiscal 2020, but just relative to your prior guidance for the cloud mix shift to cause 100 basis point revenue growth headwind for the year, have you seen anything at this point that perhaps might tilt you in one direction or another or do you still feel that's probably the right landing spot for the cloud impact this year? Thank you. Yes, and I would continue to say that that 1 point headwind to revenue growth year-over-year is what we're expecting. Recall that there were three elements to that when we talked about it 90 days ago, the first, the launch of free editions of Jira Software and Confluence, the second flow of that we would offer free trials of our cloud product to the user of that same product behind the firewall. And then the mix shift that you are referring to in the question. And one of the other things to recall is that we just rolled out the free versions of Jira Software and Confluence just quite recently and so continue to be of the view that that 100 basis point headwind is the right way to think about those three issues combined. Okay, terrific, thanks very much. Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Thank you, guys, for taking the call -- taking the question and very nice quarter. Two questions, one on sort of the new customer adds, you guys have been adding customers at a really nice clip and saw really good growth in that net new customer adds this quarter of about 20% on a year-on-year basis. Anything in particular driving that kind of stronger new customer adds in Q1 and anything in that that wouldn’t be repeatable for the rest of the year? Number one.
And number two, another acquisition sort of going deeper into sort of the opportunity around Jira and some of that core IT, we haven’t heard as much about this stuff outside of the IT Department. Could you give us an update as to kind of how we're thinking about the opportunity for Jira outside the IT Department and is the focus still there in the same way it had been historically in terms of expanding the use cases outside of those core IT use cases? Hey Keith, Jay here. I'll take the first part and then hand it off to Mike on the second one. In terms of customer growth, you know really contribution across the board from all the major products that are contributing to the new customer adds. As we talked about last quarter, there is one component in there related to the monetization improvements that we introduced to Trello around board limits for team usage, and there is some nascent pent up demand within the existing customer base that is contributing to the number, not in a materially outsized proportion, but it is in there. And that's maybe one component as we roll through a year of those monetization improvements in the base that will moderate a little bit. And just one thing to add on to that briefly, we continue to see more than 90% of those new customers going straight to our cloud services. Mike? Yes, hi Keith. Look we obviously continue to remain bullish and focused on the opportunities both inside and outside the IT and Software Department. You referenced acquisition of Code Barrel. Obviously automation is an area that we already have quite a variety of offerings in, now in Trello, in OpsGenie and we had some automation features in Jira Service Desk. This really lets us expand that automation offering across the whole Jira platform. So when you talk about non-IT teams where does that mainly exist, obviously Jira core just for business workflow and process management at all sorts of levels.
This automation fits directly inside of that sweet spot for companies that are modeling all sorts of processes on top of Jira already. This just gives them extra superpowers. And then within Service Desk, it is also incredibly important because Service Desk while it continues to land very strongly in IT, it does expand very well outside of IT to all sorts of other flow based teams within an organization, be it in legal or finance or HR, workplace management, any of these sort of things. That automation obviously works very well in those areas as well.
Obviously in this case automation doesn’t affect Trello or Confluence or anything else we sell outside of -- to business teams, but from the automation point of view, yes, very, very strong for the whole Jira platform, but inside and outside IT. And obviously for us the core of that business is a bunch of really kick-ass people that came from Atlassian to start with, so we know the people really well and I think it's going to work really well. Excellent. Thank you, guys. Your next question comes from the line of Arjun Bhatia from William Blair. Your line is open. Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. May be I just wanted to follow up on the acquisition that you were just talking about, just to try to get a better understanding of how you might integrate this into Jira and how you might monetize it, I think that is largely sold through the marketplace today, but can you maybe just walk us through how monetization model might work, is this something that you plan to introduce on the premium products only or is this going to be widely available across all Jira tiers? Arjun, Scott here. We've had some success when we acquired Butler and did something similar where we had a lot of success at packing part of in our Premium, allowing part of it also the standard offering for customers to get a taste of it and [indiscernible] I think we'll also have some existing customers particularly around - existing customers in terms of transition period. So there's lot of things to consider there, but we do think it will help bolster out our Premium offering at the time and this is something our customers are really interested in. Great, thanks. And then maybe on the freemium products that you launched, the freemium for or the free tiers of Jira and Confluence, can you just give us a sense of what you're seeing from customers in the initial phases of this launch? I know it is still early, but are you seeing a big uptick of new customers coming into that free tier and maybe on the other side what are you seeing from existing customers that used to be paying, but might have moved down to the free tier? Thank you. Yes, so it will -- if I think about our disruptive model over the years like we've always tried to make sure our products were accessible for every size company. The start-ups that's coming out of university, people just starting with two or three person organization, all the way up to people that use our things with 30,000, 50,000 people and expand that gamut. And that we've always had pricing to appeal to that. And if I would go back to 20 years when we started, only the Fortune 500 could afford software and we pioneered the model to make software affordable to companies of all sizes.
Now if you go with free and premium, it has continued to improve that in the cloud and on the premium side it is making sure our largest customers have the features that they need to continue their expansion in the cloud or to move their on-premises deployment to the cloud. And on the free side of things it's around make sure again those companies who [at the moment we] [ph] charge covered all the months, the [barrier of the] [ph] credit card if we can remove that we believe there will be a large increase in the funnel there.
On the free, I mean your question was how much it’s open the funnel. In our position to talk through that at the moment apart from saying that we are pleased by the results internally of how that is going and but it is still early days and we do want to look at some of those things [indiscernible] over long period of time and make sure that it really uplifts, but irrespectively gets the short term benefit. The long term benefit is making sure that every single company of every size can use Atlassian's products. And to emphasize, what I was mentioning earlier about that effective free being embedded within that 1 point headwind to our revenue growth rate in FY 2020. Thanks James. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James. Your line is open. Hi, this is actually Robert Majek on for Michael. It sounds like OpsGenie is doing really well as part of the Atlassian family. Can you just give us some more color there, the changes you have made that led to an accelerated growth rate and maybe more broadly, if you can just talk more about the long term opportunity for that asset? Michael, it is Scott here again. [Indiscernible] OpsGenie acquisition we just actually had a party in our office to celebrate one year of closing, last night so I described it seems like only yesterday. The acquisition is doing really well inside Atlassian and if you look at the space, the internet management companies around the world are struggling to how do they release software at a faster pace, how do they keep up with their competitors and [seeing] [ph] whole movement around things like dev ops and big part of that is making sure that when you are [indiscernible] naturally do that that people are going to respond quickly and have the right people available and that's what OpsGenie does.
Now OpsGenie we're pleased with some of the integration that we've done on the product side, the identity side, on the user space side, but I still think we have a lot of opportunity there to put those products together with our large existing base and we have seen a doubling of the rate of paid fee since we acquired the company. I think we've reported in our sales letter and that's been great and we still think we have a long way to go in terms of introducing our existing customers to the OpsGenie product. I appreciate it. Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kurtz with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Yes, thanks. I just want to followup on that thread just in your shareholder letter talking about the free tier doubling the pace of growth for OpsGenie from a user perspective. When you see that kind of result, is that how you might think about you know future M&A that you can really accelerate a product in market where maybe as a standalone entity a company just can get to that kind of growth rate and that might change how you think about future M&A or do you think that was really specific to the markets that OpsGenie serves? So I guess the question is, when you see that impact do you think you guys might want to be a little bit more aggressive in M&A? I'll take that, it is Scott here and Mike might want to add something at the end. When we think about M&A, we think a couple of things. Firstly, it's got to be right culture fit for the company, that's first and foremost since we already had the same culture. Second, it has to be a mission team, so it is not following foreign companies that don’t work with our mission which has done potential of every team and third is the business model fit, it's more difficult, but not impossible to change a company's business model, you know take it from volume high price to high volume low price for example is a difficult thing and then after that we consider technical or other things.
And so, if we do find companies that align with our ambition, with our culture, and with our business model we will consider them and we do believe that our base is 159,000 customers and millions of teams around the world is something where they are interested in other products that we can bring to market for them, both acquisitions and new products that we will develop organically. So any opportunity is really large and we're not about kind of acquiring stuff for revenue sake. There are a lot of things that we could just random things introducing to our customer base that may bring short term revenue, but don’t bring culture to our mission and we want to be very disciplined about not going out to those types of opportunities. Great, thank you. Yes, I would just add one small thing, obviously we, you've seen us make series of changes in OpsGenie and it's obvious we're pleased about how it's going. I do believe companies have a DNA. We obviously have a long term philosophy, DNA of having a long term philosophy and making changes of that type over the long term. As Scott mentioned, 159,000 customers we have a massive distribution engine for software, but you still have to have fantastic applications with really great feature sets.
OpsGenie has the best features in the market and we have an ability to put a disruptive price against it to really make a huge dent. I think that fits our DNA in a really, really good way. So part of the reason we've been so excited about the teams since they've come on board and we're starting to see some pretty good results, taking our model up against big enterprise software is something that we're very familiar with doing and have almost 20 years now history of success of doing so and intend to continue that. Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Great, thanks, and nice job on the quarter. I wanted to touch on what you're seeing in terms of rate of activity from customers moving from server to either data center or cloud. And I guess on cloud specifically now that you've got Cloud Premium out I know it's still very early, but I mean, as you look over the next 12 to 24 months do you see migration being more gradual as enterprises slowly get more comfortable or do you see perhaps more of a hockey shape just with more accepted to cloud and the advance which you are making with your premium SKU? Hey, Derrick Jay here. We talked a little bit about this on the last call. I mean, we are seeing increasing interest in cloud generally, but also in cloud from our server customer base. It is a part of what we've invested. We made big investments in migration tooling. Just to make that process simple we've make some pricing calibration adjustments to make it easier for customers to move. And then we're working a lot more closely with customers to make sure that the planning to that move and the implementation of that move is smooth.
I think in just in terms of the demand environment it is increasing at a steady clip and I think what we signaled last quarter is just the investments that we've made over the past year and just the readiness to make sure that when customers do want to move because it is both the -- in some cases it is a replatforming. It is saying, I'm going to take an instance that, you know I have three or four or five years of history with and I want to move that smoothly to from infrastructure that that I'm hosting and managing to infrastructure that I no longer have to manage because Atlassian can do a better job of it for me.
And then data center, you know is a little bit of a different, not even a migration pattern. It is basically an up-sell from a standard version of server-on-prem to high-availability instance of the on-prem infrastructure and that's still a motion that really, really large customers are choosing, which is fine because we're celebrating the customer's choice to either remain on-prem or go to cloud if they want to. And just a couple of things to emphasize what Jay was saying, that we're obviously very pleased with the rate of growth of our subscription business which encapsulates both our cloud and data center business, so that grew 50% in Q1. And then you mentioned the potential effect of Cloud Premium. As I've said in the past, I wouldn’t expect cloud premium offerings for JSW and Confluence to drive the material revenue effect in FY 2020 and we see the benefits of that downstream. Got it, okay, thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Nikolay Beliov with Bank of America. Your line is open. Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Just a followup on the last question, you've put in place channel incentive, product incentive, pricing incentive to steer the Silver customer base to the cloud version. Do you envision this being you know like through free process or five to six years kind of like transition of that installed base and $400 million worth of maintenance to cloud? I mean the transition will happen over years, it will be gradual. Okay. And James, question for you, you are right in the revenue guidance for the year in line with the Q1 base, I'm just wondering what kind of puts and takes you are considering for the rest of the year as you provided the update guidance for the year?. Thank you. Yes well, versus the midpoint of our original guide 90 days ago, we've obviously raised beyond the Q1 beat quite substantially and this others reflects our ongoing confidence as I said right at the outset of the call across the products and across the deployment options, so really that's the logic behind the moves that we've made today on the guide. All right, thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Gray Powell from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Great, thanks for taking the question. So you are an absolutely dollar basis. You added more revenue to the subscription line than any prior quarter ever. I know you're not going to give exact numbers to me like maybe broadly speaking, how much of that is being driven by just normal demand versus customers shifting from server to cloud? Well, I would say that the gradual serve to cloud transition is only momentum, but what I really would say, and when you think about that subscription growth rate it just represents the underlying strength of both the cloud business and the data center business. So we're pleased by both of those business lines are growing very substantially. Got it, thanks. Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Your line is open. Hi this is [indiscernible] for Brent Thill. Congrats again on a strong quarter. I had a couple of questions, one was given the impressive subscription year-over-year growth rate of 50% this quarter, I know last quarter you guys mentioned that you would hit, you know grown over 40% year-over-year for subscription, so is there any update to that? And then the second question was really that this is the first time you guys have done price increases on the data center product, so has there been any initial reaction to that from customers if you have seen that? Yes so, let me take the first part of that. So in terms of the subscription business, we guided at the outset of the year that we thought we could beat 40% growth year-over-year. Obviously the Q1 result is a very nice down payment if you will on achieving that objective, so nothing to update around that at this time. In terms of the price increase activity around data center customers, Jay would you want to take that one? Yes, no. One reaction, I mean the price increase at data center was super nominal. As we mentioned it was the first adjustment we made to data center pricing since introducing it three years ago. Great, thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jack Andrews with Needham. Your line is open. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could speak about the broader demand trends and competitive landscape as it relates to Trello. It seems like in this broader collaboration space more companies are increasing some focus in investments there. So I was just wondering, are you seeing any sort of inflexion in the demand for more general collaboration tools? Look, I mean I would say more general collaboration, those continue to be something else that grows as business evolves. People are getting more comfortable with using these types of tools you have obvious of joining the workforce who are incredibly comfortable with mobile based collaboration apps and things like that, but nothing unusual in the last quarter over a general shift towards collaborative tools, but as we would say in specific demand.
So why would I get a Jira Confluence? Other tools we have are actually modern collaboration tools. They have all of the modern collaboration features from our platform, but focused on specific demands whether it be project management, workflow management or document collaboration, but nothing particularly changing other than general movement in our direction which is obviously where we intend to be. Great, thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Rishi Jaluria with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions, two here. First on Trello, I mean now up to 50 million users, can you maybe help us understand if you've seen particular traction in the specific industries, lines of business within the organization, specific geographies and alongside that on the monetization side I know you introduced board limits for LTV [ph] recently and that seems to be helping, but maybe help us understand what the path to monetization for Trello looks like going forward? And then on the Automation for Jira and the acquisition there, maybe just help us understand the technology a little better, is this similar to the Butler acquisition for Trello or is this more robust maybe even slightly similar to an RPA offering? Thanks. Rishi I'll certainly take the first half there and I guess I could take the second half too. Look on Trello, we continue to be extremely positive. As we said in the shareholder letter we passed 50 million registered users this quarter which is again a huge jump from last year and continues to power along really nicely. So as we say, pretty much every quarter to you guys, the first call is to continue Trello growing the way it is growing and I think we're sort of ticking up often continue to travel well there. Those users are all across the globe. It is a very global phenomenon. It is an application that works as well in android in Brazil as it does in now [ph] in America or on a desktop in Australia.
So in terms of the global application, it is very, very large and I think we're showing in the numbers that we can continue to grow it very strongly. We are as you mentioned starting to monetize it more in the last over six to 12 months, same good traction happening there. Just in terms of managing how we separate between the free and paid offerings, you mentioned board limits, few other small tweaks in Chinese we've made to monetization and pricing.
I would just say again that comes to my sort of long term patient philosophy as a company and our DNA of having - being very, very expert at how we optimize pricing for different customer groups and customer segments and make sure that that drives firstly growth and then second value to Atlassian after we deliver value to our customers and Trello is no different there. The only difference which I will point out, we're still not active cross selling users to other Atlassian properties yet. It is on the list. We will get there, but we're not actively on that today. The other two parties are taking more than a short term.
I guess I can take that. The Automation for Jira look and technologically I'm not sure what that, you want an answer to that question. It is similar to Butler in some ways in terms of how I guess it works and automation is obviously built completely differently inside of the Jiro stack. It is a very different world. For the basics of things like Apia [ph], sure you could use it to automate some of this, but it's not, I wouldn’t say it is a competitor to Apia [ph] tools in that way. It is more about automating, I guess repetitive or tasks that you don’t necessarily need to do.
So I've given the example of our legal team uses Service Desk very heavily to manage incoming contracts and move them around. They can look for missing fields, missing data, other things they would need and balance it, strike automatically back to the user to get more information or to move it to the next station workflow without one of our very expert lawyers with their legal duties having to spend time moving tickets around which they shouldn’t have to do. Right? They want to focus on high value work that leverages their skill and Automation just lets us take that to millions and millions of juries around the world. So I think we're quite positive at the impact it can have. All right, great, that's helpful. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of George Iwanyc with Oppenheimer, your line is open. Thank you for taking my question. So just another on Code Barrel from an expense perspective, is the acquisition going forward some expenses and that's kind of embedded with maintaining the operating margin guidance? Yes, that's -- George we've embedded all of that within the guidance, that's right. Yes, are you accelerating investment in other areas internally as well? Well, I wouldn't point to any particular acceleration driven by the acquisition per se. Yes, obviously we're very pleased to be adding the Core Barrel team, and as I say we will take it to each of the effects there within the guide that we've issued. Okay and just broadly speaking on the IP side, has the competitive dynamics changed at all with the ramp of Jira Service Desk and OpsGenie and all the other efforts that you are doing – focused right there? Yes, Scott here. The competitive dynamics I don’t think have changed significantly over the last couple of quarters and we feel increasingly confident that our position in IP as we sort of mentioned before IP and software are become increasingly closer together and that's an area that we have a real strong market position given that we have a large number of software developers and tools and products to help them be productive and as those teams work closely together they will have one stack to pull those things together. So from that I feel, I get increasingly confident with our position in the market, but I feel other people out there, any major changes in the competitive dynamic. Okay, thank you. [Operator Instructions] There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to the presenters. Thanks everyone for joining the call today from Mike and Scott down in Sydney, and James and Jay up in San Francisco. We appreciate your time very much and look forward to keeping you updated on our progress as we travel into the future. Thank you.","this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of Atlassian's website following this call . on the call today, we have our Co-Founders and Co-CEOs, Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes, our Chief Financial Officer, James Beer, and our President, Jay Simons . statements made on this call include forward-looking statements .",0.0

Thank you for joining Atlassian's earnings conference call for the second quarter of fiscal 2020. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of Atlassian's website following this call.
I will now hand the call over to Matt Sonefeldt, Atlassian's Head of Investor Relations. Good afternoon and welcome to Atlassian's Second Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Conference Call. It's great to join this incredible team. On the call today, we have Atlassian's co-Founders and Co-CEOs, Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes; our Chief Financial Officer, James Beer; and our President, Jay Simons.
Earlier today, we issued a press release and a shareholder letter with our financial results and commentary for our second quarter of fiscal 2020. These items were also posted on the Investor Relations section of Atlassian's website. On our IR site, we have also posted a supplemental presentation and data sheet.
During the call, we'll make brief opening remarks and then spend the remainder of time on Q&A. Statements made on this call include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events.
Forward-looking statements represent our management's beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made. Further information on these and other factors that could affect the company's financial results are included in filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including in the section titled Risk Factors in our most recent 20-F and Quarterly Report on Form 6-K.
In addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-IFRS financial measures. These non-IFRS financial measures are in addition to and not a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. There are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-IFRS financial measures versus their nearest IFRS equivalents and they may be different from non-IFRS and non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Reconciliation between IFRS and non-IFRS financial measures is available in our earnings release, our shareholder letter and in our updated investor data sheet on our IR website. During Q&A, please ask your full question upfront, so that we can more easily move to, to the next person.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Mike for opening remarks. Thanks, everyone, for joining the call today and for your continued support. Q2 was a strong quarter. We grew revenue by 37% year-over-year and posted record levels of profitability and free cash flow. We also added over 5,000 net new customers during the quarter and now have well over 164,000 customers.
During Q2, we made continued progress against our long-term goals. We are constantly focused on long-term opportunities, including how we help teams collaborate through our products, how we win in large markets and how we continue to scale our durable business.
This quarter's product highlights connect to those themes. We passed $1 billion in lifetime revenue through the Atlassian marketplace, driving customer value through a large developer ecosystem has been one of our continued long-term focuses. The launch of Forge, our new cloud app development platform, reinforces the value we create for customers, by making it easier and cheaper to developers to build cloud apps on the Atlassian platform.
We do have bittersweet news to share this quarter. Our long-time President, Jay Simons, has decided to leave Atlassian in July for new adventures. Jay helped us pioneer our unique low friction customer-centric business model over the last decade. He's also built an incredible sales and marketing leadership team, to continue to drive that growth. Jay is a permanent part of our culture. And while we have few months left to ensure a smooth transition, we'll miss his presence in the office dearly. We provide more detail on these announcements and many other updates in our shareholder letter that we issued earlier today.
And with that, I'll pass the call to the operator for Q&A. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with Cowen & Company. Go ahead. Your line is open. Great. Thanks. James, I wanted to ask about the comment in the shareholder letter about the pull forward effect. And you did mention you pulled forward from second half 2020 and fiscal 2021, but you did raise the fiscal year guidance by more than your Q2 beat. So just trying to get a little sense of where that shows up? I suspect maybe more on the bookings and deferred and billing side. If you could give us any color on how to think about the impact to billings growth as we move into the second half that would be helpful. Well, first of all, I'd like to start by saying how pleased we were with the overall level of demand right across the organization across our products, across our deployment options and indeed across our geographies. And so, yes, there was some pull forward activity that played out in Q2. But even with that, we were pleased to be able to record the revenue result versus our original guide. And in terms of the guide for the full year, yes, you're quite right. We were able to add both the degree to which we beat in the quarter as well as some additional money. And that's really reflective of our overall level of confidence in the top line environment.
So in terms of the billings part of your question, the first thing I really like to also remind you of is, as we've talked quite a few times in the past, we really focus on revenue as our primary top line measure and that's because our model is really quite different to that of the typical enterprise software company. Recall what a significant proportion of our business is booked on an annual cycle either maintenance or annual subscriptions. And in fact our cloud business recalled more than 3/4 of that is recorded on a monthly subscription.
So that very much illustrates our orientation towards the revenue line. That said, clearly, the deferred revenue accounts give you a sense for the degree of the pull forward in addition to what I would put at about a $10 million beneficial effect at the revenue line. If you look at the deferred revenue lines and contrast historical activity sequentially quarter-to-quarter, you can pull out that there's a pull forward benefit in the aggregate of approximately $50 million, 5-0. And I would expect that to most primarily reflect that revenue would be drawn away from Q3. But the long-term deferred revenue results in the sequence of that line item also gives you a feel for the amount of activity that we booked in Q2 that was relating to contracts that will become earned more than a year from now. So take a step back. Yes pull forward activity both in the revenue line and the deferred revenue lines, but still very pleased with the underlying organic revenue growth rate that we generated across our product set. Great. Certainly an impressive quarter and thanks for the color. Okay. Your next question comes from the line of Nikolay Beliov with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. James, I was wondering if you can comment on the behavior of the data center customers in the quarter like what is to your expectations in light of -- that they had the first price increase there. And long-term DR came in probably a little bit higher than before and my understanding was that you were consciously trying to limit the number of multi-year kind of like a grandfathering of deals. I was just wondering what you saw there? Thank you. Yeah, sure. Certainly our data center business had a strong quarter. We've recorded an impressive volume of new unit sales. But you're right yes this was the first price increase that we had rolled out for our data center products a few months back. And so we did see pull-forward activity related to our data center customers. These customers tend to be larger than the average for us. And I think the degree of second quarter activity in terms of pull-forward is somewhat related to the fact that those types of companies, larger scale companies take a little longer to get through their decision making and approvals process.
I think it's also important to note that our partners had an important role to play in the pull-forward activity generally. And we've seen this in prior years. I think we've talked in the past about we have a significant proportion of our total partner base located in Europe and Asia. And so we saw quite significant pull-forward activity there being driven by those entities.
Yes we had reduced the length of a renewal, an early renewal from three years, which was the case last year, down to a two-year maximum this year. But the long-term deferred revenue result just really illustrated the depth of demand, the interest level in committing to Atlassian's products for the longer-term. And this was very much illustrated in the data center business in particular. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Thanks. Congrats on a great quarter, great results. Just again regarding the pull-in effect, I guess I'm trying to take a different approach here. I'm sure that every year when you try to figure out what the price adjustments are you going to make before the calendar year end, you have certain outcomes in mind. And clearly this exceeded your expectations quite materially. I guess, what can I learn from that on what was your ultimate price adjustment? Could it be that -- why can't I read this to mean your price increases were quite significant and just forced a signal, a greater portion of your customer base to pull in than otherwise? Well, as we've spoken about before, when we rolled out those price increases for FY 2020, we expected the total aggregate effect on our revenue growth rate in fiscal 2020 to be about the same as that that we saw in fiscal 2019. And that breaks down across our deployment options a little differently. So as we've just been mentioning this is the first year for data center price increases. Server price increases were driving approximately similar outcome in fiscal 2020 versus fiscal 2019. And on the cloud side, we projected a lesser impact on revenue growth rate in fiscal 2020 versus fiscal 2019. And things continue to play out along the lines of our original expectations, so nothing particularly to observe there.
I think the pull forward volumes that we saw are really just illustrative of the effectiveness of our partners. They're clearly expecting the price increases that we rolled out three or four months ago now. And they have taken that as a specific event that have allowed them to drive an additional level of sales activity in their markets. And again we feel -- so that's just illustrative of the underlying demand for our products and the desire to commit to them over the longer term. And maybe the only thing to add, we've said it before like naturally any given year there's lots of puts and takes. Like some products are going to move up, some are going to stay the same. Some tiers of products will move up some will move down, so there's sort of lots of different dials that we're turning. Just a reminder that the pricing philosophy for us is bedrock and that doesn't change. We want to remain the high-value low price leader. Give people ways customers easy ways to start and lots of great ways to grow with us. There's absolutely no change there. And I think maybe another question you're not asking or maybe asking or someone will ask later customer response to all of those changes in line with expectation I think that's the result of the time that we put into planning these changes and the really customer-centric customer-friendly approach to how we deploy them. Very good, good luck and thanks Jay, good luck to you going forward. Thanks. Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Thank you, guys. Very nice quarter, I think you were taking the question. I have a question about [indiscernible] subscription growth as it relates to maintenance growth and what I mean by that is subscription growth has been really solid at 50% plus growth. You guys continue to drive that really well. Maintenance growth hasn't diminished at all because of the sustained really solid 20%-plus growth there. I was always under the impression that sort of part of this price increases was kind of the carrying in the stick approach trying to push guys from on-premise into the cloud. It doesn't seem like there's any real dedication in that maintenance space. Does any of the subscription strength come from maintenance customers switching over? Or will we see that at any time in the future, just become more like maintenance customers pushing over towards more cloud solutions? Yes, Keith, thanks for the question. You're right. Certainly, the maintenance line continues to be quite steady. Now, there are a few things going on within that line. First of all, we continue to be quite pleased with the progress of the rate and pace of customers coming over from our behind the firewall options of our data center over to the cloud.
And so, within that maintenance line, that obviously is reflective of server renewals, we're benefiting now from three or so years of price increases. And so, that's offsetting the natural gradual decline in the unit volume, as some of those customers move over to the cloud. Absent that effect, we continue to record very high renewal rates for the rest of the customers who continue to utilize our server products at the moment.
The other line I just sort of really more draw your focus to is, of course, the new -- the license line for the revenue accounts. And that's where the new server based activity is recorded, either a brand-new customer or a current customer adding additional new licenses.
And while we certainly have a good number of those current server customers expanding the license count with us, a part of what we were doing with our pricing strategies, particularly this past year, was to make sure that there was every incentive available for our brand-new customer to Atlassian to choose the cloud.
And so, not surprisingly, you would expect to see that license line gradually decline over time. Now, in this past quarter, Q2, we recorded low teens growth in that line. And so, that was really more of a driver from the pull-forward activity that we've been talking about quite a bit on the call already, combined with, of course, the effect of recent year's price increases. Got it. That’s super helpful. Thank you guys. Your next question comes from the line of Rishi Jaluria with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Hi, guys. This is Hannah on for Rishi. Thank you for question today. I'm just following up on the previous question. If you could talk about what kind of conversion rate and success rate you've been seeing pre-cloud trials for existing customers. Do you have any quantitative color you can give? Hey, Rishi, it's Jay here. No specific quantitative color, other than qualitatively we're really happy with how it's performing and how it's opening the aperture on more and more customers beginning to try the free additions of products that we've introduced. And over the long term, that's a good thing. It just means we're getting more people to try the product that we can grow. And while it's early, we would continue to look to the guide that we laid out when we started the fiscal year, as to the impact of free on the revenue economics of the company this year. All right. Thank you, guys. Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kurtz with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Yes. Thanks for taking the question. If we just look at the subscription growth of 50% in the quarter, obviously, we spent a lot of time here talking about the pull-forward effect. But maybe dive into expanded seats, new product expansion, different types of larger customers, anything else that we can kind of look at beyond just the price increase, and what may have happened this quarter? I would say all of the things that you mentioned were at play in the quarter as they should be. I think for the type of quarter that we turned into in addition to the pull-forward effect that James mentioned; just the underlying performance of the businesses was where we wanted it to be. So, no specific rabbit holes to chase on any of those things. They were all working in the way that we win. Yes. And just on the pull-forward, there would be a modest element of that $10 million revenue total that I mentioned earlier from the pull-forward that would accrue to the subscription line, because recall that the data center business is accounted for there and so that's what drives a little bit of pull-forward effect there. But the larger single beneficiary of the pull-forward revenue effect was of course the license line.
And then I think as we've talked about in the past, the other revenue line that's where we record our portion of our app vendor partners sales. And oftentimes we see customers when they're recommitting to our products, extending the term of our products, they tend to do the same thing with their different app vendor partners as well. And so that can drop some additional revenue into that other line. Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Arjun Bhatia with William Blair. Please go ahead, your line is open. Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. James maybe this one is probably for you. But I think you had mentioned a 1% headwind from some of the cloud initiatives that you're rolling out this year during the Q4 call last year. If I look at the growth rate in the first half of the year, it's obviously held up very well, definitely I imagine to some of the demand trends that you've been talking about. But is there any reason that we should think that that 1% headwind from the cloud initiatives plays out in the back half of the year or should we think of that as being embedded in the first half numbers that you've put up already? Well, thanks for the question. Just a reminder as to the three elements of that one point of revenue growth headwind that we talked about when we did our initial fiscal year guide. So, the first point was that we saw something of a change in our mix as we saw -- as we expected more cloud growth relative to our other deployment options. So, that has something of a revrec effect particularly when you think about one of my earlier points and that more than three quarters of our cloud customers take a monthly subscription. So, that was the first thought.
Second that we were rolling out three additions of both Jira Software and Confluence and then also that we were offering free trials of our cloud products to customers who currently utilize our server products and so forth.
So, those were the three drivers. And I think it's fair to say that the three elements of those -- so two of the three drivers would be more relevant to the back half of the year because the three additions have been gradually rolled out in recent times and we would look to continue to build up that gradual rollout as the year proceeds. The mix effect that's really much more of a gradual effect felt throughout the year. Great. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the quarter. Thanks. Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Great. Thank you. And Jay congrats and best wishes on your future endeavors. I had a question. I wanted to start with Mike. I was wondering if you can give us your view of how you see the market for collaboration, software evolving and there's a lot of companies going after the market from different parts or different angles. And I guess I'm wondering how do you see these converging at some point down the road do you see that happening? And if so, how do you see it playing out? And also how are you feeling about the pace of adoption that you've seen as you start to add some of these adjacent offerings such as Trello and Opsgenie? How have them --they've been doing kind of versus what you would have expected? And then I've got a follow-up for James. Look, Heather, it's great to get a question from your time [indiscernible]. Look I mean on the market side of things for collaboration, I still think we're in very early innings right? If you think about knowledge workers how much work is still done in spreadsheets and e-mail and other documentations is both knowledge work is digitized, business process is digitized in all departments in companies around the world. There's a reason that we talk about targeting Fortune 500,000 and the 800 million to 1 billion knowledge workers on the planet today, let alone that number itself growing.
We obviously feel very good about where we're positioned and how that market is evolving in lots of different spaces from Trello all the way up through Jira Software across Confluence and JSD horizontally et cetera. So I think we're incredibly bullied on the overall space and opportunity. If I was to If I was to spread between that and your question on Opsgenie and Trello and other things in terms of adoption across our base, I would go back to our long-term philosophy, right? As per James' answer on 3 on the previous question, we're rolling that out pragmatically across the base and across the products over Q2 and then through Q3 and Q4 as we learned, right? We're big on test measure, learn, taking slow steady steps and learning and moving forward.
It's no different when it comes to integration of acquisitions, it's no different when it comes to new products, part of the durability and strength of our business has been creating a very efficient business over a long-term that's patient and thinks about the future. It's no different when it comes to integrating Trello, integrating Opsgenie et cetera. Obviously we've got some great Trello numbers and Opsgenie numbers in the letter. We're very excited about where we are. And both were great product additions to our family for the long term. But at the same time we think about them over a 5- to 10-year time frame and doing the right thing by the customers over the long term. Okay, great. Thank you. And then James I had a follow-up for you. You gave some very helpful color so thank you in regards to the pull forward on revenue and on the deferred revenue line as well. So that was helpful. I just want to make sure just kind of thinking through expectations here and based on some of your comments about how the pull forward is going to impact the second half of this fiscal year and then next year, is it reasonable for us to be assuming that the sequential growth in short-term DR in the March quarter is going to be less than what you experienced in Q3 last year? And I bring it up just because that was a period where similarly, you obviously had a great December and I know you guys measure yourself on a revenue basis. But then, there was a lot of confusion in March. So I'm just trying to think through kind of where would you kind of be helping us think through expectations, just given how enormous this quarter was? Yes, Heather, as you say, we don't guide to that line. But directionally, the deferred revenue, sequentially, in Q2 was obviously very strong. And so, of the order of about $25 million more than was the case in Q2 of last year. And recall that Q2 of last year was the quarter in which we saw effectively the totality of the pull-forward effect. Yes. And so, we'll see how demand plays out in Q3. As I've said, we've been quite pleased with the underlying strength. Generally, you're absent this pull-forward effect. But, clearly, we do believe that there was a material volume, that $50 million type figure that I referred to a little earlier, that is sort of outside the normal sequential deferred trend line.
And one of the other things that I think is relevant to how you're asking the question is that, whereas in some years past this pull-forward effect has been really very largely a renewals effect. This year we saw more of a balance, I would say, between renewals accounting for about two-thirds of the total and about a-third of the pull-forward effect, really in our judgment coming from new activity.
It's easier for us, obviously, to tag the renewals. We know exactly when a customer is due to renew. And so, we can contrast that with when they actually do renew. But we also look in great detail at the trends around our new business. And so, hence my comment about two-thirds renewal one-thirds new activity.
But that latter element is harder to predict. So we'll see how much particularly our partners to have really driven this pull-forward activity pretty consistently over the last three years. It's really not driven by our direct to the website type business. We'll see how that activity plays out in the fullness of time. Great. Thank you very much. Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Hi. This is Luv Sodha on for Brent Thill. Congrats on the quarter and congrats to Jay. It's been great to speak with you over the years. I had two quick questions. One was on the M&A strategy. This quarter has been a solid quarter in terms of cash flow generation. So could you maybe talk about how you were thinking about deploying that cash over the next few years? And whether the philosophy is still doing tuck-ins? Or whether you're sort of thinking about doing something really transformational on that side? Right. Thanks for the question. It's Scott here. I'll just remind like we have a -- we're really proud of Atlassian. We have built out the capability to build products internally, which we've shown over a long period of time. We have an ecosystem and marketplace that allows us to augment our products with things created outside Atlassian. We had $1 billion of lifetime sales. And we've – one of my proudest moments of doing this deal is when you meet people outside the business who have built their entire careers building around Atlassian.
And then of course, we have the ability and track record of bringing in acquisitions and successfully introducing them to our existing customer base and integrating with our products to create a solution and experience that is harder to do outside having the products under our table.
So we've got a pretty good track record of M&A. We've done dozens of acquisitions over time. We have a great team here. And I'm always reminded that the statistics are against the companies – are having accretive shareholder value to M&A. So we're always very careful about how we think about it. And culture fits the most important thing that we think about and first and foremost.
Then we look at do they share our mission? Our missions only the potential to retain. And so can we accelerate their mission by bringing us together. And then we will get – did that have a similar business model to us. And then afterwards we then look at geographic footprint and technology and so forth. So that's the philosophy we've taken. I think we've done a really good job.
As we looking forward, as you would know, we wouldn't be talking about any potential candidates on our – on the call like this. But just know that over time we'll continue to do M&A in a similar fashion to what we've done historically. Great. Thank you. And just one quick follow-up. I know margins were really strong. And obviously, some of that was because of the headcount that you guys are pushing that into the back half of the year. But over the longer term, should we expect to see sort of more leverage on – especially on the R&D side in terms of – on the margin expansion? No, I would just reiterate really what we've been saying now for some time and that over time, we would expect the opportunity to expand our free cash flow and operating margins. But we are very focused on this very large market that is in front of us
We're exceptionally well positioned to go after it. And we want to make sure that we're making the right moves that will allow us to do so to the best of our ability and that will be a very good outcome for our shareholders in our view. So no change in our perspective around margins. Got it. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Hey, guys good evening. Of course, Jay congrats and good luck on all things. Two questions. First one for Mike and Scott. A lot of the development and acquisition has been, let's call it on the ops side. And yet you do have lots of products in the more technical dev side what you call co-built and shipped Bitbucket SourceTree Bamboo. And there's been a lot of visibility of companies in that space building consolidated platforms. Can you talk for a minute about your strategy in that more developer centric side of the business? Thanks for the question, it's Scott here. Yes that's called DevOps is the trend and the name that people are giving to that. And just a reminder for people who aren't maybe familiar with exactly what that is. You've seen a trend in companies over the last 10 to 20 years where due to the changing pace of business you see more and more departments working hand-in-hand with HR. And we saw that 20 years ago with Agile, which was software developers working closely with business analysts and then the business side in order to make things happen faster and more effectively. And what we're finding now is that as customers move to the cloud, as they start building more and more software becomes part of their business that you're seeing the development teams and the operations team those people supporting a software that's running -- they're coming closer together in order to make faster cycle times.
And as a sort of any relatively nascent market there's a lot of noise around it. There's a lot of different people doing very small point things and the part that we play really well in which is what we've always played well in is having a broad portfolio of products. And the advantage of that is that those portfolio of products touch people across the entire life cycle. And so when we -- well the DevOps, we don't just look at it how to dev and ops get together, it’s okay well how do the entire business understand what is happening and bringing all that together. And if you look at our product portfolio, it runs all the way from business EVO using Confluence to right requirements and discuss what the customers need all the way through to Opsgenie which is waking people up all the night if something goes wrong, and because we cover that broad base that's why customers turn to us because our customers aren't looking for just very small point solutions.
Now whether there's new things in the market because it's changing we have an ecosystem integrations and a partner network all that allow us to work and collaborate with those point solutions that don't make sense for us to build out or they're nascent. And customers will do -- Atlassian is the sort of be the backbone for how it work moves across their organization even if there are maybe slightly difficult work that get used in niche products. Okay. Thank you. And then very, very quickly for James, I think you made similar commentary on this last year. But you did say pull forward out of fiscal 2021 as well. So how should we think about that at this point which is obviously early? Yes. So, obviously, the long-term deferred revenue kind of gives you a sense for what will play out in the second half of fiscal 2021 in terms of that roll off activity. And then in the short-term deferred revenue line, again, I think of Q3 as being the primary donor quarter of revenue into Q2 and then other effects -- lesser effects in Q4 of FY 2020 and the first half of fiscal 2021. Thanks, James. Thanks everybody. Your next question comes from the line of Jack Andrews with Needham. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Hi. It's Khanh Ngo filling in for Jack this afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. You guys made some previous comments that you don't expect material revenue in FY 2020 for cloud premium for Jira Software. Can you provide an update to the impact on the quarter of cloud premium? And separately for those that do choose to upgrade what's a typical uplift? So I'll take the first part, no change to our view that our cloud premium products Jira Software Confluence JSD, we're very pleased with our launch of those products. But I wouldn't expect those to have a material impact on our fiscal 2020 revenue. Yeah. And then the uplift is – 2x is basically the entry point and then it diminishes there as you have more volume – you get into the higher tiers and have more volumes of users. Great. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho your line is open. Please go ahead. Thanks very much. Congrats everyone in the quarter. And Jay, you've been a tremendous add to Atlassian best of luck in whatever you do next. So, for Mike or Scott given that we're beginning a new calendar year, customer budgets being reset, strategic priorities being mapped out et cetera. I'm curious to hear your expectations as it relates to adoption of DevOps as well as broader collaboration across IT? Are you expecting continued steady progress or are there any changes in trajectory that you think we could see in 2020? Yeah, mate, it's Mike. Look, I think continued steady progress is what we expect to see. Obviously, development as a whole, the creation of software technology-driven businesses extending into DevOps and how that flows through the rest of the business, is a growth area of investment for companies large and small all around the world. So that's great space to be in. And our products that then work off that as we work to more and more teams is a very strong space. But I don't expect to see any major changes in that at a broad scale.
From our perspective obviously, we continue to see advocate for and feel pull from the customers over the move from server and on-premise products to the cloud and that's something that we continue to talk about, continue to see, and continue to work with customers to manage that sort of decade-long transition that's happening there. I think we're doing a really good job at the moment, but there's always work to be done.
And you can see that in our continued enterprise releases on the cloud side, continued releases of migration tooling for our customers and our partners, to help those companies to move to the cloud and get access to all of those features and the benefits of running the software in the cloud. And you've seen us over the years continued to release Cloud Premium, as we just talked about. Access, which is a great product for Atlassian and for the customers in terms of protecting their users and content across a large number of cloud services, and then things like pushing the scale limits and other things to the cloud as well as our channel and other things moving into that direction. So that's probably the biggest move we're going through and expect to see continued momentum of this year. That's great. Thank you. And then just maybe a quick one for James. It's hard frankly to find much to pick at this quarter. But your net new logos up 5,000 were a little lower, I believe in the year-ago period. Just wondering, if there's anything that you would attribute that to? I might take that, Gregg. I mean, as we said before customer count can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. But this quarter is in the range with where we're really pleased and its healthy growth year-over-year at 17%. Some of the fluctuations in any given quarter up or down can be influenced by pricing and packaging changes. We've talked about things like new monetization levers in Trello, naturally free plans in Cloud, and we talked about the headwind effect on revenue. And so those things can be puts or takes in customer count. We're pleased with the early signals from some of those long-term it was like free plans as we mentioned earlier. And that's ultimately going to add to the long-term growth opportunity that we focus on at Atlassian. Okay. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Hi, thank you very much. James I wanted to target this question to you if I could. And it really relates to the March quarter revenue guidance and the question is what's different from last year? And what I mean by that in the context of if I think about the December 2018 quarter, the timing of the price increase was roughly the same. The impact of the price increases was roughly the same probably a little bit higher in the December 2018 quarter. And yet if I look at the -- and if I look at the revenue and sequential growth in December 2018, it was about 12%. You guys did a little bit better than that this quarter. And yet you're guiding revenues to decline sequentially in the March quarter -- March -- this March 2020 quarter. Last year you actually grew sequentially off the same set of attributes I just described over 3%. So I'm trying to understand why you think revenues will be down 3% when in similar circumstances last year revenues actually grew sequentially 3%? Yeah, Keith I'd really bring us back to this discussion of the pull-forward activity that we've been talking of. Yes, we have that one point of revenue growth headwind that I referred to and broke out on one of the earlier questions. But the pull-forward activity is significantly more material to answering your question.
And so really that's what I would point to. Recall that this was the first year where we had raised prices on our data center business. And that as I indicated a little earlier was really quite strong. Our partners around the world but particularly those in EMEA or in APJ really took that on board. In fact we have given them additional incentives to drive data center business as we think about the margin structure that we share with our partners.
So really that's what I'd point to as to the Q3 guide. Again we're very pleased to from a full year guide perspective have been able to add to our previous guide, the full beat that we were able to record in Q2 plus additional moneys beyond that as well. So quite -- with the overall… Yeah, just to interject if I could. It appears again last December quarter you had pretty material pull-throughs. In addition to it the numbers just would seem to suggest that the guidance even with those pull-forward since the situation was similar last year does seem a tad conservative. I'm just -- it may be what you said in terms of there was more new customer activity this year than perhaps renewals. But otherwise it just seems extraordinarily conservative for the March quarter? Yeah. Well, as you say the new activity was a larger proportion of the pull-forward total than we have seen in the past. And so that's our judgment and we'll see how much of that new activity in essence in Q2 was a replacement for what would otherwise have played out in Q3. But also you'd consider that the deferred revenue increment that we recorded in Q2 sequentially was really quite substantially different to that we saw in the prior year as well. So, those are the things that have helped us arrive at our expectation and therefore guide for Q3. Okay. Jay, good luck to you. Thanks very much. Thanks, Keith. Your next question comes from the line of Ari Terjanian with Cleveland Research Clinic. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Yes, this is Ari from the Cleveland Research Company. Thank you for having me on the call and congrats on the great results. Two questions if I may. First, just any update on demand for Jira Align and if you've seen any deployments there? And how you're thinking about it for 2020? And then just a bigger picture question, we hear more about on our work just people -- partners using Atlassian as kind of a more generic low-code app development platform. Can you just give your thoughts on how you view Atlassian in that regard? And if maybe Forge is a further step in that path? Thank you. Yes, this is Jay. I'll take the AgileCraft or the Jira Align question and then hand it over to Scott. We are really pleased I think with the results in the quarter and the continued demand that we see. And as we've said before, we feel like we're in a really good position to own the large-scale Agile transformation initiatives that are bubbling up at some of the world's largest companies. And this is the segment that we target with Jira Align. It's already a segment that is ripe with massive adoption of Jira at the TEAM and Tribelon [ph]. And so connecting all of that collaborative work that exists in Jira up to the strategic level of these big organizations is a huge and really important opportunity for us.
And maybe one anecdote, just a couple of weeks ago, we hosted four companies that were all Fortune 100 companies that took a day out of their busy schedules to just spend time with our field operations teams and talk about the work that we're doing with Atlassian broadly but also with Jira Align and the role that I just described. So short answer is, it's going great. Scott here. I'll just continue on the question about low code and Forge. We've been in the business for a while now. And one of the powers and particularly Jira and most of our products is the flexibility that they all got. And we were chatting with a large Australian bank just last week. And their workflows across the bank are mission-critical all implemented inside Jira. And that's HR workflows, the [indiscernible] workflows, it basically manages their entire business. And of course that also helps the Jira Align. Might be more work that's in those products the more you want to get a kind of top-down view on how and where work is happening. And if you think of where we're investing there, that's a huge opportunity for us to take more of these business workflows.
We've invested in a simpler Jira interface, we call that the next-generation Jira. And I'm delightful to use -- for everyone, it's business users can create drag and drop workflows, fields get going really quickly. But the extensibility of Jira is where technical teams turn to because they can use it as a no-code environment drag and drop. They can then augment that with low code as in by writing functions or integrations to other systems and the improvements we've made as I said with the UI ones and the interface. We've also as you've seen we've acquired a product in automation. And that's what we increasingly as customers are more and more working into our products. They want to make sure how do they reduce the amount of time they spend on that work. And so automation makes that a much more appealing thing for our customers. I've gone for a very long time, but that is an area that we focus on. And of course when you graduate in actually coding, we have all the products that are available with all Jira and allied DevOps products for those people that need to write kind of coding and integrated development environment. Awesome. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Kees with Summit Insights Group. Please go ahead, your line is open. Great. Thanks for taking my question. And I'll add my kudos to -- congrats to the quarter. I guess I wanted to -- among other things get a confirmation. I'm seeing to how you guys are talking about the quarter on both the market where you are with the demand. You're talking about -- you're bullish in terms of the market, you feel good in terms of where you're positioned you're confident in terms of the strong demand. Is it fair to say then that you haven't seen much competitive thrusts or changes from some of your peers including a very big one out in Redmond?
And then also especially since you're also talking about you're still seeing a lot of spreadsheets, a lot of users are still on spreadsheets. Is this fair to say that you still see a lot of greenfield opportunities?
And lastly another thing which is probably a challenge with other software companies especially software companies going cloud is technicals -- gaining technical staff. You're looking to ramp up. And you self say in your shareholders ambitious your R&D staffing for the second half. You're not going to make any changes in terms of where your R&D centers and your R&D hiring plans are going to be for the second half is that also fair to say? Jonathan, it's Mike here. There's a lot in that question. If I start from the back forward. Absolutely look we're -- if there are a few things that define Atlassian, it's a combination of our long-term focus, patience, openness with shareholder staff and everybody else, and our ambition to unleash the potential of every team.
This is a good example. As we wrote in the shareholder letter, we missed on execution this quarter when it came to hiring and some of the things inside the business and that's not a good thing. That's something we've got to improve. And we're committing to continuing to do that and we're open about doing that.
The R&D hiring environment, I think any company will tell you is not simple, not an easy thing to do. And we're trying to scale the company patiently, but urgently at the same time and we're just being open about. Sometimes we don't hit that. We didn't this quarter. We've got to redouble our efforts the next quarter and the quarter ahead, doesn’t get me easier from here. But sometimes that's going to happen and we're pretty honest about that.
From a competitive standpoint, look Luxio [ph] has lovely coffee, that's important. We continue to treat competitors the same way we always have. We're very aware of what they're doing. At the same time, we focus on the customers and the value we deliver to them and we've long believed I continue to deliver great value products and we're patient to show value to customers, it will come back to us in value for shareholders and for employees over time.
We've demonstrated that over almost two decades now and we don't intend to change that stance. It's baked into our business model. It's baked into the ethos and thinking of the founders and then hence it's been baked into the company, in our DNA at a very deep level. Competitive environment will always shift. Development – software development is a very competitive area. The collaboration space is a very competitive area. We're very positive on where we stand and we're going to attack that by focusing on our customers and making sure we're delivering value for them in their needs. Whether those competitors are large companies, small companies, startups, open source projects, we'll continue to be aware of what they're doing and focus on delivering customer value. Great. Good luck. Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call over to Scott Farquhar for closing remarks. Thanks everyone for joining the call today. And we really appreciate all your support and look forward to keeping you updated on our progress. I hope you have a great rest of the week and an amazing weekend. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

Thank you for joining Atlassian's Earnings Conference call for the Third Quarter of Fiscal 2020. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of Atlassian's website following this call.
I will now hand the conference over to Matt Sonefeldt, Atlassian's Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Atlassian's third quarter of fiscal 2020 earnings conference call. Thank you for joining and supporting us. On the call today, we have Atlassian's Co-Founders and Co-CEOs, Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes; our Chief Financial Officer, James Beer; and our President, Jay Simons.
Earlier today, we issued a press release and a shareholder letter with our financial results and commentary for our third quarter of fiscal 2020. These items were also posted on the Investor Relations section of Atlassian's website. On our IR site, we also posted a supplemental presentation and data sheet. During the call, we'll make brief opening remarks and then spend the remainder of time on Q&A.
Statements made on this call include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.
You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Forward-looking statements represent our management's beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made. We disclaim any obligation to update or revise them should they change or cease to be updated. Further information on these and other factors that could affect the company's financial results are included in filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including the section titled Risk Factors in our most recent 20-F and quarterly report on Form 6-K.
In addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-IFRS financial measures. These non-IFRS financial measures are in addition to, not as substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. There are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-IFRS financial measures versus their nearest IFRS equivalents, and they may be different from non-IFRS and non-GAAP measures used by other companies. A reconciliation between IFRS and non-IFRS financial measures is available in our earnings release, our shareholder letter and in our updated investor data sheet on our IR website. During Q&A, please ask your full question upfront so that we can more easily move through to the next speaker. Also, please be patient if we encounter any disruptions or challenges and logistics, given we are individually dialing in from our homes across the world.
With that I'll turn the call over to Mike for opening remarks. Thanks everyone for joining today and for your continued support. We want to start by saying we hope you and your loved ones are safe and healthy. We are in unprecedented times. It's more important than ever that we embraced our mission to unleash the potential of every team and support our staffs, customers and communities. As you've hopefully read in our shareholder letter, we are confronting this crisis head on. Rapid economic change shapes up industry leader boards, and we will continue to position Atlassian to drive long-term growth in the coming quarters and years.
We will leverage our resilient culture and the strength of our business model to take share in the massive markets that we serve. Over nearly two decades, we've learned to navigate and adapt to macro change. While we plan to play offerings in this cycle, we also acknowledge that the macro economy presents some serious headwinds. During Q3, our performance was unscathed. We posted strong results with 33% year-over-year revenue growth, 6,200 net new customer additions and solid profitability. At the same time, the reality of serving over 170,000 customers means we have exposure to the small business economy and COVID-impacted industries. We have provided much more detail and many other updates in our shareholder letter that was issued earlier today. We are committed to emerging stronger from this storm, and our culture will help us set our direction.
Before we move to questions, we want to thank our employees for demonstrating incredible resilience and adaptability in becoming a fully remote TEAM under pressure. It has been difficult, and our hard work has never been more important as we support millions of teams across the world.
With that, I'll pass the call to the operator for Q&A. Your first question – thank you for calling. [Operator Instructions] Your first question from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo. Michael, your line is open. Everyone's speechless with the results we have delivered this quarter. Great. Maybe we'll come back for Michael. Your next question from the line of Arjun Bhatia with William Blair. Mr. Bhatia, your line is open. Mr. Bhatia? And your next question from the line of Arjun Bhatia. And your next question from the line of Jack Andrews. Hi, good afternoon. Can you hear me okay? Just, fine. Great, thank you. Thank you for taking the question and glad to hear everyone is doing well in this environment. I want to ask something about the – something in your shareholder letter. You mentioned that I think 23% of your attendees from your recent Remote Summit came from business teams, which was essentially double from 2019. I was wondering if you could just talk about what is really accounting for that increase there, whether there's something that's happening organically or whether you've pivoted your marketing message. And then the second question would just be any early feedback on the new cloud enterprise product. Thank you. Hi, I'll take the first one. I think it’s just an indication of the continued interest and how broad our products can be deployed and a diverse set of audiences they serve. I mean, Remote Summit lowered the barrier to entry to Summit. So it could be that there's a lot of interest from a line of business participants in our product and users of our product that may not want to travel all the way to San Francisco for an event, but we made it far easier for them to join an event, meet – and I think that's something that we'll continue to explore going forward. And I think Mike will take the enterprise cloud question. Sure, Matt. Look, cloud enterprise to those who don't know was our latest addition of our cloud products that was launched at Summit a few weeks ago. It's certainly been one of our most important and challenging initiatives in R&D over the last few years. It does give us a full ladder now of cloud additions to meet any customer size. If you count three standard premium in our enterprise with, of course, access for identity and content management across the set, that enterprise addition helps us meet the needs of the, obviously, the largest and most complex enterprises that want unlimited scalability, data residency, the complex security needs to come with that, et cetera.
Those are obviously extremely hard to build to meet those requirements. And those requirements are incredibly prudent for the largest enterprises in the world as they move to the cloud. We obviously had a very good reception to that announcement of the early access program at Summit. We don't expect it to be a material contributor in FY 2020 or even in FY 2021 as we get those larger customers ramp up. But obviously, in the long-term, it's an incredibly important initiative. In terms of existing feedback from those large enterprises that have joined the early access program, it's been very good. Obviously, we spent a lot of time with them before that, making sure that we were building what it was that they wanted, and it was just a validation that we're on the right track with that addition. And your next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James. Hi, good afternoon everybody. You guided slightly below the street for next quarter and commented that COVID would impact fourth quarter more than the current quarter, if this is a good quarter. I was wondering if you could speak a little bit more specifically about where COVID and the emerging recession will specifically impact the business.
You mentioned SMB, for example, you mentioned COVID-impacted industry. So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about that calculation. And my follow-up question would be what you think the impact of all of this will be on the pace of software development projects being rolled out, and of developer hiring and how that might impact you guys in the next 12 months? Michael, it's Scott here. I'll talk to the broader theme, and James can talk about the fiscal impact. As you well know, we have 171,000 customers around the world, everything from Fortune 10 to most of the Fortune 500 and tens of thousands, we talk about the Fortune 500,000 being our market that we do. We have no strategic customer concentration. No one customer makes up more than 1% of our revenue. So there's not sort of a specific area there. But of course, as you expect from such a broad market that we're exposed in the same way that you would be kind of across all the different geographies and industries that we're in.
I do think there is a sort of short-term benefit of people using our products in terms of the work from home aspect they're using collaboration tools more in the short term. I think the long term, the aspect is that people are going to work remotely more than they have to date. That's going to require more collaboration tools, whether that is collaborating on work product in Confluence, whether that is managing more workflow in Jira versus talking to the person next term at a desk.
So we see that there's some benefits of that over the long term. In terms of pace of software development and hiring, I think we're 6 weeks into this, it would be too hard to talk about that as a broad industry trend. We haven't seen anything that makes us significantly change what we believe internally about that. James, do you want to talk through any test specific financial impacts there? Sure, thanks, Scott. Yes, as we said, pleased that really a negligible impact from COVID-related factors in Q3. We have seen some impact in April. And in terms of the fact that we serve such a highly diverse set of customers really across all business sizes, geographies and industries, is really one of our major business model advantages. And the reality of that is that when you're serving that mainly customers, we are going to have exposure to the small business economy and to those particular sectors that have been particularly impacted by COVID.
Now of course, this is reflected in the guide. And yes I would particularly emphasize that, that guide underpins some very beneficial aspects of our revenue model. Recall that over 90% of our revenue comes from existing customers. And indeed, over 85% of our revenue is recurring in nature. So overall, we're pleased with how the business performed in Q3. We feel like the guide reflects the impact of the coming quarter. Okay, thanks guys. And your next question from the line of Arjun Bhatia with William Blair. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. You mentioned in the shareholder letter that cloud migrations were up 60% this year. How do you think the pace of this migration plays out over the rest of the year, given we're in a bit more of an uncertain and maybe IT departments are a little busier just trying to keep the lights on. And sort of related to that, we'd just like to hear some early feedback that you're hearing from the cloud enterprise program that you launched. Sure, Matt [ph] I can certainly crack that. Look, in terms of migrations, let me start there. We continue to monitor, obviously, how that will be affected. I wouldn't say we've seen much of an effect other than the normal growth in migration so far. It's probably worth noting – the larger you are as a company, it's obviously a large IT transformation project. But once you've moved to the cloud, you have reduced impact in terms of the operational load on your own team.
Effectively, Atlassian takes care of a lot of things and you would have taken care of yourself. So depending on your increased workload in a COVID environment, it can actually reduce your workload quite significantly as an IT department to let us handle a lot of the bits and pieces. And that, obviously, as you get smaller down the chain, that can be more pronounced if you are a 500 user customer, or a 100 user customer. So we remain vigilant as to how that will affect the growth we've seen in migrations, which has been really good so far.
It's worth noting that's been increased by the release of the Jira Cloud Migration Assistant, which is a tool we shipped during the last quarter that allows Jira users, predominantly Jira Software, Jira Service Desk to pick up and move their data to the cloud much more easily. And so it helps you through a lot of the more complex transition work. And that's obviously increased both the pace and the accuracy of those migrations which has been really good.
From a cloud enterprise perspective, I don't have a lot to add to what I said before, obviously the early reaction to the ERP from customers who have joined it has been very good. Largely along the lines of that this is the addition we're looking for. This checks a lot of the boxes that we made, from the highest and most demanding customers with good scale, performance and security requirements. We'll move into assessment mode and have a look at this. And we are working together with those early access program customers to make sure that cloud enterprise continues to evolve to meet their needs. Perfect, thank you. And James as a quick follow-up if I may… Sorry, I lost you there. Can you hear me now? Yes. Okay. Sorry about that. Yes, I was just asking about how you're thinking about price increases this year relative to what you've planned and whether those plans have changed at all given the increased uncertainty. Well as you know we have a very thoughtful and rigorous process to considering pricing moves, and we've been doing that for some years now. When you think about what we've done in years past, it's in a balance between lowering prices and in some instances raising prices. And to layer on top of that as well, it's important to think about the additions, the strategy that we've been pursuing in recent times. So now with the roll-outs fully of the free additions of Jira Software, confluence and Jira Service Desk, that compliments the standard additions, the premium additions and as Mike was speaking of earlier now, beginning to roll out the enterprise additions as well.
So, the additions represent another way in which we can be paid for the incremental value that we are offering our particular customer. And our customers are able to align their needs with the right addition. And so that will be an ongoing part of our strategy in years ahead.
And then in terms of a specific price, we'll always obviously be thinking through all of the different relevant factors, both competitively and relevant to our customers. So we'll always be looking to find the right balance between being compensated for value that we offer to our customers while being cognizant of doing the right thing for our customer set as well. So we'll keep having that perspective around pricing, and we'll update you in the months ahead. Perfect, thank you. Your next question is from the line of Rishi Jaluria with D.A. Davidson. Alright, thanks for that. That's a new way to pronounce my name. This is Rishi Jaluria from Davidson. Thanks for taking my questions guys. So two, first I wanted to appreciate the commentary that more resilient model because 90% of our revenue comes from existing customers. I just want to drill down a little bit more into that. If we were to kind of take a snapshot of any given year how do we think directionally of new business with a new year, how much comes from existing versus new. And following up on that, if you were to think about your penetration within your existing customer base, I'm sure you're pretty under penetrated right now. But directionally, what do you think that opportunity just within the existing customer set looks like? And then I've got a follow-up. Well certainly, we've noted that 90% of our activity of our revenue each quarter comes from our current customers. So, we tend to add a lot of new customers each quarter, Q3 was another example of a very nice number, additional customers. But those tend to represent a relatively small proportion of the dollars that we generate each quarter. So it's very much the bulk of the dollars coming from our Expand Motion. And of course, we have a variety of ways in which to expand across products, across additions that I was just referring to in the earlier question, in terms of expanding across a broader part of that customer, serving more of the groups at that customer, and so forth.
And so we routinely talk about the fact that we believe we're early in our work to address these very large markets that we serve. So we continue to be very focused on the long term opportunity and very confident about our ability to address that real opportunity. Okay, great. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, you did talk a little bit about with the guidance, the SMB side of the equation. But I wanted to think about industry exposure, right? Obviously you're very well diversified across industries, but if you were to think about just your exposure again directionally to some of the more impacted industries like travel, hospitality, retail, energy. Just wondering if you can give us a sense for how big that exposure looks. Thanks. Sure. Again, we really cover all industries, all sizes of companies and all geographies. That's one of our terrific business model strengths. And so, yes, we obviously serve some of the companies, but like in the travel sector that would be particularly hard hit in the last several weeks. But really the focus of where we’ve seen an impact is on the smaller sized company end of the spectrum. In fact, it was notable to me how one of the larger FRS deals of March, it was with an important travel services company. The deal took a few more days to close and actually rolled into the early part of April. But at the end of the day I was very comfortable with the terms that we settled upon. And the customer was very appreciative of the fact that we have worked with them to help them through that particularly difficult time.
On the smaller end of the spectrum, obviously that's where we have more of our cloud customers, recall, that we've spoken now or a couple of quarters ago about the fact that we have more than 125,000 cloud customers out of our total of, most recent figure today reported 171,000. So we do skew in our cloud business to a full size of organization.
Taking a step back from that more broadly, I'd say we're holding steady across the enterprise and large enterprise portions of our business. And on the cloud side, going back there for one last thought I've been pleased that while they say there are some customers that who are seeing an impact. I've been very pleased by the number of new cloud customers who have been coming to us both in the month of March and thus far in April. In fact, March was the strongest month for Q3 for the addition of new cloud customers. And of course that's lining up with a month in which we had fully rolled out our three offerings as well. So, really we’re quite encouraged by the developments there in terms of continuing to attract new cloud customers. Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you. Next question is from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo. Hey there. Thanks, good afternoon. I was hoping to hear more around the decision to play offense here in this backdrop. It sounded pretty clear in the letter that you are planning to keep pace in terms of hiring and play offence here in the coming months. Can you just spend a little more time in terms of what that means from your perspective? Are there any specific areas you see yourself maybe pushing even a bit faster behind? And are any of those impacts showing up here in the free cash flow guide, we saw somewhat of a reduction here as well? Thank you. Sure let me take that from my side and Scott or James can jump in. As I think we felt it was really important in line with our values. So one of our company values is open company, no [indiscernible]. We wanted to be very clear with investors and partners about how we were approaching the current environment, which is obviously, unusual, it's not business as usual at the moment. And I think as a company, you have to choose a long-term strategic path with very clear thought as to why one is choosing that path because this is going to play out over many, many quarters.
When we sit down and think about it like – strengths, beside the fact that we are in very large markets. We have a capability to actually gain share through these quarters with turbulence. However, they come at us, and we remain very adaptable and thoughtful about them. Our culture is extremely strong and adaptable. Obviously our go-to-market models, you're presumably well familiar with, suits the flexibility of these type of environments as we don't have to get on a lot of plains to sell stuff. We have product innovation and we have an extremely strong, obviously, financial position in terms of generating free cash flow as well as obviously, the cash we have on the balance sheet in the business and the stability of our revenue streams.
So I think when you put all that together, it's – hopefully shows some of the background why we feel confident to take that strategy as we sell into the coming quarters and years about how we are planning to approach that and why we are choosing to communicate that. Scott, maybe you want to go into a little bit about the actual effects of what that means? We listed a couple in the letter. Yes, I will touch on them again. The types of things that we've done in the past. And Mike and I would hopefully consider ourselves still fairly young in the business and we we've been running last year and since I started in the dot-com crash in 2001. And we remember the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, pretty clearly. And some of the things we did back then and what we're doing again now is picking up great key hires and talent that's available and that we could – maybe wouldn't be on the market otherwise. So that's doing well.
Customer acquisition, we've – 12 years ago now, we released starter licenses and reduced our price from $1,000 down to $10 for many of our products. A few months ago, we launched free and those in free effectively to that $10 down to zero to aggressively try to acquire customers. And also, I think that increased product innovation, continuing the R&D investments that we are known for and yield great value for our customers. And if there's any opportunistic M&A that turns up we're not necessarily going hunting for it, but like there's often opportunities in this particular market environment where you can pick up things that are very attractive that otherwise, again wouldn't be available.
So, all those things that we're considering and we're discussing in a weekly basis in terms of how to be more, I guess, opportunistic in these times. James can talk to how that flows into free cash flow guidance. Yes on the guide I would just observe obviously we've laid out our revenue guide, the free cash flow guides directionally consistent with that. But then also from a working capital perspective, I don’t know if it's fair to say that we working with a small subset of our customers who requested help in these extremely challenging macroeconomic times. Now this is a relatively small proportion of our total customer base, less than half of the percent, but we feel as though that's the right thing to do. And it's an illustration gain of the long-term orientation that Scott and Mike have been talking about on this call already, just another illustration of that mindset that will work out well for those companies and well for us. That's a great color for me James, much appreciated. Thank you. Your next question come the line of Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Thanks. Good numbers guys. I guess I wanted to follow-up on a couple of things. First of all, with respect to the free cloud additions, great to see that out. Maybe you can tell us on how many downloads you already have. Or any statistics that you can have there that helps us understand uptake, interest, level of interest or conversion rate, anything on that fund. And I know it's early, but some color would – would be appreciated.
And then for James on the perpetual license revenue decline, clearly, I'm assuming this is demand related, but maybe you can help me think about that in the context of how much of that was perhaps customers shifting to cloud versus true reflection of softer business activity? And should I assume that that also is the main area where with respect to your guidance, that's where we see most of the weakness near term. Yes. Ittai, I’m Mike I can certainly take the top part of that question. It could be something else as a tricky name. So that's [indiscernible]. Look, it's still very early, the results are in fact incredibly encouraging. For history, we started rolling out our free editions back in October in a very limited sense as we told you in the shareholder letter. So sort of looking at 5% and 10% of traffic and seeing what the effects were, as we are always very thoughtful with the impact of changes we made to pricing and try to consider the long-term benefit to that. We solely expanded that.
Obviously, with COVID in the current crisis, we decided to accelerate that somewhat and rolled it out fully in March, which is now available for Jira Software, Jira Service Desk and Confluence. Obviously, that's alongside Trello and Bitbucket and other products that already had three editions, and that's a large part of their model already in the cloud.
That have been we didn’t include any closing so far. We can say up to March we had 125% uplift in valuations, which is obviously actually a little bit ahead of where we expected, but is looking really positive for that perspective. I would reiterate, it is extremely early. We did that, I think it's less than four weeks ago now, a little over four weeks ago. So we'd expect a pop-up off of that. And then it settled down to a number, but it's extremely in a good spot in terms of where we think it should be. And we had seen limited evidence so far, I would say, but certainly some evidence that is helping us get into even more markets and rich users we would not otherwise have been able to get to, which is our goal of heading towards the Fortune 500,000, so it's a great step on that particular journey.
Just reiterating the long-term rotation, and this is a great step on that journey. James, I don't know if you want to take any financial impacts of that? Sure. Well I’ll speak to the license part of the question in particular. First of all, recall that in Q2, so 90 days ago we reported quite a significant pull-forward effect that was driven by the price increases that we had announced previously. So, what we saw in part in Q3 was the effect of having activity that otherwise would have occurred in Q3 actually get pulled forward into Q2.
Now, the second point that's really important though is that – and as we've been talking about this theme now for a number of quarters, is that we're very much orienting our business towards continuing to grow to subscription revenue business, the cloud business and the data center business. So you saw subscription revenue growth of 67% year-over-year, very much substantial, the primary driver of the revenue line for the company now. And I would expect that that will continue.
And commensurately, you'll continue to see license moderating over time. In fact, recall that the license line now is a relatively small one. It's a small component of our overall revenue structure. So this past quarter, the absolute dollar figure is $21 million. So I would continue to expect that we'll see less license activity over time and more subscription revenue growth. Thank you, guys. Thank you. And your next question is from the line of Nikolay Beliov from Bank of America. Hi. This is Nikolay Beliov from Bank of America. Thanks for taking my question. I want to double-click on the 60% increase in migrations from server to cloud. Just wondering how do you measure that? Is that based on users, customers, revenue, et cetera? As you saw that uptick this fiscal year, what strength did you see under the covers in terms of customer sizes moving from server to cloud? Did you guys take advantage in more upsell?
And lastly, what have been the partner feedback on migration tools that got launched a couple of months back, as customers move from manual migration to more automated migration, are we talking about significant decrease in the time of migration maybe from months or weeks? Just whatever you're seeing would love to get to hear from you guys. Thanks so much. So Nikolay, in terms of – I have some of my colleagues will jump in as well. But in terms of your first part of the question, the migration statistics that we mentioned for our service cloud activity, they're driven off user count. And in terms of our customer size that is migrating, what we are seeing is that, step-by-step, as we continue to add more capability to our cloud products, as we continue to rollout and increase the capability of the different additions that we've been talking about on this call, then we're seeing more larger companies making that move. And I think we'll continue to see this trend play out that way over the coming years. Mike spoke earlier to the rollout of enterprise additions. So now we're in a position where we can address the needs of any customer size.
And I was going to refer to the helpfulness of those migration tools before you added it to your question. I think that has been an important aspect of us continuing down this pathway of making it easier for our customers of all sizes to migrate their path. Jay, over to you. Yes. I'll just jump on, Nikolay, with the back part of that question. I mean, the migration tools are built both for customers that can migrate without partner assistance, also for partners to basically enable a better, more reliable migration. And remember, like in the partner case, there's a bunch of work that we're going to do around the migration. That doesn't involve just moving data from server to cloud. In many cases, they want to reconsider their workflow. They want to reconsider how their projects are structured.
So we've taken the work out of basically moving data from point A to point B. But in point B, they have an opportunity to rethink what they really want to do or how they want to change the product. In many cases, the server customers have been using the server product for five or six years and so there may be some classification that they want to partner to help them move past. And I think we're going to measure that just in terms of velocity over time, like constantly, both with the partner and with the customer directly, we want to make sure that moving is ever, ever easier. Got it. And just one clarification question, if I might. James, you mentioned, I believe that you saw some COVID impact in the month of April. Can you please give us some color where in the business you saw that exactly? Thanks so much. That’s it from me. Yes, Nikolay, nothing really to add to our previous answers, the April impacts really in the SMB space, with more of an orientation of SMBs to our cloud products. And then obviously, the most heavily impacted industries in terms of the macro impact from COVID, seeing some factor there, but absent that, nothing noticeable to report across industries or across geographies. Thanks so much. And your next question is from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Excellent. Thank you guys for taking my question. Congrats on a very nice quarter. I wanted to follow-up on – I think this is a question that Mike Turits was trying to ask, maybe I'd be a little bit more direct about it. One of the things investors are trying to understand is like which solutions do customers find most strategic and most mission-critical and where you're most likely to sustain demand even through difficult times and which ones are perhaps less – or deemed less mission-critical.
And I think the question we're trying to ask is like, if we look across the solution portfolio, is there parts of the portfolio that people find to be more mission critical? Do you expect the demand to sustain better in? Like if we think about Jira Software less mission-critical and Jira Service Desk more? Or is there any way you could kind of help us out in terms of how the customers are thinking about the mission criticality of the suite, number one?
And number two for James, on the – I know it's a very small percentage of customers, but the customers that are asking for help, is the form of the help that you guys are willing to give, is that just on payment terms and the like? Or are you guys actually kind of modifying existing contracts? Keith, Scott here. I'll answer the first bit about sort of where our products are most mission critical. Now what we've found is that our products because they are workflow products that are embedded in our customers' workflows in almost all the cases of what we do, whether it's Trello or it's Confluence or it’s Bitbucket or it's Confluence for doing collaboration or it's just service sets of serving your customers, your internal help desk, like all those things are baked into our customers' workflows. And so we don't really see them as a discretionary expense that gets turned off when you want to save money, like it's a key to people being productive. And I think we have an added benefit that we're relatively compared to our peers or competitors, we will be well cost to provide that outcome.
And so we – in 2008, we saw some benefit to us because people switch to a low-cost provider to provide those things where maybe they had a legacy provider and they wanted to move. Now – so that's the way I think about it. It's not an area where I'd say we're particularly strong or weak there. Obviously, our customer base, the more embedded we are in our customers, the stickier we are, and so to the extent that more – to be able to customize our products more, which we'd say probably a medium or larger-sized customers have customized our products more. And where people use our third-party marketplace so if two companies look alike, I'd say the ones that have customized it more and have used more third parties, we know are stickier in the numbers.
James, do you want to talk to the next part? Yes, sure. The bulk of where we're working with our customers are really around payment terms. And I'd note that those are changes to our arrangements that are temporary in nature, and that's quite clear in our dialogue with those customers. Excellent. Super helpful. Thank you, guys. And your next question is from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Great. Thank you so much. Just had a couple of follow-ups. And thank you, I know the shareholder letter was longer this quarter, but it was very helpful. My two questions relate to a little bit what other people have been asking. Just looking at what you said about April, are you assuming that spending levels from those affected companies and industries, stay the same throughout the quarter? Or in your assumptions, are you expecting business to actually get better for those affected companies and industries in May and June?
And then my follow-up is just, again, you also highlighted 90% of your revenue comes from existing customers. From the industries that aren't impacted, what assumptions are you making about net expansions, if you will, versus prior periods for June? Thank you. Okay. Heather, I'll take that one. So in terms of the guidance that we've offered, a few thoughts. First of all, I'd say that the philosophy that we brought to setting the guidance in terms of setting the range, placing the range is quite consistent with what we have done historically. We have laid out a broader revenue range. Clearly, with this macroeconomic uncertainty, there is a greater potential variability in our results. And it's certainly challenging to accurately estimate the current environment's impact across such a large customer base.
So we have looked carefully at our experience in April and considered that and our various leading indicators are top of funnel type indicators and assumed that, that sort of situation plays out across the balance of the quarter. So hopefully, that's helpful to that part of the question.
In terms of around the 90% or so of our revenue that comes from our existing customers. I wouldn't add anything other than, obviously, we factor in what we've been seeing in the last few weeks. And again, think specifically about the relevant forward-looking indicators for that type of element of the overall revenue structure. Great. Thank you, James. And your next question is from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. Okay. Thanks. Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho. Hi, guys. I guess my first question, in the shareholder letter, you mentioned that you have over 150,000 organizations on starter licenses or subscriptions, and clearly, it's a very large number. However, there were over 175,000 starter accounts a year ago. And just given your very strong top of funnel, I'm wondering why that has declined. In other words, have you converted a lot of these to paid accounts? Or are there a bunch of them that have just gone away for one reason or another? Hello? Hi, Gregg. I think, Jay, can you take that one? Yes. Hey, Gregg. So I think the macro trend is just the shift to cloud. Remember, like the starter license largely talks about the server end user license for $10. And increasingly, the more attractive value proposition even at the pre-free price was to move to cloud, and that was like the macro trend, people aren't going to install a piece of software, if you can get it for effectively the equivalent price run in the cloud. So that's been some pressure. And then free is a far more attractive place to start on any Atlassian product. And so that's sort of the – I think the macro effect here on the server starter license. Right. Okay. Thanks, Jay. And then just as a follow-up, curious about what kind of demand you saw in the quarter for data center subscription as well as your cloud premium SKU? Thanks. Good. We were pleased with both. I think James mentioned this. But largely the enterprise segment, both just in terms of how we performed in the quarter and then the overall pipeline and traction, we saw both through the quarter and headed into this one with positive, both across data center, both directly and then in with our indirect global channel, and from standard to premium as upgrade pattern in cloud. Perfect. Thanks. And your next question is from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Hi, this is Luv Sodha on for Brent Thill. Thank you again for squeezing me in. First of all, congrats to Jay given it’s his last quarter. And I wanted to ask maybe a couple of questions. One was now with the release of the Atlassian Cloud Enterprise, could you maybe talk about the investment in Enterprise Advocates? I know you guys have a viral go-to-market motion. But the Enterprise Advocates have been helping in terms of phishing Atlassian as a solution set. So what about the investment in that team going forward?
And then the second one, on the M&A front, I know you guys mentioned that you would be more offensive there. Sort of anything in your portfolio that's lacking right now? Or how would you think about the strategy going forward? Thank you. Yes, I will take the first one. So we'll continue to invest in Enterprise Advocates as we have to support the data center upgrade motion in server, both the migration motion from server to enterprise cloud and the upgrade motion from standard cloud to enterprise cloud is really similar. And so I think we'll continue to expand that team to serve the opportunity that enterprise cloud presents, both for existing server customers and moving in for big enterprise customers that are growing.
Remember that we get a lot of leverage in the Enterprise Advocates group, both from our indirect channel that we – that is pretty large and deeply connected to our products and our customers in the market, and we work hand-in-hand with them on that bigger enterprise upgrade motion and selling motion. So we get leverage there, which is why the Enterprise Advocate group can grow modestly over time.
And we get a lot of leverage just from the flywheel. We're landing inside of these biggest customers with a high-velocity starting point that I think we're really well-known for. And then we can use that as a more efficient leverage point to grow customers, both as we have in data center, and it's certainly up the stack in cloud to enterprise cloud. I’ll hand it over to Mike on the M&A question, or Scott on the M&A question? Yes. I'll grab it here. I think the M&A, again, we’ve been really proud of how we've done that. You can build products, you can partner, you can have a marketplace, you can acquire. And I think Atlassian as a company has done all those very successfully over almost over 20 years there. And when we look at acquisitions, the things we always look for is, firstly, are they aligned with our mission to unleash the potential of every team to help us get to our big hairy goal of 100 million active users. Do they fit with the values of our company? Do they fit with our business model? And then there's a lot of long tail a lot of things we really look for. And I think we've been very successful with that approach and a measured approach of making sure that we bring on the companies that are really great fit for Atlassian.
As Mike and I've been the biggest shareholders of Atlassian, we're aligned with all of you on this call and all the shareholders listening in terms of being good stewards of capital and making sure that we invest wisely to get the returns that all of us would want. That’s great. Thank you. And your next question is from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Hi. Thank you very much. I want to ask two questions. The first one is on mix and the second is on COVID. The mix question is probably for James to build on something that was asked before, but perpetual was down year-over-year, and you indicated you had some pull-ins. It actually hasn't been down previously despite some pricing changes. And so as we look out, you said growth would moderate. Would it still be – you think positive numbers we look out over the next couple of quarters?
And the related part of that is on the maintenance side, maintenance has been steady area, call it, 20%, 21% growth for some time. If perpetual wanes, should we start to think about the maintenance side, also perhaps slowing? I would think that would be a long process. But I just wanted to hear a little bit about that, and then I'll ask my COVID question as a follow-up. Sure. So in the perpetual license line, yes, we have been seeing those pull forward effects into Q2 from Q3. And I would expect other of upcoming quarters, the next couple of quarters, for example, to see similar types of pull-forward effects when we record those results. So that will drive the dynamic of whether it's a lower percentage growth or whether it is, in fact, a shrinking of the absolute dollar figure. Again, the dollar figure is a relatively small one at this point in time because so much of the new activity is taken by our customers going straight to one or more of our cloud services.
Now also in terms of the maintenance line, clearly, we have spoken a great deal about our efforts to migrate customers from server over to cloud. And indeed, some of our server customers migrate up to data center as well. So as that continues to happen and continues to build over time, then, yes, there'll be fewer customers executing their renewal of their server contracts. Instead, they'll be taking on data center or cloud contracts. And so yes, you would see that affect the maintenance line over time.
But I think you're right in characterizing that as a more gradual effect the net that you see in the license line because the license line reflects brand-new activity, either a new company coming in to buy our server products or it could reflect a current customer buying additional licenses, more users for their current licenses, that sort of thing. And so I would expect you to see the drawdown most pronounced on the license line but also a similar effect over time on the maintenance line. Okay. Great. That’s very helpful. And then, Jay, maybe in the spirit of this is your last call, direct this one to you. When you think about or talk about COVID and the interactions with the customers, is there any sense about you could give us some dollar exposure to SMB? In other words, is that X percent of your revenues? And B, when you say that you're having some impact, what's the behavior there? Is it less upsell? Is it not renewing the monthly? Is there any feedback you can give on what that means in terms of behavior when you say you're being impacted. And all the best in your future endeavors. Thanks, Keith. I'll start, and James maybe want to tack on. I think we've addressed this a bunch over the course of the call, like we've seen largely – the impact that we've seen has been from the small to medium business segment in cloud, and we saw that in March and continued a little bit in April. And mostly, that is around customers either not expanding at the rate that we wanted them to, or in some cases, reducing their license counts because they reduced the size of their employee population. We're happy – on the cost side, by the way, we're also happy with the rate of new customer acquisition has been where we want it to be. And so I think that's a good positive signal.
And then as I mentioned, the enterprise segment, which is a growing proportion of our business remains healthy, both just in terms of what we did in the quarter and pipeline that we're building. And James you may want to tack on some color as well. No, I think you covered it, Jay. All right. Thanks, gentlemen. Thanks, Keith. And your next question is from the line of Ari Terjanian with Cleveland Research. Thank you so much for having me on the call. Congrats on the results. Two questions. First, you guys just give a little bit more impact. You touched upon it on the shareholder letter, but – and talked about collaboration. But any more examples of how customers may be using your tools and solutions to help address COVID and you think you guys will make more templates, more kind of prepackaged applications to help.
And then second, you talked about take-up of the leaderboard. Are there any areas where you see potential for the greatest share gains over the next 6 to 12 months across your portfolio? Thank you. Let me take the first one. Scott mentioned a bunch of these use cases, but I mean, we become a way to coordinate project activity content. In the case of COVID where everybody's gone remote, I think our products become pretty critical as a way to connect people to what they're trying to do. And so I think there's a bunch of great use cases highlighted in the document, even when you think about something as maybe that seems little mundane is how do we get people back into our offices. I mean, that is a fairly – can be a fairly complicated amount of work with a whole bunch of considerations as we emerge from this and maybe people go back into an office and to work, and they've got to do things like get on an elevator, you have to consider like how desks get spaced out differently. That involves a ton of human coordination and action. And that's typically where our products get brought in to help customers and help teams.
And maybe who is taking the second part, maybe Mike? Yes. I can certainly take the second part of that. Look, the question is where do we expect share gains, et cetera. Look, all of the markets we operate in, whether you look at Agile and DevOps in the software teams market, whether you look at IT and the broader sort of ITSM, enterprise service management spaces or whether you just look at collaborative work management tools whether teams are remote or not remote, right, people are going to change their work styles as a result of this.
So I would say all sort of three of our major markets, we have very small shares, and all three of the markets are growing by themselves. So we expect there to be a lot of opportunities to look there. Scott mentioned talent, it's quite likely that this is a period over the next couple of years where there's a higher availability of talent in different markets that we operate in geographically. That's very important for us.
And I think what's important is to see us just constantly optimizing our business. Again, as Scott mentioned a little bit in 2008, 2009 when we introduced the starter program, which is a little bit of an analogy to what we've done in free and cloud. That really sets the platform to drive a decade of growth across a lot of different markets that brought in tens of thousands of businesses to the Atlassian experience that over time grow up into different parts of our world. And those are companies you see at the moment moving from server to data center or evaluating cloud premium or cloud enterprise.
So when we talk about playing in the long-term game, that's exactly what we mean. We believe this can have an opportunity in three very large markets that we serve, and you'll see us continue to make moves to try to be opportunistic where we see that. You've seen that in free already. You've seen that in hiring. We'll continue to evaluate our acquisition opportunities as we look through that. But we're very positive about what that means to us going forward. Great. Thank you so much. And your next question is from the line of Alex Kurtz with KeyBanc. Hi, this is Steve Enders on for Alex. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to get a better sense of how your partners and sales teams are adjusting to work-from-home initiatives and their ability to drive expansion within your largest customers. And secondly, I want to get a better understanding of, I think you mentioned that you're looking to hire more people and focus more on the R&D side. But where are the biggest opportunities for investment in the product and R&D teams now? Thank you. Hey, Steve, I’ll take the first part. I mean, our sales teams – our direct sales teams are all largely inside, and so – inside teams. And so – they're working largely either from home. They've did work from home in the past or they work in offices, engaging with the customers. So I think that rhythm hasn't really changed.
Partners are in market with customers. And so I think there's an impact there for our partners that can't meet with customers. But we've been working over the past 10 years to help digitize like our solution partners. And so the way that we market, co-market with them, the way that we help generate demand in market combines both offline, which may have a little bit of a pause until we can get back to a different – the old normal. But we complemented that with a whole bunch of online digital demand capability that we will open to them. Just in terms of building pipeline and letting them serve customers, I don't anticipate that we'll have too much of an impact. Yes. And if I could just briefly interject on that, Jay, just to support that, I've been pleased with as I said earlier, we've been tracking very closely all aspects of our financials in April and partner performance has been tracking well. And one of – I guess I can comment on the second part of that in R&D. I’m sorry, I can jump in and take the second part of that in R&D. Look, we still believe we have a massive number of opportunities to invest in R&D. The highlights are certainly things like Trello and Toggl advantage of the change in work style. As more companies are working from home, tools like that are obviously becoming more valuable, Confluence for a synchronous communication, things like this. So obviously, in the product set, there's a lot of opportunities.
Secondly, we're in the midst of a decade-long transition to our singular Atlassian platform, the Teamwork Platform. That's not a simple exercise. It's going to continue to take us years to build out, even though we’ve done really good progress so far. You've seen lots of examples about the new collaborative editor rolling out in Confluence, which is a huge change, involves a lot of changes in identity and other key parts of our platform as they roll through different products.
And then thirdly would be in the enterprise segment, right? We've talked about cloud enterprise, the new addition that we put into early access program this year. That's a massive amount of infrastructural and calculated changes in how we operate our products to meet the demands of our largest customers and scale them in the cloud. That's not a one-and-done exercise. That's a continued R&D investment and requires large-scale changes in our infrastructure and how we deploy products, how we work with data residency, how we work with security, how we work with our company's own networks, et cetera, and still provide the flexible cloud products that we do and scaling for those needs. So you'll see us continue to invest largely all across the board, but hopefully those are the three useful examples of areas where we are investing. Yes, very helpful. Thanks guys. Your next question is from the line of Derrick Wood with Cowen. Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. First question, James, with respect to guidance. If I look at the midpoint, it does imply sequentially down revenue for Q4. And I guess I'm just trying to understand the kind of bigger levers in driving that. Does it increase the dollar churn? Or should we think maybe there's more trade down to pre SKUs or perhaps an acceleration of on-prem to cloud? If you could give some color there, and then I've got a follow-up. So it just points to really three different thoughts. First of all, recall my earlier comments about pull forward activity, so I would expect what we benefited from in Q2 in terms of a pull forward effect. That's drawing from both Q3, Q4 and probably the next two quarters of fiscal 2021. So I think that's important to bear in mind.
Yes, as Mike talked about earlier. We have fully rolled out free as the default option for our entry-level customers. So I would say that the effect there is quite modest. We guided at the start of this year to the impacts that we thought would occur from free during the year, and it was one of three components of a one-point headwind to revenue growth. And I feel as though we're tracking well to that. And then obviously, we've been talking about the impacts of COVID generating the macroeconomic sort of circumstances that are impacting some of our SMB cloud customers in particular. Okay. I guess a broader question. I mean, I would imagine there's a lot of people that are looking for cost optimization right now. Maybe that gives you a window to attract more IT people to your platform. You've got low cost particularly around Jira Service Desk. So can you talk about maybe some new initiatives you guys are thinking about doing to target the IT buyer more aggressively in this environment. Yes. I mean, Derrick, we believe it's an ongoing focus for us. IT is, as we've talked about, is an increasing place that we can land with JSD. And to your point, like we agree, we are, I think, a value choice and a high product quality choice. And that combination, I think, sets us up well in this environment. We'll continue to talk about the IT service management and IT, kind of broad collaboration, service collaboration areas that we focus on, both across JSD and with Opsgenie, and with Confluence and Trello. I mean, there's we've got, I think, a really rich portfolio that we can talk to IT about both to help serve the problems that they're trying to solve internally for themselves, but more importantly, for the problems that they're in charge of for their companies. Thank you. And I will now turn the call back over to Scott Farquhar for closing remarks. Thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. We appreciate your ongoing support, and we hope that you and your loved ones remain safe and healthy. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

Thank you for joining Atlassian's Earnings Conference Call for the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2020. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of Atlassian's website following this call.
I will now hand the call over to Matt Sonefeldt, Atlassian's Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Atlassian's fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 earnings call. Thank you for joining us today. On the call today, we have Atlassian's Co-Founders and Co-CEOs, Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes; and our Chief Financial Officer, James Beer.
Earlier today, we issued a press release and a shareholder letter with our financial results and commentary for our fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. These items were also posted on the Investor Relations section of Atlassian's website. On our IR site, we also have posted a supplemental presentation and data sheet. During the call, we'll make brief opening remarks and then spend the remainder of time on Q&A.
Statements made on this call include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.
You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Forward-looking statements represent our management's beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made. We disclaim any obligation to update or revise them should they change or cease to be updated. Further information on these and other factors that could affect the company's financial results are included in filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including the section titled Risk Factors in our most recent Form 20-F and quarterly 6-K.
In addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-IFRS financial measures. These non-IFRS financial measures are in addition to, and not a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. There are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-IFRS financial measures versus their nearest IFRS equivalents, and they may be different from non-IFRS and non-GAAP measures used by other companies.
A reconciliation between IFRS and non-IFRS financial measures is available in our earnings release, our shareholder letter and in our updated investor data sheet on our IR website. During Q&A, please ask your full question upfront so that we can easily move through to the next speaker. Also, please be patient if we encounter any disruptions or challenge in logistics, given we are individually dialing in from around the world.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott for opening remarks. Thank you everyone for joining today and for your continued support. We want to start by saying we hope you and your loved ones are healthy. This is a dynamic moment in time for everyone, including our customers and our employees. As you've hopefully read in a shareholder letter, we had a strong business result in Q4 and the full-year. We now serve over 174,000 customers, of which 150,000 use our cloud products.
For enterprise customers, we are an increasingly important mission critical utility for enterprises going through digital transformations. Continuing momentum help drive $1.6 billion in revenue in 2020, as well as strong profitability and cash flow. As we turn our thought to fiscal 2021, we have three priorities to help up drive long-term success. First and foremost, just to continue supporting our customers and help them stay resilient and successful.
Second is to continue driving transformation into becoming a cloud-first company. Third, is to make significant progress in our large end-markets, agile development, ITSM, and non-technical work management. Halp and Mindville, the two acquisitions highlighted in our shareholder letter will help us across all three priorities. Because of the macro environment, now cloud focus, fiscal 2021 will be a challenging year. We'll play offense for to the long-term through the short-term headwinds.
We'll make choices other companies may shy away from relying on our past experience to guide our path forward. In success, we continue our transformation into a $5 billion global software leader. We provided more detail in many other updates in our shareholder letter issued earlier today. Before we move to question-and-answer, Mark and I want to both thank our employees who remain a source of strength and inspiration for us during these challenging times. You make unleashing the potential of teams possible.
With that, I’ll pass the call back to the operator. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. And appreciate all the detail and some of the incremental detail that we're seeing in the shareholder letter. In the shareholder letter, you guys did a really good job framing out kind of the impacts that we're likely to see from a more aggressive push to the cloud and the investment that you guys are making behind the new solution. Can you talk to us a little bit about sort of the other side of the value, if you will, of what we could expect in terms of kind of average pricing per customer as they move to the cloud? What's the timeframe for realizing some of the yields on these investments and sort of as we look forward to FY 2022 and FY 2023? What are the expected benefits out of these, these investments you're making right here? Keith, this is Scott first. I’ll just talk about sort of the macro of this, and then James can talk into this, sort of specifics. You know, as we said in our shareholder letter, moving our customers to the cloud is great for them and great for us. In the cloud, we can innovate faster for them, we get, you know, we can make improvements and get feedback from customers a lot faster. And for our customers, they benefit by not having to manage all the infrastructure and servers there and as they do, their total cost of ownership reduces significantly, even as though, you know, we take on a larger percentage of this workload. And so it's great for all of us and, you know, James can speak to the specifics, I guess, about how things might change over time. Thanks, Scott. I’d just add the long-term economics in our view of the cloud are attractive as Scott indicated, both to our customers, but also to ourselves. And we see that in our ability to price in a way that reflects the value that we're creating for our customers. Of course, our customers enjoy the simplification that comes along with not having to operate their own software and servers. And what we intend to do over the medium-term is help smooth the pathway for particularly our larger server customers as they embark on their cloud migration journey.
We talked in the shareholder letter about how today we still have around three quarters of our paid users behind the firewall. And so, we're looking to, in essence, provide discounts to our cloud pricing to these larger server customers as they make their migration. This gives those customers time to adjust their budgets, to be able to realize these benefits around cost and complexity that I mentioned. So, we're comfortable that over time, this will be a good outcome, not just for our customers, but very much for our shareholders and our long-term growth. Got it. That's super helpful. And maybe I could sneak in one follow-up. I was hoping you could give us a little bit more color on some of the recent acquisition, and in particular, how you think that changes your competitiveness, particularly in areas like ITSM? Thank you guys. Sure, Matt, I can take that. How are you doing Keith? Look, we announced the Mindville acquisition today in, along with our shareholder letter. So, I hope you've all seen that and again, Halp, as Scott mentioned in the intro remarks during the quarter. Look, I think it goes to our, both of these go to our long-term philosophy that there's a line between IT and software development, that's increasingly becoming blurred. As the team is building software, the teams operating, deploying, and managing that software are becoming ever more shared or collaborating a lot more. And you can see that in both acquisitions.
It takes us further towards being the only company I suppose that has a broad platform for all sorts of technical team workflows. You can also look at Mindville specifically, as just a part of a sort of steady long-term progress of delivering more value for customers in the IT market. You know, obviously, with Jira Service Desk and Opsgenie and now MINDVILLE and Halp there. It is, as we've mentioned before, the fastest growing part of our business that is operating at large scale and this will go, you know, we think only continue that trend.
In terms of Mindville specifically, you know asset management or CMDB was the most requested area by customers of feature area, I suppose in that offering as people were taking it beyond a service desk into a broader service management offering and is a very prudent decision, we know the Mindville team well and I think we will work extremely well together. You can see that also in the shareholder letter we cited the example of Balyasny, which is a great customer example of large companies switching to the Atlassian platform for their broader, you know, ITSM needs. Excellent. That's super helpful. Thank you guys. Your next question comes from Alex Kurtz with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Yeah, thanks for the question, guys. So, I think there's a lot of investor discussion inter quarter about whether you would raise prices this fiscal year, fiscal 2021 given COVID and the impact you saw in the SMB space last quarter. So looks like in the shareholder letter, you will be, you know, pricing will be used, so maybe some additional color about the extended time versus prior years? Well, I can jump in and take that one. I think we should really start by focusing on how we are very mindful of the challenges that our customers are facing in this macroeconomic environment, and we've reflected that view in a variety of our actions over the last few months. And pricing is another illustration of this point. So, yes, there would be some benefit of price in terms of our overall growth rates in fiscal 2021 year-over-year, but I would really describe this as a modest impact, certainly, versus the experience of the last three or so years.
So, I think that's very important to get context around. And then I just further say that where we do move forward with pricing actions it will be very much in support of our overall strategy that we've already been talking about today extensively around, accelerating the move to the cloud for our customers, given the benefits to them and given the benefits to our long-term model as well. So, only modest benefits from price in fiscal 2021 and very much movements that will be consistent with our strategy. Okay, thank you. The next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Thank you. This is [Caroline] on for Heather. Just jumping on the different strategies that you're going to be using to migrate customers to your cloud product. I was wondering, given that you listed a number of them, I mean, price cloud discounts is one of them, but you talked about partners R&D, new products migration tools, I was wondering if you can rank order those in terms of like which one do you think you would have the most impact? And then also on the discounts for enterprise server customers, I was wondering if you can give us a little bit more color on the terms of those discounts. And also, like, you know, weighing that versus the fact that last year you did a number, you did raise prices on server customers. I'm trying to figure out, how does that impact the migration versus the discounts you're planning to give? Thank you. Yeah, hi, I can take the first part of that. Caroline, I'll leave the discounting section to James. In terms of the strategies, look, by far the most important strategy is just building a kick ass cloud offering. We've spent a lot of time and energy making sure our cloud products, the additions, the offering we have, and all of the capabilities is the best Atlassian experience that customers will get. If we don't have that, all of the other strategies aren’t going to be very, very helpful.
Second most important strategy, as we would say, is reducing the friction that takes for customers to move themselves over there in the long-term, and also giving them clear guidance about where we are investing, and how we see that transition happening over time. These are long-term moves, right. And customers make prudent investment decisions about how they're managing that, but at the same time, there's a lot of friction we can remove in the process.
You've seen that in our migration assistance that we've shipped and continually upgraded to allow you to keep your server and cloud instances running and live as you move your data over to allow you to do test runs of the data movements and all these sorts of things, right. All of these reduce the difficulty and the frictions of customers moving their data and the usage and their users across to those offerings, which as I said, we continue to make sure the best example of using Atlassian products. And then you had various others, as you mentioned, partner strategies, pricing strategies, and all sorts of other things.
I think, you know, our long-term consistency on all of those areas is probably the most important thing next to building just a really consistent offering. You've also seen us I would say; in terms of building that great offering continue to ladder out the different additions to cater to our breadth of customers that exists on premise. So, obviously, you saw the introduction of free in the last quarter or quarter and a half, and then the launch of enterprise at the end of last quarter in the cloud to handle the needs of those biggest customers.
It's still in our early access program, but it's going very well so far. That addition map in the cloud is something we didn't have to two, two-and-a-half years ago and we'd really work hard to continue to build out to not to all of the different customer segments that we have.
I’ll pass to James for the explanation of how cloud pricing discounts work. Yeah, Thanks Mike. I’d just say, as you look at our list prices for our different deployment options, there's clearly a significant delta between the server prices and the cloud prices at different points along the user tier scale. Similar, but less so in terms of the comparison of list price between data center and cloud, and this embodies the recent price changes that we've made over the last few years. And so, while there is this list price delta, it's really important that we work with our customers to make sure that they are able to focus on the total cost of ownership equation, which we believe is attractive for them, particularly when you add to that the very significant investments that Scott and Mike have been talking about us making in our cloud products over a number of years now.
So, the concept behind the discounting that we talk about today is very much to give those server customers a multi-year ladder to gradually get them to the cloudless pricing, and that gives them the time to work internally within their organizations to sort through unlocking the cost savings, the complexity savings from not having to operate their own software, but instead tap into high quality cloud services. Got it. Thank you so much. Your next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Okay, thank you very much. Good afternoon, guys. In the shareholder letter, you mentioned that you would be making several short-term trade off in addition to the greater discounts for migrating server users to cloud, as well as the more modest pricing changes that you've been talking about, are there other steps that you also plan to take over the near-to-medium term that would amount to some sort of economic trade off or does that essentially capture it? I can jump and take that one, Gregg. The other things I would just refer to really are the fact that as we continue to emphasize the cloud, invest in the cloud, help our customers migrate over to the cloud. Of course, there’ll be a reduction in the volume of our server revenues. We talked in the letter about the license line, which is now a relatively small part of our overall revenue base, only $20 million in Q4, for example, that license line during fiscal 2021 reducing by about half, and then the maintenance line. So, the annual maintenance for server customers staying about flat, and so this is very much what we've been talking about for a while now as we emphasize the cloud, emphasize moving to the cloud from behind the firewall products, particularly the server products.
So this is very much the continuation of that clear theme. And of course, the maintenance line has been heavily benefiting in recent years from price increases. So that's worth remembering as well. And I'd expect that that theme around the license line and the maintenance revenue line to build gradually, so more of an effect in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year. And then the other thing just to remind everyone off and I'd say this is a smaller element of the overall equation, but we have been able to help a number of our customers who have been under particular pressure economically in this COVID driven environment, and we’ll continue to support customers in fiscal 2021.
So that's also a part of how we're taking decisions that help our customers for the long-term. Yeah, impacts us in the short-term, but we think that's absolutely the right thing to do. Okay, thanks James. I was going to follow-on from James there. You know, I just think that could be getting into all the specifics of all the different things we're doing. The way we think about it is just we want to be good stewards of capital for the long-term and the time horizon we're comfortable making those investment decisions on doesn't fit necessarily within an [eight quarter, an eight] fiscal year, and you know, so we know, through the 2008, 2009 downturn, when we invested throughout that it really set us up for another decade of growth and whether it was starter licenses to $10 or, you know, we saw about 10-years at Atlassian over the last year and a bit, we've had a lot of 10-year Atlassian’s that we hired during that 2008, 2009, they’ve been amazing people that, you know went on the market beforehand and haven't been on the market for the last 10 years. And so, we'll continue to hire, and we'll continue to do things like free that set-up our funnel really well.
We'll continue to be good partners with our customers, and generous with them in order to maintain a long-term goodwill. And so, it will be all those types of things, most of which I think, have a meaningful numerical impact that we're aware are in our shareholders letter, but that doesn't mean that there are other ones that we're doing every single day. Okay, that's really helpful. And then I'll follow up if I may, because that's actually a good segue to the introduction in March of, you know, free cloud versions across Jira Software Confluence and JSD, which clearly has long-term positive benefits. You already have talked about the uptake in users that have signed on to those free additions, but I guess the question is just around, you know, net new paid logos, which obviously were much smaller than usual this quarter for that specific reason. And I was just wondering, because we do have a couple of things at play with the introduction of free versions, and of course, the pandemic, if it was possible, sort of estimate roughly how much your net paid ads may have been impacted by the pervasive presence of free, perhaps by looking at the historical run rate of those net new customers who were paying for starter additions, or you know, any other way that you might be able to measure that perhaps? Thanks, Gregg it’s Scott, we’ll do Scott first and then James can follow-up. Look as you know, [indiscernible] for a while our new customer number bounces around a lot. It's not something that we guide through all we spend a lot of time on a day-to-day basis, you know, trying to aim for, and you know, in this quarter, we had an expected impact. We, you know COVID had some impact in terms of now with 174,000 customers we’re exposed to every industry on the planet, you know, every sized company from large and small, and you know, some of those smaller customers churned as a result of COVID.
And the other part is free. As we said, that frees open the funnel, but it also differs, you know, the time period by which people migrate and upgrade to our paid instance of our products. And so that’s a longer conversion cycle also has some, you know, short-term headwinds against our customer numbers. So, but we're really pleased about that, you know, free itself is at 150% increase in signups as I mentioned in our shareholder letter. So, everything in that signed is really positive and against based our long-term investments there, and as I said before, it started licenses a similar program 10 years ago, you know has paved the way for the last decade of course.
James, anything you wanted to add to that? Just a couple of points. First, I’d note that our gross new ads of customers, so ads before any consideration of churn, they were remaining strong throughout the quarter. So, we're pleased that our continuing ability to bring customers into our products and services for the first time, but yeah, churn obviously was what drove the lower net customer ad number. I just really echo the fact that it was very much a blend between COVID driven macro-economic effects and the broadening access to free versions of Jira Software Confluence and Jira Service Desk.
I note on the COVID driven impacts that we saw the greatest impact in April, less of an impact in May, and then again less in June, and so as you take a step back and think about the macro economic impact and free, you know, we believe that both of these drivers will ebb over time in terms of their headwinds to customer growth. Obviously, we're not trying to predict the duration of the macro environment, but at some point that will ebb, but having said that, I would expect that in fiscal 2021 the customer addition number would show higher variability for both reasons, COVID driven and free driven as we work to monetize those free customers gradually. Your next question comes from Nikolay Beliov with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Hi. This is actually Jacqueline on for Nikolay. A couple of questions, I guess this first one was for James. In the past, you've told investors to look at revenue growth instead of billings growth; it seems like the growth rates have diverged even more recently, can you talk about the percentage here? Well, thanks Jacqueline for the question. We do continue to believe the revenue growth is the best way for investors to think about our business. When you consider that now, around 90% of our total revenue is recurring in nature; we're very comfortable that revenue is a strong reflection of the underlying demand for our products and services.
So, one thing I'll certainly note is that the cloud business has a blend of subscription terms. So, about three quarters of our customers take monthly subscriptions as compared to our data center and server businesses being typically annual type terms. And we note in the shareholder letter to illustrate this point that at the end of the fiscal year, about 25% of the deferred revenue was cloud based, while a little less than 50% of the revenue was cloud driven. So, that's the only thing I would add, but we still very much focus on revenue growth as a very fair measure of our progress. Your next question comes from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Hi, there. Thanks. Good afternoon. Most of the investor questions we're getting are around the guidance, some of the color across revenue segmentation you’re providing, James you mentioned the magnitude of expected impacts to license and maintenance here, the one segment you're not explicitly mentioning their subscription, just wondering, is there anything additional you can provide for us and just thinking through the related subscription impacts that could just help us and thinking through the overall mix and offsets here going forward in our models? Well, thank you for the question. I would just note that we would expect the subscription revenue line to continue to grow very nicely over time, both the cloud business and the data center business for those who need an on-prem solution over the medium-term here, a lot of opportunity in front of both of those. On the cloud side, where obviously we're primarily focused, we're seeing obviously very strong adoption in terms of those new customers coming in 95% this past quarter, and we're also seeing nice building volumes of migrations, and we expect that to be continuing in the coming years. So, that's really the effect there. Of course, remember we've talked about the fact that for those larger migrating customers, we will offer discounts to smooth that pathway that I was referring to earlier. Your next question comes from Arjun Bhatia with William Blair. Please go ahead. Yes. Thanks for taking my question. [Indiscernible] for Mike or Scott. I read in the shareholder letter, you know, that seemed to be a lot of focus on servers or cloud migrations, I'm just curious what role you see the data center offering playing at Atlassian in the long-term, you know, is this a bridge skew until cloud can handle some of these larger customers, which seems to be relatively soon or do you plan to keep it around longer-term even after customers are comfortable scaling with cloud? Yes. Hi, Jim, I can certainly take that. Look like data center is a critical offering for our customers. At the moment to make sure that, you know, the largest scale customers, as you said, can manage their own environments right where they have a desire to or a need to. There's no doubt that we're continuing to build out the cloud offerings to handle larger enterprise volumes, to handle the – obviously increased needs, right, in terms of scale, in terms of security, in terms of data locality, all sorts of SaaS based needs for our largest enterprise customers.
As you can expect, the slowest customers to migrate we think over the long-term will be the largest customers, which will mean that data center offering is, you know, it's important for those customers for a long time prone. It also has to be a part of their planning right. As we are clear with the customers about where the best long-term experience is and we help them to manage that migrations; at the same time, we have to be clear with them that those offerings are important and part of their planning, right, both on the data center side and on the cloud enterprise side.
I would say that, you know, as part of our continued long-term communications, we remain driven by customers in this right. We do, it's worth saying we do get a lot of requests from customers that are large to move to the cloud, right? And so, it's not a one-way traffic at all. We tend to be very, very, very customer driven, and try to be prudent in how we think about helping them with that movement over time. Your next question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please go ahead. Hi, thanks. Sorry to beat a dead horse on the cloud question. I guess in the letter, you talked about a 60% uptick in cloud migrations, I think, on the server side, any anything you can tell us around, sort of how much greater you expect the migrations to be in fiscal 2021 versus 2020? And any color you can give us around types of customer’s products, and I guess you've already kind of answered the question on additions, but just curious more color there, especially on how we should think about the magnitude of the uptick of migrations into the next year? Sure. Hi, Walter. Look, the first thing I would say is, in terms of magnitude or in terms of migrations, obviously, we've continued to build that, as I mentioned before, the product quality and the depth and the breadth of our offerings in the cloud. So, one would expect that to increasingly point to larger scales of migration, right, just as the sheer quality of the offering has improved. The biggest thing that we've done in the last year is to continue to improve our migration assistance and working with partners, both of which have had very positive impacts.
The Confluence migration assistant, for example, shipped about 18 months ago; I would guess the first version. We've had two or three versions since then as we keep improving it. It now has more than 95% of all Confluence migrations go through that migration assistant. So, as those migration assistants do work, we have to keep tuning them and helping customer’s data move through those migration assistance. That really, really helps that journey become less friction-full and then it's all about our communication. The customers planning, you know, they're going to move this quarter, next quarter, next year, whatever that's part of their planning.
I mentioned the Confluence migration assistant because it's our oldest and most invested migration assistant. The Jira Software migration system is a lot newer, so that shipped in March, and you know, we continue to work on how to improve that. That's only about 50% of migrations at the moment. So, as you would expect, as we improve that migration assistant, and the longer it's out, we’ll see more Jira Software migrations in the year ahead than we have in the year behind. And similarly, the Jira Service Desk migration assistant is in, I believe is in beta at the moment, and will continue to rollout throughout the year.
So, I think you will see increased migrations in the year ahead, both through the offerings we have, and then the migration assistance is continuing to improve, as well as I would call out our partner network, right, continuing to improve their capabilities, their services, their experience, their history in migrating customers, because especially for those logic customers, we have an awesome network of partners around the world that help them to manage that migration, maybe they're moving things along the way, returning the offerings to their businesses. So that's, you know, that's a human power that helps, but take some time to learn and get experience in managing those migrations. Your next question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Thanks. Great quarter, guys. I have a few questions. First of all on cloud enterprise, can you talk about what percent – I know it probably clearly doesn't apply to all of your customer base, a small subset of it, but maybe you could talk about how much of your revenue you think can be captured by cloud enterprise? And I'm trying to, kind of gauge, first of all, what percent of revenue is exposed to this? Do you think that can be upgraded? And also, what would you – is there an average price increase I can think about relative to the premium tier that cloud enterprise reflects? It’s Scott here. Thanks for the question. I'd take it back to, I guess our principles, which is we want to be able to serve all of our customers in cloud and we have our free edition to the very smallest of teams, and until recently, it was just free and standard. And, you know, as we’ve looked to make sure that we can handle all those customers, we have gone to premium, and now enterprise.
Now, enterprise is still in a closed beta with customers. So, we're not in a stage where we could talk to, you know, overall customer demand or you know, specific pricing on that product, but when we think about it, you know, enterprise use target at the lives of their customers that have very specific needs around data locality, performance, scale, and other things that where we believe we can provide a specific offering for those customers.
So, too soon to kind of answer specifically to your questions, but we're committed to handling all of our customers, including the very largest of customers in cloud, and as I said before, that, you know, we save a lot of money for those customers, you know by handling the total cost of ownership because we can run it cheaper and better than they can. Your next question comes from Robert Majek with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Thanks. Can you share some feedback from the partner channel, which represents a quarter of total revenue on how they're evolving their practices as you accelerate the shift towards cloud products? Sure, I can take that one. Look, I think any large scale shift in our business like this is going to impact the partner channel, right. So, you clearly see that in that feedback they're used to working out how to help customers in a certain manner, and then having to evolve and helping them in a different manner. This creates opportunities and creates challenges for them, and you get both in the feedback.
For example, as I mentioned, migration services for, you know, the last year or two and the next few years will be a good source of revenue for our partners in terms of helping our customers to move, not just [sheerly] picking up the data when running the migration assistant, which the customers can probably do themselves, but in terms of how should they think about their business, which has probably changed in the cloud like that they need to think differently, do they need to set it up differently? Do they need to manage it differently in terms of doing that?
Second, the offerings like cloud enterprise, and the new extensibility capabilities we have in the cloud are very exciting for partners. They create a lot more opportunities in the cloud world to manage the customer’s instances, manage how they do things. Again, cloud enterprise being multi instance, so you can set up as many Jira instances as you want to manage your work, creates a lot more flexibility for the customer in terms of data management, how they want to manage projects, how they mentioned content in Confluence, and the partner can help them manage that method closer than ever before to their business to make it a better fit.
So, I would say, as a whole, although the partners have made huge strides already in managing that transition in their business, you know that they continue to work with us and we continue to communicate very much. So, how that's going to change and work alongside them as we go in that direction. Just want to add something there. Mike did a great job explaining that. If [indiscernible] how much of an asset our global partner channel is, you know, we have just a huge range of partners, you know, in tackling, you know, verticals and those partners are also key in our marketplace, which has been a huge strength for us and you know, creates stickiness in our products, and they've done a great job of building those marketplace apps, now cloud and of course, that allows them to be more sticky.
So, I’m glad you brought up the question because it does speak of the huge benefit we have of this global partner channel, and particularly where we don't have to have, you know, post sales, you know, professional services people on the ground around the world, and we can leverage our partner channel to do that as a huge source of strength for us. Your next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Hi, this is Luv Sodha on Brent Thill. I had a couple of questions. First one for Mike and Scott was around, you know the R&D investment, it sounds like you guys are still going to keep the hiring speed up in fiscal 2021, and you know, this year you guys had an impressive, you had the free cloud editions, you launched premium, so like what are sort of the feature sets that, you know this R&D investment is going to be focused on going forward? And then the second one was around the demand pipeline, so I know James, you provided some color around, you know, the demand pipeline being the most impact from COVID-19 in April, and then improving sequentially. So what has been implied in the guidance for the first fiscal quarter that you provided? Thank you. Yeah. Mike. Great, great question. Look, I think we've obviously got the COVID background as we've talked about, right, and whether the recovery, you know, sort of slowly comes back like a marshmallow or snaps back quickly, like a rubber band, that is, you know, that's out of our control. However, what is in control is our ability to continue to invest prudently and for the long-term. So that we can, you know, we can come out of this strongly, however that happens.
In terms of where the R&D dollars are going, that doesn't change, right. And it shouldn't change because of COVID or any or any background circumstances. So, as we continue to say, we're trying to build an amazing platform for helping teams work across lots of different markets, you see that obviously going into the cloud platform continuing to build out the enterprise capabilities there, as well as on things like free and helping the smallest of customers get started, and just make their teams more efficient, right. That doesn't change.
We continue to have some amazing opportunities in terms of the markets ahead of us in software, in IP, and connecting those two markets as well, as you've seen with the Mindville acquisition that we announced today, as well as in the broader work management for all teams, you know, aspect. Trello continues to power along really well and we're happy with how that's going, Confluence continues to become a broader offering, and we continue to work on our overall platform of tying things together.
So, just high level, we're really excited about where we're investing our R&D. We do think about that in the long-term. And as Scott mentioned earlier, you know, we're continuing to invest in hiring and in acquiring the best talent that we can into the business so we can build things for our customers. And I can just add on to the second part of your question, in terms of the COVID impact that we saw in Q4, I picked out of around $10 million in revenue in the quarter, and that was predominantly on the cloud side of our business, which you would expect that's where we tend to serve our small and medium sized business type customers. We saw some weakness there, particularly around some of the smaller tech companies that we serve. And then of course, particular industries were heavily impacted by COVID-19, and then we saw impacts right across the customer size spectrum within those impacted sectors.
So, around 10 million for the quarter, that includes a subset of that 10, relates to some of the help that we gave to certain of our customers. Although I'll note, it was a relatively small proportion, less than 2% or so of our customers came to us for one form of help or another. Looking to fiscal 2021, we're assuming, again, we're obviously not trying to take a call on the macro or on the timing of the trajectory of COVID, but we're assuming that there would be effects throughout fiscal 2021. So, net-net, it would be a bigger effect in fiscal 2021 than what we've seen to date. Your next question comes from Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. Please go ahead. Thank you so much. This is [Jerry] on for Pat. Just two quick ones from me. First, how do you think about M&A going forward? And then maybe on the COVID impact, can you maybe touch on what you saw in July, and how that compared to June? Thank you so much. Scott here. I’ll take the M&A question, James can take the COVID impact one. M&A hasn't changed for us. We've always viewed M&A as one of the areas that we are great at, along with building and developing new products along with our marketplace of third party apps that we provide to our customers. It's sort of because one arrow in our quiver that we can deploy, and nothing's changed.
We believe that the most important thing companies need to have that we're interested in looking at is that they align with our mission that they, you know, are around unleashing the potential of everything, and you know, then it’s culture, food, and other areas. So, we're really proud about M&A. And we've always been prudent stewards of capital and that hasn't changed through COVID. Like always, if there's opportunities to buy things at a reasonable price that makes sense and add to our product portfolio in areas that we're already looking at, we will do that.
I will say that the valuations haven't come down as much as many people we expected during this time. And you know, we're in no rush to sort of go and deploy capital in areas where we don't believe we can get a great return. James? Yeah. I’d just add that we’ve been discussing how the challenging impacts of COVID lessened as Q4 progressed. I would just observe that in July so far, we've seen a continuation of that theme, but I really would want to emphasize it early in the quarter and I'd be not looking to draw too many conclusions here. Obviously, the macro factors are really hard to predict and we've seen economic openings in certain geographies followed by less or more restrictive economic conditions. So that's what we've seen so far, but I would be very cautious about going too far with that. So, our next question comes from Derrick Wood with Cowen. Please go ahead. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about business outside of SMB, outside of distressed verticals, and maybe looking at your more stable verticals, and your more enterprise type customers. I'm curious, you know, given the impact from kind of worker displacement and supporting hybrid work enabled, then what you're seeing from a demand perspective, you could argue, maybe, yeah, investments in collaboration and workflow would rise, but you could also argue companies still are very much in tactical mode. So, would like to hear how you're seeing conditions and you know better performing verticals. I can start on that one, and then Scott and Mike perhaps you want to jump in, but we feel as though we are very much in the center of important transformations, digital transformation is only being accelerated by the macro economic developments that have played out in recent months, and we feel that our products and services fit that need for where our customers are going. And I would just also add how we were very pleased about the larger enterprise end of our customer base.
As to the large spending statistics that we published, we've traditionally published numbers for customers spending more than 50,000 and $500,000 with us, and those customer accounts grew by 44% and 56%, year-over-year. And then a new statistic for us, as we continue to scale is the number of customers spending more than a million dollars with us. And so we were delighted with that number increasing by 76% year-over-year. So, I think illustrative of the breadth of what we have to offer, the relevance of what we have to offer, I’ll leave it at that. Your next question comes from Rishi Jaluria with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. Hey, guys, thanks so much for taking my questions. Just two quick ones. First, diving a little bit more into the term discussion, you mentioned in the past that your retention rates are about 98% for those customers spending [over 5k], has that been consistent, you know during COVID or has there been changes with what we've done the customers who have larger bills versus just a total customer as a whole kind of the whole? And then on a cloud revenue side in the shareholder letter, you said slightly less than half of revenue is cloud. To be clear, that's just the actual cloud revenue that's not including marketplace, correct? Because then that's telling us that about 80% of that subscription bucket would be your actual cloud. It's definitely lot higher than I expected, but just wanted to get a sense of that direction, the right way to think about that. Thanks. So, in terms of the last part of your question, the cloud commentary, you know, obviously directional rather than terribly specific, recall, obviously that the marketplace has been growing nicely for us on the cloud, but traditionally, the marketplace has grown up around server and data center apps we're growing very nicely in the last year and a half or so. So, we expect more growth to come on the cloud side of our marketplace, but that's a smaller components today of that overall, at that line, a revenue mix. And then the other elements of your question, if you want to come back to that? Your next question comes from Ari Terjanian with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. Thanks for taking the question. Appreciate it. Wanted to follow-on on the large deals are growing customers spending more than million, can you give an update on what's driving that, any update on Jira line, and as you look into FY 2021, with Cameron as Chief Revenue Officer, any changes to go to market strategy you're contemplating with your own direct sales force or with partners? Thank you. Thanks. There’s nothing changed our go to market strategy. Over the long-term, I don't expect it to have any new terms in the near term either. I'll go to market strategy has always been when customers bottoms up and where they need help assistance. You know, we provide that for them. You know, over time as the deal sizes get larger, you know their engagement with us, you know, they want a sort of person to talk to, but that engagement is almost always after they're already a long-term customer that last seen and they're looking to expand either to a mission critical data center instance or zero line for, you know, reporting into the [C-suite].
I've spent a lot of time with e-customers recently, you know, that are engaging with our zero line product, and what we're seeing there is a digital transformation use a CEO level and board level concern amongst many of our customers and they are, you know, it’s still very early in the digital transformation roadmaps, you know, many have engineering teams, but they've been working in a waterfall fashion. They're not moving fast enough to keep up with today's demands. And so they're looking to vendors like ourselves, to help them, you know, unify all their [dev teams] from the moment they come up with an idea all the way through to launch and maintaining and running it. And so that involves an entire product suite.
And you know, as they look to do that at large scale, they need products like Jira Align to manage their portfolio often thousands, if not tens of thousands of developers they have building products for them. So, in short, no changes to our go to market, and we say again, all of our product portfolio playing out as we expected, which is we are the only vendor that can handle both end-to-end and the scale that our customers are operating at. Hey, I just wanted to circle back, I think we missed the first part of Rishi’s question. We moved on to the next question real quickly, but it does dovetail nicely into what Scott was talking about with the go to market evolution and how we continue to look in a long-term at improving our model. Rishi asked about the retention rate for customers north of $50,000. And I just wanted to say it's been holding steady through the COVID challenges, so continued retention among the large customers. We’re happy with as we continue to be mission critical part of their infrastructure of their – how they run their companies, as you'd expect that retention rate is holding well. [Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from Jack Andrews with Needham. Please go ahead. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. During the quarter, you announced a variety of integrations between some of your products and third party DevOps tools, and so just philosophically speaking, I mean, how much do you think of the DevOps lifecycle that you're interested in addressing directly versus partnering with other third parties? Scott here, I appreciate the question Jack. If I look at COVID customers and explain what we do, there's a lot of, if you think about the broad market, there is plan and manage, you know, kind of what are we going to get done across our organization and in that space, you know, Jira and now Jira Align, and other products are totally ubiquitous there. You then have what, you know, kind of writing code, testing code, deploying code. And in that space, there are thousands of different vendors and different startups happening every single day.
And Atlassian plays a really important part there with our coding tools, with our deployment tools, and so forth, but there are – our commitment to our customers in that space is that we will integrate with everything in that space and everything that space because of our market presence and our customer base, they are incentivized to integrate with us and so our brand promise no spaces.
You know, we have things for you. And we have some of the most important pieces in that space, but I think it's silly to any vendor to promise to be all things to all people in that space, given how quickly technology changes and how people write code evolves over time. And then at the other, sort of the very end of that when we say, okay I want to manage, run, and support these products, that's where we increasingly been spending time with all of our ITSM investments with Jira Service Desk with opportunities that are [words], people, you know, when you have issues.
And so, in that area, we know we're still in the stage where every time we add a feature, we gain more market share there, it's still very early. But what customers look to us across all of this is that they want, [indiscernible] single pane of glass that tells them where are they spending time, you know how they are managing these huge amounts of people that are involved in digital transformation with their writing code, or they're designing user interfaces, or their frontline support people, you know, when the products go down in the middle of the night, they want something that coordinates all that work, and we're the only vendor that can do that end to end.
And so, you know, being the integrations we announced in DevOps were, you know, par to that, you know, effectively demonstrating again, like no other vendor can do that. We are that single pane of glass no matter what you use at a sort of detailed level, DevOps, whether you use our products or use a third party Atlassian is the only vendor they can sort of go out to the C-suite, and then down to the people writing code in the trenches. Jack, I just wanted to add one thing there. You know, Scott, and I've always believed it's incredibly important to communicate our philosophies of how we think about the world as much as the actions we’re taken on a quarter-to-quarter basis. I hope you can see that in our shareholder letters. We're, you know, we're long-term thinking people. We've built a long term thinking business. And we believe that the shareholder letter as much as anything else is about philosophy of how we think about the world.
I think you can see over the last, almost 20 years now, and you will see continuing on we're extremely pro interoperability. So, you asked about integrations and how that works. While we obviously make sure our own applications work incredibly well, together. We think it's incredibly important as software continues to evolve that interoperability between the best of breed vendors, between all vendors that customers show up with is incredibly important. You've seen that in our partnerships continue to evolve with Slack and with Zoom and with Dropbox, all of which I believe had announcements within this quarter, and continue to work well with the thousands of different integrations that we have.
This also plays well into our cloud journey, because integration interoperability in the cloud is even easier than it was in the on-premise world because of the standardized endpoints. No one has to upgrade their software; it's all running on the latest versions. So, we think that's going to be an increasingly important part of our story. As Scott mentioned in development and IT areas, but increasingly in work management for all in every area, and I think that's a really good philosophical stance for us to have and only increasing as a strength of us going forward. There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to Mike for closing remarks. Just wanted to say thanks to everyone for joining on the call today. Appreciate all the time and thoughts and your ongoing support as investors and as shareholders and stakeholders in our business. I hope you and your loved ones are safe and stay safe throughout the quarter and we'll talk to you shortly. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining.

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of Atlassian's website following this call.
I will now hand the call over to Matt Sonefeldt, Atlassian's Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Good afternoon, and welcome to our Q1 Fiscal 2021 earnings call. Thank you for joining us today. On the call today, we have Atlassian's Co-Founders and Co-CEOs, Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes; and our Chief Financial Officer, James Beer.
Earlier today, we issued a press release and a shareholder letter with our financial results and commentary for our first quarter of fiscal 2021. These items were also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website. On our IR site, we have also posted a supplemental data sheet. During the call, we'll make brief opening remarks and then spend the remainder of time on Q&A.
This call will include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.
You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Forward-looking statements represent our management's beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made. And we disclaim any obligation to update or revise them should they change or cease to be updated. Further information on these and other factors that could affect the company's financial results is included in filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including the section titled Risk Factors in our most recent Form 20-F and quarterly 6-K.
In addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-IFRS financial measures. These non-IFRS financial measures are in addition to, and not a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. There are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-IFRS financial measures versus their nearest IFRS equivalents, and they may be different from non-IFRS and non-GAAP measures used by other companies.
A reconciliation between IFRS and non-IFRS financial measures is available in our earnings release, our shareholder letter and in our updated investor sheet on the IR website. During Q&A, please ask your full question upfront so that we can easily move through to the next speaker. Also, please be patient if we encounter any disruptions or challenges. Lastly, we’ve announced two additional items in conjunction with our financial results this quarter and we filed Form 6-K announcing the successful close of a $1 billion senior unsecured delay
draw term loan and a $500 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility.
Second, we've announced that we will host a Fiscal 2021 Virtual Investor Day on Tuesday, November 17 at 2 P.M. Pacific Time, but we're able to organize for that over the next 24 hours to our IR website. We hope to see you there. With that I'll turn the call to Mike for opening remarks. Thank you, everyone, for joining today and for your continued support. We hope you and your loved ones are healthy during what continues to be a dynamic time for everyone, including our customers, partners and employees. We hope you've taken the time to read the shareholder letter. This quarter, we've been transparent in describing the many different long-term initiatives that we're focused on as a company. This includes our recent announcement focused on migrating our customers from server products to the Cloud. In Q1, we posted strong results, adding over 8,600 net new customers, generated $460 million in revenue up 26% year-over-year, and realizing solid non-IFRS profitability of $61 million in free cash flow.
We've got several product wins as well, including achieving FedRAMP certification for Trello Enterprise, strengthening our partnership with Slack, launching Atlassian Ventures, and closing the Mindville acquisition which accelerates our ability to offer customers a comprehensive ITSM experience. Looking forward to the rest of fiscal 2021, we’ll continue to focus on playing offense for the long-term. All of our choices and actions focus on making our customers successful and drive us through $5 billion and beyond. Before we move to Q&A, Scott and I both want to thank our employees who continue to be an inspiration for us in these challenging times. Thank you for sharing your passion with our customers, especially as they move to the Cloud. You make unleashing the potential of all teams possible. With that, I’ll pass the call to the operator for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Hey, there. Thanks and good afternoon. On the Cloud migration, I'm sure there will be a number of questions on it. Obviously, super early and appreciate there's an Investor Day upcoming, which we're certainly all looking forward to. But any initial feedback you've gathered from customers and partners early on to share? And I
think it's unquestionably the right strategic decision. But in terms of the risks to be aware of, how you think about the potential friction, a hard and fast timeline can add to the equation. And you mentioned some of this in the letter as well. But can you talk through some of the steps you're taking to help ensure this transition as frictionless as possible? Thank you. Hi, (inaudible) this is Mike. Hi there, can you hear me? This is Mike. We can hear you now, Mike. Thank you. Sorry, apologies for that. As I was saying beforehand reaching it, because I was on mute. The customer feedback has been lastly as we expected. So, we've had the expected range of responses, I would say, our customer base has been awesome and coming to us with questions. We've given a long timeframe here. So there's multiple years. So when you sit down with the customers and explain how you've got us here to make a decision. This is a three year end-of-life timeframe. And there are a lot of options for you. Our teams have done an amazing job with content to help customers through that journey. So we've got, I think 10, or 12 different language translations, there's a million plus words of content out there, which I'm told is longer than the entire Harry Potter series.
So this has really been an all company effort to make sure that this is handled well with a customer first lens and tries to be as clear and empathetic to customers as possible as we move through that. Obviously, as we discussed in Q4, we think we're ready to make this transition. It's been a long-term journey, we've been working on for a long time. And this is just the next step on that journey, particularly.
We've had more than a decade long history now building Cloud products and a multi-year investment in our Cloud platform. And we really believe, as we showed from more than 95% of new customers choosing today, we're at the right particular time to move our customers across. But necessarily this is an announcement that for some customers it's a little interesting to receive. And I think the team has done a fantastic job. And we will succeed in guiding everyone through that over time. Great color. Best of luck. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley, your line is open. Thank you guys for taking the question. Really nice quarter, this quarter in terms of the new customer. I don't think we've seen a number that strong in quite some time. Two questions, well one question on that. In the letter, it sounds like you guys don't expect that level of customer gains to maintain on a go forward basis, if we talked about why not like sort of what is going to bring those back down on a go forward basis and then maybe one for James.
On the guidance for the full-year and the slowing down, it seems to seem that like the line is going to have to slow down for the remainder of the year. Like I get what's going on with license I get what's going on with maintenance and in the marketplace, I don't quite get kind of what the pressures are on subscriptions, could you dig into that a little bit for us and sort of why the shift towards Cloud doesn't have a more immediate positive impact, at least on the subscription line? Yes, Keith, I would go and take both of those. So first of all, on the customer edge, yes, we were very pleased with that figure. A couple of things though, that I think probably did help somewhat in this quarter. First of all, you recall that in Q4, we had a relatively low customer add number. And what we talked about there was COVID related churn effects impacting some of our cloud customers in particular. And I think part of what we've seen here is in essence, a little bit of a pull forward of that churn from Q1 into Q4, as those customers were experiencing, obviously, very tough macro economic conditions.
And so I think some of those who perhaps might have churned in Q1, under normal circumstances, ended up churning earlier in Q4. The other thing I'd point to is that we obviously as you know, have really established free versions of Jira Software Confluence and Jira Service Desk in the market now. And as a result of doing that, we've curtailed our Cloud Starter offering.
And so for those folks, we've seen a nice portion of them moving up to a full standard Cloud license, and therefore being counted in our definition of a customer. So both of those things wouldn't expect those to be recurring necessarily in the coming quarters. But certainly, yes, we're very pleased with that, that customer number. That's a nice illustration of the power of our land and expand model. To the revenue picture, a few thoughts on this one.
During this next phase of the cloud transition, we've really given our 30,000 or so server customers the control to pick their migration path and the timing of that move. And so this will introduce a degree of variability into our financial model, likely over the coming handful or so of quarters. And so given this variability, we wanted to provide everyone with something of a framework as you consider a revenue growth during this transitional period. And I think of that framework is having five themes to it that we've really generally discussed with you previously.
First of all, consider COVID-19 and the resulting challenging macroeconomic environment that's created for our customers. Q1 in this regard was quite encouraging versus Q4 of the last fiscal years in terms of the figures, and based on what we've seen in Q2 and those numbers so far, we continue to be encouraged. And so we're assuming that this headwind diminishes steadily, but will still be a factor in our revenue results, including the subscription line in particular, because we've seen, obviously, our smaller customers generally use our cloud products, we would see that being sort of factor over the next handful of quarters or so.
But that said, as you know, we’re seeing COVID-19 cases continue to grow around certainly Europe and the Americas. So we're remaining watchful of any building impacts on our financials from impacted industries, or some of our small and medium sized business customers. The second point, as we've discussed before, we've very much taken the stance of investing through this challenging macroeconomic period for our customers, with very much the strong belief that that will drive long-term competitive advantage for us and a good example of that investment focus, which is really a consistent theme right across these next four drivers that I mentioned, was the broad rollout of those free versions of Jira Software Confluence and Jira Service Desk, we've been very pleased with the resulting expansion at the top of the marketing funnel.
That's going to create an excellent source of new customers for us over the long-term, but in the short-term, this will create a revenue headwind, so we expect will moderate in the next year or so. Third, we've also talked about another investment that we've been making in this macroeconomic environment, and that is to drive less FY 2021 revenue growth from price increases then was the case in fiscal 2020.
Now, the server and data center price changes that we announced just recently will largely benefit FY 2022 and beyond. So we expect the FY 2021 pricing related growth headwind to neutralize in the coming courses, fourth as we discussed 90 days ago, we expect our Server business will decline especially now given the end-of-life announcement and specifically, the FY 2021 license revenue line, we expect to be down around 50% year-over-year and the maintenance revenue line will be approximately flat year-over-year in FY 2021 as our Server customers gradually migrate, and we expect a similar effect on our Server apps business, which we account for in the other revenue line.
Based on our recent announcement, we would expect license revenue to trend down towards zero in the next one and a half years or so. And the significantly larger maintenance revenue line to do the same over approximately the next three and half years. And then the fifth point is that while we're excited by the long-term benefits of the cloud for both our customers, and lastly, we're again taking a very customer focused approach to gradually phasing in these benefits to our financials. So for example, the larger customers will offer material discounts to our cloudless prices for a multiyear period, depending on the timing of the customers move to the cloud.
And this approach will bring gradually growing revenue benefits as those discount levels subside over the coming three or so years. And then for smaller customers making that transition, we've really designed the Server and cloud economics to be somewhat similar. So as these customers grow in the cloud, they'll of course enjoy more of the benefits of our cloud offerings, and we'll share in that additional value creation. So the net of all of that, I realize that's quite a mouthful. The net of all of that I would say is the revenue generation will be driven in part by the timing of customers electing to migrate.
I would expect beneficial migration revenue effects to gradually build over time, especially as our larger customers increasingly migrate to the cloud in the coming years. And my current expectation is that our revenue growth rate would begin improving beyond the next year or so. So that's probably a little more color than you're expecting, Keith. But I wanted to really get that out there. That was a robust answer. One quick follow-up when just thinking about license revenues, basically getting cut in half or debt down 50% year-on-year, does that include an assumption of any potential pull forward by the server customers to try to like top up on server licenses in the near-term? Or do you not think that's going to happen? Well, I think there will be some pull forward activity as in previous years, we're giving customers time to think about how to step in front of those price increases that come into effect on this coming February the 2nd.
So yes in our modeling, we do try to predict some amount of that pull forward. But that's always a challenging exercise, I'd say it's more difficult this year, because this time, we've actually announced the end-of-life of server, so how customers will adjust in their pull forward activity. So that really remains to be seen over the next several weeks. Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you. Okay, thanks. Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard from Citi, your line is open. Hi, thanks. Just to build on the last one, we talked a lot about server. And that's pretty clear with the end of license and so forth. Around data center, how are you expecting that the news that you put out around server will impact the larger customers who are on data center who may look at this move and say, data centers and that's just the path that Atlassian going with the innovation is and so forth in cloud, do you expect even though it's not directing out there that you'll have sort of induced a behavior change there as well? Scott here, I’ll take that. Look I mean what we've said to our customers is, some of our largest customers are choosing to remain on data center, because they have a longer timeframe that they want to migrate, and we're continuing to invest in our data center product. And just a reminder, for some of those who haven't read all the announcements, ended like server product, but our data center product continues to be something Atlassian builds upon and supports and continues to invest in.
Now, that said, I have talked to a whole number of CIOs over the last three months, from everything from regulated industries, banks, European customers, and every single one of those CIOs has a plan to move to our cloud. And when they're in a regulated industry or European customer, and it's just a matter of when, so our data center product is going to be critical and making sure that customers are supported over their timeframe for migration. But we expect that all our customers will migrate to cloud over the medium-term. Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. Your line is open. Okay, thank you very much for taking the question. James, I wanted to circle back I guess on fiscal 2022, because clearly, there are some puts and takes and you alluded to some of them, but I guess as I think about it, on one hand, there will be an additional loss of perpetual license revenue. There will be significant ongoing migration incentives. But on the other hand, you're going to get more benefit from the upcoming price increases, more conversions from free to paid. And the loyalty discounts in year two, for large customers naturally won't be as significant. Now in the shareholder letter, you said that fiscal 2022 will also be negatively impacted by all of the changes that you've recently made. But just to be clear on this point, any revenue headwinds will be greater in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022. Correct? Well, what I was chanting about Gregg as I kind of walked through that five point framework with the different timeframes that I feel will be relevant for each of those factors as you frame there and the question, you've got a lot of moving parts. I'd say the net of all of this is that the revenue growth rate would begin improving again, beyond the next year or so. So, in the lesson, we use similar words in my section. But that's how I think you should consider the trajectory of the revenue growth rate pattern. Okay, that's helpful. Thanks, James. And then just a quick follow-up, there was a comment that the current expectation is that there will be lower take rates on the sales of cloud apps through the Atlassian marketplace, I suppose over there, the rest of the year for the near-term anyway, and just kind of wondering what will be the case? Yes, there we’re just very much looking to continue to provide rich incentives for our app, ecosystem partners, to build more cloud apps and have them be in our marketplace. Obviously, that marketplace started out life many years ago, as a server based marketplace more recently, within the last year and a half or so, we've really focused on expanding the data center apps as well. And with this very clear focus we have as a company now on the cloud transition, obviously, we want to make sure that our customers can gain access to the same sort of functionality that they really benefit from in the current apps behind the firewall, available in the cloud as well. So we just want to make sure that the financial incentives for our app developers line-up with that. And as we mentioned in the less, we've designed those as temporary incentives. Okay, perfect. Thank you. Okay. Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kurtz from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to round back to the blog post that you put out a couple of weeks ago about the changing and the server pricing. But you also have a comment on the blog post around future cloud pricing. I know today in the shareholder letter blog posts, which seems to imply that the customers in the advantage pricing program might eventually be moved up the list price. So maybe just help me navigate that and what that could mean for a potential cloud price increase for those cloud customers? This is James, I'll take a crack at that, Alex, but you broke up there in the middle part of your question. So you can stare me, if I'm not answering for that. But in terms of what we've talked about in that blog post a couple of weeks ago, yes, we’re rising prices, effective February, the 2nd for our server and data center products. And we note in the shareholder letter, that while yes, you've got to be very thoughtful about user tiers and product combinations for specific price outcomes. If you're a customer, directionally from a modeling perspective, they equate to about 15% increases year-over-year, we're very explicitly not rising cloud prices this year versus the case where we have done that, in whole or in part in previous years.
And in terms of your reference to advantage pricing. Yes, there were some price list for current customers, when we've rolled some of these price increases through, we've always wanted to be thoughtful about the degree of change that the customer is taking on in terms of price. And so in each of these situations, the end result is list price. But it just takes longer than just an immediate step function up to the new list price. It’s just reflective of people, customers current budgets, and those sorts of things. So does that give it what you’re asking? Yes, it does. So just to be clear, the advantaged pricing plan is probably for a very small sub segment of your cloud customers? Yes, so the advantage to cloud customers were those you may recall a year-ago for the higher user tier part of our cloud pricing structure. So certainly a year-ago, we had relatively few customers in that part of our customer base. And yes, we moved prices up for those higher cloud tiers. So for those customers who have gone early to, the larger scale end of the cloud, we're giving them more time to come up to list. Yes, that's a relatively small proportion of the overall cloud user base. Thank you. Alex, it’s Scott Farquhar here. Just to chime in and add to James like, that's a great question on the detail. But philosophically, we want to get our customers to the cloud, when I talk to companies big and small, they want to move across to the cloud. We know that over time, because we solve a lot more problems for them, and take a lot of the management overhead from them, the scalability issue, the hardware costs, because we do all that on their behalf, they're willing to pay larger, high prices in order for us to order them. And the cost savings are significant. In many cases, they will, if you have a team of five or six people, managing our products, when you make them yourself, that's down, we have a case study with a standard under a person now, and so those cost savings, we can capture some of that.
And the aim is, in the short term, though to make it an absolutely easy decision for people to move across without trying to get into discussions in their organization, it's like, let's just move across, and we try and make the cost and price, relatively the same in the sort of first year of transfer and over time, step them back up and capture sort of more of the value that we're providing for them.
And so really, there's a lot of ways you could slice it differently. And we think this one is very customer friendly. And we've always thought about the long-term customer relationship. We have from planning level, all the way up to CIOs very large organizations, so we want to have a great relationships as we provide more and more products for them, and we sell them more, more things. But also that one of them is possible without any sort of (inaudible) something in a way. So that's sort of the philosophy behind it. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Thanks, and good quarter guys. Leaving the cloud on the side for a second. Scott, and Mike maybe can talk about Trello. In the work management space, maybe you could talk about progress over there and
maybe fine tune to kind of differentiation with it and although it is public, how do you see the landscape? How do you see your competitive positioning there and opportunities ahead? And then for James, just kind of following-up on the data center side of the equation, correct me if I'm wrong, that is a term business. So that shows up in subscription revenue? But can you tell us the magnitude how much of your subscription revenue is tied to on-premise, not to cloud, perhaps number of customers? I think it was 30,000 enterprise customers, what would be the count on the data center side? Sure, Ittai, this is Mike. Hope you’re doing well. Look on the work management side, I can give you some color, it wasn't a specific question. I suppose. Obviously, look you saw us in the quarter on specifics. We got support for Trello in FedRAMP, for obvious reason to Trello is doing well in the government sector and continues to grow there. I'd say the broader story there is around Trello in the enterprise. And as the extremely large Trello user base continues to grow a pace, how that is starting to get into larger organizations, like the government obviously indicated from that. At the same time, Trello continues to sort of broaden the appeal of its product. So you've seen us do a lot of work with what we call Trello Views. So changing the way that you see the data that's inside Trello, and also embedding Trello into a lot of other places.
In a broader sense, I would say look, that that area of work management for all continues to be one that we’re spending a lot of time in. Confluence continues to grow very well. And you've seen us with the Halp acquisition in terms of providing a sort of service management experience inside of Slack and inside of Messaging Tools, which is used by IT certainly, but used increasingly by other teams where that's much more familiar interface for them to provide a service management capability. So I think we're credibly positive about all of the things we have going on in that area. Continued innovation and continued enterprise growth of work management for all tools, I think bodes very well for us in that space. And Ittai, this is James. So I can jump in on the second part of your question. So yes, data center has accounted for in the subscription revenue line. And I think the way to really think about that is that subscription in Q1 represented 60% of total revenue. And recall in the past, we've said that the cloud business is just a little shy of 50% of total revenue at this point. So that gives you directionally a sense for the scale of the data center business. And in terms of customer counts, some of the other data points we've offered, now we have 180,000, 200,000 plus total customers. And we've talked about 160,000 cloud customers. So again, that gives you a little bit of a sense as directionally the overall customer count. Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies, your line is open. Hey guys, this is Luv Sodha on for Brent Thill. Nice quarter and great investments on the cloud side, I wanted to ask a couple of questions. One was, in terms of server, you provide great color on server to cloud pricing. I was wondering like, what would be the -- in terms of any color, you could provide on server to data center pricing, in terms of what's the difference and what the migration process entails there? And then the second question was around the Mindville acquisition that you closed this quarter? Obviously, how does it position you relative to the competitors in that marketplace in the ITSM space? Thank you. Well, I can perhaps take the first part of the question in terms of the economics of moving from server to datacenter, really quite similar to the situation, when customers electing to move over to the cloud for our larger customers in the 1000s plus seat grade, we would again look to offer material discount levels, less than those that we will be offering someone moving over to the cloud, but still material discount levels over a multiyear period. So it's a similar approach, reflecting the comments that Scott, and Mike made earlier that the data center is very much still a deployment option that we continue to invest in for the future. So I'll pass over to Mike or Scott for the Mindville part. Mike? Thanks, Luv. Thanks James, thanks Luv for the question I can certainly take that. Look, we continue to be incredibly excited about what's going on in the ITSM space as we continue our long-term journey in that space, it really has been a series of years now. I think if you zoom out you can look at that and see how kaleidoscope of options, there are many, many ways that companies can provide ITSM solutions, I do think what we’re doing is bringing that into pretty sharp focus. And if you look at our offerings continuing to mature and the way we've taken Jira Service Desk, and then adding status page for external communication adding Opsgenie to provide rostering and real time management capabilities of your team and bringing them into incidence.
And then obviously, adding Mindville for CMDB capabilities. So asset management of all types, alongside our service management capabilities that we've released. So not only managing the services that are outbound, but also providing a registry of the inside services, the technology services that you have inside your company, what we're starting to do is really provide a single pane of glass that can look across your IT operations and development teams.
As teams and companies are increasingly bringing their development teams closer to their IT teams, we're providing a singular set of offerings that run across that. And as we continue to integrate them and add the Atlassian platform under all of them, we're obviously incredibly excited about both the growth of the space but also the uniqueness and the clarity that our offering brings to otherwise quite blurry space around there and the uniqueness of that offering. So really excited about that space going forward. And, you'll continue to see us investing there and continue to see us having big investments in that space. Your next question comes from the line of Jack Andrews from Needham. Your line is open. Good afternoon, thanks for taking my question, I want to ask about the work you're doing or initiatives you have in place to gain more leverage with some global systems integrators and particularly thinking about something like Jira Align, I mean how important is it to engage with these types of partners for you these days? Scott here, and thanks for question, Jack. Systems integrators, great partners, partners are being a huge part of Atlassian’s success. We have a great partner network, hundreds of partners around the world, particularly in Europe is a real big strength for us. And there as we see with some of our larger engagements with customers on the larger side like most of them are bringing in and working with a systems integrator on those transformations. And particularly if you think about digital transformation, a lot of what needs to get done in those organizations is not simply the deployment of software, it's actually changing the way that these organizations work to do agile transformation or scaled agile framework, and so forth.
And so these systems integrators are really important to be on the ground to help out some of these transformations that that happen. And so, particularly happy with the systems integrators and you would also say our migrations, people migrating to the cloud is a huge opportunity for our systems integrators. And we've seen some of our best partners build migrations practices already if you go to the cloud.
And that's been a great source of business for them, and also a great way for our customers to get across to the cloud faster. And of course we continue our depth of portfolio that we provide to CIOs in terms of reverting from the Jira framework and Confluence, but all the way up to Jira Align, which handles effectively the CIOs dashboard about how their organization is going into digital transformation. Again, that makes us more strategic for customers and our customers they walk to partners to help them deploy and roll that out. Your next question comes from the line of Rishi Jaluria from D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Hey, guys, thanks so much for taking my questions. Just two quick ones. First, if we do kind of the back of the envelope math, you've got roughly 60% of your customer base, that's using a hybrid, some products on-premise, some products in the cloud, can you give us a little bit more color on what these sort of situations look like as a function of, they might be using Jira on-premise and Trello in the cloud? Or is it a departmental level thing where the initial adopters are using Jira Server Data Center, and new teams are jumping straight to Jira Cloud.
And then the second is just on thinking through the longer-term COVID impact over the past couple of quarters, you've identified some of the headwinds from SMB exposure and payment duration, when we look out maybe longer term, especially given that it's looking likely that we're going to be in a much more distributed workforce even post-pandemic, how do you think that that shapes maybe the necessity for your solutions and the demand environment? Thanks. It's great questions. And firstly, I'm not sure the back of the envelope is 60% of customers is necessarily right. But we said in the past that 95% of our new customers use our cloud offerings. And while we don't disclose the overlaps, like I can talk through the reasons for that, one of the advantages of cloud is the intake going really quickly. You don't need to deploy hardware, you don't need to kind of confine space in your data center. And so what we find is even amongst our largest customers that I have deployed, wall to wall with our data center or server offerings, and with new projects where they want to get off the ground, quickly in many cases, will deploy a cloud version of our products.
I mean so we find that, even the kinds of customers you find using cloud products, and in many cases, that's sort of the White House department inside those companies as they ought to migrate to cloud. So I think it really speaks to the ease and speed of which customers can get going in that cloud. Do you see that? The hybrid and of course, over time, we'll see those cloud things scale.
On the distributed workforce side of things, what we saw in the initial days of COVID was a spike in our web traffic, I think in the order of roughly 10%, where we saw not a huge spike in customers within days of the pandemic, but because our existing customers were using our products with a high frequency, and that that is that there was no posted notes, no whiteboards, and they need want to track all the work they're doing inside our tools.
And there's a huge opportunity for that because once you track work in a product like Jira, Trello, Confluence or any of our products, there's opportunities for automation, which we've seen with all our investments in automation and Atlassian’s automation products. And there's investments of smarts and we've seen some announcements recently around how we're using data machine learning to better route work to the right people. And so we think there's a huge opportunity for our products to help with the workforce. And the other thing, which was surprising for me, when I chatted with CIOs, is that the CIOs agenda has never been more aligned with the CEOs agenda.
If you went back to the 15 years as CEO and CIOs agenda would be, sort of marginally overlapping whereas today, the same problem CEOs are struggling with riches, how do I make my workforce productive while we're remote. And how do I serve our customers in a new way? Particularly, if I've had to move out transactions with our customers online.
How do I make sure my employees are healthy? How do I make sure, and the workflows across the organization are moving fast, like, these are all CEO conversations and board level conversations that are happening when the CIO is now on the hook for doing that. And now used to be that HR is responsible for the water cooler. Now CIOs are responsible for the digital water cooler. And so what surprised me is how much interest has been around culture from CIOs, who traditionally wouldn't be thinking, and that that would be front of mind for them.
And because Atlassian and the way we worked and how we work openly and how our products promote an open and transparent culture, they turned us as a trusted partner to help them transform their organizations. Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood from Cowen and Company, your line is open. Great, this is actually Nick Altmann on for Derrick. Thanks for taking our questions. You guys have talked about your hiring plan for this year. And you've said the bulk of the hiring is going to be going to R&D. I guess when you look at the product portfolio, where are the pockets that you guys will be focused on the most from an R&D perspective? And I guess how much of the effort is going to be directed around furthering the cloud enablement of the portfolio versus net new offerings? Nick, look firstly, I think I would zoom out to start that into, as we said a few times, we're in three very large markets between work management for all the software Agile, DevOps, a market and then into, obviously, the IT and ITSM market. One of our advantages, is not only are these three fantastic markets that are incredibly critical to customers and companies out there, as Scott mentioned, they’re all are connected at various different points. One of the strengths, Atlassian has is having products. Confluence runs across all three, Jira as a platform runs across all three, Trello is increasingly used in lots of different places across all three.
So having products and connections between these markets, as we've mentioned, software coming closer to IT, obviously, the IT department being more involved in all sorts of work management capabilities. These connectivities are huge strategic strengths of ours, but require R&D investment, they require us to continue to bring products closer together, to allow customers to reuse data across different spaces, and building out our cloud infrastructure to handle all the enterprise needs of customers, as well as the work management and the automation data platforms, as Scott has mentioned.
So, yes, we’ll certainly continue to invest in R&D across a lot of those areas. Our platform is the continued place of some significant investment, both to bring our marketplace up to speed. But also, as I mentioned to look across the increasing amount of data we have and providing better answers, automation AI, there's lots of things that we're doing and building there. We’re always looking at building new products, we always have a series of different prototypes and teams working on things internally.
Sometimes those become products for the outside world, sometimes actually get merged into existing applications and become features of what we're already doing. So one of the advantages of our business model, obviously, is our ability to invest in R&D and continue to keep that innovation going. One of the advantages of our D&A is the long-term thinking and when you put both together, I think that's part of the reason we've been so successful for almost two decades now and intend to continuing to do so.
So we don't generally provide any specifics. But hopefully that gives you a little bit of color about where some of that R&D is going and why we're excited about our possibilities in the markets we’re in. Your next question comes from the line of Robert Majek from Raymond James. Your line is open. Great, thanks. Can you update us on the customer transition from standard to premium skews? What is customer feedback been like on premium? What's the mix today? And where can that mix go as we look out a few years? Rob, it’s Scott here, we're really pleased with the customer adoption of premium. As you know, in the last, probably 18 months, we've introduced premium and enterprise versions of our cloud skews. So previously, there was really only one price you could pay for say, Jira or Confluence, Jira Service Desk. And we've now sort of got tearing in those structures, our premium lean affiliate that ramping up now. So that is a widely available and widely adopted product. And Enterprise is really, in the early stages, like we've announced it and we've got some early customers using it but it's still ramping-up.
I would say we’re giving specific numbers, we've been extremely happy with the premium adoption of our products. We're still in the stages as we add more features, they get adopted at a higher rate and the satisfaction for those customers has been really high. And as a reminder, the premium version of that products include feature differentiation, they also include higher for customers who are mission critical and so we've seen kind of that combination video really valuable one desirable one for our customer base. So, yes, very excited and very happy with it. Okay. And with the launch of Atlassian Ventures, can you help us frame the positive impact that might have on the ecosystem as well as future marketplace revenues? Sure, I just want to add one thing, I'll get to ventures on premium and enterprise additions in the cloud, a reminder that most customers will tend to migrate. And obviously migrations going very well, we're up about 90% year-on-year in terms of the number of users that are migrating, and obviously offers small base. But as we continue to increase that with tools and with partnerships that's going to grow, most customers will migrate probably to cloud standard. And then over time as their cloud journey, as they increase their confidence in Atlassian’s Cloud, and they need more features and capabilities. Once they're in the cloud, they'll then sort of move up through premium and enterprise depending on their company, and their journey.
So just to be clear, I'm not sure people will necessarily move from on prem, straight to cloud premium, but that'll be, as they mature in their Atlassian journey. On Atlassian Ventures, of course incredibly excited about this, we've done a few investments in the past as Atlassian. This is, I would say a sign of our maturation as a company, having a formal brand, a formal budget, and a team that is focused on doing this allows us to better serve the ecosystem and economy around Atlassian. Right, it’s not all about acquisitions. There's a lot of work to be done in investments and partnerships. And we'll just continue to mature and grow in stature in all of those areas as we become a part of the larger scale tech economy.
And I think it's a great step for us to continue to go albeit done with Atlassian’s general sort of pragmatic, long-term focus on how we do this. So obviously, that's not a short-term issue. Your next question comes from the line of Jim Fish from Piper Sandler, your line is open. Hey, guys, this is Quinton on for Jim, thanks for taking our question. Just two high level questions from us. First IT operations is a massive and somewhat newish opportunity for Atlassian. Is there any way to think about the revenue contribution today outside of the core software dev market? And then additionally, wondering if you guys have seen any material changes in the hiring of developers or IT professionals in general that may help expand Atlassian usage? Scott here, and Quinton great questions. What we're seeing in the Dev and IT markets is the continual overlap of those markets. And so if you would pick a like and put them into three buckets, but these days, most of what IT people are doing is involving software. I know lot of the IT operations stuff is running and managing software. And that's an area where we believe we have a unique advantage as the vendor that powers more software teams than anyone else on the planet. And we think we have a huge opportunity there to bring those, those two things closer together.
If you think about how we have probably mentioned before, in terms of planning and managing work, Jira, Jira and Confluence come in, we do an incredible job there and we handle everything from someone putting something on that Sprint backlog all the way up to the Jira Align and managing 10,000 people, then through development like, there are a lot of vendors there. And we actually partner with a huge number of vendors in that sort of code and test and deploy side of things. And in the run side of things, run, manage, support area, that's where you’ve seen us make a large number of investments over the past couple of years, everything from Jira Service Desk, which has been in the market now for quite a while due to opportunity status page.
And the investments that Mike talked about with Mindville recently and so that is a huge area of investment for us. And as you see like everyone that build software now has to align it and those things that cause never before. So we don’t break them out as much if something we see those (inaudible) developers are now on call and on support, it’s not a separate team sitting in a network operation center anymore, it’s the people that build it, now run it and so the developers are managing our products there.
That was on the first part, on the hiring of developers, what you see across the entire industry now is 10 years of digital transformation happened in 10 weeks and so the demand for IT professionals and developments and people can build software is higher than it's ever been. And what you're seeing is organizations saying, well, we want to hire developers, and if we can't do that, how do we get other developers be more productive? And so you see the rise of workflow applications like Atlassians where you can take, you don't necessarily need a software developer to make sure workflow applications happen and run across your organization.
You see work code, opportunities, which people using Atlassian platform to automate things across their entire organization and automation, which we've invested heavily in, and to make sure that all of the busy work that goes away. And so in terms of we’re delivering numbers from any third-party in terms of hiring developers, but I would expect that to be a pinch point for most organizations for the foreseeable future. Your next question comes from the line of Arjun Bhatia from William Blair. Your line is open. Hey, guys, this is Dylan Becker on for Arjun. I appreciate you taking the time the question, just one quick one from us. And I kind of wanted to touch on Trello, as you've made some kind of changes here in 2019 with the Paywalls and the acquisition of Butler, but kind of thinking, how was the monetization of the product change? And then how are you measuring the kind of success from this product looking into fiscal 2021? Thank you. Thanks, Dylan. Look as we've been on a long-term journey with Trello, we've always said the most important thing is to keep the product growing as a whole. Trello is a monster product, 10s of millions of users and continuing to grow fast. And for the long-term perspective, having those 10s of millions of users continuing to grow is the number one priority.
And we've been pretty clear about that. That said, we have continued to apply Atlassian’s expertise in pricing and packaging to work out how we get the best customer outcomes and the best Atlassian outcomes so that we can continue to invest in the product. That journey has been going quite well, as you mentioned, we've changed some of the ways that it's charged in a couple of times now over the years, and that continues to drive the top line that Trello is contributing to Atlassian. Things like Butler provide more differentiation. So that's the sort of automation capabilities for Trello. And you're saying that with the continued work, we're doing around Trello’s views, so providing more ways to look, we've got a calendar view and a map view at the moment, we've got a title view that's in the public data at the moment.
So continuing to have different ways to look at the data that's inside Trello, also gives us some capabilities to look at the different paid additions, and add different view capabilities as you go through there. So I think look, our continued number one focus for Trello, as I've said is the user base and continue to just make it a standard. The other thing we're also doing with Trello is continuing to bring it closer to the Atlassian family as you've seen with the identity stack underneath moving to the Atlassian Identity platform, which by itself handle 10s of millions of users.
So it's very helpful to bring that Trello user base closer to the Atlassian user base over time. And obviously things like Access is a monetization angle across Trello as well as connections to obviously the Jira Software, Jira Service Desk to Halp and to Confluence, obviously. So bringing it closer to the Atlassian family is a part of the monetization journey for Trello as well. [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Ari Terjanian from Cleveland Research. Your line is open. Hi guys, thanks for taking the question and congrats on the results. Just want to double click on the comment around code app development. It's an area we're seeing increasing strength, certainly this year around price communications or tracking trace et cetera. Any thoughts around furthering efforts here? Obviously, Forge is a great first step. But any more color you can share on new use cases and ways you're seeing people use Atlassian as a locoed platform in this environment? Thanks. (Inaudible) Hang on, we've lost you, Scott. Apologies there, sorry. One of the benefits we've had over the long-term of Atlassian is that our products are incredibly flexible. And our customers have used them for all manner of things. And so we see Atlassian products use everything from HR, recruiting and onboarding of employees. We've seen them for people NASDAQ listed company uses Atlassian’s products to handle their quarterly calls process in finance, and the advantage I guess is our products are very fast to rollouts.
They’re widely deployed inside an organization. And they have customization that varies from just changing internal kind of interface and configuring workflows and custom fields, all the way through to our riding Forge, which is in a Forge application through to building complicated applications that are, you can deploy and use from our marketplace.
And so we've seen that sort of the use cases will be too numerous to get into on this call. But we've seen Atlassian products be used across the entire organization. The example we’ve said previously Twitter uses Atlassian for 100s of service types, I think with 140 service types starting from legal service types to HR, across the entire organization and so we see Atlassian as a platform where people do move work across their organizations and as Mike alluded to as we continue to build out that platform, it gets used to more and more use cases. There are no further questions at this time. I’ll pass the call back to Scott Farquhar for closing remarks. Thanks everyone for joining our call today. We appreciate your ongoing support and we really like that you and your loved one remain safe and healthy. We hope to see all of you at Investor Day on November the 17th. Thanks a lot. That concludes today’s conference call.

Thank you for joining Atlassian's Earnings Conference Call for the Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2021. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay on the Investor Relations section of Atlassian's website following this call.
I will now hand the call over to Matt Sonefeldt, Atlassian's Head of Investor Relations. Good afternoon, and welcome to Atlassian second quarter of fiscal 2021 earnings call. Thank you for joining us today. On the call today, we have Atlassian's Co-Founders and Co-CEOs, Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes, as well as our Chief Financial Officer, James Beer.
Earlier today, we issued a press release and a shareholder letter with our financial results and commentary for our second quarter of fiscal 2021. The shareholder letter was posted on our company blog and all items have also been posted to the Investor Relation section of Atlassian website. On our IR site, we have also posted a supplemental data sheet. During the call, we'll make brief opening remarks and then spend the remainder of time on Q&A.
This call will include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.
You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Forward-looking statements represent our management's beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made. And we assume no obligation to update or revise such statements should they change or cease to be current. Further information on these and other factors that could affect the company's financial results is included in filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including the section titled Risk Factors in our most recent Form 20-F and quarterly 6-K.
In addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-IFRS financial measures. These non-IFRS financial measures are in addition to, and not a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. There are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-IFRS financial measures versus their nearest IFRS equivalents, and they may be different from non-IFRS and non-GAAP measures used by other companies. A reconciliation between IFRS and non-IFRS financial measures is available in our earnings release, our shareholder letter and in our updated investor sheet on the IR website.
During Q&A, please ask your full question upfront so that we can easily move through to the next speaker. Lastly, we've announced dates for Team 2021, a virtual annual customer conference taking place April 28th and 29th. We hope to see you there.
With that, I'll turn this call to Scott for opening remarks. Thank you everyone for joining today. We hope you and your loved ones remain safe during these challenging times. We hope you taken the time to read the shareholder letter. This quarter, we focused on three themes tied to Atlassian's long-term focus.
First, that we're off to a strong start in our multi-year initiatives to migrate our server customers to the cloud. Second, we continue to deliver mission-critical solutions for our customers across the large TAMs through products like Jira Service Management, which launched in Q2. And third, that we will continue to use the cloud to deliver innovation to customers small and large in our ultimate goal to serve the Fortune 500,000.
Our business results reflect steady execution against our goals. In Q2, we generated $501 million in revenue, up 23% year-over-year. We also achieved subscription revenue growth of 36%. During the quarter, we added a record 11,617 net new customers of all sizes, bringing out total count to over 194,000. While we are proud of these results, there's plenty of hard work that lies ahead.
Before we move to Q&A, Mike and I want to thank our employees who continue to inspire us with their passion for customers and their adaptability. You make unleashing the potential of all teams possible.
With that, I'll pass the call to the speaker. So I called him the speaker. They were waiting for me to say the word operator. [Operator Instructions]
Your first question comes from the line of Alex Kurtz with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Yeah. Thanks. Thanks for taking the question. Just on the new customer adds, the strength there. What drove that? Is there something changing with the SMB customer base? Is there a certain verticals that stood out key? Just a little bit of context around that? Yeah. Great question. Well, because if you've been around for a while, Alex, you'll know that the new customer number bounces around a lot. We had about 30,000 in Q4, 8,000 and a bit in Q1 and, of course, 11,500 now, and it's not a number we guide towards, or we really managing into Atlassian. And it's also always been a pretty small driver of immediate revenue being the smallest of our customers.
What's the change this quarter is, a lot of the funnel changes we've done around free. It's all other product. Also -- and truly we changed the monetization funnels, a lot of those areas, which they're really proud of what they're kind of put us in the right place very long-term growth. They did change sort of the mix of customer ratios and we do have a larger mix with smaller customers. And so, I'd say more than any other quarters, we probably have a greater ratio with smaller customers than we've had before.
So we think it's great. I think it's, again, a great testament to how much demand there is for our products out there. But I heisted to try and roll any of that into some sort of revenue forecast. And just looking at these new customer adds, were any of those potentially customers that turned in the first half of 2020, and they're back. I don't know if you categorize them differently, if they didn't turn their back. I don't have numbers around that at hand, unfortunately. We have seen improved churn in general across most of our product base. Some of that is things we've done and some of it could be macro trends as well.
James, do you want to comment as well on that? Yeah. Just a couple of things to add to that, Scott. I would say that I was pleased with the customer count because it illustrates the mission-critical nature of the products that we serve our customers with of all sizes, all across the board from small, medium sized businesses through to the largest corporations, governments, and so forth. So, please by that churn, as Scott was saying that, has increased, improved nicely, as the recent quarters have gone by.
You are right. We did see some challenges back in Q4 of fiscal 2020. But as we've seen our churn improve, as we've seen our custom account go for this past Q2, we've really seen those improvements right across all verticals, and again, right across the different sizes of customers that we serve. So, we're pleased by all of those themes. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and really nice quarter. If I could kind of squeeze in two questions. One, just on the overall spending environment, if you have an idea kind of where we are on that, that really true recovery. You talked about improving renewal rates. That sounds like that's getting better, but just kind of your take on kind of where we are on that.
And two, in particular on the ITSM product, now that we've integrated Mindville and you have that, CMDB component of the equation, is that enabling the solution to go further up market? Have you seen any evidence of that traction as of yet? Okay. Keith, it's Mike here. Let me take -- let James take the question on the spending environment and Scott and then I can come back on the ITSM one. On the spending environment, obviously, we are pleased by what we see is a nice gradual improvements. Now, it's hard to parse that out because I feel as though our products really are serving so many of the critical needs of our customers. There's a increasing movements to agile frameworks. The work-from-home process is now becoming such a normal part of business life. And, of course, our tools help support that. So, we've been pleased by the themes that we've seen in that last year and recent weeks and months. Mike? Yeah. Mate, I can address the ITSM question there. Look, as you mentioned, Jira Service Management launched about a quarter ago now, and we've been very pleased with the results so far. Mostly obviously inside a quarter and our model customer reaction, customer adoption, acceleration of purchasing an interest behavior. As you mentioned, it is a great example of Atlassian's overall philosophy of both building and integrating smiley acquisitions, as you mentioned in this CMDB facilities. Again, those are released as a plug-in at the moment, but not fully integrated into Jira Service Management yet. So, those will be coming in the coming quarters. So, as a part of our long-term ITSM strategy, you see a constant drum beat of improvements there.
At a whole level, customers have resonated with us, seeing the blurring of lines between IT and software development, as we are sort of the one company that considered their needs from software development through ops -- DevOps and into their IT and technical teams on that end. So, that's really resonating with customers, and we're very excited about that. And again, focusing on the Fortune 500,000 gives us a very broad customer adoption cycle all the way up to large customers, as you see from the ISS customer example in the shareholder letter, some very, very big customers adopting our ITSM offerings as well. Excellent. That's great to hear. Thank you, guys. Your next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Thanks. Hey, guys. Congrats on a great quarter. I'd like to focus on the 30,000 server customers that you're trying to migrate to the cloud over the next two to three years. Can you give us some color on how much movement was there this quarter in that transition? How many of the small, medium, large have transitioned?
And then second, how would you think about churn in this group? I'm sure a lot of people, or some customers are probably not that happy about, although, while recognizing and appreciating the benefits of the cloud and the capabilities that come along with that pricing is -- could be materially different, especially for a large customer. So, help me think about -- how would you think about churn in this transition over the next couple of years? Thanks. Good question. Firstly, just to remind everyone we have 30,000 server customers and I mean, they move an over a multi-year period with end-of-life of server and our customers have three years to make decision to move across before they hit our end of maintenance period. So we've been very friendly to our customers and we have a pretty wide window for those customers to move across.
In terms of our -- where we are, like it's very early in that. And when overall numbers about our internal metrics, we're doing exactly what we said we were going to do. We've got customers moving across that higher -- a little bit higher levels than ever before. Our numbers internally that we measure for this quarter were -- a new high as you would expect as we go through this transition.
And also reminded that the majority of our new customers today choose cloud. So, we'll have a 95% of our customers choose cloud. Now, new customers choose cloud today. And so, we're really happy with the leading indicators. That's great.
In terms of churn, when I talk with our largest customers, but the companies you would all know and do business with, they all have plans to move to the cloud. Like I say, it saves them money, saves the hassle of doing things, get some higher reliability. And so they are all partnered up with us to move to the cloud. In most cases, it's in our court to ensure that we had the size and scale and that we can help them migrate across.
And so, it is hard to predict the churn on that like, because it is now in customers' hands or a period of time, but I'm pretty pleased with the indications of what we've got at the moment. And sort of the customer response.
James, do you want to add anything to that? Just that like at Investor Day in November, we noted our expectation that around half of our 30,000 server customers would migrate in FY 2023 and beyond. And indeed for our medium or larger size customers, we would expect that ratio to be about two-thirds migrating in FY 2023 and beyond, and nothing has changed in our perspective there. Very good. Thanks. And then maybe just to follow-up on the perpetual license revenue, which clearly was still strong and it's -- for obvious reasons people want to do things before February, I guess, next week kicks. And -- but we forgot to upgrades. You've talked about how it gets collapsed all the way through fiscal 3Q next year, fiscal next year. Do you suspect though, that upgrade activity is going to be robust in the same way that perpetual license sales in this quarter was robust just because we're kind of heading into a deadline of expiration?
And as you said relative to your expectations that most upgrades of medium, large customers are going to be fiscal 2020 and after many are going likely to upgrade near term in order to give them more time to complete the transition to the cloud? Yeah. Let me take that one. In terms of license revenue, yes, we either have new licensing activity both in that line or upgraded licensing activity. And just to remind everyone, we'll be curtailing new license sales in a few days time, February the 2nd. And we'll continue to allow customers to upgrade their licenses, expand the size in essence of their current licenses for another year or so.
So, in Q2, it is fair to say that we did see more of that upgrading and new activity than we were previously forecasting. And I would say, as we have now almost a month of Q3 behind us, that type of activity has continued into Q3. And, of course, we would expect that to mean less activity downstream. I think there'll be upgrading activity playing out over the next year or so, but it does appear that some of that upgrade activity has been pulled in advance of the pricing increases that will play out next week as well.
So as you said, not surprising, hard to precisely determine the scale of this pull forward activity on the upgrade side. And, of course, if you are interested in new licenses, you really have to act very quickly here before those new sales cease. Got it. Very good. Excellent. Thank you very much, guys. Good luck. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Securities. Your mind is open. Hey, there. Thank you. First off, congrats to Mike and Jazz on that 10 game win streak. It's impressive stuff there too. James, maybe one on margin. You've consistently noted margins are expected to trend down in the second half of the year. We now have the Q3 guide. So just wondering if there's anything else from a seasonal perspective we should be cognizant of that could maybe make the shape of the second half look a little different than prior years. Just trying to make sure we don't over or under extrapolate what we're seeing into Q4 and beyond on the margin. Thank you. Well, a couple of thoughts. First of all, just to reiterate what we've been now saying for two or three quarters that through this harder macro economic period, we've really been looking to invest purposely and that continues. You saw strong headcount growth in the last quarter, good execution by our people teams in that regard. We see very significant opportunities in front of us and we wanted to get off to those opportunities.
And I think it's fair to say that Scott and Mike's experience back through 2008, 2009 tied down to macro economic downtown was such that it was the right thing to do to invest through that period. And we're doing exactly that again this time.
Also, recall I've spoken in the last call or two about some shorter term revenue headwinds, things like the introduction of free additions. The fact that we're taking less marketplace revenue as we encourage our patent system developers to emphasize putting new cloud apps on the marketplace. And we've also taken the decision to execute fewer pricing actions, particularly on the cloud side of our business this year versus the past year.
So while the impact of COVID that we were talking quite a bit about two quarters ago, that is decreasing nicely as an impact on our financials. Clearly, we will continue, as I said in an earlier answer to expect the server business lines, the license line and the maintenance line to continue to contract in terms of their rates of change and so forth.
And recall also that we have in order to encourage our larger enterprise customers, those with over a thousand users or so, to migrate to the cloud, we're offering them quite substantial loyalty discounts. So, we have some revenue headwinds. I would describe them as transitory in nature. They're very much really favoring the long-term for -- a short-term headwind.
So, when you take those factors together, of course, we have seasonal factors like the payroll tax reset that happens at the start of every calendar year, few different things to consider. But we've baked all of that into the Q3 margin guide. And as we've said elsewhere, we would expect second half margins to be down versus the first half margins. I appreciate all the detail. Thank you. You're next question comes from the line of Arjun Bhatia with William Blair. Your line is open. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. One of the things that stuck out to me in the shareholder letter was, I think you pointed out that cloud enterprise adoption is coming in ahead of expectations. I was hoping maybe because unpack that a little bit. Is that migration that's driving that, or are customers naturally upgrading once they've -- once they started using your class solutions for Jira and Confluence and JSM?
And then, on the hiring side, are there any specific areas within R&D that you're targeting in the second half that we should be on the lookout for? Thanks, Arjun. I can take both of those. Look, on the enterprise side, I have to say we have two phenomenons going on there, so I'm not sure which one you're asking about, but let me answer to both. On the general enterprise customer, so we call that the literally enterprise big, big companies. We really pleased with our continued cloud adoption there across all the editions of cloud and that goes from free all the way through standard, premium and the enterprise edition Big E.
You've seen us over the last three years through access through scale, through performance and reliability improvements and continued investment in old manners of compliance standards, continuing to get better and better traction with large customers, with enterprise customers, sort of a thousand seats and more, no matter what edition they buy.
Secondly, we did GA our enterprise edition, so Big E during the quarter, and I've been very pleased with the reaction of the customers there. So, we've had a lot of customers in the early access program for about the last six months, testing that with us. Again, the enterprise edition has five levels of compliance and security standards, data residency and a whole lot of other features as well unlimited instances. So you get unlimited scale.
So rather than buying one Jira software instance in a second Jira software instance, you get -- you pay obviously a higher price, but you get unlimited Jira software instances. So that allows you to create and segment your business as very large companies often need to do. You might have one for Europe and one for America, or you might have one for a certain department and one for different departments with different plug-ins, add-ons, exposition to other customers of your own as company, et cetera.
So very pleased with that adoption so far. Again, it's incredibly early days. It did only GA during the quarter. And obviously, we're working with all of the early access program customers -- the company, I should say to turn them into enterprise edition customers. There is naturally a flow upwards from standard to premium to enterprise, as customers grow and deepen their usage and adoption of Atlassian products. And that's part of the latter that we're trying to build there.
On your second question, no specific call outs in R&D. We continue to invest in hiring across the board and R&D across product management, engineering, design, and all manner of operations and engineering functions. And that's across Atlassian all of our offices that would remind you about our Team Anyway program, where we have announced six months ago and continue to announce to stop about hiring in lots more countries in the world and multi-path of the world. And that opens up R&D pipeline to get that talent, hopefully logically, no matter where it sits in the world to work for Atlassian and it's been very successful for six months and we look to continue to dig that in 2021. Perfect. Thank you very much. Your next question comes from the line of Robert Majek with Raymond James. Your line is open. Great. Thanks on the enterprise cloud, Scott, you noted higher than expected initial demand for Jira software, Confluence and Jira Service Management. Can you still put some more color there on the customer feedback they're getting? And is this dynamic enough to potentially change the timetable for large customer migrations? Thanks Robert. Scott here. I think just to echo sort of the things that we've sort of said earlier, we have seen demand higher than we thought, but it's still very early days in terms of these parts on demand for -- lots customers as Mike talked about and also demand specific enterprise product. And so at this stage, there is nothing to say different. Like we think we've been pretty -- we're really happy with, and I guess, it's playing out as we expected in terms of the migrations. Like, -- so there's nothing there that would change now in our forecast. Great. Thanks. Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Your line is open. Hi. Thanks. Two quick questions. First, just on the data center side, I'm curious, you've obviously have these plans well outlined for the server customers. Has outlining those plans and implementing them cause any change in terms of how data center customers are thinking about moving to cloud?
And then just quick second question for James around the gross margin impacts on cloud or just gross margin impact generally. You talked about migration expenses and also just hosting costs. Can you help us understand which of those are bigger and how long you expect the migration expenses to beyond ongoing in COGS? Walter, Scott here. I'll take the first one and then James can get into the details on the second one. The migration to clouds, whether it's server or DC customer, the majority of our customers have made long-term plans to move to cloud. And in areas where they're hesitant, it's the bolt-on and echo, because there might be some particular compliance requirement in that geography or something else that they're just waiting on us to do.
And so, the overwhelming demand is there obviously with customers who had server licenses. They've got three years to make a choice. Whether they wait, whether they go to cloud or DC and the overwhelming majority, we want to move to cloud and early discussions we're having.
Of course, the customers on DC are also looking at the benefits of cloud, not having to manage their own upgrades in their hardware, getting the latest versions of our products the increased collaboration that they can have, the well maintenance costs and that can put that stuff on high value activities. Like those things are the same, whether you're coming from server or DC.
James, do you want to add to that? Yeah. Sure. The first thing I note is that I am really pleased by how our gross margin has stayed at the level that it has as we've been able to build a business 45% of which -- revenue is coming from the cloud. So I think that speaks a lot to the execution of the teams involved there. But as we have indicated in prior calls, we would expect, particularly as the larger customers, the largest server and data center customers move over to the cloud, that we would see increased hosting costs. And we've spoken also about how we have added to our support capabilities so that we're ready to help those customers moving over to the cloud.
In terms of the timeframe for those support costs, I would expect those to be in place for the next few years, consistent with the timeframes that we've talked about for our larger customers moving over to the cloud. And so, I would expect some downward pressure on gross margins.
But having said that, I really do also want to emphasize how we're very focused on continuous cost improvement, whether it's around our usage of compute and storage resources or whether it's related to helping off support resources people help our customers, so that we can do that on a more cost efficient basis.
So, that hope gives you a little window as to how we're thinking about and operating along the lines of the cost of goods sold part of our business. Thank you both. Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho Securities. Your line is open. Okay. Thank you very much. I guess, first off, I'm just kind of wondering James how you would characterize the revenue and/or deferred revenue benefit from pull forward this quarter as compared to what you sell when you're prior. And then just secondly for micro Scott, just curious to hear the -- how the demand was for data center subscription this quarter? Thank you. I can take the first part of that question, Gregg. So, in terms of maintenance pull forward activity, I would describe that in Q2 as really quite modest. Now remember last year that was the primary pull forward quarter. And so it was a much larger effect in Q2 of fiscal 2020. Now, what I would expect to play out in Q3 -- and as I indicated little earlier, we're already seeing this in the month of January, is that we'd see more maintenance revenue pull forward activity in Q3 as well.
And so what's a little different this time around. A couple of things, really. First of all, we've given our customers more time, more advance warning of the price increases. And second, of course, not only is there a price increase, both for the server and the data center business, schedule to be put into place next week. But at this time we were also in the license, the sort of a business we've made that announcement.
And so really what played out more so in Q2 is you can think of it as pull forward at some level. It's a different type of pull forward to that that we've seen in prior years, because the pull forward has been customers adding to their license count, expanding the size of the current licenses ahead of the moves that we're making around sever end-of-life.
Data center, relatively modest pull forward there in Q2 as well. And again, I would expect there to be a pull forward activity ahead of the price increases that will apply to data center just as they will apply to server as of February 2nd. Okay. That's great. And then just broadly speaking, not referring to any kind of pull forward, but just around kind of overall data tender demand in the quarter, that would be helpful as well. Thanks. Yeah. In terms of data centers demand, overall, it was a relatively strong quarter. I think part of what we're seeing is some of our European partners encouraging some of their customers to move over to the data center ahead of these price increases. So that was a part of what was going on in the subscription revenue line. But as we talked about before, recall that the cloud business is by far the largest part of our subscription revenue growth. Right. Okay. Great. Thank you. Thanks. Your next question comes from the line of DJ Hynes with Canaccord. Your line is open. Hey, guys. Congrats on the results. James, one for you. So there was a comment in the prepared remarks that said, you're growing the free edition strategy. And look, clearly the top of the funnel is really working, right? You already talked about that, but what is it that you're seeing that's given you competence in the economics of those customers, right? Is it just a lower tack or are you seeing expansion activity that's outperforming your expectations again? Any color there would be helpful. Yeah. Sure. So what we do is study very closely each cohort of free customers they join us each month and we track their progression, whether it be because they add to the user accounts and then go beyond the 10 user free limit or whether the progression is before they get to 10, they decide that they really need and appreciate the functionality that our standard cloud offering or even our premium cloud offering contains. And so they make that switch from a free to a paid edition in that way before they get for the 10 years level.
So we watched this, as I say very closely cohort by cohort. And so while, I noted earlier that for fiscal 2021, we would continue to see this as a net revenue headwind. But as we watched the cohorts, we see the trend lines are quite clear, and that gives us confidence about the future of this initiative. I think it's an excellent example of how we've taken a long-term view. We've made a decision to take a short-term headwind for the long-term benefit down the track.
Mike, are going to add something? Yeah. Thanks, James. DJ, I just want to add a couple of small points there I suppose. We've had a lot of questions on free. Firstly, I would think of free as much less thoroughbred and much more cloud self style in terms of how it's going to give us a long-term kind of diesel engine, like pull up the hill, right? And the reason for that is, it builds a big base of customers and potential customers underneath our business that will mature into customers small and large over the next many, many years, right? It's a multi-year impact. It's a long-term investment that we're aiming at with free, but clearly we track extremely closely active usage. And I would stress that is the most important metric for us. Our people using these free additions that we're giving away free things that people don't use them.
So we spend a lot of time trying to track active usage and we're looking at how we can make sure the customers are getting value out of those free additions. We firmly believe philosophically if they're getting value, once they hit that 10 years of stage, they will pay and continue to be a long-term Atlassian customer said marching up that edition hill.
The second part that's really important for the free editions for us is the reduction of friction specifically in cross flow and cross sell. So where you may have -- for example, a Jira software instance that has 50 or 100 people, and someone discovers Confluence and its connections to Jira software in that company, previously they would have to -- if they weren't the administrator get out a credit card and pay for a trial of the Confluence instance, if that makes sense. Now they can start a free trial of Confluence as any of those users. So their ability to discover new products that we have as an existing customer is also increased, right? And the more users we have in product, the first product, the more that we have a potential to start trials of second products or free editions alongside with anyone in that company. So our ability to expand and go wall-to-wall is increased by free.
Again, I would stress it's a pretty modest revenue impact, given these are all small customers and we are aiming for that multi-year impact, part of our sort of long-term thinking. Yeah. No, that makes perfect sense. And I'm built more like a cloud building and a thoroughbred, so I can get behind that analogy. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one -- I know it's early, but what have you seen in terms of the revenue applications when customers migrate from server to cloud? I think you talked about small customers may see a little bit of a downtick in revenue capture mid-market, maybe a little bit of uptick. Any early read on revenue conversion and including the potential to upsell, cross sell during the migration.
And then I'll just throw in my second one. Pretty interesting when with thought works and the 8,000 users on Trello. Is this one of the biggest customers? You've had adopt Trello from a user count level and just be curious to hear maybe kind of why they picked you over the competition and anything else you can share about how you won the deal. I can take the first part of that. In terms of the revenue result that we've seen from the service cloud migrations, I would say that's very much tracking along to our expectations. As you pointed out, as you framed the question, we gave some, I think, helpful illustrations of how the economics work for small, medium sized customers on those generally the ones that are migrating at this point in time. So, yeah, that's tracking pretty consistently with our previous discussions of the topic. So yes, some headwinds on the smaller size, at least initially modest tailwinds on the medium-sized. Net-net, I wouldn't describe it as a material driver of the revenue in Q2. And Matt, I can take the Trello question. Look, Trello continues to be early in its monetization journey. As we settled the time again, a year ago, I believe we released a stat, it had passed 50 million accounts. So from the point of view of size and scale, the 8,000 thousand uses mentioned that the whole looks is relatively small, obviously in comparison to the 50 million uses of Trello, and that 10 million monthly active use a number that we possibly released at our Investor Day. That's it from Trello's point of view.
Obviously, we're continuing to learn from the customer base and work on demonetization journeys there in Trello, working through it's monetization ladder, if you think about it's equivalent, but free business class and Trello Enterprise, it's sort of equivalent to the free standard premium enterprise ladder of editions that we have in Jira software and then Jira Service Management.
8,000 users is not a particularly large enterprise Trello customer I would say. We certainly have some that are in order of magnitude or more larger than that. But it's a very good win for us. I think the reason you see companies like Trello using this is ultimately about Trello's flexibility and its capabilities and potential to handle all manner of different workloads with a very freeform model inside an organization clients.
So, it's adaptability to lots and lots of different use cases and almost anyone in a large company, gives Trello huge advantages to solve a whole manner of workflow problems for those larger organizations. And again, as we continue to do in business class and in Trello Enterprise is give those organizations that control to manage their data, to manage their users and manage the boards whilst keeping that flexibility and freeform nature of Trello in the hands of the users, I guess. And you'll see a lot of exciting things coming up in Trello. Again, a small plug for Team 21 if you go to that in a couple months time. We continue to work on really exciting things to Trello and look forward to its future. Great. Helpful color. Thanks. Your next question comes from the line of Rob Oliver with Baird. Your line is open. Great. Thanks guys for taking my question. Happy New Year to everybody. My question is on Jira Service Management and then I have a quick follow-up. As you see customers, and I know it's still early migrate from Jira service desk up to Jira Service Management in the cloud. Obviously, that product attacking more things within the IT department, Agile, DevOps, ITSM work management. Any color around sort of the expansion you're seeing, as that product -- as people migrate.
And then, just a question on the partner network games had mentioned earlier, come the ways you're incentivizing the partners with cloud apps and others. You guys are obviously very used to selling with a very light touch. But many of your partners are not, but even partners are very active in physical events and stuff. So, I'm just curious as your partners, 600 plus play a real important role here in this migration, how they're adapting to the current environment and whether you're satisfied with the progress that you see. Thank you guys very much. Sure. Look on ITSM, I would say too early in the release of that particular product to see massive differences with JSD having -- again, not being in the market that long in terms of adoption and seek expansion. Obviously being a broader feature offering and having embedded the opportunity functionality and some other things to serve a lot more purposes full JSM specifically, we are ambitious, I would say, that we say that seat expansion of the time, whether that's a small customer going from 50 seats to 80 seats or a very large customer going from 10,000 seats to 15,000 seats. I think JSM gives us all of that possibility.
And I would stress that we continue to invest very aggressively in that product set. We still have the CMDB functionality coming out and continue to invest in automation, all the other things that we've put into the ITSM packages over the last than a while.
One thing I would broaden that though, is when we talk about our connections to IT, it is broader than just ITSM. I think about ITSM as IT teams using JSM for IT. We gain great connection trust, a partnership with those IT departments that we then have a lot of other offerings that they can take advantage of in terms of that IT department providing functionality to the rest of their organization. And that's why you say the strength of the broader Jira platform. So they start to bring in Jira Core. They start to bring on the products to provide workflow applications and solve lots of different use cases and workflows for other parts of the organization.
That's often the IT department creating that workflow for the legal department, the marketing department, the finance department, but all within that one Jira platform and all within a broader Atlassian platform. And that applies as much to Confluence as it does to Jira Core or indeed to Trello in Trello Enterprise. That's about our broader Atlassian seat expansion once we really gained the trust and respect of that IT department and what we can do to help them.
I'll let Scott answer on the partner network. Thanks Mike. The partners, as many of you would know it's been a peak part of align … I think Scott's screen blurring out there [ph]. Sorry. It is a huge advantage for us in Europe to have a partner network. We have partner network extends the entire globe. And Atlassian does not have a services department. And so our services are really provided by our partner network around the world. And as we know, we incentivize them with margins. And we also spend a lot of time on training and so forth. And, of course, we are using training, margins and other things to direct our partners network more towards our cloud offerings, that this is course where the demand from our customers is at the moment as well. Thanks a lot, guys. Your next question comes from the line of Rishi Jaluria with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Nice to see continuing and improving business momentum. Two quick ones. First, going back to the comment that's been made on the server customers and not expecting mid to large -- or two-thirds of mid to large customers to migrate until FY 2023 and beyond. I guess I'm a little surprised by that metric given the incentives that you have in place to push migration. What has been the pushback from customers on migrating? Is it just the amount of investment that has to be made? Is it not enough incentive? Is it pricing? Is it inertia?
And then follow-up, I just wanted to ask about cloud net expansion rates. At the Analyst Day, you talked about 121% cloud net expansion rate and 130% for medium and large customers. How has that been trending? And is that a metric you plan to disclose maybe annually or how should we be thinking about that? Thanks. Scott, I will take the first one and James chime in on the second one. For these server customers and the large ones migrating from server to cloud, one thing to realize is, these instances are mission-critical in our organizations. We've had the CIO of a large technology company talk to us recently, and they said, well, there's three to four mission-critical applications at Atlassian -- sorry -- this is a good company. One of them is our ERP. One of them is kind of a Salesforce automation, and one of them is Atlassian products because we usually stopped when these products go down.
And so when these mission-critical applications are there, these companies want to plan for it, find the budget cycles for it insight. If that gets -- the thing is a move today, they appreciate all the benefits that I would get, that is a practical matter. It takes a while to plan and migrate the sort of the systems where they really want to minimize the amount of downtime for their employees. And so there's nothing specific. There -- I would say there's no areas that Atlassian will continue to improve on around compliance and certification in certain geographies that takes us a while to get those things and customers are working with us to move as we hit those certifications. But there's nothing specific that I look at that makes them a delight really just inertia and the mission criticality of our applications. And then just on the second part of your question, obviously at the Investor Day, we wanted to dive a little deeper in terms of our offering and cloud metrics, given the importance of the cloud business to our company in the coming years. So yes, we talked about our 35% growth year-over-year at that point the net expansion rate you say at 121% and that being a larger 130% for our medium and larger sized customers. And so, as we continue along our cloud migration journey, you can expect that we will periodically update those statistics. Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Your line is open. Hey, guys. This is Luv Sodha on for Brent Thill. Congrats again on the nice quarter. Just a couple of real quick questions from me. One was, digging a little bit deeper on the migration, the server to cloud migration. I guess, did that have any impact, any negative headlines on billings or revenue per se?
And then the second question was on the momentum that you've seen that the free cloud versions last quarter, I think, that -- you saw an increase of 175%, has that top of the funnel momentum continued in this quarter? Thank you. So I can take the first part there. In terms of server to cloud migration impact on billings. No, I wouldn't describe it as a material item in Q2, either our revenue results off of the deferred revenue. And in terms of the free versions, we're pleased with obviously our progress there, but I wouldn't speak to anything in addition to what we've already covered in earlier balances.
Anything to add to that Scott or Mike? Okay. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jack Andrews with Needham. Your line is open. Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. I wanted to see if you could provide an update for us on Align. You previously talked about how Align is one of your fastest growing revenue products. And so, it’s just -- was curious if there’s any context you can share in terms of just how -- where the growth is coming from and how it’s growing whether it’s through organic means or is cross selling really kicking in there? Hi. Thank you. It’s Scott here. On Align, again, that is primarily sold to our existing customers, right? So, this is not something that where we go in with the sales team and have kind of long customer acquisition sale cycle. These are existing customers using our products, predominantly Jira. And I’d say actually I’ve got one on many Jiras across my organization. We are doing a ideal transformation and digital transformation and we want better executive level understanding and we want to sort of scale up our Agile from what was happening at the engineering level all the way through the organization. And so, what we get is a lot of our customers going up and saying how do we solve this problem. And, of course, Align is the exact solution they’re looking for.
And so, I don’t think there’s anything in terms of -- it really is an upsell, so existing customer base. We're very happy with the acquisition and how it works with our customers. It is one of many things that helps us within our customers' digital transformation. And that is something we can talk with customers. It used to be that software teams were kind of do their own thing in the department, they say the software is mission-critical to every company. When you talk to companies that goes every sector and that really saying that the thing they’re struggling with is how they’re transforming their organization.
And in most of these cases that transformation is coming from the software teams. They are actually adopting practices in software and rolling them out across the entire organization. And benefiting, not just here Align, but that benefits Confluence as teams need to collaborate more closely across their entire organization.
It’s going to benefit some of the new products we’ve got coming out to address this may even. So that broad trend, I think, is news in the up and whole bunch of conversations at the C level, CIOs, CTOs and even CEOs of organizations who are turning up to Atlassian asking how we can help them solve their digital transformation problem. Thank you very much. Your next question comes from the line of James Fish with Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Hey, guys. This is Quinton on for Jim. Thanks for taking our question. Really throughout the pandemic, we’ve seen employees adopting new ways of communicating with their teams. We're wondering if you’ve seen any acceleration in the adoption of Atlassian products from the non-technical users maybe compared to more prior years. And how are you viewing the competition in the non-technical specific world? Thank you. Good day, Quinton. Look, let me answer the pandemic question first. Obviously, as more people are working from home, working remotely, changing their work habits, as we like to say they change where they work, but they keep how they work consistent in order to allow people to work from multi different locations. As that has happened, you naturally see increased activity in usage in our products, because our products fundamentally help people working asynchronously, like they help teams collaborate to help you get on the same page where you might have used a whiteboard beforehand and in an office now you might use a Trello board or if you have a remote meetings. I live on Zoom most days. We often start meetings with Confluence pages as a pre rate, right? It’s a very -- much more efficient asynchronous method we will often start our meetings with a 10-minute pre rate where someone will send the link to a Confluence page, we will read it and then comments to attend it, and then we will start the meeting.
So, these sort of things are driving, I think, a difference in how people think about working and structuring their day in knowledge work in broader areas and leading to activity and usage in our products. Again, it’s not a sort of a hockey stick jump or a step change jump. I would say, it’s a continued slow march of improvement for us as more companies that are already customers have more usage, more days of the week, they might use our products, et cetera and that will, I think, in the long-term lead to expansion, but it’s not going to be a step change. They all sort of run online and suddenly decide to buy Trello, I guess.
In the broader work management for all space, look, we continue to be bullish. It’s a very huge market. Obviously, we’re very happy with the progress of Trello. Confluence continues to do well at helping us get wall-to-wall with inside customers. And we continue to work in innovation areas on new products to target some of those trends that suppose.
One example of that is our acquisition, we acquired a company called Halp, which is a digital version of ASN, you might say, focused on messaging platforms. So, Slack and Microsoft Teams and providing service management within the messaging construct and connecting it back sometimes to something like a Jira Service Management in the back end and sometimes just processing all that messaging within -- all that service within the messaging products. That again, as you see adoption of things like the Slack and Teams during this pandemic, people work-from-home, products like Halp will benefit from that because people are increasingly looking for ways to do work within those tools. And that’s the leading service provision tool, I think, in the Slack ecosystem is now in the Atlassian stable. And we continue to work on integrating that in the rest of the things. Got it. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. Your line is open. Great. Thank you. And I’ll add my congratulations. So, I’ll go to a little different topic here. So, in August, you announced that the employees could work-from-home permanently even after the pandemic ends and obviously your whole solutions that really helps with that. But I know about you guys, but I find a full Zoom day is so exhausting. And within our organization, I’m not sure it’s the best thing for our employees. I’m just wondering, how has your thinking on that topic evolved over the last six months? Scott here. Obviously, others can chime in if I want to add anything. We think of it -- we call it Team Anywhere is our why we’ve done this, which is really that our employees can work anywhere they want. And if they choose to come and work in one of our offices, they can do that. If they choose to work-from-home, they can do that. And that really opens up the talent pool for us.
And if we think one of the reasons why Atlassian has been successful, I think is our heritage outside of Silicon Valley. It’s allowed us to tap into an amazingly diverse and very loyal talent pool, particularly in Australia. And so, I think that’s been echoes our success and we’re really excited about and able to tap into that around the world.
I know myself -- yeah, the day full of Zoom meetings aren’t that great. But what we found is that the many employees value the lack of a community, the ability to spend more time with friends and family, the reinvigoration of local communities around where they live. I know many of our executive team has moved from the center of cities to somewhere nearby to take advantage of kind of those areas. And so, two hours back from a commute gives you a lot of freedom and flexibility to spend time with family or exercise or other things there.
I’d remind our employees that we aren’t really in a steady state there that we are working from home in the middle of a pandemic. And that’s different to what the world will look like when you can -- your kids are back at school, and you can travel into the office. And we are building our policies so that world and God willing like that will happen this year. We will see the vaccine rollout and hopefully we can move into a more normal state.
So, it is something we spend a lot of time thinking about. I don’t think we’ll get it all right like everything Atlassian. We continually try and improve that cloud self spirit is continuing to make relentless improvement and so, you’ll see that here as well. Great. Thanks for that perspective. Your next question comes from the line of Fred Havemeyer with Macquarie. Your line is open. Hey. Thank you very much for taking my question. I'm really curious about your perspective on this. Our business is a planning for their IT remote based work -- sorry -- remote work, the design in this new kind of IT paradigm of hybrid of remote work. How are you seeing the evolution in the funnel? And what are companies looking for in terms of software that can support more Agile work cycles or team alignment within these remote work environments? Scott here. It’s interesting in terms of your remote work by design, the great quote, which is the future is here, it’s just unevenly distributed. And I think, if I went back pre-pandemic, you would find it like they were a large number of our customers already working in this fashion, heavily weighting on digital tools to share information across their organization, already reaping the benefits of asynchronous communication more work that is tracked kind of in Confluence rather than meetings.
And so, in many cases, what we’ve seen in the pandemic is that sort of whole world catching up. Many people who are already using Zoom on a day-to-day basis and everyone else is now saying it. We’re seeing many customers using Jira and Confluence and our Agile products, with Trello already being used in many places. So, I don’t think there has been a huge change. I guess, we’ve always, at Atlassian, cater to the vanguard of people and how they’re working. And obviously, there’s some new things we’re thinking about with this. But it hasn’t been a sort of step change in sort of how products work. Thank you. [Operator Instructions]
Your next question comes from the line of Ari Terjanian with Cleveland Research. Your line is open. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the results. At the Analyst Day couple months ago, you guys talked of about the strength in large deals. I was wondering if you could double click on that and how recent performance is there in this quarter.
And second, just -- yeah, any more color around -- what would you say is the biggest surprise you’ve seen in terms of customer behavior since the October announcement of the server end-of-sale? Thank you. So, in terms of large deals, we tend to update that’s just the each year. I would say that we continue to execute in a way kind of consistent with the trends that were laid out in the last stats that we laid out at Analyst Day.
And in terms of the second part of your question, surprises in terms of how customers have reacted post the server EOL announcement, I would really say that I think our team prepared just fabulously for that announcement. And that planning, the thought that went into that announcement has paid off.
Because I would say that customers are, obviously, thinking hard about their options and so forth, the right timing for them to make a move and so for. But really that’s very consistent with how we had analyzed and planned for this announcement.
Scott or Mike, would you add anything to that? No. I think you said it really well, James. Like, we’re thoughtful long-term focused and we’ve seen from Atlassian whether it’s free or migration to cloud or the product portfolio we build like we really just take a long-term focus with all of it. And with volatility month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter, but most of time, Mike and I don’t spend -- really as much time on pull forward or anything like that. We’re spending our time thinking about the future of our companies and customers in the cloud.
So, yeah, we can -- I mean, it’s a last question, I’d say thank you to all of you for being on with the journey and I appreciate it and I think -- that’s our last question? Yes. There are no further questions at this time. I’ll turn the call back to Mike for closing remarks. Hello, everyone. Thank you very much for attending the call and for the thoughtful questions and write-ups. I hope you and your families stay safe in this challenging time around the world. And we look forward to talking to you next quarter.
And a reminder that Team 21, our annual conference is on just before the next earnings call, I believe, so attend that. And thank you very much for being here. Hope you have a kick-ass weekend. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating.

Thank you for joining Atlassian's Earnings Conference Call for the Third Quarter Of Fiscal Year 2021. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of Atlassian's website following this call.
I will now hand the call over to Martin Lam, Atlassian's Head of Investor Relations Good afternoon, and welcome to Atlassian's Third Quarter of Fiscal Year 2021 Earnings Call. Thank you for joining us today. On the call today, we have Atlassian's Co-Founders and Co-CEOs, Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes; and our Chief Financial Officer, James Beer.
Earlier today, we issued a shareholder letter and press release with our financial results and commentary for our third quarter of fiscal year 2021. The shareholder letter is available on Atlassian's work life blog and the Investor Relations section of our website, where you'll also find other earnings-related materials, including the earnings press release and supplemental investor data sheet. During the call today, we'll make brief opening remarks and then spend the remainder of time on Q&A.
This call will include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events.
Forward-looking statements represent our management's beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made, and we assume no obligation to update or revise such statements should they change or cease to be current. Further information on these and other factors that could affect the Company's financial results is included in filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including the section titled Risk Factors in our most recent Form 20-F and quarterly Form 6-K.
During today's call, we will also discuss non-IFRS financial measures. These non-IFRS financial measures are in addition to and are not a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. A reconciliation between IFRS and non-IFRS financial measures is available in our shareholder letter, earnings release and investor data sheet on the IR website.
During Q&A, please ask your full question upfront so that we can easily move through to the next speaker. We also invite you to check out sessions from Team '21, our annual virtual customer conference, which runs through tomorrow, April 30. We've included a link to Team '21 in our shareholder letter and our earnings release. Lastly, I want to thank Mike and Scott, James and Matt, and for the opportunity to lead Investor Relations at this incredible long-term and customer-focused company.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for opening remarks. Thanks, Martin, and thank you for joining today from wherever you are in the world. As I sit in Australia, I'm reminded that our national coat of arms, displays the kangaroo and the emu. Why those two specific animals you might ask? Because they are unable to walk backwards, they can only move forward. Australia as a nation must continue to move forward.
True to our Australian heritage, Atlassian only moves forward, and we continue to do so at great pace through a strong Q3. We hope that you've read the shareholder letter, where we described our long-term focus on delivering that innovation to customers. Our investment in our world-class cloud platform makes it possible to develop and deploy this innovation at an ever faster pace.
Highlights from the quarter include: doubling customer cloud migrations versus last year, right in line with our expectations; launching Point A, our new product development program. Yesterday, we announced five initial products from Point A to technical and nontechnical teams of all sizes, and continuous investment in leading-edge innovation.
We announced amazing updates for the Jira family of products. We're extremely excited about initiatives like Open DevOps and the whole new Trello that shipped during the quarter as well as acquisitions of ThinkTilt and Chartio.
We also posted strong results in Q3. We saw significant short-term demand for on-premises products as a result of customers purchasing ahead of both the discontinuation of new server license sales and price changes to on-premises products that went into effect during the quarter.
More importantly, we made continued progress to our long-term goal of becoming a cloud-first company. During the quarter, cloud revenue grew 35% year-over-year, and overall subscription revenue grew by 43% year-over-year.
Before we move to Q&A, Scott and I want to thank the more than 6,000 Atlassians whose resilience, passion and commitment to drive that innovation that we deliver to our customers and who continue to move forward every day.
Check out our sessions from Team '21 to see how we're building the future of teamwork to unleash the potential of every team.
With that, I'll pass the call over to the operator for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Busy week for everyone, it seems like, with the team conference, which looked like a good showcase for some of the innovation on the product side, that cloud, in particular, opens up. So was hoping you could maybe first touch on that, what you're enabling for customers with things like the Point A program and our Work Management.
And then maybe, James, you could also comment on whether some of those recent innovations as well as things like cloud enterprise and the data center strength you're showing here alter your view on the mid-30 subscription growth target you've laid out, given it looks like you'll come in above there this year at the very least. Yes, Michael, good to hear from you again. I can -- look, I can talk to point A. If you've seen all the announcements in the news, Point A itself is a program that we've launched to co-develop some of our new products alongside our customers.
There's a period in early product innovation where we know what we want to build, but the progress, if you like, the shape shifting of the product in its early days is very rapid. And so we need to notify customers that in the first year or two of a product's life, it's likely to change form very quickly, not in a volatile way, but in a really sort of forward-moving way.
That is done alongside customers, and we are -- true to our philosophy of being opened, we're doing that alongside our customers, and we're trying to be very clear with them about that. Point A, as we mentioned in the shareholder letter, all of the products built very strongly on the Atlassian cloud platform.
So all of the things that we've talked about from machine learning and automation capabilities, to the compliance requirements and enterprise structures that we have through the collaborative capabilities and editors and reactions and all sorts of other things, they all appear in all of those Point A products.
So not only will they solve a series of new challenges that our customers have and deliver unique value to them from product managers in Jira Product Discovery through to broad-scale organizational goals and by scale sort of user directories in Team Central, obviously, through to Jira Work Management, bringing our business teams marketing, finance and HR into the Giro family and all of the Jira capabilities that arise for those business teams in a business-friendly environment. Not only do all of those things arrive in Point A, all of the capabilities that we continue to bring to the client platform will arrive in those products as well.
So we thought it was a very good example of the innovation that we've been building in the platform that's not just for our existing customers and existing products, but it's as much for the new things that we can continue to build and the advantages of moving into the cloud, both for us in terms of creating things and for our customers in terms of the value that they can get once they have moved there or if they are already there, if they are in, obviously, very large numbers today.
I can talk more if anyone has any other questions, but let me hand off to James to talk about the subscription growth part of your question. Yes. Sure. Thanks, Mike. Certainly, we were very pleased with the ongoing momentum building right across our cloud business. You mentioned in the question, enterprise, very early days for that addition. We're very pleased that it's off to a good start, but early for that to be a material revenue contributor. But I would certainly point to our premium additions as continuing their very nice momentum. And I'm also really pleased by how our partners, as a group, are really developing their business practices around our cloud business. That's very encouraging for our future.
And then you mentioned the event-driven data center volume of activity that we discussed in our preannouncement press release a few weeks ago. So given all that, yes, we are projecting that we would beat the FY '21 previous target of subscription revenue growth in the mid-30s percent year-over-year. And then for FY '22, the subscription revenue growth target, we'll address that in 90 days' time. Your next question comes from the line of Arjun Bhatia from William Blair. Your line is open. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to touch on some of the new product announcements you made specifically around Jira Work Management, and it sounds like you made some changes to Trello as well. But as you're going after this business user market, I think we're all aware that there is a lot of incumbents in that space and a lot of fast-growing companies. But I would love to hear how you think that space evolves over time. Do you think there's consolidation in the number of tools that business users are using for work management? And then how does Jira Work Management strategically kind of position itself in this market as something unique and compelling to offer compared to some of the other players that are in the space? Sure. Arjun, I can take that. Look, let me start with the latter part of your question first. A huge number of business teams already use Jira software or the formerly owned Jira Core to manage their work. So this is not a new area for us. This is about us doing what is classic Atlassian innovation, listening to our customers, seeing what those business teams that use Jira software already are doing and how we can deliver further capabilities to improve what they're already doing in a new and better offering that's tailored to their needs.
We're very confident there are a lot of other business teams in our customers that could, therefore, benefit from that if we can deliver a really good and compelling experience. So you can see that in some of the features, things like calendars and time line views more sort of business friendly ways of looking at things. A lot of the new Jira family templates that shipped as a part of Team '21, but this is sort of project setup in very specific ways for lots of different circumstances.
You can obviously think about those for software teams that offer different methodologies and ways that popular teams want to set up that project. We can do that for the upfront. But we ship to 20 different business templates for different HR and finance and marketing use cases that take advantage of the features of Jira Work Management to deliver for those particular customers.
There, Jira is a very structured system for work management. So it has a huge amount of power, a huge amount of capability built into the Jira platform and the broader Atlassian platform. For customers that have chosen Jira in a deep way across their business, this is a very logical choice to continue to expand that to our business teams, specifically where those business teams have to work as they increasingly do with teams in the technology part of the organization. So when you're working with software teams, when you're working with IT teams or operations teams, you can see a lot of things around legal and compliance, for example, or finance and AWS billing, which can be quite challenging.
There are marketing teams shipping software and have to understand how to work with designers and software teams and when things are going to arrive and what they're going to look like and how that's going to go together. So the fact that it's all inside the Jira platform provides a lot of very deep integration capabilities, not least things like automation, machine learning. The smarter Jira itself gets smarter as a family of products. We can do a lot of things in terms of cross link in between.
So I hope that shows a little reasons why we think a lot of business teams will be excited by Jira Work Management. I would point out I know it's very early days, right? Again, part of Point A is co-developing this with customers, and we will continue to do that. I think this space in general, as you asked at the start of your question, is very, very large. As we pointed out, there's close to 1 billion knowledge workers out there.
As we look at continual knowledge work of productivity improvements over the next decades to come, there's going to be a lot of work around how do we take things like machine learning and automation and all sorts of data resources as we have in the Avastin platform and bring them to knowledge worker productivity in terms of project management, task management and the flows, right? How do we coordinate groups of people, which we call teams across large organizations in different functions, we obviously think with the broader Atlassian platform and the different offerings in the Jira family, we are very well positioned to take advantage of those trends. Your next question comes from the line of Rob Oliver from Baird. Your line is open. Thank you very much for taking my question. I wanted to just ask about the enterprise conversions. You guys mentioned Splunk in your in your letter and particularly, I think, compelling example. When you look at a company like a Splunk, I think you guys mentioned maybe Northwest Mutual as well. Are there patterns or markers that you see like that that are leaping at the opportunity to migrate early? I know you guys have said that it would be mostly SMBs early in enterprises later. But clearly, there are some enterprises, multiproduct platform-type users that would leap that opportunity in the use of data that you guys are famous for. I'm sure there's some patterns you're identified there, whether it be JSM users or whatever with lower what your -- how you're approaching that. Robert, it's Scott here. I appreciate the question. As we've mentioned before, it's migrating the tens of thousands of customers we have from our server and data center offerings across the cloud as a multiyear process. And we still expect the majority of our largest customers to move kind of in subsequent years. And so we're really excited by some early movement of customers, but it doesn't represent any, I guess, great change in the estimates that we put out previously.
When I look at the customers that moved across, in general, without speaking to those specific examples, large companies can be identical. All agree that the cloud is the future for them. They don't want to be in the business of managing infrastructure. They look at the features that we're offering in the cloud, whether it's the security features we can offer them or it's the management features or the end user-facing features. And they're all -- they all want to be there. And so it comes under a discussion of when we ready.
In some cases, the highly regulated industries, we haven't yet got the certification required. Or when are they ready? Which may be down to the time frame on which they can schedule that project alongside of the projects that the house are going on internally. And so we're really happy with the momentum that we're seeing with customers, large and small. It doesn't represent any change, I guess, in our forecast that was -- it is a multiyear process. Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Thank you guys for taking the question and a very nice quarter. The number in particular that really stuck out to me was that new customer add number, And I know some of it's related to kind of single-use Trello. But even when we take that, it's well ahead of what you guys have added historically. I'm sure some of it's related to sort of end of new server licensing, but that only makes some sense because the customers didn't realize they needed Trello before and then also because the pricing changes that they do that doesn't make a ton of sense. Can you help us understand like what caused that? What drove such a big spike in new customer adds. And are these customers -- are they like of the same ilk as like historical customer is? Like did they have the same growth potential as what you've seen historically? Keith, it's Scott here. I'll take that question. You've been around long enough to know that at Atlassian, we don't spend a lot of time looking at our customer numbers on a quarter-to-quarter basis just because a customer quarter brings very little revenue at the start and there's just so much variation in quarter-to-quarter. It's not something we manage to internally.
You mentioned the Trello single users, so if I think about kind of thesis in the border trend, we've done a lot of changes to our funnel over the last year, how we've introduced free versions of that product and so that's changed our funnel. We've done more optimization around Trello, which is to more single users, also more small teams there.
And while customer numbers are a huge indicator of our long-term potential, we don't kind of really get excited by large numbers, all small numbers in any particular quarter. And so I think it's too early to say what these customers look like over the long term as we've made these changes to our funnel. We do want to pull out the Trello single users because we believe we're a teamwork platform and a single user isn't yet a team.
They may turn into a team pretty quickly, but not at this stage. And so we wanted to give you some indication of that. But yes, I think it will be fair to say that there is changes in our customer numbers as we've made changes to these funnels. And it's too early to say what the long-term potential of those look quite the same as previous ones.
Again, our model is land and expand. So obviously, we're ending way more companies across the world that gives us a huge opportunity for us to expand into those customers over time. Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho. Your line is open. Okay. Curious to hear what you're seeing with respect to demand for Jira Service Management, including the premium option that has the CMDB technology. And then for Point A, apologies in advance for throwing out a baseball analogy to an Australian and British management team, but what inning of a product development are you engaging your customers? And how broad of a level of input are you going to be soliciting from your customers? Yes, I can take both of those. Look, on the ITSM space, we continue to be extremely excited. As we've demonstrated two years ago, we told you in our shareholder letter, which I know you will read sort of work for work that we were doubling down on IT. And I think you can see over the last two years that we've really done that.
The CMDB capabilities you referred to are just the latest of a series of additions that you've seen us make, both from internally generated things and external acquisitions outstanding for the leading sort of world real-time rostering and capabilities because a lot of things in IT nowadays come down to milliseconds it matters all the way through to this quarter adding ProForma from ThinkTilt to continue to drive our automation and low code/no code in a really native Jira way.
Overall, the traction amongst the customer base is really phenomenal in the ITSM space. We're really excited about where we're going. We do believe we're very uniquely positioned. We're the only company that gives you a single pane of glass across software, operations and IT staff for modern enterprises that are moving at modern speed as we'd like to call it, high velocity. That's a very unique position, right?
The Atlassian cloud platform continues to deepen its capabilities, which we bring to all of those ITSM customers. And no matter whether you're a small company or a large company, we continue to see really create traction for those offerings. So I don't think -- demand continues to be strong, the CMDB capabilities that went during the quarter in the cloud. Obviously, we'll continue to get customers excited as we as we move through that.
I would point out that the low-code/no-code additions that we've added and will continue to do so. It's not new. Its automation has been a focus for us for a long while now. And I think in the quarter, you've just seen us bring that. And as we continue to add all of these capabilities together, so you can take the machine learning the automation, the forms and the CMDB that you mentioned, and it's just an amazing offering priority team.
So we continue to be really excited about the space. In terms of baseball analogies, I've sat through many of baseball games. So I think I know it at least well enough. It's very similar to cricket in terms of things to be and watching time. I would say that generally, we're sort of in the -- maybe the first or second inning, maybe bottom of the first, top of the second when we start revealing products to customers. I'm very confident of the direction that we're moving in. We have enough of the product built such that we are clear on the boundaries and what problem we are solving for customers. There's a lot of customer research that happens before that.
Once it then gets out, there are a lot of tailoring to their needs, integrations that they need and how the user experience is going to impact. Things like Compass, for example, are very new ways of looking at the sprawl of one's modern software architecture. And customers are saying, yes, this is a huge problem, but I don't know how to solve it because we don't have any tools to solve that.
And so we're trying to build a tool to solve something that is a problem they clearly have in a very, very new area. We hope that by the third or fourth inning. It's very clear to customers that the boundaries get very well defined, and that's when you start seeing a traction and monetization. In the early days, it's really just about finding that problem with the customer. Your next question comes from the line of Fred Havemeyer with Macquarie Research. Your line is open. So I'm also interested in Jira Work Management, and I'm wondering about how you're helping generally, less technical users do work, especially in these more modern remote work or hybrid work model. So understanding that it's early days, do you think that Jira Work Management is a product that nontechnical teams will pick up on a self-serve basis? Or do you anticipate it needing an assist from either your direct sales force or more of your channel partners? Yes. Good day, Fred. Look, I think like all Atlassian products, there'll be a large amount of self-serve involved. I think one of the things that's interesting about Jira Work Management, especially when combined with our land and expand model and obviously, the free program we've talked about a lot over time, that has great potential not just to learn new customers but to learn new parts of existing customers. So a Jira software customer that's broad can easily start a new free Jira Work Management account alongside that product offering alongside that Jira software for the first team or the second team to really get started.
That said, I have no doubt that because of all the capabilities of the broader Atlassian platform, automation, a lot of things we're investing in the data and insight space that we haven't talked about as much, but there's a lot there for partners to both explain to larger customers, map to their organizations, which is often a facility that they bring or understanding those larger customers challenges and business problems and then say, hey, Jira work management could be a piece of the solution to that problem and obviously bring it along to them.
So I would imagine that the general split that the self-serve motions, et cetera, Jira Work Management aren't meaningfully different to our other products in size and scale. Obviously, we think it's incredibly large market, and we continue to invest against that. I would point out, as we've talked about before, probably, call it, 50% of the broader Jira family audience is technical, which means about 50% of the audience today is nontechnical.
As Jira Work Management continues to grow, you could see that blend getting even further applied. It's usually surprising to people when they hear it's 50-50 at the moment. And obviously, this has a potential to continue to grow that. We've made no bones that our mission is the potential of every team and every team means we're going to have to work out how to help solve problems for marketing, HR, finance, sales, lots of other teams that need to manage projects around the building. And that's what Jira Work Management is aiming at inside the inside the capabilities and structure in power. Your next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Nice quarter, guys. I guess I want to just make sure I double down and understand the transition to the cloud. Clearly, you had a massive quarter where customers kind of pull in purchases. I guess the question is going back to that 30,000 server customers you talked about to transition over time. Has that number actually increased in this past quarter rather than decrease? And perhaps you can talk about churn that you've seen in the conversion? How is that shaped?
And then lastly, given the magnitude of this pull-in effect, do you get a sense that perhaps customers are really unhappy with your cloud pricing? Does this magnitude of falling make you feel more comfortable about your transition to the cloud or makes you question the pricing that you've set up for it relative to the historical products? Scott here. Great question. Appreciate you asking it. There's nothing about this last quarter that has changed our belief or our time frame internally for our customers moving over. And then again, main we say win, we've had a huge matter of pull forward on the service side of things. How does that affect our cloud transitions?
All of our internal cloud transition numbers are working day on track as what we had forecast before this. What you've really seen is people take advantage of, okay, inertia, I might be here for a year or two, I want to buy that now and get ahead of any price increases that are happening or And so it hasn't really changed their forecast time frame, they really just decided to transact ahead of certain events. So we haven't seen that.
You asked about churn, now customers and cloud pricing look on churn, our numbers are actually -- I think we've talked about this before, our churn numbers across cloud and across our entire base are better than we had forecasted through this transition. So that is going really well. And there will be some customers who will turn through this process, but we believe that it's better for us and those customers over the long term, like -- so that's all going on track.
And on the cloud pricing, we have discussions with our customers. Obviously, the sticker prices is larger in cloud for many of our customers. But when you look at the -- both of the features and the benefits they get from that the reduction in the number of headcount that they require to move across, like our cloud, our customers are super excited about the cloud offering and are very happy with the price that we're providing that at. And so we -- I guess, when you look the numbers on our website, sometimes they require a bit of explaining to customers. But once we've done that, they're all signing up, and it really just comes down to the time frame that they want to move across. Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies. Your line is open. I wanted to ask one quick one on -- dig a little bit deeper on that last question around the cloud migration. Could you talk a little bit about the enterprise cloud -- the cm enterprise cloud and how that might give some comfort to maybe the larger customers who are maybe waiting to make their decision as to whether or not they commit to the transition early on? And then a second question around the acquisitions of Chartio. I wanted to ask like are you planning to get into the BI space? Or is this just giving you some basic reporting functionality within the Jira family? Okay. Scott here. I'll do the first one, and Mike can chime in on the one. If you look at our migrations, we said that small customers can move faster, and we've seen that. And the larger customers just have more inertia, and so it takes them more time to move across. And the larger customers, we've done a lot for them over the last -- I mean, since we started our cloud, but it's accelerated over the last period of time.
We've improved scalability requirements, and we continue to tick down the size and scale of the instances that we can support in cloud. We are working on compliance and certifications, and we're again ticking off the compliance requirements for heavily regulated industries.
We are data residency and other one, particularly for customers in Europe, and you saw -- I think we talked about into our shareholder letter De Volksbank, who's the fourth largest bank in the Netherlands who have chosen to move across and their European customer and data residency obviously something that they consider over there.
You looked at data regulation that our enterprise offerings allow people who want to make sure the data is not intermingled with other customers. Security, we've improved and continue to improve our access product that allows effective integration with security providers and the higher level of security and access control.
I've been going for a very long time here, but we've -- we are continuing to improve LOA enterprise offerings, whether it's in the base product. We chose to be data residency in based product for every single customer. Then we have our premium offerings that provide more. And then for the largest companies in the world, we have enterprise versions of our product that cater to those specific needs. So all those are improving in a very, very rapid clip, and so yes, we're really happy with the progress of our R&D teams on those ones. Mike, do you want to talk about Chartio? Sure. Thanks for the question, Brent. Look, there's no doubt that data is incredibly important to our customers. And we have an amazing depth and richness of data that is incredibly important to them. The more customers consume Atlassian products across the family, the more data about their history, project and task speeds, how that connects into documentation, who's collaborating with who, we have a phenomenal data set when we put it all together across our products.
We are exposing that to customers in various different ways. Firstly, this quarter, you've seen -- well, first, I would I would start with, in the platform, infrastructural, we continue to build a large data lake where we are cross-referencing and connecting all of the different data points that we have across multiple products and across third-party products, I would say, in the various different markets and workflows that we're involved in.
So in software, in IT operations and through to broader knowledge management and work management that data lake all of the principles that Scott just talked about. So this is not a trivial engineering exercise across billions and billions of data points, but to do it with data residency in mind and do it with all of the different enterprise compliance in mind is a nontrivial exercise. That's a part of what the Atlassian platform does in terms of the data and insights features keeping compliance and privacy in mind at all times.
We then take that data lake. We can expose it to customers in a direct way. We have an early access program going on to expose that directly to customers to put into their broad-scale BI tool and mix and match with whatever data that they have. That's one potential way that, that is emerging for customers' insights in a particular customer users workflow to help them manage what they are doing at that particular time.
So we shipped the series of features inside Jira Software this quarter where that emerged inside the software Board. So for example, we can look at your organization's general task completion rate in terms of how you do agile software. You can look at a particular team's task completion rate, how much work they tend to get through in a given sprints, two weeks.
And then as they're doing sprint planning, we provide real-time insights to them rather than having to go look at some sort of reporting tool to work out the insights in real time, we say, Hey, you might be trying to do too much this next two weeks based on our analysis of your last -- however long they've been using it in the last two years' worth of work, this particular team, this piece of software, this code base. We know a lot about what's going on. So that is starting to emerge inside the product itself.
And then lastly, you get to, as you mentioned, reporting in other areas. Chartio's strength is in its reporting and dashboards capabilities. You'll see the start to emerge, I imagine in the Atlassian platform as a broad-scale capability, much alongside automation and machine learning and other things where we look platform-wide across multiple products and also potentially seeing those reports and dashboards appearing inside singular products where that makes sense.
It's a fantastic team with a huge amount of experience in this area of dealing with large-scale data sets and presenting them. It also has a lot of capabilities to continue to look at third-party data. Often it's not your Jira software data alone that helps with sprint planning when we need to look at source data and data from other providers as well. So really excited about the space and the team that's joined us there in Chartio and lots of potential, a huge amount of work that we're already doing there, but future looks great. Your next question comes from the line of Tyler Radke from Citi. Your line is open. Could you help us understand how you're thinking about just data center strength kind of continuing into Q4? Obviously, a really strong number in Q3, and obviously, with the end of life of server, you would expect that customers weren't ready to go to the cloud. Kind of when we have data centers they're only non-cloud options. Maybe just help us understand how you're thinking about that growth heading into Q4 and just overall subscription growth into Q4. This is James. I'll address that one. Clearly, in Q3, we did see this outsized event-driven data center volumes. And of course, a part of that was, customers stepping in front of the price increases that we implemented in Q3. So you won't have that sort of a dynamic playing out in Q4. As I mentioned a little earlier, though, when we look at our subscription revenue growth target now for fiscal '21, we had previously said mid-30s percent growth year-over-year. And we are confident that we're going to beat that now. We're very much encouraged as we've been discussing on this call by the momentum that we're seeing on the cloud business. And then as you say, the data center business remains strong as well. And the next question comes from the line of Robert Majek from Raymond James. Your line is open. In my checks, I picked up that some customers are planning to convert to cloud last minute in June, while they're still able to lock in the 55% discount level. Is that something that you've heard or expect more broadly across the base? And if so, should we expect some new cloud wins to get pulled forward into Q4? Well, this is James again. You're right. We do have the loyalty discount that we've been offering to enterprise scale, so 1,000-plus users, server customers looking to migrate over to the cloud. So there could be some additional volume there ahead of that reduction in the discount rate. But we're certainly not of the mind that, that would drive the sort of scale of event-driven activity that we saw in Q3.
I think Q3 was maybe really Atlassian unusual event in terms of us ceasing the sale of new server licenses and then also raising prices on both the server data center side of the business. So yes, there will be examples like the one you're framing in the question there, where we'll continue to try and tune our various business incentives to further drive our cloud migration time line. But I'm not of the view that it would drive the same sort of outsized level of activity that we saw in Q3. Your next question comes from the line of Jack Andrews from Needham. Your line is open. Congratulations on the announcements this week. I want to ask a couple of questions about Point A. I guess I was curious, given the launch, does this change your framework at all in terms of how you think about building new functionality organically versus maybe making potential acquisitions. And then I was also wondering if you could provide some color on just in terms of how we should be thinking about what type of -- what is the portfolio of new products that may come out of Point A look like? And how far field do you think that you might go from your core mission of improving work management under this new initiative Yes. Good day, Jack. Look, on the first part of your question, we've always maintained repeatedly, I think we've been very, very consistent in our philosophical stance. I was going to say since we've been public, but actually, we're consistent well before that in terms of -- we don't believe all the innovation exists inside the building. We don't believe all the innovation exists outside the building. And so we try to be extremely pragmatic and thoughtful about whether we build or buy new capabilities that we need or new products or teams in terms of groups of people. And it's always been a strength of ours, I think, to be pragmatic about both of those equations.
Point A is a particular example of internal innovation and programs that are starting to hit the outside world, which is always a very exciting time. Part of that is driven from the cloud platform investments that we've made over the last five years or more. So those investments have taken a large amount of that R&D spend line item that you're always so excited to find out about as a group. And building on those platforms, that platform itself will enable us to create new products faster and with less resource spend than they would have otherwise done in past years.
That's why all of those products are in the cloud. We believe all of those products will be also a card or an advantage to customers who are considering moving their existing products to cloud. A lot of the new products that they can work with exist in the cloud only because they're natively built on top of that cloud platform. That lets each of those products benefit from all of the capabilities that we've already put into that cloud platform.
So we've had a lot of feedback on Team Central from customers that are already using it and the amazing breadth that it already has. Well, a lot of that has come from three, four years of investment in an absolutely world-class editing experience and a linking experience to tie all of your SaaS objects and data together into various forms. That's being repackaged into a very different method. We're looking at goals, status updates and company directories inside Team Central, but it comes with all of that power sort of from day 1. So it's an incredibly full-featured capability set.
Similarly, if you look at Compass in terms of looking at the the sprawl of the massive amount of software assets that have been created by software teams, so the output of all of the software teams, be that websites or microservices or apps, libraries, whatever it is, that is very natively tied into the services you have in Jira Service Management and all of the capabilities we know about your deployment, your source code, your rosters, your real time, it sort of arrives as part of the platform encompasses although it's sometimes a repackaging the functionality, they can be very full featured from the start.
So no change, in summary, in our approach to building organically versus M&A, we think we have strength in both areas and continue to look on both sides of the house. In terms of moving further afield from our mission, I think you've seen that we're -- besides being, I think, really good stewards of capital as the founders and the leadership team have been heading towards two decades now.
We're also incredibly focused on our mission and focused on the long term. I don't see Point A as being any departure from that. If you look across the offerings that we've announced in the last week or two, they're all directly in the hitting zone -- there you go, I'm using a baseball analogy -- directly in the hitting zone of the mission that we've talked about for a long time and exciting to us to be moving forward continuing like the moving forward towards that mission. Your next question comes from the line of Ari Terjanian from Cleveland Research. Your line is open. Thank you for taking the question. Just want to see if there's any change in thoughts or philosophy around how you're thinking about cloud versus data center and any feedback from customers. Data center is something, given the recent strength you plan to maybe increase R&D or investment around maybe versus previous thoughts or you continue to intend to invest the disproportionate now focus towards cloud longer term? Ari, it's Scott Farquhar here. We're clear with our customers that the cloud is the future and the long-term future for our customers to get the best experience of Atlassian. And it will take some time for our customers committed across, but they all understand that, that is the best place to get the best experience from Atlassian.
Obviously, we're continuing to invest in data center, so there's a small number of customer that aren't ready to go to cloud or who aren't yet ready to go to cloud. And so we're continuing our investments there. But long term, both our customers and us know that that experience that we get will be in the cloud. Your next question comes from the line of Jim Fish from Piper Sandler. Your line is open. This is Quinton on for Jim. You touched on it briefly already, but on the data residency capabilities, I think you mentioned during yesterday's Team 21 event, that those capabilities for paid customers would focus on just a few areas or geos to start. Are there plans to roll that capability out to the larger global scale? Or is that plan to follow based on customer demand? Thank you. Yes. Quinton, I can take that. Look, we support a series of geographies at the moment for data residency. The plan is to continue to roll that out, I would say, yes, with customer demand. We have strong demand, as we've talked about at the Team -- in the Team '21 keynote from various more specific regions in Europe. Australia, Canada, those are all in some sort of engineering or testing today and will be rolled out by the end of the calendar year at least. So I think it's some of them are by midyear as customers continue to go into different regions.
Given our platform, it's relatively easy for us to roll out new geographies if we see demand or we see legal privacy compliance reasons why we need to roll that out in a particular area for customers. So it's both driven by market forces, if you like, in terms of the governance and regulatory regimes and also by customer demand in those areas. But what we've invested in the platform being able to do that relatively rapidly and economically for all of our customers.
We continue to believe that broad-scale compliance laws in different parts of the world around data, privacy, regulated industries in terms of finance or health care or whatever it may be, will continue to evolve over the next 5 to 10 years. We need our R&D and our engineering to be prepared for that and our platform to be prepared for that because I think it will be a competitive advantage and will be increasingly difficult for SaaS companies to be able to keep pace with that for their customers.
We are prepared and investing in that future. You see that in our recent announcement in the last quarter that data residency will be available for all customers that are on paid additions, so standard, premium and enterprise. We don't believe that data residency is a large-scale sort of capital E requirement. It is a small customer requirement as well for smaller German organizations that need their data to be in Germany, it's not just large German banks, for example, that have that requirement.
That is a Kudos to our engineering and infrastructure team, that's a nontrivial thing to do in a very large-scale SaaS platform and SaaS application, but that is the future that we are building to be able to have those capabilities for customers that may only have 11, 12 or 13 users and to be able to do that economically for both them and for us. Your next question comes from the line of Pat Walravens from JMP. Your line is open. This is Joey Marincek on for Pat. I appreciate the question. So first, I want to dig in on IT and ITSM. And maybe just from a high level, why those make sense as a focus area? And then secondly, what have you learned in the early days of your premium and enterprise SKU strategy? Yes. Okay. I can take those. In terms of why IT and ITSM make sense, look, we obviously have a long-term multi-decade now core strength in software teams, software and engineering teams and expanding out to designers and product managers and the people around the software creation process. Increasingly, that has both in terms of our movement as a company, but also the larger industry scale trends, IT and software are increasingly blurring the lines between those two, right?
Development and IT, those lines are increasingly blurring as they come together. It used to be that software teams built something, and IT teams ran it. Now you have software teams that are running services for themselves, and you have IT teams that are building new capabilities as the world becomes ever more digital and software-driven. We think it's an incredible strength of our company to be the only company that spans development IT and the operations that exist either between those two or across all of those groups as they come together.
You see that in Jira Service Management and all of the changes that we've made there and increasingly driving the more rapid pace of IT as modern IT organizations move, as we like to say, have high velocity, there's different speed and cadence to modern IT operations that we're really helping to drive that a lot of the legacy and old school vendors don't seem to understand. The strength of having the software teams there shouldn't be underestimated because all of this is coming together into a single spot.
So that hopefully explains why we think it's a large and transformative area and why we have some strength to play there. It goes without saying I hope that the digitalization of everything, software and technology is the core competitive advantage for every single business nowadays. We've seen that now more than in the last 12 months through the pandemic, right, where we had vaccines created digitally, huge logistical operations, lots of businesses in all parts of the world, either becoming more digital or using the digital transformation to adapt in an incredibly fluid and challenging environment as we've had in the last 12 to 18 months.
So you don't need to talk any so you don't need to talk any further than that to see wide digitization and software as an advantage for any business -- in any industry, and I think that puts us in a really, really core and strong position, and we continue to lead in that area. I can take the premium part of the question as well. Booked premium is, obviously, for our more advanced customers in whichever a product line or SKU therein or in all of them continues to have good traction in terms of -- there's a clear strategy as to why customers want more capabilities as their usage becomes more advanced.
And again, it's part of our additions strategy that we've talked about both on the free end, we should remember that, that free is part of the addition strategy to continue to make it easier for customers to land into a new product or with Atlassian for the first time. And we have then the journey that they can go on as they stay with us for hopefully a very long period of time through standard and premium and then up to enterprise, if that's what their company needs. Again, enterprise went GA last quarter and continues to get very early but very encouraging traction in the largest organizations in the cloud. Your next question comes from the line of Keith Boston from BMO. Your line is open. This is Dan on for Keith. I wanted to ask quickly about the marketplace business. Obviously, this quarter benefited from the server and data center dynamics. But next quarter, it sounds like it will continue to be impacted by some lower take rates. So how do you think about marketplace growth in a more normalized environment? Yes, just in time. Look, clearly, this quarter, we had the pull-forward effect when we -- marketplace revenue is recognized 100% at the point in time when it is sold, whereas other revenue is spread ratably across different time periods depending on if it's data center or cloud. But because we don't have ongoing obligations for our marketplace revenue, it's recognized upfront. So what you do see is see more variability around marketplace, sort of swings in the revenue line item that we have than you would see in other areas.
Well, in terms of marketplace growth, we have an amazing marketplace in our -- behind the firewall on-premises products, and we have amazing marketplace in our cloud product as well. We've seen a huge number of our vendors move from, I guess, their behind the final business to cloud along with our customer transition. So they are being led by our customers as well who are moving across.
And as you mentioned, we've more use the take rate for our marketplace to incentivize some of the vendors to move across, and that has worked, and we've seen vendors both transition of business across, and we're seeing a whole bunch of new vendors who are building only for our cloud platform. So marketplace continues to be a huge source of strategic strength for us at Atlassian.
We know that customers who use our marketplace products are stickier than ones that don't. We benefit of the ecosystem that is built around it. We know that we can't build everything. Our products get us so widely 200,000 companies around the world. And they can't build every use case for them into the marketplace managed to fill in areas that we can't do. And so again, the customers benefit from that. So I said the marketplace to be just as important, and it is just an important in our cloud business as it has been historically now behind the firewall business. There are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to Scott Farquhar for closing remarks. Just a huge thank you, everyone, for joining our call today, we appreciate your ongoing support. I'll be on holiday with my family next earnings call, maybe tracking some emus across Australia. And so Mike and James will be holding down the fort for the Q4 call.
I hope you and your loved ones remain safe and healthy. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

Thank you for joining Atlassian’s Earnings Conference Call for the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal Year 2021. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of Atlassian’s website following this call.
I will now hand the call over to Martin Lam, Atlassian’s Head of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead. Good afternoon, and welcome to Atlassian’s fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 earnings call. Thank you for joining us today. On the call today, we have Atlassian’s Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Mike Cannon-Brookes; and our Chief Financial Officer, James Beer.
Earlier today, we issued a shareholder letter and press release with our financial results and commentary for our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2021. The shareholder letter is available on Atlassian’s work life blog and the Investor Relations section of our website, where you’ll also find other earnings-related materials, including the earnings press release and supplemental investor data sheet. During the call today, we’ll make brief opening remarks and then spend the remainder of time on Q&A.
This call will include forward-looking statements.

The reconciliation between IFRS and non-IFRS financial measures is available in our shareholder letter, earnings release and investor data sheet on the IR website.
During Q&A, please ask your full question upfront so that we can be fair and easily move through to the next speaker.
With that, I’ll turn the call over to Mike for opening remarks. Thanks for joining the call today everyone from wherever you are in the world. Scott’s out on holiday. So it’ll be just James and I taking your questions today. We’re in lockdown here in Australia. So, you and your loved ones are safe wherever you are.
As you’ve already read in our shareholder letter, our Q4 was a ripper of a quarter, as we say. We added over 23,000 net new customers. We generated revenue of $560 million, up 30% year-over-year. Importantly, we grew subscription revenue 50% year-over-year with cloud revenue up 47% year-over-year. And that cloud migration momentum continues to build.
Our strong Q4 caps off another year that we’re incredibly proud of. We entered FY 2021 staring down headwinds, and we exited stronger than ever before. I’m proud of our resilience, and our ability to execute during a difficult year. We’ve continued to deliver innovation to technical and non-technical teams, building new products and new capabilities on top of our world class cloud platform.
We surge pass 200,000 customers, and $2 billion in revenue. We followed through on what we said that we would do. We played offense. We’ve added more than 1,500 Atlassian’s to our team, and we’ll continue to play offense into FY 2022 and beyond. We still have a lot of work to do. But the opportunities in front of Atlassian have never been greater. And we came to seize those opportunities.
Before we move to Q&A, I want to take a moment to thank the 1000s of Atlassian around the world whose resilience, passion and commitment drive the innovation that we continue to deliver to our customers every day, every month and every quarter.
With that, I’ll pass for the operator to your questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David Hynes from Canaccord. Your line is now open. Hey guys, this is Luke on for DJ. Thanks for taking the question. So, I just had a quick one, I guess, product oriented thinking about your ITSM capabilities, that that whole solution set has been considerably bolstered over the last couple of years, starting with Jira Service Desk, and adding incremental functionality with Opsgenie for incident management Mindville for asset management, Confluence, solves knowledge management, it feels like a really full complete solution at this point. We expect the question; do you feel like there are other areas there that would still be logical additions to become part of the platform? Thanks. Thanks, I can take that one. Look, we are extremely uniquely positioned in ITSM. We see that positioning resonating with customers every single day. As you know, companies are increasingly blending the line between their software revoking their upslope between Dev and IT however you say it, we have a single unified payment glass, as we say, in JSM, and then extending to the whole Atlassian family.
I think we’ve been very thoughtful, and consistent in how we’ve grown that from two, three years ago, when we said we were doubling down on the IT space, and then almost every quarter or six months since then, you’ve seen a steady drumbeat of improvements, as we’ve continued to build capabilities and go after the opportunities that existed. We’re still going to keep doing that. And we believe any opportunities in the broader IT space, very deeply. We think we’re the only company that can address those unique requirements. And those companies in the future from 50 person companies all the way up to 500,000 person companies. We’re very unique in our breadth and span there, and you see a turning up in the results. So, I guess I don’t have a concrete answer other than we deeply believe in the opportunity in front of us in that area, and our uniqueness and position and it’s – I think it’s showing in the resonates we’re getting the customers. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Great quarter guys, and really fantastic in to the fiscal year. It really seems like something has catalyzed or something has shifted over the past two quarters. You talked in the letter about the 70% acceleration in large customers coming over to cloud prior you guys are a little bit more cautious on the pace of that transition. 23,000 customers read and just say ipoping number compared to like the 8000 you did a year ago. Is there something in particular as the macro environment is just like the product strategy jelling the distribution strategy show? Is this something you could point to, for that sort of what seems to be a catalyst or an inflection point in the momentum on the cloud strategy? And just like overall customer additions? Yes, hi, Keith. That’s perfect. Look, I think we’re in a great position across the board. And we continue to take our long-term thoughts in mind. If you think about the last year, in such a maelstrom, boneheaded moves are really easy to make. And we’ve kept our heads. We’ve been very sensible about how we have made decisions throughout this last 12 months to 18 months, and continue to focus on the long-term and focus on our customers. And so the strength that you’re seeing across the board in so many different areas comes from thousands of really smart, really thoughtful, long-term decisions that we’ve made that are continuing to drive the pace and progress of Atlassian and the value to the customers.
I don’t think anything particular has changed in the last few years in that philosophy and strategy, which I always say is more important than individual decisions. And you can certainly point to things like free, which has significantly expanded our funnel and ability to
to grow the customer number of various ways, you can point to the continued integration of Trello. And yourself have probably asked a whole series of Trello questions over the last four years. And our answers have been very consistent and very much the same. And that is four years worth of work from the Trello team and the all the paths of Atlassian and bringing that in continue to make it part of the family that continues to pay off as our broader shift in migration to the cloud, which gives us a lot of fantastic capabilities for those customers right, on top of our platform, and all the other things that cloud brings us. So, I don’t have a singular shift. I don’t think there’s any individual thing that’s changed. I think it’s our, 20 years of Atlassian history and making long-term decisions and continue to execute it to a very, very high level again those decisions that is – that that continues. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Rob Oliver from Baird. Your line is now open. Great, thanks, guys for taking my question. Appreciate it. Mike, I’ve got one for you just I saw the Quarter Grand Award from Appfire in the investor letter. And its strike me one of the things we’re seeing playing out for you guys is like the very methodical investments you’ve made in both the partner network and those who build apps on your platform. Now, you’re up over 700, and just wondered if we can just get an update on your philosophy there is that seems to me to be contributing nicely to the kind of early success you’re having here in enterprise, if I understand that, right. And I might squeeze in one for James at the same time, just to say that, you guys had set up some fairly conservative targets, or at least they seem so to investors around server customers and migration of businesses up through FY 2023 and given the success you guys are having right now, whether there is any thought of sort of reconfiguring those targets. Thanks, guys. Hey, Rob, look our channel marketplace continued to be extremely important pillars of the business going forward. They bring – always have bring and continue to do so in the cloud unique capabilities to our customers that we can’t bring, right, and we really value them for that they’re in geographies, they’re in industries, they’re in parts of the world that we can’t be. And that continues to be the case in the cloud. Probably you can see that that’s working. Again, in a shareholder letter, we said that our channel partner sales are up over 300% year-on-year when you look at their cloud sales. So, we’ve done a lot of work to help our channel partners understand the cloud. It’s a big strength of Atlassian’s business. And that’s resonating with their customers, that are our shared customers and that’s really working – nothing different than the philosophy that we have to get our customers through this migration journey. And we have to get the channel and our partners through the migration journey. So, we do a lot of assets that driving the cloud migration, but also cloud in general.
Obviously, from the point of view of the technology partner in the marketplace, we continue to have great progress with Forge in terms of allowing both our customers and our partners to build and extend Atlassian products, which is always been a hallmark of our philosophy. We’ve always been highly extensible and believe in customers’ ability to extend our products. Forge is a way to do that that meets the cloud, regulatory and compliance requirements that we’ve talked about that are incredibly challenging for SaaS businesses going forward. And we’re really taking an engineering first approach to that. Forge will allows us to solve those problems gives great security and peace of mind to the customers using those extensions and technologies. And we continue to improve, as we’ve mentioned, with more than 500 apps now on the fourth platform, both from third parties and customers and we expect that number to continue to grow. So no doubt in broad philosophy to your question around the partner ecosystem, but we continue to help them, and they continue to help us on the long-term migration journey with [indiscernible]. Well, I’ll jump in for the second part of your question. We’re certainly pleased with the developing momentum that we have along the migrations timeline. Mike mentioned the statistic with regard to our partners increasing their migration sale activity and cloud orientation 300% year-over-year. More broadly, we talked about 2x volume of migrations year-over-year. And then I think another important element of this is that quarter-over-quarter, our larger customers, we saw, so those are – those were the 1000 users plus, we saw them growing migration activities 70% quarter-over-quarter. So, clearly with those facts demonstrating nice momentum.
We came into this process, what a little less than a year ago with around 30,000 server customers. So yep, we’re pleased for that momentum, we’ve got plenty of work ahead of us. We have a ramp to execute on. We feel good about our ability to execute on that ramp. But it’s a little early to change our thinking around the overall timetable that we’ve spoken about. And that is that we would expect around half of those customers to be migrating in fiscal 2023 and 2024. And probably that would equate to something of the order of two thirds of the larger customers migrating in that time table.
The other thing, I would mention is, we’re pleased to be the early pace of the enterprise additions of our cloud products. And I think that will be another important element in terms of bringing more of these larger cloud – excuse me server customers to be ready to move over to the cloud. Thank you, sir. Moving on, your next question comes from the line of Tyler Radke from Citi. Your line is now open. Yes, thanks for the question. You talked about your hiring plan in the letter, and it seemed like on the R&D side, as you’ve historically been focused there, that’s where the bulk majority of your investments are going. I was wondering if you could just kind of talk about both the R&D and sales and marketing side, I guess, on R&D, what are you most focused on? Is it cloud investments? I know, you have kind of talked about introducing some new products in the collaborative work management space. And then on the Salesforce side, just how much important is there in hiring sales reps to make these cloud transition to be enterprise customers where things are more complex? Thank you. Hey, Tyler, I can take that one. Look, we’ve continued to say that the people are really important to us. We’ve been made quite clear in the shareholder letter, as we did a year ago, we’re going to continue to take opportunities on the front foot that we have continued to build our team again, a year ago, we said we’d be adding over 1000 Atlassians, we ended up adding 1,500, which is a fantastic achievement in the year that we’ve had for our talent teams and everybody around the business that has continued to do that, again, more than a third, I think more than a third of our staff at this stage, haven’t stepped into an office, at this point ever.
So, we’ve had some challenges. It’s been an interesting year for hiring. And we’ve done extremely well against that. Part of what we’re saying in the shareholder letter there is we’re going to continue to do that in the year ahead. We see the opportunity in front of us hasn’t been greater, and we’re going to continue to play offense on that side of things. And I expect this a lot of detail in questions around that. You mentioned the R&D, for sure, that is an area that we will be continuing to hire him. It’s long been one of our hallmarks. And the broader strategy of in the long-term investing heavily in R&D hasn’t changed and we will continue to be doing that. We’ve been successful in hiring, fantastic engineering, design and product management staff all around the world and we’ll continue to do that in the year ahead.
On hiring R&D and on sales and marketing before getting to the second half of your question, TEAM Anywhere is a big and important strategy that I think investors would do well to understand. Our ability to hire staff all over the world, to integrate them into execute them into our culture is a big change in the last 12 months to 18 months, and I believe is an opportunity for us to both differentiate the company, but also to differentiate ourselves from competitors out there. And I believe it’s starting to pay off, we have a lot to learn in this area. But that’s it’s really, really important. And you see that in R&D, but we’re also going to see it in sales and marketing, the other areas that you mentioned in.
In terms of what R&D is focusing on? It’s probably the same as it always has been. We have a fantastic set of products that have huge opportunities in front of them, in our three major markets. We’ve talked about Point A little bit last quarter, we have five products in the Point A program at the moment that we are co-developing with customers and collaborating on all of them, are resonating very well at this stage in a whole series of different areas across our three markets. And so we will continue to invest in furthering those products and capabilities, and our broader cloud platform, the Enterprise aspects of the cloud platform all the way up to the scale aspects of our cloud platform. What we are intending to try and what we are doing at a world-class scale in our cloud platform is an extremely nontrivial asset. And so there’s a lot of R&D and engineering investment that goes into continuing to maintain our platform and improve it day in day out on behalf of the customers.
Sales and marketing wise, again, we’ve been very consistent to our strategy. We have a high velocity, sales and marketing model that I’m sure you are well familiar with. We are continuing to seize the opportunities that are in front of us with our sales and marketing staff. And that goes all the way from the marketing team and landing thousands and thousands of customers every quarter, up to our Enterprise sales teams that work with our largest customers and continuing to deliver value to them in the largest customers in our customer base. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho. Your line is now open. Okay, thank you very much. And congratulations on not only a terrific quarter, but what has also been a transformative year for Atlassian. So for, I think one of the most impressive data points in my view was a significant acceleration in cloud revenue 47%, year-over-year versus 35%, the prior quarter. Obviously, cloud is rapidly recognized. But James, if you could speak to what drove this degree of acceleration that would be helpful.
And then for Mike, just getting back to large customer cloud migrations up 70% quarter-over-quarter. What if anything, do you think has changed over the past 90 days to get large customers more comfortable with migrating that, again, might drive that sort of increase? Thank you. Gregg, I can take the first part of your question around the cloud revenue. Really pleased with the underlying performance of the business, I would point three particular drivers. The premium editions that have been in the marketplace for a year or two now are proving to be very much popular with our customers. We continue to see a nice development in the proportion of the total number of customers who are choosing the premium edition. And we’re very much following a strategy we’ve talked about really for a long time now. And that is very consistently adding new functionality, new capability to these additions. And as we do that, there’s a greater and greater approval of our standard cloud customers and indeed others who are migrating over from a behind the firewall product.
There’s an increasing attraction to this expanding capabilities of the premium offer. Now, we’re just getting going with the enterprise edition. And I just think that this is another illustration of this long-term strategy to have a full ladder, if you will, really starting with free, then standard, premium, and then Enterprise edition. So that’s an important strategy for us that I feel we’re executing very well on.
The second thing I’d point to is just the expansion of the number of users at our current customers. That continues to go very nicely consistent, obviously with the value that our customers are seeing in utilizing our cloud products. And then I think the third thing, I would point to is improving rates around churn. There are a few things going on here that I think are very much illustrative of the long-term strategies that we have been pursuing. What we’re finding is that initially free edition customers who then convert to a paid plan of stickier. We see the same thing for our customers who choose the premium plans. And my expectation would be consistent with Enterprise. We’ll see how that plays out in the next year or two.
And then, perhaps not surprisingly, those who are migrating from behind the firewalls, to the cloud, offerings are also stickier. So, you’ve got a few different drivers there. In addition to the fact that for the last year, 18 months or so, we’ve had a variety of specific initiatives, where we have used our understanding of the marketplace and the different dynamics as to usage of the cloud products to be able to identify potential areas where we might see churn, and we’ve been able to work to get in front of those customers, and change their minds.
And so that’s been another important driver of the cloud business. One other thing to remember, I would say also, migrations per se, a relatively small impact on the cloud growth rate thus far. And then the other thing to remember is that this time last year, we talked in Q4 of fiscal 2020, about the fact that we had about a $10 million revenue headwind as a result of the lockdowns that were in stewing in many parts of the world in those months. And really, that all was impacting our cloud business. So that’s made the comp in this Q4, fiscal 2021. A little bit easier, as well. But a variety of those drivers that I mentioned, that are really proving to yield a very strong tailwind for our cloud business generally. Super helpful. Thanks for the year color, James. And then Mike, if you have any quick thoughts on what’s driving some larger customer cloud migrations, that’ll be great as well. Thank you. Yes, Greg, it’s probably the some of the factors we’ve talked about earlier. For sure, the channel getting more comfortable with cloud is probably one aspect I mentioned that is driving that we see more, obviously, the larger the customers, the more likely they are some sort of partner helping them. So that’s continuing to build momentum, which is good. The second thing I would say is, we continue to work hard, and it’s not particularly in the last quarter, as much as over the last few years, on the Enterprise editions and the capabilities that come with them from access through Premium and Enterprise, as James mentioned, continuing to resonate with customers.
And, those will have long-term roadmaps that we have in our public cloud roadmap about what we’re adding to them over time. So customers are not just buying into what we’ve done in the last 12 months. But what we have coming up and our the more that customers see us deliver against that roadmap, when we tell you, here’s the things we’re going to do each quarter for the next year, and then we go do them that builds confidence in that part of the customer base. Well, an older customer base, and particularly in that part of the customer base.
And the third thing is just continuing to deliver against some of the performance and scale and governance capabilities that the large enterprise customers require. You saw that in the last year with things like data residency. And we’ll continue to do that more broadly. And if there’s a fourth one, it’s probably our platform capabilities continuing to evolve in the Enterprise direction. So automation capabilities, smart scale, that do resonate with the larger customers, because the bigger you are, the more data you have, the more teams and more users the more sort of smart AI machine learning driven features actually come to help you because we can sit them on that data much more quickly for you. Automation features or things in the platform that we continue to build for the largest customers it’s probably a small part of all that collection of factors which driving that until the success. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of James Fish from Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. Congrats on the quarter and ripper in the quarter is understating it. I guess going back to this idea of free to premium enterprise, I guess can you walk us through a little bit more of the details on the adoption curve of standards of Premium to Enterprise, in any sense to the mix within those buckets at this point and how long it takes to move up the stack on average, or why customers might not be moving up at this point, but could move up over the next 12 months. Thanks, guys. Yes. One of the things I start by saying is, how the free edition, so really expanded the top of our marketing funnel in an impressive way. We talked in prior quarters about a 3x type factor. And frankly, as each quarter goes by, we continue to refine the experience, if you will that the user has with our free offering, making it easier to invite others in on their team, not requiring someone go through an admin, you will change the trial and so forth, associated with the move up to standard. So we continue to refine the way, the user experiences and gains value from our free offering, but then also is introduced to the additional benefits of the standard paid plan.
And so very pleased with how as we study the different monthly cohorts that have started with free, over the last year also, how they are moving increasingly towards the paid plans to the degree that we feel very comfortable with the long-term economics of offering free versions of Jira Software, Confluence and Jira Service Management into the market. And I think that was one of the key initiatives of this last fiscal year, that will serve us well out over many years to come.
In terms of premium, yes, we started off 18 months, two years or so ago, with a relatively modest package of incremental functionality versus the standard plan. And not surprisingly, and we expected this, it was a relatively modest take up, that was just getting us out of the gates, if you will. And we have, as I mentioned in one of our earlier comments, really routinely expanded what’s available in that premium offering, and we will continue to do that in the years to come. And we’ve been very pleased with how Jira Software, Jira Service Management and Confluence premium editions have increased their impact on the overall proportion of cloud customers. And then we’re just really getting started with enterprise very early days, but encouraging developments thus far. And again, well, this is one of our key areas of focus R&D development. And I would expect us to continue to build momentum around the Enterprise editions over the next year or two. Mike, what would you add to that? James, Fish, I think James Beer, did a fantastic job actually answering that question, the only one small element of color I would add, and it may be taken for granted. But I just want to make sure everyone understand, a customer does not need to buy one addition across the board. So one of our advantages, and having a family of products, is the adoption curves of each product can go at the pace of the particular customer, or group department within that customer set of teams, whoever is using that particular product. This is where our ladder is very consciously designed to be customer friendly and customer first. And it’s really starting to resonate. So an example there is you could use Jira Software, Enterprise edition or premium edition in a large company because you have a very mature engineering organization with a lot of capabilities, and adopt Confluence free with a small group of 10 people alongside that, as you start to learn about how Confluence can add to your software team.
As that Confluence deployment grows, you probably move into standard and you probably move into premium overtime if it’s a large company and the user base continues to grow. And we have success right with your usage. So a single customer can buy different editions of different products at the same time, depending on their adoption of each of the different areas and opportunities and markets that we have. That’s designed like that on purpose so that customers can grow at their own pace in different areas. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman from BMO. Your line is now open. Hi, many thanks for taking the question. The first one, I think is for you, Mike I wanted to hear a little bit about platform parody. And what I mean by that is, where do you think you are now in terms of, say the cloud offering, particularly targeting those large enterprise customers that James mentioned, would still be migrating late in the cycle? Where are you in terms of the capabilities on the cloud versus server versus data center? And how might that change over the next year? So in terms of reaching feature parity to already to catalyze the great momentum you’ve already started with? Hi, Keith great question. Look, we are – firstly, it should be said that are very early in the migration journey. This is, as we’ve said, repeatedly, this is a multi year journey. And we will continue to evolve with our customers as we go through that journey. The capabilities of the cloud, it should be mentioned, firstly, are incredibly unique already. So the cloud has some big differentiations in terms of its capabilities that already give you a choice between the two, the deployment option. And then we continue to build out our enterprise capabilities. You mentioned the very largest customers; you saw that in the last couple of quarters with data residency, and continuing to improve things like FedRAMP, and a lot of other compliance requirements and enterprise requirements. Again, we haven’t public roadmap, we explain to customers where we are at that roadmap and how we’re executing against that, that’s really resonating with those larger customers. So, I think we’re in a really good spot in terms of how we go through that journey.
And as we’ve said, it had a relatively modest impact on in Slide 21. And we are early in that journey over time, as we continue to power through that. And those customer migrations are coming from server and data center. It should be said for the largest customers that you mentioned, in data center. Often that journey is not a singular step. So that customer can choose to move, they might have 10,000 users, let’s say on data center, and they choose to move 500 or 1000 of them to the cloud for a particular purpose. Maybe it’s a unique geographic office, maybe it is a large project group, department within the company. That is a behavior that we see often, where they will move 500 to 1000 customers, the users, sorry, to the cloud, to test us. And we like that that lets us demonstrate our capabilities that let just demonstrate our enterprise strengths to that customer. And we are confident that we can give them a great experience, give them a great total cost of ownership equation with their for the cloud offering that will then resonate through the remainder of those users. So that customer becomes a customer, both cloud and data center in our example. And then over time, we would hope that they would move the rest as we demonstrate our capabilities. Yes, just add on one. Thanks to that, Mike. We’re now seeing the 25% of our seats migrating into the cloud are coming from the data center. And obviously, the data centers where we’ve tended to have our larger customers. And so again, I think as the cloud enterprise editions become more and more capable, I would expect that trend of data center to cloud migrations will only increase in the next two plus years. Thank you. Moving on, your next question comes from the line of Ari Terjanian from Cleveland Research. Your line is now open. Hi all thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the great result. So double click on the cloud performance is wondering, if there any pattern is seen any surprises in terms of the type of customer among these larger enterprise teams like growth in America’s only decelerated, 200 basis points? Is it fair to say most of these are the type of customer you’d expect in terms of geography or vertical? Or you’re starting to see some more non-traditional customers start to migrate to cloud as well? Thanks. Yes, just a thought on that. One of the things we actually chatted a little bit about this a quarter or so ago, is that we’re quite pleased with how we’re seeing more cloud take up within Europe, Middle East Africa region. And that has been a part of the world that has been very, very focused on utilizing behind the firewall type solutions. And so we’re pleased to see European based partners really taking on the opportunity, understanding the value to their customers of our cloud offerings, and then obviously that the customers themselves. So again, relatively early days versus days the Americans were, I would say there has been a longer history of wide scale cloud adoption. And so we’re encouraged by that. And obviously, what will continue to work at that angle. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of George Iwanyc from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Thank you for taking my question. Mike, with the context of continuing to be on offense, can you maybe share some color what you’re seeing on the competitive front? Maybe broadly speaking and then specifically, maybe progress with work automation in work management? Sure. I can talk about that. Look, we continue to be, as we always have philosophically aware of what competitors are doing that we absolutely don’t focus on that. We always try to put customers first, in a big, big way. And it’s very easy to say that, I would say that I seen as a company that actually does that. And we have done for a very long time. The – not really any change in the competitive landscape, I would say is a brief answer over the last quarter, we continue to be really positive about the opportunities we have and where we sit with our customers.
Talking broadly about work automation, work management, obviously, it’s a very, very large space continues to be, so we have a number of different offerings, targeting that space with customers, that resonate very strongly for a whole series of different reasons. Trello continues to power along very strongly, very happy with where Trello sits, and how it has continued to grow. Over the last year that team’s done a fantastic job. And that is an exciting area for our business and continues to be so.
Inside Point A in terms of innovation and new capabilities, again, Jira Work Management is doing some really excellent work and connecting the Jira family into some of those really exciting areas. It leverages our automation platform, leverages our cloud platform in really good ways to bring the rigor and structure of Jira, which is very needed by a lot of parts of a lot of enterprises into that broader work management arena. So, we’re very excited, obviously, extremely early days with Jira Work Management, it’s only been in the while for three, three to six months at this stage, and continues to be a part of the point AI program, because we’re really collaborating deeply with our customers about how to continue to grow that.
All the way across to, I would say, help is a good example of a product that is taking an alternative view to how work management can be done. Help is messaging based service provision tool, a lot of parts of enterprises are actually about one team servicing another team. We think about that in the ITSM context, obviously. But if you look at service driven organizations in a broader sense, we’re going to have to continue to find new ways for teams to service other teams. We let our legal team or an interactive marketing team and help it’s really resonating strongly because the messaging base paradigm is a very new one. So, we have a lot of very unique capabilities in the broader work management space. And I would say my excitement is extremely high about all the different investments that we have. Just to have on one our thoughts. While obviously the customer accounts that we publish, each quarter does move around from quarter-to-quarter, we’ve always expected that the 23,000 numbers that we posted up in Q4, I think is impressive in terms of illustrating our competitive analysis. Obviously, those 23,000 companies evaluated their alternatives, and chose Atlassian. And so as Mike referred to the Trello is an important part of that. We’ve been emphasizing monetization initiatives there now for 18 months or so, as we’ve discussed in the past. But this customer increase was broad based Jira Software, Jira Service Management, Confluence and so really encouraging and illustrative of I think, where we stand on the competitive playing field. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Fred Havemeyer from Macquarie. Your line is now open. Thank you, and congratulations on a really strong quarter here. I’d like to ask a bit about some of your integrations and your strategy around that, because some of the products highlights in your letter around, Open DevOps and the importance of integrations really drive home where it is that you’re focusing some of your efforts and product development investment outside of some of the other topics we’ve been discussing today. So, I’d like to ask, do you view integrations within the Jira ecosystem more opportunities to improve retention, or as an opportunity to also expand user capture by adding essentially more workflows that can be addressed within the Jira ecosystem? Hi Fred, Mike here. Yes. Look, I think that’s an extremely good question. Strategically, I would say we are very pro integration. Let me explain why that is. We’ve talked a bit before about what we call Cambrian SaaS. So there is an explosion of SaaS tools happening out there at the moment. It’s a very verdant period for new solutions for customers, new applications, niche one, big ones, small ones. This is a fantastically interesting period to be in SaaS. We focus on what’s best for our customers. And when you’re doing so, it takes a lot of practicality, pragmatism, a little dose of humility to realize that those customers are going to use a lot of applications that come from other companies for all sorts of reasons.
The best thing we can do is be deeply integrated in all of those places. We believe that’s best for the customers. It is then our job to automate workflows to coordinate data. And to do that as best we can across all of those different applications. And that leads to the best outcome for the customer, which leads them to, as you mentioned, be retained or enjoy their Atlassian experience so stay, it also leads them to have an increasingly integrated, which becomes sticky and more valuable to them. Offering set among the different products and applications that we have.
One of our biggest competitive advantages is developer ecosystem and our extensibility of products. You see that and as Cambrian SaaS continues to throw up new evolutions of products and variants in different directions. That allows us to flow into those directions through integrations, through acquisitions, through extensibility, automation in lots of different manners as we navigate that that continually evolving world. And so, yes, I think strategically, it’s extremely important that it’s been part of our open philosophy for customers for a long time now. It’s part of Open DevOps, as you saw, as you mentioned, and we know that that resonates with customers, both philosophically in terms of they like that they think it’s a good position for Atlassian to stand, we’ve never been a vendor that said, hey, all your stuff is with us. And you don’t need anybody else. No, we don’t, we don’t believe that. That’s not what we tell customers. That’s not what we talk to them about. So philosophically, that resonates with them.
We know from their usage from their satisfaction, that we are then a better vendor for them. So, we see that in the numbers in lots of different places be that analytically usage based or customer satisfaction report based. And then we believe that results in better economics for Atlassian, which is then shows why those integrations are important for shareholders, and the long term future of Atlassian. That’s a philosophy we’ve had for a long time. In fact, we can really show that philosophy in ways that we couldn’t, beforehand because it really becomes apparent.
Thinking through my own after the path that I want to also stress, the data integration piece is really important. So, we continue to evolve our data platform as a part of our cloud platform to connect objects – to connect elements across the Atlassian and third party spaces, so that we can give smarter and better answers to customers. And we saw that show up a little bit in the insights features we shipped in Jira Software, that don’t just leverage Jira Software data, they can leverage data from cloud providers, CICD providers, lots of other parts of the DevOps ecosystem, to give you the best answers in Atlassian products and outside Atlassian products.
I think that’s a long term strategic piece here as well, is to be able to coordinate and understand data across multiple vendors gives you those automation capabilities, but also gives you insights and unique places that we can get answers to customers. Just a couple of things to add on to what Mike’s commented on that. One thing that we’ve seen going back to talking about churn a few minutes ago, is that when our marketplace, vendors, partners, are a part of the relationship with the customer when the customer uses an app, our dollar churn declines by around 50% – 50%. So that’s an interesting illustration of the stickiness part of your question. And then in the shareholder letter this quarter, we’ve put quite a bit of materials to talking about the different types of partners and one comment we make is an interesting illustration of how they can these integrations drive user growth. We talked about being able to request access to Confluence now directly from the Slack channel. So it’s just an illustration of the sort of thing that Mike’s been talking about here. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Hey, guys, congrats on a nice finish to the year. My name is [indiscernible] I worked with Brent Thill. Wanted to ask a quick question to Mike, first one on the – could you give us some insight into the impressive net new customer ads? And what are these customers landing with? Historically, Jira and Confluence have led that motion. But do you see the new customers can adopting the entire solution suite or is it still certain products and leading the charge?
And then one for James, obviously, the fiscal 2022 guidance for subscription revenue growth is low-to-mid 40s, which is ahead of what he said previously of mid 30s. Could you – maybe shed some light into what’s driving this optimism and what level of migrations is kind of embedded into this new guide? Thank you. Thanks. Look on the new customer number, a few points, I would say first, we did say six and a half thousand of those odd word Trello single user accounts. So the 23,000 is a really impressive number. Even if you take out the six and a half thousand Trello single user customers, you still end up with a very strong quarter for customer ads. As we say, all the time that customer number goes up and down. We don’t focus on it. We focus on the activities inside the business that lead to the best long-term customer acquisition.
Inside that James has already mentioned free obviously continuing to drive that and power the sort of the part of the iceberg is below the water, I guess, we don’t talk a lot about free customer – they’re not customers, right. So if they’re using the free offerings, we don’t count them as customers. So as they convert into being customers, they might have actually been using Atlassian applications for a long time. So a part of that is just a general rising tide as freeze being available for 12 months to 18 months now and continues to be so.
The biggest strength in the number that gives me confidence, I would say, is the fact that it’s vary across the board. So there’s not a particular area that is excelling here. We see strength across the software, agile and DevOps spaces. We see strength in ITSM and Jira Service Management and health and Confluence and we say strength across the work management, arena, Jira Work Management, Trello help again Confluence, and it’s a very across the board pace and rates that we’re seeing. So there’s not a particular good answer to your question of which sector?
In fact, the answer is look, it says or out of lots of long term activities across all the areas and opportunities that we have in front of us in the business. We’re proud of where we are and the execution we’ve done. I’ll throw to James for the second part of your question. Yes, thanks, Mike. A few thoughts around the guide. So both cloud and data center the two components of subscription revenue, good organic tailwinds, if you will, we have spoken quite a bit about the cloud business in the last hour or so. So wouldn’t repeat all of those points. But similarly, we’ve got a lot of new demand. For data center, we have increasing the demand in terms of user count from current data center customers. We also raise prices on the data center business around five months ago. And so that’s a benefit that will increasingly start to see as the next several months play out.
In terms of loyalty discounts, you’ll recall that we have stepped down the size of the discounts that we offer to migrating server customers for both the case where they would migrate to the cloud and to the data center. So that provides something of a rolls if tailwind as well. In terms of the effect of migrations, obviously, that also going to continue to benefit both the cloud and data center businesses in the coming year, I would expect migrations to drive approximately mid single-digit growth on our subscription revenue growth in fiscal 2022 year-over-year. And while obviously not a subscription revenue issue, the server business obviously, we stopped selling new server licenses five months ago. We’ll stop selling server upgrades to current licenses in seven months time or so. And so then, that server business will just naturally decline over time as those customers migrate over either to cloud or to data center. Thank you. And your last question is from Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Hey there, thanks. Some even more fantastic than usual phrasing in the letter this time. So kudos there. I wanted to go back to one of the hat-trick core markets and just touch on ITSM, you referenced Jira Service Management. Now you spend more than 30,000 customers, it’s a big number, hoping maybe we can touch on whether the more explicit move towards ITSM is influencing either the type of customer or the pace at which you’re adding customers or seeing engagement from that area. Thank you. Hey, Michael. Look, I think we’re – as I said before, we’re very happy where we sit in the ITSM space. The type of customer – look, we – there’s clearly a type of customer that’s large that uses ITSM solutions. I think one of the exciting parts inside that is that we continue to learn smaller customers in ITSM, as well, as those skills of the large companies are more taken up by small businesses is saying 50, 100 to 200 person businesses really thinking deeply around their IT capabilities and technology and the strength broadly. And we’ve long said we’re targeting a Fortune 500 and 1000. And we have very big aspirations for that. We don’t think the ITSM opportunity is restricted to the sort of Fortune 2000 or the Global 5000, or whatever we think the ITSM opportunity is far, far, far broader than that.
And as such, we’re thinking about it in that manner, that plays into Atlassian core DNA and strengths of how we go about doing what we’re doing. So that part is very exciting. We for sure need to solve the needs of the largest enterprises at the same time. I think you’ve seen us continue to do that. So that the type of customers that I believe we will see in ITSM, are as broad as the general Atlassian customer base, which I know is not the expectation of sound, but I believe that is one of our strengths, our ability to really changed that change the IT and technology capabilities of companies of all sizes, small, all the way through to the biggest companies in the world. That – that’s how we think about it, and will continue to embrace that opportunity to attack that opportunity with vigor.
And that we’ve said that in the shareholder letter, two and a half years ago, when we said we’re going to double down on IT. We meant it when we said that, and we mean it just as much today, there’s a huge opportunity in that space, as there is in all of our three markets that we are that we’re playing up against. Thank you for presenters. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our Q&A session for today. I will hand it back over to Mr. Mike Cannon-Brookes for any closing remarks. Just wanted to say thank you everyone for joining the call today. We appreciate your continued support and questions. Thank you to all of the Atlassian on a fantastic year. We look forward to continuing to power into the future. I hope you and your loved ones wherever you are in the world remain safe and healthy. And we’ll talk to you next quarter. Thank you very much. Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for your participation.

Thank you for joining Atlassian's Earnings Conference Call for the Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2022. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of Atlassian's website following this call.
I will now hand the call over to Martin Lam, Atlassian's Head of Investor Relations. Welcome to Atlassian's second quarter of fiscal year 2022 earnings call. Thank you for joining us today. On the call today, we have Atlassian's Co-Founders and Co-CEOs, Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes, our Chief Financial Officer, James Beer; and our Chief Revenue Officer, Cameron Deatsch. Earlier today, we published a shareholder letter and press release with our financial results and commentary for our second quarter of fiscal year 2022. The shareholder letter is available on the Atlassian's Work Life blog and the Investor Relations section of our website. Where you will also find our other earnings-related materials, including the earnings press release and supplemental investor data sheet.
As always, our shareholder letter contains management's insight and commentary for the quarter. So during the call today, we'll have brief opening remarks and then focus our time on Q&A. This call will include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events.

The reconciliation between IFRS and non-IFRS financial measures is available in our shareholder letter, earnings release and investor data sheet on the IR website. [Operator Instructions].
With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott for opening remarks. Thank you for joining us today. Happy New Year to everyone. Q2 was another strong quarter as we continue to see great momentum. It's extremely encouraging to see many of our past long-term investments reflected in our Q2 results. The Atlassian Marketplace, which we started in 2012 recently surpassed $2 billion in lifetime sales. Cloud apps now make up nearly half of all marketplace apps. And the rate at which customers are adopting cloud apps is outpacing our own cloud products. It's exciting to see our ecosystem grow at such a rapid pace. And for us to be able to expand the economy around Alaska.
IT was an area we were committed to doubling down on three years ago. Recently, Jura service management was recognized as a leader in the Forrester enterprise service management wave, with our strategy for ASM receiving the highest possible score. We also recently added Percept.AI to bring AI powered virtual agent technology to expand Jason's frontline support capabilities. Our continued investment and innovation at cloud platform are driving great results. This quarter, we added more than 10,000 net new customers, we all landing in clouds and quarterly cloud revenue grew 58% year-over-year.
As you've already read in our shareholder letter, we're looking forward and laser focused on investing in the future. Hiring is our top priority. We deeply believe in a massive market opportunity in front of us and investing in people is our path to seize these opportunities.
Lastly, we hope you can join us for Team '22 in April. We are cautiously optimistic to be back in person with our customers and partners. We hope to see many of you there. But we're thrilled to also be able to host viewing parties around the globe and offer virtual options as well.
With that, I'll pass the call to the operator for Q&A. Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Alex Zukin from Wolf Research. Sir your line is open. Hey, guys, congratulations on another just wonderful quarter. I guess, maybe for me, how should we think about the results relative to your internal plan? And what were the two biggest areas that that outperformed your expectations? And if you can any bottlenecks to growth at the moment? And how are those different than maybe this time a year ago? Well, thanks for the question. I start off by saying I was really pleased with the performance against our plans really, right across the board. Even you see very strong performance in both the cloud and data center businesses. If I were to pick out one product, it would be JSM. I think that's just really hitting the mark with customers a big opportunity for us going forward. That has, of course, given us the confidence to raise our full-year subscription revenue guidance to around 50%. That's up from the mid-40s percent that we were talking about 90 days ago.
And the other thing I would really highlight is I feel we're very much on track with our migrations timeline. So please buy that. In terms of the last part of your question. IT demand continuing to be strong for both the cloud and data center businesses. I don't see bottlenecks there in the future. One of the other things I'm sure we'll talk more about this is the continual progress we have with in increasing the capabilities of our cloud quarter-by-quarter. And as we do that, obviously, more and more of our, currently behind the firewall customers are able to move over to the cloud. It's clear that they want to go in that direction. And increasingly, each quarter, we're making that possible. So we feel good about the opportunities in front of us. Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Nikolay Beliov from Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is open. Hi, thanks for taking my question. James, one for you, when we will start seeing the migration impact from server and data center to cloud in the numbers. And the loyalty discounts unwind over time. Are we talking maybe a year from now, two years from now. And as a follow-up to the team in general, as you move to the cloud, your pricing really is changing. And you started the company probably 20 plus years ago with a business model oriented around very low price compared to the competitors. And now for example, Jira premium is 15 bucks and enterprise probably that it was higher approaching the pricing of competitors. So I would think that's a major shift in strategy here. And how is that reflecting in the business model and the size of the company going forward in light of that context? Thank you. Well, Nikolay, let me start the answer there. In terms of the impact from migrations, what we're saying is that for fiscal '22, so for the full-year, we would expect migrations to be driving mid-to-high single-digit growth in our revenue year-over-year. So you can contrast that, of course, to what I was just pointing out there in terms of our expectation of around 50% growth for subscription revenue in fiscal '22.
And then I would add that in the quarter just past Q2, it was a very similar sort of figure, mid-to-high single-digit type contribution to the growth rate that we recorded in Q2. So that 64% subscription revenue growth of Q2, about mid-to-high single-digits coming from a migrations. Just a couple of other things, I would add. You referenced in your question, their loyalty discounts. So today, and until the end of June, somebody moving over to the cloud from either server or data center, they would receive a 40% discount.
Now, once we get into July, in a few months' time here that discount will have down to 20%. So that's important to remember. The other thing I say is that when a customer migrates over to the cloud. Of course, in the period that they made that migration, that's a very modest impact on our revenue. Obviously, the cloud businesses recognized reasonably in terms of the accounting. So those are the three points to keep in mind. I'll add just on the back of claims around sort of our price philosophy that we've talked about, and there's no change to our pricing philosophy hasn't really over the 20 years have been running Atlassian, we've always priced the volume. And we've talked about reaching the Fortune 500,000 and reaching millions of people around the world. And that's what we've always priced for. And so what you've seen sort of in terms of how that's manifested in our current list prices over the years, we've made it cheaper for well consistently, by making it more free over time. And we've also captured more value at the higher end where we are providing more and more value for our largest customers.
And of course, as you know, the cloud provides more value for customers, we take a lot of the management overhead away from customers by providing the hardware and so our customers are happy for to give us those responsibilities. And so I don't see there being any real change to our pricing philosophy, and I'd continue to see us do more free to low end and more optimization at the high end as we deliver more value over time. Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo. You're your line is open. Hey there. Thanks and congrats for me as well. And an impressive set of results here. Some of the commentary around ITSM and Jira Service Management stands out in the shareholder materials, even out Cameron picking the favorite, which I'm sure isn't easy. Maybe you could speak to what's driving the momentum there, how that's impacting the model, where that might be showing up and maybe what makes your service management, the right product at the right time as you referenced in the customer section. Thank you. Yes, it's Scott here. I'll take that one. We'll go to Jira Service Management is like uniquely positioned to handle the convergence of developers and IT. And we're seeing in the market these days that IT is no longer an island over by themselves, it's no longer upgrading things that were handed on a CD over a weekend and taking people down. Developers in IT are working hand in hand to transform their organizations. And there's no other vendor out there that has that sort of unique position of bringing data and IT together.
And the second aspect is they're the only company that allows us to, they can handle the Fortune 500 all the way to the Fortune 500,000, as we've talked about that and that comes from a deep focus on the end-user experience, like which is we've delivered on across our product range for multi decades at the moment and bringing that to IT has seen a lot of value there. And you've seen us say, we're going to invest in ITSM, three years ago, when you have seen a consistent drumbeat of innovation.
We've done some acquisitions to add functionality, but most of it's been in house innovation and building out the feature set across our entire product range. And so we're super excited that that's been recognized by analysts out there, which is great, but more importantly, being recognized by our customers who are adopting it in it. And so pleasantly surprised, I mean it was our plan three years ago to do this. And because we've got a great platform, we've been able to move relatively quickly and delivering all the value to our customers. And so we expect ITSM to continue to grow into the future. Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is open. Excellent, thank you guys for taking the questions. And congratulations on another really, really nice quarter. I wanted to ask about two probably in a quarter full a lot of eye popping numbers, two the numbers that really stood out to me. One was data center, seeing another acceleration in growth to 83%. Anything kind of one-time in nature, we should be aware of in that number. I know there's a tough comp coming in Q3. So we're seeing that growth. But actually think about what drove that acceleration. And two, there was a comment about channel partner revenue growth accelerating, I think it was 130% growth year-on-year, anything in particular changing in that program that caused that acceleration. And if you can give us some type of sense that become more material channel that is starting to move the needle a little bit more for the broader Atlassian distribution strategy? Good question, it is Cameron here and as far as the data center demand, the best way to look at that is it's just showing further commitment from our customer base into the Atlassian ecosystem, and also the highlights the mission criticality of our applications, as we continue to say that migration to cloud is a multi-year journey, different customers are on different stages of that journey. And that's half the data center for many of them is a step towards the cloud.
All of them are well aware that cloud, our investments in cloud, our strategy on cloud and that cloud is in their future. But they're at all different levels of maturity at one end, they're able to move over. But the reality is, if you look to last quarter, one-third of our cloud migrations came from data center customers. So we have proven that we can take the data center customer base to the cloud.
The second one is around our solution partners in our channel, which are just absolutely critical to our overall efficient go-to-market model that we have everything we do directly with my teams, and marketing and sales and customer success is amplified with our hundreds of solution partners out there in the market. And obviously, as you see in the numbers, the solution partners have been increasingly critical to our cloud migration process.
The reality is that we provide a variety of incredible self-serve migration tooling for customers to move to the cloud. But many of our customers want help from planning out their migration to manage the migration stuff and partnering with Atlassian. And that has allowed for us to continue to show great growth. In general for large customers when I'm talking to them, the first thing I'd say is, hey, which partners are you're working with? Who can we partner with to build this plan out hand in hand going forward. And let me just add on to the first part of Cameron's answer there. In terms of data center growth, a couple of things also to remember in terms of Keith, you referred to something like a one-time nature. I think about the rev rec, remember the portion of the data center activities that we would contract with a customer is taken upfront, that's quite different to our cloud revenue accounting, which is fully reusable. And then the other thing I just pointed out, recall, we raised prices, around this time last year, on the data center, the full effect of that is now flowing through.
And so both those things give a little extra fuel to the inherent demand that Cameron is referring to for data center. Thank you, your next question comes from the line of Fred Havemeyer with Macquarie. Sir, your line is open. Hi, thank you very much, and congratulations on another really impressive quarter here. I wanted to ask, from your perspective, how does the hiring landscape for top tier talent? How is that evolving at this point? You mentioned throughout your investor letter, that your hybrid work policies have been a strategic differentiator for your hiring practices. In addition to just offering hybrid of remote work options, are you seeing anything out there to suggest that top talent is now weighing either compensation packages or stock comp packages any differently in this more volatile environment, potentially favoring companies like Atlassian? Thanks, Fred. It's Scott here. We will go -- we've been really happy with our team anyway a policy like that, to allow people to work wherever they want with that in an office, that's great, although it's been a little harder through the pandemic, and wherever we have the legal right to employ them. So we have seen a lot of our employees, and new employees working remote from existing offices, and we've seen existing employees move as well. So that's really great. We think that's going to be a long-term differentiator for Atlassian.
And I think that's going to be difficult for companies that don't have similar policies to attract and retain the best talent. In terms of compensation, we have seen some minor up ticks in compensation, we were early to that, I guess ahead of many sort of peer companies who are anticipated to see attrition take off before they address thing and also we're really proud with, we've worked on that with our employees. And now there's been talk with the great resignation across particularly North America, but we haven't seen an uptick in similar ways that our peers have seen an uptick around that.
Now, on the back of all that, we are setting aggressive goals for hiring into the future like we think and see we have such great opportunities across all three of the markets that we have talked to QA that linked about and the way of going about that is building out our largely R&D functions to build out the products. So I needed to go after these large markets. And so we're -- you'll see an uptick in our investment over the coming quarter and years. And we think that's, going to pay off really well for us. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of the Steve Enders with KeyBanc. You may ask your question. Okay, great. Thanks for taking the question here. I just want to ask about three exiting of CTO. Want to get a bit of sense for what the kind of plans are to manage his responsibility as going forward and how the company is thinking about that at this point? Yes, Steve it's Mike. I can take that one. Look, she's obviously been an absolutely fantastic leader in technology over the last six years. He's taken us into the cloud and then continue to build a truly world class cloud platform. So we couldn't be happier with what he said. I've also his superpower has been building high performance teams, building a great leadership team. So we're in an incredibly good situation in terms of engineering.
Broadly, obviously, we'll be very sad to lose him as he moves on to another phase in his life, which is understandable, but we will -- I have no doubt, we'll be able to find more talent internally, externally, we're in an incredibly good position. We've, over the long-term had a clear philosophy on culture and building a sustainable company. And a part of that is about leadership, transition and continuing to move forward in all of our departments. And I feel incredibly confident about where we are in our technology and engineering functions. It's perfect. Thanks for taking the question. Your next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Sir your line is open. Many thanks. James, I wanted to put this one to you if I could. You announced pricing changes, that would be effective on Feb 15th for data center and server. And I wonder if you could characterize what you think the impact has been or will be prior to the 15. For those pricing changes, see some pull in of demand and/or any characterization of posts of those two particular areas and data center and server? Thank you. Yes, sure Keith. At the end of the day, it is obviously the customer that makes the decision as to whether or not they're going to early renew, answer their investment was at last year and the head of these price changes. So you -- we really can't predict given the volume of customers that potentially had this offer available to them. So when you look at the price changes themselves that we announced a few weeks back, they vary by product by user tier, which is very normal for U.S. I would though generally think of those as approximately mid-teens percent type growth in price across server and data center. And so, I would expect that to begin flowing into our P&L in the fourth quarter in a more meaningful way.
So there may well be some event driven customer purchasing ahead of those price increases, as we saw in Q3 of the last fiscal year. But again, at the end of the day, the customer really decides. And so this is why we've been talking for some time now about a certain amount of variability in our financial model, as our customers go on this journey from service Cloud. Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani with Citi. Your line is open. Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for taking my questions and get to telephonically meet you again the question for you with respect to the concurrent acceleration that we seen in the cloud and data center business. Now, I was hoping you could put into context how both those businesses can sort of enjoy this degree of concurrent acceleration, especially considering you had mentioned that about a third of the cloud performance being attributable to data center migration. So I'm just curious as to, if you can walk through some of the dynamics there, and if you can also give us a frame of reference for how much of that cloud performance in the prior quarters. How much of that was driven by migrations from data center, just we have the frame of that context? Thank you. Sure, I'd use to take that one. Let's start with migrations. I mentioned a little earlier that what we would expect, and in fact, what we saw in Q2 was about a mid-to-high single-digit impact on our subscription revenue growth from migrations. Now, important though to note that when we think about cloud migrations, then about a third of that activity is coming from data center.
So again, but in context, when you think about the growth rate of the businesses that we're recording both cloud and data center, migrations are important, but relatively small part of the overall picture. So let's take a step back and really think about what are the key drivers for the cloud.
And I've really point to a handful of items beyond migrations. First of all, I think most importantly, we continue to do an excellent job of expanding our user accounts at our current cloud customers. You saw are also in the data, we brought 10,000 new customers to the company, they're all effectively going to clouds, we talked about the percentage. And once they're at the cloud, we're doing a very nice job of expanding user count.
The second thing, I've really also highlight the growing impacts that we're making with our customers on premium and enterprise editions. This really goes to our overall editions strategy that starts with free standard, then premium, then enterprise. And we've really got those four additions now, pretty much right across our portfolio, broad portfolio of products. And I think that's a tremendously important driver, we're seeing customers really get incremental value as they step up that that ladder, if you will of additions.
And then we've spoken now for several quarters about how pleased we've been had the royalty that type of activity. So that's working nicely. And of course, you saw us rollout a mid single-digit pricing increase. A few months ago now and so that relatively quickly, layers into the P&L when you think that the majority of our customers are on a monthly subscription. So those are really the important drivers that that in context. Thank you. The next question comes from the line of James Fish with Piper Sandler. Sir, your line is open. Hey, guys, this is Quinton on for Jim, thanks for taking our questions. You know, customer additions this quarter were really strong again, is this kind of 10,000 that adds the right level moving forward? Or do we back to more fiscal '20, fiscal '21 levels? And then just as a quick follow-up, what would you say that the education of channel partners is at with selling the cloud products? Are we at the bottom of the ninth inning with one or two legacy partners to go or is there significant education left within the channel? Thank you. Cameron, do you want to start off with that one? Sure. Yes, as far as the -- I can speak to about the new customer [Technical Difficulty] numbers as well as the names of the channel partners. As far as new customers, like, I have to call out just how incredible this machine that we built and go-to-market that we can routinely get 10,000 plus net new customers in the business, while maintaining our efficient go-to-market span. But in addition to that, I got a call two years ago, we made that change to the free model. So in addition to $10,000 and paying customers coming in with more than two users. We've also have 1000s of more teams and companies choosing us and using us in market for free. And that just shows like how much demand there is, and why people are choosing us.
Sort of the number itself, like it fluctuates quarter-to-quarter, for a variety of reasons changes in the funnel, seasonality, you name it. So let's be focused on the individual quarter numbers and look at the longer-term trend. We've added over 51,000 customers over the last 12 months, which when I started with this company, like many years ago, it was a fraction of that of our overall customer base. So we just been able to continue to evolve and make that efficient, go-to-market model work. As far as it means being an Australian company, most of our Aussie friends don't understand what any of the means.
I'd hate to say, which I mean there in. The reality is we continue to train certify partner with and engage our partners in these migrations, it's multi-year journey. Some of the partners are well ahead and leaving all immigrations, many of the other partners are going through these trainings and bringing people in. So plenty more to do there. But I'll tell you that they are critical to our migration story and our execution there. James? No, I think you covered it. Thank you. Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Arjun Bhatia with William Blair. Sir, your line is open. Thank you. Mike congrats on the quarter. Mike certainly, again in the shareholder letter, it seems like hiring was a key area of focus. And I think you stated that, building new products in the R&D or it would be a priority as you scale. When you scale your developer talent. I'm curious, if you can share any particular areas of focus that you have out in the market from a product perspective, that maybe is not addressed by the product portfolio today? I can take that Arjun it's a market model and maturity level. Let's look at you with the three markets that we're operating in, like we were lucky to operate in markets that are very, very large. And we have different levels of maturity in each of those markets. And underpinning, our ability to go after these markets is the Atlassian platform that we've spent over a decade building out. And so when I look at the investments we're making, like you'd have to say they're in the areas of the three different markets, we talked about those investments required to help our customers make those migrations across the cloud and continued investments in the platform that were that we've built out over those years and continue to build out.
And the benefits you're seeing come through, obviously, you've got migration numbers, but they're also benefits in our ability to launch new products, as you've seen with point A, that we can bring and launch new products to the market pretty quickly. And so I wouldn't see that being, huge changes in that, like, I think as the platform continues to mature their ability across to work across given IT I guess it'll be like chips and guacamole [Technical Difficulty] and, so that's like a unique ability that we have to do that. And of course, work management for all built on a great platform for work [Technical Difficulty] really unifies work across the entire organization.
Again, that we're uniquely positioned to do so. Mike can you add anything to. Yes, I mean, I just wanted the question started in hiring, I guess and ended in markets. So I'm not sure, which angle you're trying to go on. I think Scott's point about the platform is really key. Our platform, we believe is one of our strengths in executing against the large opportunities that we believe we have in all of our markets and around the business and in the Latin economy. Building that platform takes a world class engineering team and a world class engineering team at very large scale. So you see us making continued improvements and things like came anywhere in our culture and pressing our long-term thinking as a business, and also executing against those opportunities. Rather than being clear that we are going to invest and we believe in those opportunities.
At the core of that platform is a truly world-class engineering organization. So if it's about where we hiring? Look, we have a deep long-term belief that building a world-class technology company without engineering and R&D at the core is skills to steal Scott's analogies that are like making guacamole without putting avocados ethical, it just doesn't work. And you'll see that from some other companies. But we have a deep belief in engineering and R&D, at the core of executing into the huge opportunities that we have in front of us. And so that's why I try and tie those two together in question. Your next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Please ask your question. Thanks, guys and great, great numbers, I have a couple of questions. One on work management, you haven't talked too much about that maybe you can give us a little bit more color on the progress there. Maybe number of customers so you mentioned that on service management, maybe there you can mentioned that our work management? And then the second question more of a general one, regarding the customers that have transitioned to the cloud. Can you talk about the how the expansion activity of customers that migrate to the cloud is different? Then expansion activity of customers who remain on premise? Hi, Ittai. Look, I can take both of those. Firstly on work management flow. The first thing I would say is the fact that we get this deep into the call. And we talked about our huge opportunities in IT. We haven't mentioned Agile DevOps and software teams or work management, I think that's an example of just spend an hour plus talking about any about there. I would say we continue to be incredibly bullish on the work management space. We're doing an incredibly good job with Trello. And continuing to make that part of our platform, part of our set of offerings, whilst having a standalone flavor to it.
Do your work management continues to power along it's very new out of point A program innovation, but adding a different flavor on project management. And we incredibly bullish on things like 10 Central and other things coming at point A as well at the same time. So I feel very comfortable with where we stand, we believe there'll be lots of different ways of attacking the broad work management problem. And that's all. Before we even mentioned something like confluence. So really excited about how that happens, and how that continues to evolve.
I will say, we talk a lot about digital transformation, changing software teams and IT teams. A big part of that is also a cultural transformation and how the software and IT teams work with the rest of the business. So yes, we have three different markets, we believe in all of them very deeply. They are tied together at the core of how every company is changing as a software technology base, but also changing culturally to be more dynamic and more agile. And that's why we're in those three markets.
In terms of cloud expansion, it's a pretty simple story, actually. The ease of adopting a second product in the cloud, our ability to understand what customers are using, and hence, recommend other alternatives for them, either, you should get more people in your team on board, or you should try this other product is we can just do it a lot faster and easier. But it's a single click in the cloud, nothing to install, nothing to try. With free, you can quickly get 10 users started. So our ability to help customers expand is just much higher in the cloud. And you see that in greater and quicker expansion numbers of customers. We have to have the product to deliver that value. But our ability to help customers and guide them less friction in the cloud is just high. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Oliver with Baird. Please ask your question. Great. Thank you. Good evening, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Cameron you alluded to this earlier in your remarks. And Scott, Mike, I'd love to hear your view. But you guys continue to knock down a lot of the global compliance standards that are out there that really are I assume are inhibitors to many large enterprises and governments really going wholesale into the cloud. So I'd love to hear a little bit about some of what you've seen in terms of as you knock those down, how that backlog has been converting and then maybe some of the other global standards out there that you're excited about that you guys hinted in the letter that there's more to come imminently? Appreciate it, thank you very much. Look for sure, it is part of our continued momentum, right one of the bolts seen overtime that last season's just continued momentum and improvement, incremental improvement every single quarter. It's something we've done for just shy of 20 years now. And we'll continue to do. The area you've asked about in terms of cloud standards and compliance and governance and the whole sort of equity suite that comes with that in every different geography in the world. We do believe that that will continue to be a challenge for every SaaS company going forward as there are more companies, more geographies, more legal conditions. And so we have to build a world class engineering organization, and a platform underneath that cloud products that allows us to quickly adapt to that market as it changes that areas changes. And also continue to add the standards that our customers need and ask us to support.
We've done that over time, and you continue to see us improving that every single quarter, whether it's data residency in Australia for financial companies, or whether it's BaFin in Germany, we've continued to do that. And we'll continue to do that. We've seen a lot of examples of every time we add support for a different geography or standard, we unlock a portion of our customer base to move to the cloud. It's not a singular unlock. It's a whole series of ingredients, but it just increases the overall momentum of customers to the cloud. But for sure, we continue to work on performance and scale for the larger customers in the cloud. We continue to work on compliance and regulations and standards.
And we also continue to work on extensibility, which is equally important. The reason I mentioned that last one is Forge sort of future extensibility standard and technical framework builds things like these compliance and regulatory standards at the core, which is incredibly difficult to do. But we believe in extensibility, for our customers going forward, it's long been a hallmark of Atlassian and I think in a higher compliance environment, that's going to be incredibly important for us going forward in the cloud. And we're seeing that in the adoption of Forge via those enterprise customers in the cloud, where it handles the regulatory standards for them. Thank you. The next question comes from the line of DJ Hynes with Canaccord. Please ask your question. Hey, guys, congrats on the continued success here. I have a product question for Mike or Scott, I presume. So there are a handful of visual collaboration tools in the market that are seeing really strong growth. I know you guys recently invested in Miro, what is it about visual collaboration that makes it hard for you to replicate? Like why invest or partner in that space versus doing it on your own? Yes, I can take that DJ. Look, we believe in having a broad spectrum of opportunities in that, with Atlassian Ventures, we're trying to make sure that we are investing and partnering in high quality enterprise SaaS companies that are partners of Atlassian. You've seen us do that in the past with Zoom and Slack and others, and more recently with Miro across our markets, as well as a whole host of smaller up and coming names. Visual collaboration in general look, it's a very busy category, I would say because it's such a broad option.
It used to be called whiteboards, but it's not really a whiteboard. It's a whole series of different things that you can do there. It's a bit like saying as one way to do project management. If you're a five person marketing team, you do project management utterly differently than if you're 5000. Engineers building a bridge. So project management is a very broad term, I would say the same thing for visual collaboration.
It's a broad term. I think there are a lot of fantastic products in there. And obviously, we believe in the ones that we use and the ones that we've invested in. But in general, our customer philosophy is being partnered and integrated with all of the best of breed SaaS products that are out there, and allowing our customers to make those choices and just making sure that all the data they have in any Atlassian product is easily connected and integrated with all the data they have in any other product. Next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Thanks. On Trello, you've been pretty clear over $50 million on the platform yet I think monetization is still low. Can you walk through, how you expect to potentially change that over the next year or maybe not. And for James, Americas at least in our model look like the best quarter in 13 quarters, I know that the comp was little easier but and then stand out there in the Americas that perhaps you haven't seen in past quarters? Thanks. Brent, I can take the first part on Trello monetization. And so I don't have much new news for you. But I can repeat our stance here. I mean, Trello, we focus first on continuing to grow, demonstrate the size of Trello going after the Fortune 500,000 we think of that very, very large scale. And there's a billion knowledge workers out there trying to do all sorts of different things that Trello is very, very useful for. You've seen us continue to improve the product with views, smartcards to integrate third-party data, as we just talked about, and a whole series of continued product improvements.
That said, we've gotten better at monetizing Trello almost every year that we've had it on the platform and continue to do so. But I will say that we put usage before monetization, when it comes to Trello. You see it getting closer to the Atlassian platform in various different ways in terms of the Atlassian account and identity and all sorts of different things. So we are very patient in doing those things correctly. And continue to make Trello a huge product that's beloved by its users. And we put that first. But it's pretty nice business for us and continue investment. James, I will leave you there. Yes, just follow-up on that. One of the things we've done around Trello pricing has been recently bring in a standard position. And again, this is an example we talked about price increases at different points on this call. So a good example of whether many indication where we are actually lower.
Again to stimulate the sort of demand that Mike is referring to. In terms of the Americas result, yes, it was a strong year-over-year growth rate for the Americas. I just point back to one of my earlier comments about obviously data center had very strong growth in the quarter. And we do have this portion of the customer commitment that is taken upfront, in terms of rev rec in the quarter in which the customer signs with us.
And of course, the U.S., the Americas, particularly the U.S. is home to a good number of our largest customers. So the certain amount of timing effect there that makes for a very strong Americas year-over-year growth rate. Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz of Mizuho. Your line is open. Okay, thank you. I remember when you launched Atlassian Marketplace that was less than a decade ago, and here we are a $2 billion lifetime sales. It's incredible. My question here is with cloud now comprising nearly half of the apps in the Marketplace and with take rates continuing to be discounted as an additional incentive, are we sort of at a tipping point, in other words, are we at a space where you're seeing app development and app usage really accelerate? Yes, Scott here. Look we're really proud of the marketplace, I remember, the plane where Mike wrote the original code that went into the marketplace and got us got off the ground. And for us to get from there to $2 billion lifetime sales is amazing. And more importantly, that's $1.5 billion of money that's going back into the ecosystem, right, and we've got such a strong and powerful ecosystem around Atlassian.
And we've long for over a decade had goals around the ecosystem outside of the Atlassian to the way larger than Atlassian itself, both in terms of the number of people working on it, and the revenue there. And so, we're really, really proud about kind of the jobs and everything we've been created around Atlassian and how we benefit, all of us benefit from that.
In terms of like the cloud and tipping points, obviously, Forge our app development platform in cloud and takes care of a lot of things that developers used to have to do themselves, such as writing their own servers. And now we take care full use of that, that is lower the barrier to entry for new people to build functionality inside of applications. And as we've seen kind of in our server based applications, all of the early adopters of these new technologies are people using internally inside their own companies to integrate with different processes to automate things themselves to build, extra functionality that is unique to that particular company. And that oftentimes leads to people starting our business using those things and making them more generic or things flow to our existing marketplace partners who are building out on the Forge capabilities.
So, I think like longer-term, you've seen pressure on our marketplace take rates across kind of, particularly in the consumer side of things has been downward pressure on that, and we get to play that out over the long-term, I would say that we will -- the take rate will be more pressure on the take rates have been historically, but that's also going to lead to a much, much, much larger ecosystem build around Atlassian. We're experimenting and seeing beyond our traditional partners, how we can partner with people, like it, we've made investments into Atlassian Ventures, and overall like the number we focus on is not really our take rate, like that that's nice, but that number we focus on internally is our sort of GMV or so effectively how much money is running through the marketplace, like to our third parties, and that's the number we work internally. Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Steve Koenig with SMBC Nikko. Your line is open. I appreciate it. Most of my questions have been asked, but and actually, let me also congratulate you on the quarter also on the very low employee turnover metrics that we're seeing from LinkedIn, especially in sales. I just think it's remarkable. I guess what I'll ask about that a little bit in the weeds. But you know the price increases happening on February 15, you talked a little bit about the impact that could have on the coming quarter? What kind of customer behavior, could we expect in the subsequent four quarters with respect to like those customers that maybe have renewed early to take advantage of locking in the price?
And then, would they be looking to convert to cloud within the next four quarters? Would there be a greater incentive to convert to cloud? How do we think about that? And I guess the larger question here really is we kind of puzzle over your trajectories here, we've talked a bit about data center, and the drivers there, we've talked qualitatively about the drivers in cloud. But we're seeing cloud continue to accelerate here. And just kind of how do we think about that, even if it's qualitative. So that's all and thanks again, and congratulations. Yes, so thanks for the question. This is Cameron here. So two pieces on this. So every time we do some price changes, obviously, customers have the ability to make a choice. And I was actually just on a call with an executive of a very large pharmaceutical company, just this week, largely talking about his options going forward, which is one, you can renew, that's fine. We'll just, that's an option going forward, renew your data center licenses as we continue to plan for cloud. The second is, we can start planning out a few small cloud projects, maybe for some teams, or we can go all in on cloud and get it all done with it all comes down to what's your prioritization and what is your company's readiness.
After a 30 minute conversation, he basically give me the all in on cloud option, like this is fine, we have a cloud mandate, we need to prioritize the work, let's just get it done now. The reality is, that's how we prefer that optionality for our customers, that we're not forcing them down any path, that's what's going to work for them and their projects, and the value that we can deliver. The second big one is even if they renew today, we have plenty of programs and practices in place that two months from now or four months from now, or six months from now, if they want to move to cloud, we will absolutely make them right from a licensing perspective.
So by no means do we hold them to a 12 month cycles for these decisions based on efforts, get them cloud licenses, and dip their toe in the cloud. So a lot of this comes down to largely the customers appetite to take on the IT project that is in migration, more than anything. For most of our customers, they are more than ready to go cloud. Almost all of them have the cloud mandates, and just comes down to timing of budgets, prioritization and IT projects. Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. Your line is open. Thanks very much. It is Joey Marincek on for Pat, appreciate the question. Can you just give us some more color on the Percept.AI acquisition and then sort of how you're going about M&A going forward? And then separately, what are you looking for in your next EPS? Thank you so much. Great, squeezing with three questions at the end. Well done, look let me take Percept.AI first. Fantastic team focused on AI and smarts in specifically in a service management and customer service manner. Again, AI and smarts is relatively domain specific to make a huge impact at the moment. And so I would see this as a part of our continual improvement in the ITSM space, both organic and inorganic, to make sure that we have the best set of ITSM tools around.
And also an investment in machine learning and smarts as we keep putting at the core of our platform. I always say that our customers shouldn't need to know that we care about AI and machine learning and smarts, but we bake it deeply into the platform. And this is about continuing to improve that in the area of service management and for IT teams in any service driven enterprise out there. I can pass to Scott on M&A philosophy, if that. Sounds great, Mark like we're lucky the company, we have a track record of building new products is that our track record of partnering in our ecosystem, which we talked about on the call, long track record of successful M&A, both really small tuck-ins and medium sized companies like Trello, which we brought as an extension and so I don't dwell on all three. Now we'll get acquire over time that the number one thing we will get is out what's rolling machine alignment, so they often miss the potential where everything like that's got to be the most important thing is do they align with our mission.
And then they fit culturally with Atlassian. And then everything else after that, you kind of go to market and technology and other things are [Technical Difficulty] there is you evaluate the life of the two, the most important thing and so there's been no change to our M&A philosophy over a long decade on time horizon, we'll continue to look for assets that fit really well alongside Atlassian as well as kind of small tuck-in technology acquisitions that help us where we'll be quicker to acquire something then build it ourselves. [Technical Difficulty] of Cowen. Sir, your line is open. Great, thanks James. Question for you on operating margins. You guys are targeting that it's 17% to 18% in Q3 That's down from 26% to 27% in the first half, could you just talk about what's driving that that margin step down where you guys are looking to step up investments and kind of where you see hitting the low watermark and margin starting to rebound? Thanks. Yes, sure, Derek, we very much feel as though we've been saying this for a while, the company across the three markets that we really want to push to continue to build on the momentum that we're seeing, hiring, bringing excellent talent in wherever they are around the world. I think the team anywhere approach we have is really important in terms of differentiating our ability to attract the best talent, obviously, in a very competitive field. And it's with those additional folks that we'll be able to get after these very significant opportunities that lie right in front of us. And so we're really enthusiastic about that, we're positive about that opportunity and more tactically, if you think about the fact that we're increasingly becoming a cloud company quarter-by-quarter, 53% of revenue is now cloud, that all costs have an impact on gross margins.
We've talked about that for a number of years, as we take on the work resources to help our customers make that migration journey very much along the lines of what Cameron was just talking about with the large customer that he was talking with this week, do the migrations work. In terms of operating margin, the significant bulk of the additional investment would be and that in our businesses, really comes down to having Atlassian. And so that's why it's really we describe it in the letter as our top priority.
So that's what we'll be focusing just on opportunities across the three markets, that the platform I think is a really important accelerant of our business. You've seen that showing up in our ability to quickly get new products, developed point A, we've talked about those new products under that program will continue to be important. So you will continue to be very focused on the quality of our investing and the returns that all for Atlassian will be strong. Thank you. I will now turn the call back to Scott. Sir, please go ahead. I just wanted to thank everyone for joining the call today. And I thank you our customers and to all of the fantastic Atlassian representatives. We appreciate your ongoing support and remain safe and healthy these times. I will see some of you in person and for the rest of you tune in virtually to Team '22 coming up in April. Have a good day. Thank you. This concludes our today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

Thank you for joining Atlassian's Earnings Conference Call for the Third Quarter of Fiscal Year 2022. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of Atlassian's website following this call. I will now hand the call over to Martin Lam, Atlassian's Head of Investor Relations. Welcome to Atlassian's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 Earnings Call. Thank you for joining us today. On the call today, we have Atlassian's Co-Founders and Co-CEO, Scott Farquhar and Michael Cannon-Brookes; our Chief Financial Officer, James Beer; and our Chief Revenue Officer, Cameron Deatsch. Earlier today, we published a shareholder letter and press release with our financial results and commentary for our third quarter of fiscal year 2022. The shareholder letter is available on Atlassian's Work Life blog in the Investor Relations section of our website, where you will also find other earnings-related materials, including the earnings press release and supplemental investor data sheet. As always, our shareholder letter contains management's insight and commentary for the quarter. So during the call today, we'll have brief opening remarks and then focus our time on Q&A.
This call will include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, performances and achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed and/or implied by the forward-looking statements. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Forward-looking statements represent our management's beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made. We assume no obligation to update or revise such statements should they change or cease to be current. Further information on these and other factors that could affect the company's financial results is included in filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including the section titled Risk Factors in our most recent Form 20-F and quarterly Form 6-K.
During today's call, we will also discuss non-IFRS financial measures. These non-IFRS financial measures are in addition to and are not a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. A reconciliation between IFRS and non-IFRS financial measures is available in our shareholder letter, earnings release and an investor data sheet on the IR website. During Q&A, please ask your full question upfront so that we can be fair and be able to accommodate the next speaker. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for opening remarks. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Q3 was yet another strong quarter for Atlassian. We continue to execute well and see great momentum in our business. We continue to see significant demand for our products across all 3 of our markets, and now have line of sight to $10 billion in annual revenue based on our current markets and current products. Atlassian has a 20-year track record of growing our ambition, and we've never been more excited about the opportunities in front of us. We had an amazing Team '22 conference in Las Vegas.
It was incredible to hear all the customer stories, about the mission-critical workflows that we're powering from our customer community and all of our partners. We continue to learn from our customers about how Atlassian can help their teams work differently together. If you missed us at our Investor Day in Las Vegas, be sure to catch all of the materials and a recording of the event on our IR website. We'd love for you to learn more about Atlassian and better understand our massive market opportunities, our platform, the strategic bets we're placing and our future trajectory. With that, I'll pass the call to the operator for Q&A. Operator? Mike, do you want to talk about the long-term future of Atlassian while we have a moment here. I was thinking a shareholder letter maybe answered all of the questions -- perfect shareholder letter. [Operator Instructions]. We have your first question from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. And very impressive results. Right now, the investor focus is really on sort of macro and durability of software demand. One of the things, Mike, that you've talked about in the past is Atlassian is kind of built for defense. But when you look at sort of the 3Q results, how much of this was just the demand environment is good, and you guys are executing in a good demand environment. How much of this is Atlassian flexing that we're good at side of the equation to help us kind of understand the operating environment you guys are in? Keith, it's Scott here. Look, I'm super happy with the results we have. But the way we operate as a company is really making long-term bets and long-term investments. And that's what we see here. And those investments, whether they were in free many years ago or they were in ITSM, who we made those investments or cloud infrastructure and migrating our customers to cloud, all these things are long-term bets that are paying off over time. And so I think regardless of what the demand environment is like we've played that long-term game. So that's one thing to think about. The second aspect about that is that we've seen kind of great demand for our products around the world. I know there's some worries about that but we've seen great demand in all of our geographies. And I think what we're seeing there is we sell into a market that in good times and bad times, requires the products that we sell.
And we've seen that even through sort of the '08, '09 downturn, we've been around long enough to have played through that, and we came out stronger on the other side of that, and we grew through that downturn as well. So it's a combination of those factors. I think people realized sort of pandemic is coming off and there might have been pandemic tailwinds, fueling Atlassian's business that will come off after that. We haven't seen anything to indicate that if anything, the demand for digital transformation is kind of a structural change that's continuing to happen. We have your next question from Arjun Bhatia with William Blair. And congrats on a great quarter here. I wanted to touch on the ITSM market and the progress that you're making with Jira Service Management, specifically. It's something that was a big topic of conversation amongst your customers and partners at Team '22 in Vegas. And I'm curious how the product market fit of that solution has changed over time? I know in the past, we've talked about maybe it would be good for legal help desk for quick up and running use cases. But are you starting to get pulled into more core ITSM use cases at large enterprises. I'd love to hear some of the commentary around that and maybe how the deal size is for Jira Service Management have changed over the last year, 1.5 years. I'll talk about the long-term stuff, and Cameron can chime in with any color about deal size changes if there's anything to add there. As we said before, there's some huge advantages we have in the ITSM market. One is that we're the only company that can bring IT and Dev together. And that's very attractive to companies as IT and Dev do come together across the entire industry. So that's really attractive. And then the other one is that we can play for the Fortune 500, 1000. We're not just playing the Fortune 2000. That's both the cost-effective nature of our solution but also just the time to value, getting our customers up and running. And so when you look at the sort of product market fit, like those things stand out, they stand out to the entire time frame that we've got. And that's been recognized by Gartner, Forrester kind of the big people who are recommending to large customers what to buy like those advantages are being recognized up and down the customer size spectrum.
Look, I mean, longer term, that we have a view that every organized team and the organization becomes a service team, whether your HR, your finance, legal. IT, the obvious one, right, that everyone becomes a service organization. And I think with the visions we laid out at our annual conference just a few weeks ago, we sort of articulated that global health vision. So Cameron, do you want to add anything on the customer size? Yes. I first want to call out that part of our approach here is not to just go after the small customers or just attract the large customers in that we are very much Atlassian focus, which is just over 40,000 Jira Service Management customers today. And that's a relatively new product and it shows the type of volume of product market fit, as you would say, is quite strong, increasingly over the last couple of years, largely due to our cloud platform and from an enterprise investment perspective, supported by a variety of really robust features in the IT service management market. We checked off what I consider is like that kind 80, 20 set of requirements that most enterprise departments need, and they're starting to really look to Jira Service Management as that IT service management platform. And we have plenty of case studies where we see companies address us that way. I actually spoke to the customer yesterday that did exactly that and has been running Jira Service Management for all the IT Service Management operations for over a couple of years now. We have your next question from Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets. Cameron, good transition for my question. I wanted to ask about Jira Work Management and get your perspective perhaps on where you think the maturity curve is relative to JSM and what you think the opportunity is? And if I broke that down into the pieces, if you could compare it to JSM has 40,000 customers in terms of the maturity, where is your work management? And how do you see the opportunity in terms of contribution today since your work management as you look out over the next couple of years, it just seems like your work management has a tremendous opportunity for growth. But just wanted to see if you could put some scale and context to that. Keith, look, I can certainly talk to that one. For sure, we would echo your comments, there's a tremendous opportunity in Jira Work Management. There's also a tremendous opportunities in Work Management in general. Obviously, we have a long and proud history in the large products and confluence in Trello, complemented by -- you mentioned like Jira Work Management and Atlassian which we shipped at our Team '22 conference. I think, look, a few comments. We started using the term work differently together, and I think it's really, really applicable in the work management market. Because Jira Work Management and Trello are different ways to work. They reflect different types of teams that want to manage their work. What's really important is that Atlassian allows you to have that autonomy among your teams to use different types of tools to manage work because different teams and different functions manage work in different ways. But we started to create that alignment across the organization. We can do that in various ways.
If you're working in the Jira manner, I suppose, with Jira Service Management, Jira Software and Jira work management that helps you bring them all together under the Jira family, if that's the way your organization runs or your team runs. But similarly with that we can now tie Jira work management together with Trello and lots of other third-party work management tools to create that same visibility. It's very early in the Jira work management journey. So it's probably more like Jira Service Management 8, 9 years ago, whenever we originally shipped out. So we're spending a lot of time with customers at the moment to try to make sure it fit their needs and continue to do that. But as you've seen from us over time, investing in R&D and investing in products and listening to customers is something that we do very well, and we're going to continue to run that by quarter-on-quarter, and we're very bullish about the Jira work management space and its opportunities. We have your next question from Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho Securities. Okay. I wanted to ask about the recent outage. And just if you had any concerns that this could affect the rate and pace of cloud adoption going forward. And then also, I know that it only affected about 0.3% of your installed base. But were any customer credits issued for the Q3 and/or Q4 period? I'll first talk about that, and I'll let Cameron talk to the migration impact on customers and how we see it from different lens. Look, it's pretty clear, we understand deeply how mission-critical our products are to customers and the teams are impacted massively when our services are unavailable. There's no way of saying this out, it's not met our own high standards that we hold for ourselves. As you said, there were 775 customers impacted. And as you pointed out, you've done the math yourself, but 1 customer is too many. So although it represents yes, less than 0.5% or so of our customer base. One customer is still too many. Important emphasize for any customers that are listening, not the result of Cyber-attack, no unauthorized access to any data, any of those types of things. And obviously, that we maintain backups that we be resilient against all different types of data corruption events has happened in this case.
And all our customers have, at this stage, been fully restored. You'll be long familiar, great with our values, [indiscernible] is something we hold pretty highly, and we run a very open and blameless incident management processing culture. As such, we will be ultimately publishing a pretty detailed post-incident review on our website for -- on our engineering blog, I believe, by the end of the week, as we do to share with our customers what happened, our learnings, and importantly, the processes we've changed and we'll continue to change as a result of this. We believe that such a culture builds ever more resilient services and helps us emerge continually as a stronger company as we do that. And I can talk to Cameron, but we've had pretty great customer reception from that openness. Got you. Yes. I can speak to the customer impact. As you can imagine, I've been speaking -- this is Cameron, by the way. I have been speaking to many customers during and now post the incident that were both directly impacted by the incident as well as customers that are looking to migrate to the cloud and has -- and they have questions around that. Now while the outage affected a very small subset of our customer base, as Mike said, one is too many, and we take this extremely seriously. Getting on the calls with these customers, they're tough conversations. But when we walk through exactly what happens, which we will provide in detail in the incident review as well as what we're doing about it to ensure it doesn't happen again. Most customers completely understand and it turns into a collaborative discussion on moving forward. In fact this morning, I spoke with a directly impacted customer who actually was standardizing on our tools over the last few years, and we had incredible uptime, incredible SLAs for many years with them.
And this was the first kind of big incident that caused them to have their concerns with us. And we talked about the mission criticality of our applications. We talked about how they did workarounds in the interim as they actually when -- they started more applications with us as the incident was out. But the reality is by the end of the conversation, we had moved forward, and they were talking about upgrading to the premium version of our products, which just shows how much goodwill customers have for us in our products. James, do you want me to do credits? Yes, Gregg, just to address the compensation part of your question. Obviously, we want very much to do the right thing for the customers that were impacted. So I would expect that there would be compensation in Q4, so to be clear, nothing in Q3, but I would not expect the level to be material to the financial statements. We have your next question from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Securities. Growth remains impressive and consistent as always. The EMEA number at 25% growth is a touch lower the letter, carefully characterized this as event-driven. As a result of the tougher comp, not demand-driven. And you're also citing no material changes fiscal Q4 thus far. Is there any additional context you can add around the signals you're watching there? And what informs those observations and certainly top of mind for all of us across software and useful. Yes, Mike, I can address this first, and then perhaps Cameron, you can add on behind me. But as you're alluding to there, Michael, as you framed the question, 25% growth year-over-year in EMEA, but very much a tough comp versus Q3 of fiscal year '21 in which we had very significant EMEA growth of 45% year-over-year. Recall that last year, we had the event-driven activity as a result of having recently announced the server end of life and then also price increases associated with both server and data center. And a year or so ago, it was our European partners who were particularly adept at working with their customers to get ahead of some of those changes. So that really explains the reason for the tough comp. And I would just further note that in Q3, EMEA represented 39% of total revenue. So that's actually up a point sequentially versus the previous quarter. So not seeing anything unusual there. We're pleased with our growth rate in EMEA as we are in other parts of the world. And in Q4, yes, it's early, but not seeing any material change in our sales activity day-to-day. Cameron, do you have anything extra there? Yes. And I want to speak with our teams located in Europe as well as our partners. The short story is the war in Ukraine is very much present in everyone's conversations, but it has -- today it had no direct impact to the demand for what Atlassian does, and that's kind of the short story here is because of digital transformation, because of continue to remote work from home because companies are trying to be more agile and responsive to this changing world, that provides constant demand for what Atlassian's applications do. In that Team '22 a couple of weeks ago. I met with a variety of our European solution partners.
Their biggest challenge remains being able to hire enough people to satisfy the demand that they see in the market. And in addition to that, we focused pretty heavily on the European market just from a cloud capability perspective, as you know, last quarter released support for BaFin which is basically financial services standards in Germany for our cloud products, and that has opened up a variety of new cloud opportunities and very large financial services firms for cloud migrations. So we continue to see that demand there and other things looking good this quarter. We have your next question from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. James, a couple for you. Just on the financial side. Data center continues to perform very well for you. I believe that in the Investor Day, you actually mentioned a few instances where data center customers were actually migrating to the cloud. How do we think about the growth in data center going forward? Is there a point in time? Do you see this kind of rolling over and transition to the cloud starts happening a little bit more diligently and that side of the equation is any way can help us get a framework around that will be great. And then just another just household question regarding Russia, the 1,800 customers that have been, I guess, turned off because of the sanctions or inability to pay. Can you tell us what's the annual revenue impact of that customer base? Okay. Ittai, let me take the first one, data center. Yes, I was very pleased with the growth rate of the business there. And as you alluded to in your question, in the context of the fact that when you look at our cloud migrations, 1/3 of those volumes are coming from data center. So I think this is one of the important stories here around the migration journey. Obviously, we've been talking a lot about server to cloud, server to data center, but also the fact that a good number of our larger customers that generally are on the data center products migrating to the cloud I think, is going to be a theme that continues to play out for a number of years. And I think this very much reflects our thesis, the cloud is very much the best experience for the customer. That's obviously where we've been putting in a disproportionate amount of our investment over recent years. And so I would expect that to continue over time. So as it does, that would obviously represent a headwind for data center growth.
But yes, as we've discussed in the past. For some customers, they're not able yet to move to the cloud. Oftentimes, it's a matter of that customer fitting in this migration project to their overall IT workflow and so forth. And so we're delighted that customers continue to look at our data center products, high-quality, good value and so forth. And so I think those are the dynamics that will play out gradually over time. In terms of the 1,800 customers that reside in Russia and dropped out of the customer count of this past quarter, we noted at Analyst Day, that Russia had represented about 1% of our business. So those 1,800 customers reflect a fraction of that point. We have your next question from Fatima Boolani with Citi. James, this one is for you. I know calculated billings or billings is not the metric you focus on and neither do you run the business on the metric. But I'm curious if you can just give us a reminder on some of the points of volatility in that metric, particularly given the pricing changes in the end of life of certain products? And then just with respect to doing larger enterprise transactions and enterprises generally preferring to take on maybe more longer-term oriented contracts. I'd love to get your perspective on how we should put some guardrails around the reported or calculated billings metrics as it were. Sure. I really speak to deferred revenue here because when you think of calculated billings, it's certainly revenue plus change in deferred. And so the first part of your question around the volatility in that metric, I think back to Q3 of last year, and we saw a very substantial increase in revenue that we referred to as event-driven that I was mentioning in one of my earlier answers, related to the server end of life activity that we had just announced previously to that point as well as price increases around both server and data center. And so that drove a revenue level that had us preannouncing, you may recall, a year ago. But it also drove a very significant deferred revenue increment at that point in time.
Now fast forward a year, and we had some similar level of activity, but significantly less of this event-driven activity. In this past Q3, we finished selling server upgrades and then somewhat similarly to the previous year also had price increases for both the server and data center businesses again. But when you look at the deferred revenue balance and the percentage growth in deferred revenue on a sequential basis, which I think is the right way to look at it, you'll see that the increment to deferred revenue, the growth rate of deferred revenue in this past Q3 was less than half of what we were seeing a year ago. So I think that's the primary thing to really focus on in terms of volatility of deferred revenue.
In terms of the enterprise activity, certainly, some of those larger customers are interested in multiyear commitments. And you see quite clearly in the long-term deferred revenue line, the impact of that effect. Now again, if you look at the absolute dollars here, they're actually for long-term deferred revenue, they're actually down year-over-year. And obviously, we've grown substantially in the last year. So while it is an effect, I wouldn't say that it's a terribly large effect in terms of how our business model is evolving. So yes, I have some enterprises who are looking to commit to us for longer, but in the overall scheme of our numbers, I'd say this is relatively modest. We have your next question from Fred Havemeyer with Macquarie. And firstly, congratulations on another very strong quarter. And I think also importantly, thank you to the whole Atlassian team for addressing the outage right up front in your shareholder letter. Certainly, we were tracking what many were saying online. And I think the transparency that you're bringing to the table is really quite important when you're working with developers, technical consumers and enterprises globally. Now higher-level question, James, while I really don't want to see you go, it's always a pleasure to work with you. Your anticipated retirement date is on the horizon here. And I just wanted to check in how is Atlassian thinking about the CFO transition at this point? And where are you in terms of considering or finding a potential successor? Yes. Thanks Fred. It's changed, it's 74th earnings call we've liked this out and with backgrounds of 74 at the moment, celebrating, James, do you want to tell us how old [indiscernible] celebrating his earnings call numbers. Soon, he will be -- he bought himself a plane that he [indiscernible] soon, he'll be flying to a remote Island, going for a swim, going for snowfall, hike, just enjoying retirement. And -- so we start to see him go [indiscernible] I know how much he will enjoy working with James. But it's been great research that we had ongoing. We've had a lot of interest from people across the industry and even beyond into other industries who are super excited to come work with Atlassian. And as you'd expect, we want to make sure we keep the bar high and so whoever and exception to James he sure does a great job. And so I'm not ready to kind of share any names or any details about that at this stage, but you'll be the first to know once we've landed a suitable candidate. We have your next question from Brent Thill with Jefferies. This is Luv Sodha on for Brent Thill. I wanted to ask a question on the cloud migration demand and how we should think about it, especially as we have a loyalty discount expiration coming up in next quarter on June 30, and you've achieved HIPAA compliance for Jira Software and Confluence Cloud this quarter. So how should we think of these 2 events? Could you maybe give us some historical context as to what you saw last year when you had a similar loyalty discount expiration? Yes, I'll take this one. It's Cameron here. Migration continues to be very much on track as we planned. And we continue to say that this is very much a multiyear journey. Yes, we have different steps along the way, whether it was the elimination of server upgrades back in February or the loyalty discount coming off in July or the server end of life in February of 2024. We have multiple stages where over the next few years that will give customers a reason to component event to go off and migrate. And this has all been planned out. But once again this is on track, it's important to say that migrations as well is a multiyear journey and then it doesn't end once the server end of life happens. At that time, we will still be migrating data center to customers to the cloud for many years to come. So this will be a constant journey for us.
I'd say every day, we get better at helping our customers through this migration journey, whether it's them assessing our cloud, assessing the financial impact, understanding, hey, if we go earlier, we get this discount. If we go later, we can get a different level of discount, but we have many different empower teams to have those conversations as well as our solution partners having those conversations, and it gets better every day. In addition to that, what I'm very happy about is once we convince customers to move to the cloud, we get better about actually getting them to the cloud, moving their data, moving their systems, onboarding their users. And that's a journey. Our products are mission-critical. That transition is different for every customer, and we have many different teams and solution partners helping with that. I just want to say it's a constant moving thing, and you also mentioned HIPAA and HIPAA is one of many compliance requirements out there that I mentioned [indiscernible] as well that we are continually working on.
We have a whole dedicated compliance teams that are largely -- you name the acronym in the industry, we're knocking them off and opening up those cohorts of customers. So yes, with HIPAA, we can start talking to health care and organizations. We're working on FedRAMP, which allow us to open up the government markets and so on and so forth. So we did FSI last year more financial services. So think of it as a continuous set of improvements both on the product side as well as financial improvements on the -- over the next couple of years that we'll continue this journey for our customers. We have your next question from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. So I wanted to key back in on the data center revenues and just understand either if the outage is driving increased interest in data center or how you're thinking about the seasonality, particularly for Q4 and mid next year around the data center business, the trajectory there? And just remind us, obviously, the guidance for margins for Q4, kind of looked like some more of your out-year targets. Where is that incremental spend mostly coming from for -- in Q4. And I think that would be super helpful. This is Cameron again. I'll address the data center demand. I'll let James speak to the incremental spend. On the data center side, as James already mentioned on this call, it's a great product. It's a great offering for our customers who are looking for performance, scale, stability, full control of their applications in their environments. The trade-off customers make of going to data center is they do not get all of the innovation that we're launching in cloud. And customers, we speak with customers every single day about this. It's a sure trade they have. They know very much that many of the new features, a lot of our new products that are coming from our point A offerings are coming natively in the cloud and will only be available in the cloud.
And many customers are running towards the cloud right now to make that decision. Many customers are saying, okay, we can actually go stay on data center for a year or 2 or maybe customers say, hey, I want to stay on data center for the time being, knowing that cloud is always going to be an option for them. That said, we will continue to focus on cloud on the front foot, every customer. We are incentivizing customers to choose our cloud first and foremost. But for customers for whatever reason, need to stay on data center, that is a great option for them. They are very high satisfaction for those customers, and we have a good track record with that product line. And in terms of the operating margin part of your question there for Q4, is very much illustrative of the theme that we were talking about at Investor Day recently in terms of the very significant opportunities that we believe that we have right in front of us at Atlassian and that we're looking to invest against those and that will be the right thing for shareholders, free cash flow generation over time and so forth. Now one of the points that we noted in the letter was that during Q3, we hired net new Atlassian's, a total of 791. That is significantly higher than the previous quarterly high, which is 479 net new Atlassians. And you will see the full quarter effect of those additional folks in Q4.
And we're delighted that our talent acquisition engine, if you will, is able to attract that many talented people from all around the world. I think our team anywhere strategy is an element -- an important element of how we're able to do this. And I think that just positions us very well indeed for the future. One other item to remember in Q4 in terms of the expensive side of the equation, we had our Team '22 event, as we've been discussing, and so that would have added, particularly to some of the sales and marketing expenses in the current Q4 quarter. We have your next question from Jim Fish with Piper Sandler. This is Quinton on for Jim Fish. Really, we wanted to circle back to work management. The team said at the Analyst Day and actually reiterated today that there is a course to greater than $10 billion of revenue with work management as the most significant opportunity. How much of that $10 billion would work management have to represent for you to hit that goal? And then as we think about the opportunity, how much of it is penetrating the current installed base as a greenfield opportunity versus replacing competitive solutions. Yes, I can answer that. And look, a few comments. Firstly, I can't fill and sell detail in the model, but I would reiterate the $10 billion number that we put out there, and we feel really confident and bullish on is across all 3 of our markets. I think we've said that logically, work management would have the most number of users, right? If you think about tens of millions of developers, hundreds of millions of technology professionals once you start talking about IT and then 1 billion-plus knowledge workers. The work management space, obviously, target which has the most volume of going after 100 million monthly active users. It's a logically connected that -- it is likely that the majority of those would come from the broader work management space, right? There are many more people working in finance and HR and marketing and all sorts of different departments and there are working in the IT department in most companies. So that's from a user perspective.
That may not necessarily be reflected in the revenues perspective, because obviously, the dollars per user of the more technical tools are generally going to be higher. There's sort of high-level directional commentary over the multiple years ahead, but that sort of seems quite logical to me that, that's the way that it would work. That said, obviously, we have 2 fantastic products in Confluence and Trello, that are at scale and continue to grow strongly at scale. Both have histories, and we are continuing to invest very hard in both of those. We also have a series of new products that we've seen, we mentioned Jira work management, taking advantage of the Jira family and Jira's history of compliance and structure and control for organizations and teams that work that way. And the finance teams, for example, often want more details and controls and auditing processes and things like this.
And Atlas, obviously, being our newest offering, launching at Team '22. And I think it's fair to say that we continue to be excited about the work management space and looking at a lot of things in terms of innovation there. What I would stress that all of our products in work management are built on top of the Atlassian platform. That's the platform that helps people work differently together. But in this particular case, it allows our work management products to work very well with both the IT and developer spaces. One of our advantages is that although we sit in 3 different markets, those 3 markets are connected for customers. Scott mentioned earlier, how developers and IT work very well together and that continues to be a strength of our JSM and ITSM market.
Similarly, in work management, you're increasingly seeing both -- we have an advantage in customer adoption in the early phases because a lot of them come from the software and IT spaces into work management. But as we continue to grow, helping your technology teams work together with the non-technology teams and to have visibility across that where you can put on your snowflake book look under the water or you can look above the water, right? Your visibility can be across both sides of that. So I guess I'd say we're just incredibly bullish on the space. We are very strong. We have great customer reception to our Work Management market. And I think our strategy is incredibly solid as we look at the explosion of Work Management tool there. We have your next question from Rob Oliver with Baird. Great. Appreciate it. Mike, Scott, just a question for you guys around in some of the point A products. So, it's just a good buzz at demand and to be around Atlas and do the workflow collab and just confluence as well. I just wanted to get a sense for what you guys are seeing there? It seems like a lot of the activity is still on the free trial side, which is what sort of interest from customers? And then also how you see partners, your partners fitting into that equation and as forward starts to work up to scale. Yes. Good. I think there were 2 questions in there, Rob. So I might take it separately, if that's all right. On the point, I'll take point A first and then I'll slide forward to second and then maybe Scott can add on if I miss anything. Look, on point A, incredibly positive reception from Team '22, I will say. It was the first sort of outing for Atlas and Compass both of which have similar goals in terms of helping people work differently together and providing that aggregation layer and a lot of different areas in a very innovative way. So both comes on the technology side. And Atlas on the broader cost company user work team help directory level, very, very positive reception to both.
So now it's the hard grind of doing what we do, which is working with those customers, seeing adoption, learning from their activity and also working with them and collaborating with them, as we said, in the point A program that's one of our strengths. That's where we can put R&D expertise our together with our customers centricity and really build truly differentiated products that have a long-term focus. We also shipped Jira product discovery at Team '22. So that's us getting more into the creative discovery spaces at the start of the software processes. That also had great reception. Sometimes gets missed, but the executive team is doing an amazing job.
And again, bolstering out the Jira product family and getting more into the discovery and creative parts of the engineering cycle is a new space for us with a lot of partners and also with our own product. So that's what we said we're going to do, as we've talked about pointed A repeatedly here. On the Forge side of things, look, customers continue to be very happy with Forge. Forge again is our extensibility framework that allows customers and partners to build apps, integrations extensions that run in our infrastructure. And the latter part is really key there. It's what makes it differentiated against almost any SaaS-based extensibility framework out there. It means that if you have data residency requirements, compliance requirements, security requirements, you run in our infrastructure, even the third-party apps or your customer written extensions, the customers write them for themselves. That runs in our infrastructure.
One of the things customers like the most about it is we provide the servers and everything else to run. So they just focus on writing the extension, writing the integration they need. We handle all of the running and keep the compliance and security requirements talking about the run of data. That saves them a lot of time. It's a much higher ROI sensibility method than having to run their own servers and maintain them and operate them and keep them running, et cetera so. Look, it's going very well so far. We continue to invest in Forge in improving every single quarter. You can see it's got quite a rapid pace of innovation and incremental improvement. And so Team '22 has a great chance to chat with a lot of our vendors and customers about what they want to see next and continue to build better. We have your next question from Ari Terjanian with Cleveland Research. Congrats on the great results. Just had a question regarding the CTO transition. Obviously, a ton of great progress the last few years scaling the cloud products, addressing different regulations and compliance needs. What do you view as the main things that Rajiv will be working on over the next couple of years as CTO of Atlassian. Yes. Thanks, super excited about Rajiv coming on board. I've personally been leading that search for a long while, and incredibly excited to get in to start, starts in a few weeks and to share that all with you. Very sad to see Sri go, but happy we'll have an overlap between the 2. So there'll be a smooth handoff of the baton there. And I think our engineering teams will be -- continue to be incredibly well led in that way. In terms of goals, still abstract, but at a high level, obviously, as we've communicated to you at Team '22, we are investing very much so in ourselves. That results in scaling the company up, adding thousands and thousands of new employees, tens of thousands of new employees. Obviously, given our model, significant numbers, this will be in engineering, in R&D and design, continuing to keep our world-class R&D team and the efficiency of that, continuing innovation. That's a nontrivial exercise.
This is not just something that continues to be exactly the same as we go through levels of scale that continues to have to be adapted, restructured, we thought and a lot of different processes and human factors, right, in terms of how we continue to make Atlassian a fantastic place for engineers to come and do the best work of their lives. That's obviously going to be a big part of Rajiv's goals over the next few years. He's handling that scale and continuing to make that the case as well as all the things that we are working on in terms of continuing to improve and deepen our cloud, enterprise compliance, scale, performance, all of those types of things.
So no shortage of challenges and growth opportunities ahead, and that's largely what will be working on continuing to bolster the identity of Atlassian engineering is being world-class as we scale [indiscernible]. I should also point out he has pretty big shoes to fill, obviously, of Sri who has taken us from 400-odd engineers to thousands and thousands of engineers, got us into the cloud, built a world-class cloud platform and scale of infrastructure as well as built a fantastic leadership team. So Sri's leadership team remains in place, Rajiv has some pretty big shoes to fill to continue the growth trajectory that should have set a motion. We have your next question from Stephen Koenig with SMBC. This is Owen Haworth on for Steve. Congrats on nice quarter. I'm wondering if you can rank the buying motions for Jira Service Management at this stage today. Is it more a greenfield customers that don't have a service test for the line of business with an organization standing something else maybe in tandem with their enterprise standard or organizations coming to you looking to make a larger scale replacement. And then -- and with that, to what extent are you getting into ServiceNow accounts, even when ServiceNow is already largely an enterprise standard. And if I can sneak 1 quick one in. I believe Jira Software Confluence and Trello has been the most common land products today in the cloud. Is JSM trending up in the mix of lands? Or is it more commonly an expansion? This is Cameron. I think I can address all of that. So first off, Jira Service Management, who's buying it -- you got -- we're going with 40,000 customers. We have small customers, midsize and large. On the small size, very much we're replacing e-mail and spreadsheets. There might be 1 or 2 people in IT. They're handling the e-mail, then they needed to get a little bit more mature. And actually, this is one of the great things we offer 3 agents for free with Jira Service Management. So it's actually a great pipeline into those small businesses. You're a small business, you need an IT service management, IT help desk solution, you get a free 1 from us. And as you grow your IT department, you can turn to paying customers. So that's [indiscernible] on the very small size.
In the midsize, there's a variety of different vendors or established different solutions out there, but we continue to see that with those organizations, the core value prop of, hey, these are your development teams, your engineers and your IT departments, your operators, your IT help desk people working closer together in the future. If so, they're looking to a single platform to solve the needs and connect those teams. And Jira software and Jira Service Management is that kind of perfect unification for many of those midsized customers and very much a sweet spot of Atlassian. In the enterprise, our complete strategy, what we're seeing is very much go in there and knowing that most will have at least 1 or multiple different IT platforms that they're running.
Our goal there is very much to leverage, find departments, teams and so on that have bought into the fact that they need to move -- their engineering teams need to move nimbly with their IT organizations. We see different things like security teams or small security areas in these large organizations and we come in and we largely get small little beachheads where organizations want to move very, very quickly.
From that, we absolutely start seeing when the big renewals come up for the big platforms, of which there are a few out there. We tend to have -- we increasingly have a seat at the table and have those conversations. Additionally, what Atlassian has been able to do over the last few years, outside of just beyond IT service management is really establish our enterprise credibility. We have executive advisory boards. We have many CIO councils. So the good part is now those top leaders who are making those big platform decisions, we have relationships with and they understand that this is very much an area that we can support for them going forward. So we're very much in the game incredible there, plenty of enterprise customers to go after.
Your next question is which customers, which products are we landing with, which one are we expanding with. I'll be the ones that you called out were very much the products we land with. And Jira Service Management, we are still very much going after the current existing customer base. But that said, it's not with the software development teams and the existing customer base. We need to find those IT departments of those IT use cases. And that's where we turn on a lot of the marketing machine to drive that awareness. But today, we still very much consider Jira Service Management focused at our very large existing customer base. We have your next question from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. It's great to be a first-time participant on your earnings conference call. Congratulations on everything that you've accomplished. I'm curious to get to your perspective on how the platform evolves. Certainly, there is a merit to be exposed and having the 3 pillars, your DevOps, ITES and work management, be interconnected from a market perspective and also have a technology platform that brings it all together. At the same time, how do you weigh that against the innovation in each of these pockets still going through a pretty rapid cycles you've got best-of-breed companies that you probably run into or maybe don't at the high of these markets. So these markets are still going through a period of growth and not yet at maturity.
So how do you trade off having to bring together these disparate markets and products under the cloud unification, which is a different challenge versus actually horizontal challenges as oppose to vertically scaling these products and still keeping up with all the cutting edge features. How do you weigh these 2 things because the market does not look like it is settled, it's entering a next generational shift, if you will, right? And from a financial question, James, I know this is probably the last couple of quarters or so. As the dust settles on the migration, how do we think about the longer-term structural growth of your end markets in Atlassian as well? Yes, Kash, welcome. Welcome to the investment call. It's a hell of a set of questions you've got there. Let me start with the platform, and I'll leave to answer the finance question in a second. I think first, a few comments. Our platform enables us to be best-of-breed in each of our 3 markets and to do so efficiently. So we definitely don't think about ourselves as competing against best of breed. We are the best of breed in each of the markets that we participate in and intend to continue to do so. And the platform allows us to do that with efficiency and scale as well as preparing for the future. So a few ways it does that. We are able to be best of breed in ITSM and in Azure DevOps because of the investments we make in and are driven by the work management as a singular example because we can afford to build an absolutely world-class tech editing environment, which is a very nontrivial exercise and then run that across a series of different markets.
Now a single competitor in a single market in this space can't afford to do that. You can look at that in reverse. If you go to the bottom of the staff in terms of infrastructure, the same thing occurs in terms of compliance, enterprise, scale. The SaaS world is increasingly difficult as every geography around the world passes new laws and new rules about how data needs to be stored for certain industry types, et cetera. That's a very nontrivial exercise to serve those enterprise customers and different global geographic customers in different ways. Putting all of that into the platform allows us to have that across all our markets and spaces, allows point A products, they're shipping in new and innovative areas to have all of that enterprise and compliance support.
And similarly, as the markets change, we talked about the future, our platform is a very long-term investment, not just because it takes a long time to build a really world-class platform. But as we look at the future, we believe there will be more compliance, will be more Cambrian explosion of different SaaS apps are focused on integration and bringing them together. Our platform is hard to build. It's also very hard to replicate. So we believe it's a huge competitive advantage in each of our spaces. As you've mentioned, it obviously helps us bring the spaces together. You can see that in our Atlassian data lake and Atlassian analytics tools that we shipped on top of the platform at Team '22, enabling us to take data from disparate applications and bring them together for customers in a way that they couldn't have done beforehand, and they can't do.
We're also focused on building out in the platform the stuff that doesn't change. I think Jeff Bezos once famously said that he was more focused on the things that wouldn't change in 10 years than the things that would change, and it's a really interesting philosophy. What doesn't change is the collaboration. Teams and people are going to need to come together in each of these 3 markets to really be efficient and that desire for efficiency [indiscernible] continue to go up. And so collaboration is going to become ever more important a team of anywhere world, where people are distributed. Our collaboration tooling is largely built in the platform.
So you can see this in commentary and reactions and sharing, notifications and search and all the different bits and pieces of bringing data together, connecting it, linking it and then connecting with colleagues and people that collaboration being built in the platform is a huge competitive advantage, I believe, for Atlassian in each of our markets and then even more so when you start putting the market together collectively. So we've tried to talk about this for many, many quarters. It's an area that I think is a huge trend of Atlassian, and you'll see us continue to invest in the platform going forward. I am showing no further questions at this time. Presenters, please continue for any closing remarks. So I think, James will finish up. Yes, let me just jump in to add to that last question. Just very briefly. Good to hear from you again, Kash. A number of things. In your question, you kind of alluded to the end of migrations, if you will. The first point I'd want to make is just to reemphasize something that we mentioned earlier, is that, yes, the server customers will make their move in the next couple of years. But we're very encouraged by how many of the data center customers are again continue to be moving to the cloud already that 1/3 of migrations to the cloud coming from data center. Beyond that, more generally, we are addressing very large total addressable markets. We went into some detail at Analyst Day on this topic. And for the TAM that just represents our current products that's of the scale of around $29 billion, well, less than 10% of that today.
I think the theme of digital transformation is very real for companies all around the world, and we are exceptionally well placed to continue to address customers' needs in this regard. And we are going to invest so that we can drive more value for our customers in these different ways in which we're very well equipped to do. And that is going to help continue to spur our growth rate over the long run. We'll be disciplined about how we invest. We always are. But that will be an important theme for our growth rate. And then just the last thing I'd say is the top of the Atlassian funnel, we talk about a net new customer count each quarter. It's always in the thousands of customers. And we land small and expand very significantly over time. And I think the net expansion rate number that we indicated at Investor Day 3 weeks ago of 130%, in fact, it's 140% for our larger customers is just a great illustration of how we gradually get larger and larger in terms of what we do for our customers. And I think that altogether gives us a lot of runway for long-term growth. I'm showing no further questions at this time, presenters. Please continue for any closing remarks. Thank you everyone for joining our call today. Let's say particular thanks to James Beer for his partnership over the last almost 5 years with Atlassian and just congratulations on such an incredible career and wish you all the best in your retirement. And as always, like for all, everyone on the call, staff, partners, investors, everyone, thank you for all your ongoing support, and enjoy the rest of your week and your weekend. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.","this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of Atlassian's website following this call . on the call today, we have our co-founders and co-CEO, Scott Farquhar and Michael Cannon-Brookes; our Chief Financial Officer, James Beer; and our Chief Revenue Officer, Cameron Deatsch . this call will include forward-looking statements .",0.0

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of Atlassian's website following this call.
I will now hand the call over to Martin Lam Atlassian's Head of Investor Relations. Welcome to Atlassian's fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2022 earnings call. Thank you for joining us today. Joining me on the call today we have Atlassian's co-Founders and co-CEOs, Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes; and our Chief Executive Officer, Cameron Deatsch.
Earlier today we published a shareholder letter and press release with our financial results and commentary for our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2022. The shareholder letter is available on that Atlassian's Work Life blog and the Investor Relations section of our website where you will also find other earnings-related materials, including the earnings press release and supplemental investor data sheet.
As always, our shareholder weather contains management's insight and commentary for the quarter. So, during the call today we'll have a brief opening remarks and then focus our time on Q&A.
This call will include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. You should not look upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events.
Forward-looking statements represent our management's beliefs and assumptions only as of such date -- such statements were made and we assume no obligation to update or revise such statements should they change or cease to be current.
Further information on these and other factors that could affect the company's financial results is included in filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time-to-time including the section titled Risk Factors in our most recent Form 20-F and quarterly Form 6-K. During today's call we will also discuss non-IFRS financial measures. These non-IFRS financial measures are in addition to and are not a substitute for or superior to measure this financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS.
A reconciliation between IFRS and non-IFRS financial measures is available in our shareholder letter earnings release and investor data sheet on the IR website. Please keep in mind that we'd like to allow as many of you to participate in Q&A as possible. To facilitate that we'll take one question at a time. Please rejoin the queue if you have a follow-up or another question and we'll do our best to come back to you later in the session.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott for opening remarks. Thank you for joining us today. As you've already read in our shareholder letter we ended fiscal 2022 with strong Q4 results across all three of our markets: Agile and DevOps PFM and Wealth Management. Cloud revenue grew by 55% year-over-year in Q4 and ended the year with over 242000 customers. Atlassian is uniquely positioned having great momentum and a differentiated business model.
Now, while we can't predict what the future holds at a macro level we're forging ahead with conviction and vigilance as we look to continue to fuel durable growth over the long term and deepen our strategic advantages. We're incredibly proud of the way we continue to execute against our long-term goals and we're excited to take this momentum into fiscal 2023.
I'd also take the time to mention that this quarter I am operating as interim CFO. This will be my first and last earnings call as interim CFO as we welcome Joe Binz as our incoming CFO. We are so excited to bring Joe on and introduce him to you in the next earnings call next quarter.
With that, I'll pass the call to the operator for questions-and-answers. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Fatima Boolani from Citi. Please go ahead. Hey everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Just one around the cloud growth expectations for fiscal 2023 that you've reiterated which is very encouraging as well as the reiteration of the magnitude of migration impacts to that cloud growth. What I'm curious about is when you think about the fiscal 2024 dynamic which is similar to fiscal 2023, how much of the migratory impact from the prior year i.e. fiscal 2023? What type of purchasing or expansion behavior from those migrated customers are you expecting in the base in fiscal 2024? Scott here answering that question. As we mentioned previously in our Investor Day, a few months ago and reiterating now on this earnings call, we expect cloud growth to be approximately 50% year-on-year for FY 2023 and FY 2024 and so that remains the same. We've also said that there's high single-digit of that growth comes from migrations, in any given year. And so we expect again, that could continue.
We haven't looked in terms of the FY 2024 dynamic, of how that goes. What we do see though are migrating customers, expand at a similar rate to the customers we have in our existing instances. And we've also stated that previously, we have a net expansion rate of 130% in cloud, and 140% for our larger customers in cloud. And so that's all I can give you on that, at this stage. This is Martin. Just to clarify, we are expecting 10 points of growth of the 50% growth, in cloud for the next two years. Understood. Thank you, I’ll get back in the queue. Your next question comes from Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, Micheal. Hi. great. Thanks and congrats on a strong end of the fiscal year. Scott, I know we won't see it often, but nice suite photo, very CFO with the materials as well. There's a great stat, you emphasized just in the letter on 90% of fiscal year revenue coming from -- we know you've generally, always run a consistent long-term playbook. So just wondering, is that number fairly consistent with prior periods? And then on the other side of that, if we do see some moderation of the newer cohorts, are you confident that there's a catch-up for the newer cohorts you're landing, can similarly contribute to the model, as you work through it just given the experience and expertise you've gathered there? Thank you. Yes thank you for the compliments, on how good I work on the suite. I appreciate that. And you're right we won't [indiscernible] too often in the future. What we've said historically yes, that 90% of our revenue in any given year comes from our existing customers. And we were chatting just before on this call that, if you think about the results we're getting this year, they are seasonally planned years ago in the safer [ph] planting this year come to bloom in the imports.
So this is not a business where we are trying to have a very extensive enterprise sales force, to do a particular number in a particular period. We think very carefully, about the long-term return characteristics of all the investments, that we make at any point in time. And so that 90% number we continue to see that like that's not likely, to change in any particular time, but we really think about the long-term investments that we're making now, are paying off over a two- to three-year period. Thank you. Your next question comes from Arjun Bhatia from William Blair. Please go ahead, Arjun Thank you, guys for taking the question. Congrats on a great quarter. As you -- I know you guys addressed the macro a little bit in the Shareholder Letter. But I'm curious, as it relates to migration specifically, would you expect the shape of migration to change at all just given the macro situation to customers, pause a little bit do they reconsider or do they say hey the total cost of ownership is there, and I'm going to go full steam ahead? What are you seeing and hearing from partners and customers on that front? This is Cameron, and I'll take that one. So as you know, this migration journey has been going on for a couple of years now. We announced the server end of life, over 18 months ago and gave customers more than three years heads up, to make a decision on migrating to the cloud. So none of this is a surprise.
Many are in the different stages of their planning, whether that's from a technical perspective or budgetary perspective, and we are increasingly getting good at those conversations, about honestly the larger ROI savings that customers get, when they move to the cloud, whether that's reducing administrative costs, their own hardware costs and of course unlocking a ton of new innovation in our cloud.
In addition to that, we have a Forrester Total Economic Impact report, where we've actually done deep research into the overall cost savings, that customers get when they actually move to the cloud. So the short answer is, no, our migrations plans continue as planned and we are very happy with the results to date. And you saw a lot of that, in our recent Q4 results. Your next question comes from Jim Fish from Piper Sandler. Please state your question. Hey guys. This is Quinton on for Jim Fish. Thanks for taking my question. Sticking to the demand side for just a second, is there anything you can call out from a geographic perspective in terms of weakness or relative strength? Looking at the numbers here it looks like really strong growth across all geos. But wondering if there is one specific place that you're maybe keeping your eye on more than others? Thank you. Thank you, Quinn. Cameron here again. I'd say we are being exceedingly vigilant across watching all stages of our funnel, whether that's migrations funnel, the additions upgrades, retention rates and of course our new customers coming in. And this really set up with the Russia Ukraine war back starting in February. We have been keeping a very special eye in the EMEA region.
The good news as of to date is we have yet to see any specific trend geographically or even in industry segments or in customer size that gives us pause or worry to date. So something we continue to watch like a hawk, but there's no new news to share today. Your next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho. Please go ahead. Thank you very much. Congrats on a very good quarter as well. Has there been any change to the mix of products sold over the last few months? Anything different with regard to customer prioritization? And then just a quick clarification just to help everybody with their models, if I may. I believe consensus was projecting data center revenue growth somewhere in the low to mid-20s for fiscal '23. And given the comment in the Shareholder Letter about moderating growth after Q1 being somewhat vague. I'm just wondering if you're able to tell us if you're comfortable at this time with where those consensus numbers stand? Thank you. This is Cameron. I'll speak to the mix. I'll let our new interim CFO, handle the second part of that question. As far as the overall mix, no we have not seen any significant shift in customer demand across our product lines. I do have to continue to call out the strong demand, we continue to see with Jira Service Management as one of our strongest cross-sell motions surpassing 40,000 Jira Service customers to-date.
And we just seem to have struck a vein there in the market with very compelling offering that's very feature complete very easy to use, as well as highly competitive from a pricing perspective. But that -- I don't want to take away from our other products. Jira Software Confluence, Trello you name it, continue to see strong demand across the board.
As we continue to see people embracing digital transformation and needing tools to help, [indiscernible] take these large technical projects that they're running and our tools help manage those projects throughout, as well as this cultural transformation. We continue to see as all of us are figuring out this new way of working whether it's remote back in the office or hybrid. We continue to see demand for collaboration products that continue to be strong. And the second half to Scott there. Yes, just to your question around DC shape of revenue. Again, just a reminder for those people new to the story we have end-of-life our server offerings. And so they have to make a choice whether they move to our cloud directly or if they're longer process or a longer timeframe, they're not choose to data center as a step starting to moving to cloud.
And so, we've been really happy again with our migration and actually happy about 1/3 of our migrations come. We said that at our Investor Day about 1/3 of our migrations come from the data center customers already. And so, we really starting in all directions it towards cloud.
Now specifically in our Shareholder Letter, we highlighted in terms of the data center revenue maintaining high growth through Q1 before moderating over the remaining three quarters. And we can't give any sort of more details on that, but really that's just to give you into the seasonality that we might see over the next four quarters in terms of how we think those migrations might end up happening. Yes, thank you. Your next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies. Brent, please state your question. This is Luv Sodha on for Brent Thill. Wanted to ask a real quick question on margins this quarter. It looks like there was an increase in investment in R&D. And it sounds like you're planning to continue that into the next year. Could you maybe give us some color into where these investments are being directed to? Thank you. Yes. Thanks for that question. If we -- sort of starting at our Investor Day we had a discussion with you our shareholders about the incredible opportunities we are seeing across our business. And those opportunities they're kind of in every corner of the business. And as a management team we think long-term. And we think about, how do we, invest behind those opportunities.
And the myriad of them, but a couple we've highlighted in the past are our customers migrating to the cloud. We're seeing incredible demand for that migration. And if we can improve the throughput of those customers migrating to the cloud that's great for them and it's great for us. We've also seen incredible demand for our ITSM products in that market.
And again, there are some features we can add there and getting our customers onboarded to those products and great for us and for them. And I can go on. But as a result of all these opportunities we made a decision to invest heavier behind these opportunities than we had before.
And then, we said in our Investor Day that, we expect margins for FY 2023 to be in the mid-teens. And so those areas of investments are as you mentioned are largely in R&D. We are sort of really seeing huge investments there because of the features and getting our cloud to the stage where we can accommodate 100% of our customers require some more features.
You will also see some investments turn in other areas of the P&L, because for example they are some handholding to get our customers across that doesn't show in R&D as well as it shows up in other areas in the P&L. So largely R&D but you may see some other areas of P&L impacted just to the way that we're helping our customers migrate. Perfect. Thank you. Your next question comes from Alex Zukin from Wolfe Research. Alex, state your question. Perfect. Thanks so much and congrats on a great quarter. I guess, maybe just two from our side. When you think about the macro impact that you are seeing in the business, I think you called out slightly slower conversion of free customers to paid customers.
I guess when you dissect what's happening in the pipeline, why do you think that's the only macro impact you're seeing versus migration delays or versus longer sales cycles and the larger customers?
Or we're not seeing kind of some of the other impacts and other companies are seeing. Is it -- like what are you learning in real time as you analyze the data in the demand environment? And then I've got a quick follow-up. Yeah, I can cover that first piece. This is Cameron again. So as you mentioned and you see this in our Q4 results, across the many funnels we operate whether that's our migrations, our additions upgrades, our cross-sell of products, our overall retention continues to be exceedingly strong.
And that's been great to see. And that's been supporting our net expansion rate we've already discussed on this call here. And largely what you see is existing customers continue to have demand for what our products do to help their teams work more productively in the future. As far as that slight thing that we mentioned in the Shareholder Letter just so you all realize that we land all of our net new customers in free plans.
And this is relatively -- we're about two years into this experience, but we continue to have many, many, many thousands of customers signing up in free plans and they either need to add an 11th user which then they had a pay to get the 11th user or simply they want more premium capabilities in our standard and premium additions. Those are the reasons people enter their credit card.
And the one thing that's worth calling out, that we've seen literally just in the last month is that the cohort of customers that came in the April, May and June timeframe are converting to those paid plans at a slightly slower rate than what we've seen in previous quarters.
Now I'd love to say that's specific to a product, or a geography, or an industry. There's no specific customer segment there. It just seems that in general those cohort of customers have been signing up in the last quarter are using the products they're activating, they're getting value but they simply just haven't put those credit cards and hit those paid walls yet.
So that's one of those areas that we continue to be vigilant. We have multiple analytics teams multiple growth teams as well as our onboarding and R&D teams that are focused on ensuring that those customers remain active.
And it gives us more chances to convert them to paid plans in the future. That does not take away from the continued growth we see in our existing customer base, that also drives more than 90% of our revenue in the existing year. Perfect. And I guess maybe just going back to the data center part of your business, the extraordinary growth that you're seeing I think accelerating growth in the quarter. How much of that growth is from data center customers expanding versus understanding what the existing customers are growing like within data center to get a sense of the growth that you're seeing in data center coming from server migration to data center? In addition and I apologize for the multipart question, just the range of migration activity from data center to cloud versus server to cloud in that 10 points of migration as a driver for the 50% cloud growth. Got you. I think I can address that. So overall data center demand, I'll hit that first and then we can talk about the server to cloud or data center to cloud journey. So as we've already mentioned this server end-of-life message we give customers more than three years, heads up. And what you see customers doing every quarter is increasingly optioning out of going to cloud, which obviously that's where we lead with. That's where we have been putting all of our incentives to get customers to go to the cloud, so they get as most innovation as possible or they can choose data center.
And many are seeing either way it's an increased investment and commitment to Atlassian long term. And we see that those are two good decisions for customers. However, when those customers jump the data center and we see this again and again, they're seeing that as just a stepping stone to that cloud journey. But it gives them more optionality down the time and of course data center is a fantastic product.
So we've historically said, it's roughly 30% of our cloud migrations come from data center customers, which proves that stepping stone statement. And I don't, specifically know how much that drives into the overall 10% growth that we've shown that drives our overall cost growth but you can see roughly a third of our customers are coming from data center. That's all I have to share. Scott, do you have anything to add on that? Okay. Your next question comes from Adam Tindle from Raymond James. Adam, please state your question. Okay. Thank you very much. I just wanted to touch on the investment period and operating margin trends. You talked about mid-teens in fiscal 2023 playing offense. I think you said lower in the second half of the year. I'm wondering if that's indicative of a multiyear period of investment here. You certainly earn the right to invest based on what we've seen so far. I just wanted to level set investor expectations since I think Street is modeling improvement in fiscal 2024. I'm not sure if that's consistent with how you're thinking about things. Thank you. Thank you, Adam. Just remind to everyone we said back at our Investor Day, which is Atlassian has an incredible business model. And if you look historically over the arctic time, before being a public company and during the seven years we've been a public company, this business model does generate a large amount of free cash flow and margin returns. And so that's sort of the fundamentals that we have in the business.
And if we look at the long-term opportunities like they are more abundant than we've ever seen before and that's the reason to invest. Now on your specific investment period, what we've said is that FY 2023 is going through investment year and we guided to the mid-teens margins for FY 2023. We haven't given any guidance for FY 2024 and we'll be doing that at the end of FY 2023. Your next question comes from Peter Lee [ph] from Bernstein. Peter, go ahead. Thank you. So taking a look at kind of your overall migration plan. I think you had originally anticipated maintenance shrinking down a little bit more than maybe it's seen now and you're talking about a year from now getting to $75 million which I think was maybe a little bit of a slower ramp than at least I had been anticipating. How are you seeing that roll off of your existing customer base? Has it been stickier? And is it something where you're having to spend more time and effort encouraging customers to migrate? And how do you see that affecting the curiosity of the cloud migration itself? Yes, this is Cameron again. As we mentioned, migration demand remains very strong. And that server customer base, they effectively have until February of 2024 to make a decision on where they want to option out whether it's going to data center or whether that's going to cloud. Obviously, we continue to remove any blockers or any reasons why customers would not adopt our cloud and we give people plenty of incentives along the way to move to our cloud offerings.
The good news across the board is we continue to see retention rates maintain high for the existing the entire server customer base throughout this. So as we continue to see server renewals happen, we see people option out the data center and cloud. The good part there is we continue to see these customers continue to remain in their loyal to Atlassian and largely they're figuring out what the best technical and decision long-term is for their companies. We have been focusing on cloud. And as we've already mentioned, we are largely in line with our migration plans to date. So we'll continue to be vigilant there over the next year, as we continue to incentivize our customers to choose cloud. And I think you've been investing in some cloud migration personnel. Do you see that being kind of like fully built out, or are you seeing that you're going to have to continue to expand that personnel to see the success through? This is Cameron again. Yeah, so we have a dedicated cloud migration management and migration support engineers as long -- as well as a dedicated migration tooling and a variety of people that can come and help these customers through the more technical migrations. We did make significant investments in the previous fiscal year across those teams and we believe they are fairly stable to date and can handle the volume that's coming in over the next coming quarters. Thank you. Your next question comes from Steven Koenig from SMBC Nikko. Steven, please go ahead. Great. Hey, thanks a lot for taking my question. So let's see I'm wondering regarding your hiring and you're investing that you've been talking about. Your comments on your plans to hire are certainly borne out by your -- as we look at your job postings there remaining pretty solid whereas a lot of other vendors are cutting their hiring plans. I'm wondering how is your hiring progressing relative to plan in terms of your progress in finding the talent that you want? And then if I can just add a quick addendum. Any tactical pricing adjustments of note since your February 15 price increase on server on data center. And that's all for me. Thanks very much and congrats on a great quarter. Hey, Steve, it's Mike here. I can take that. And then be getting a lot of product questions on today's call. So let me jump in and take one of the talent ones. Look we've been pretty clear right that we're playing offense. We continue to tell that quarter in quarter out. We're using this period of time to deepen our strategic position and increase the advantages we have over the competition, right? There's less -- they say that they would go as cash funding competition. And so, we think we have a really good opportunity going forward. We also have spent a lot of time retooling our hiring pipeline over the last two years and are really, really excited with where we stand at the moment. So we've had I believe our two biggest quarters of hiring in the last two quarters and we continue to do so.
Obviously, we don't just look at the volume multipliers or that's sort of an absolute number marker. We continue to push quality of the talent that's available and we think that that will get easier in difficult circumstances. And also, obviously making sure that the cultural fit and other things that are in which is incredibly important and incredibly difficult and a huge challenge for us to do as we continue to scale. There's no doubt as Scott mentioned, the majority of that hiring is going to R&D to try to again deepen those strategic positions that we already have.
The last thing I would say is just a reminder that we made the same or similar sort of play in the 2008, 2009 period. We paused for a little while then and then we realized that we were in a very strong position as a company relative to other companies out there. And so we hired well through that period and we saw the benefits of that for the three, four and five years afterwards as we've got a real updraft with the products coming out and the results of this product. So we believe we have massive opportunities in front of us in all three of our markets. And as such we're hiring behind them. That's great. Can you guys comment on any pricing actions of note say in the last six months since the February price increase? Yeah. So this is Cameron. As you already mentioned, we did have price increases on our server and data center products in February. All of our pricing changes are made public and we -- across the board and they're all available on our websites for all of our customers, as well as we give our customers a relatively decent heads up on these price changes so they can plan their budgets accordingly. No other price changes to mention and our pricing strategy remains consistent. Great. Great. Well, thanks very much for the color. Your next question comes from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Keith. Thank you for taking the question. This is Sanjit Singh for Keith. Somewhat annoying, we had another question on sort of the case for investment. As you sort of look at where the business stands today, you have a $3 billion business, you have 0.25 million customers, I think 10-plus monthly active users.
And if you look at sort of where you're trying to take the business, getting to one million customers, 100 million monthly active users, expanding from developers and IT to line of business teams, with the work management initiatives.
As you expand into these newer markets and this longer tail of customers, are the unit economics from here going to be as attractive versus what the business has built today to get to this $3 billion and 0.75 million customers?
I was wondering, if you could just sort of frame out how you think expanding into these -- into the longer tail of users and customers and product markets. What does that do to the sort of unit economics of the business? Sure. Mike, I can take that again. Look, I think obviously we feel bullish about our unit economics at the moment. And I don't see why that would change going forward. And we've always been very prudent stewards of capital in the business and continue to invest in very high ROI opportunities as we look forward.
You mentioned some of our numbers there. Obviously, there are millions and millions and millions of businesses in the world. There are around or approximately one billion knowledge workers. So we have a huge amount of expansion possibility, even just inside our existing customers.
As Cameron mentioned earlier, we remain north of 130% in our NER numbers and north of 140% in the large customer segment and we saw that again this quarter. And so, from the point of view of expansion in those large customers, we have many, many millions of employees that we do not touch in those existing customers.
And you see that in -- specifically in our Work Management segment where Trello, Confluence and Atlas are continuing to get further and further into an organization and look more to the wall-to-wall access to water all employees within those companies.
I think the other thing I would say is that, we continue to, as Cameron mentioned earlier, be incredibly focused on not just the unit economics of our funnel, the product where the growth funnel in terms of free and our evaluations and trials and we're obviously incredibly well instrumented there and we really understand the value of spending a dollar on marketing or sales and the conversion rate of expansion through our customer base.
We've got 20 years of experience doing this. I believe we're absolutely best-in-class and continue to improve and evolve every single year. We also are really, really good at the enterprise and premium expansion activities when it comes to bringing in more human power and more activity to expand customers across the product set.
And again, we've got a whole lot of new products coming out, but also the same focus on being very, very capital efficient when it comes to those sales motions. We don't just take it in the automated product-led growth funnel, we take it at the same time in all of our sales activities. We're very proud of how we do that and we have to keep raising the bar on that every year. I don't think, long term, it should change the unit economics. Really appreciate the thoughts and congrats on the great data center and cloud subscription results this quarter. Thank you. Your next question comes from Ari Terjanian from Cleveland Research. Ari, please go ahead. Hi, team. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the great results. I just want to double-click on the Deutsche Bank cloud deal that was called out in the press release or the Shareholder Letter. I was just hoping if you could provide some more detail on that opportunity. Is that migration complete, or is it just the signing?
And what do you think caused them to pull the trigger, because I know regulated industries, banking, Germany, Europe these are areas that had historically more hesitant to move to cloud. So just wondering if you could please provide some more color on that deal and if you think it could be a beachhead and cause others in these geos and verticals to start moving. Thank you. Yes. So, Cameron, again. Yes, I was deeply involved with Deutsche Bank for quite some time. In fact, they've been a customer for many years. They have been a data center customer for many years. And we've been speaking about the cloud opportunity and journey with them for quite some time.
But it shows, I think, you nailed it right there, its German bank highly regulated, massive scale like you name it from a requirements perspective they had it for our cloud. And it's a testament to the investments we've made over the last couple of years and performance and scale in regulated things like band fees, specific financial services regulation requirements in Germany that allowed us to open up that door and have that serious conversation about getting them to the cloud.
To answer your question no, we have just started the cloud journey. We've largely -- they checked all the boxes to get them to adopt our cloud and we've started our migration planning so just begin moving their users and data. And that will be a multi-month or multi-quarter journey the size of deployment and complexity that they have as well as how mission-critical applications are for the bank.
I mean they literally are running on us every single day. Many of our customers are saying that our applications are more important than e-mail for getting their work done inside the organization. So it's something that we have to plan out very diligently with them, but they've been incredible partners throughout this exploration of cloud and we are looking forward to having them 100% on the cloud in the upcoming quarters. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Fred Havemeyer from Macquarie. Fred, please go ahead. Hi. Thank you. I wanted to ask about your net retention rate because throughout this year you've been posting or discussing strong 130% rather north of 130% cloud net retention rates. I saw in the Shareholder Letter today that you noted that larger customers were topping 140% cloud net or rather net expansion rate.
So I wanted to ask can you help to characterize what's driving that? Is that something that is a seat-based expansion a cross-sell or upsell reach into non-technical departments expansion with new technical departments? Anything to kind of characterize that can help us understand where this growth is coming from would be greatly appreciated. Fred, appreciate asking the question. Yes the numbers you quoted are correct and I think we've stated in our -- from our Investor Day last year and reiterated some of them in our Shareholder Letter today.
Now if you think about Atlassian's business model it has been historically and continues to be a land and expand motion where we land inside a part of an organization maybe a small team a couple of different teams or even multiple teams across the organization that maybe aren't even coordinated with each other.
And from there they see the incredible value in our products and they expand on a number of vectors. And those vectors are -- they've been a number of seats maybe starting with one small team all the way up until large enterprise deployments such like Deutsche Bank that we talked about with tens of thousands of seats. And so there's a seat aspect where you land and expand there.
We also see that customers expand on a product basis. So they start with one product they then to the value that they've got they come back to Atlassian and discover what other products that we have that can do solve their problems and how well do these products work together, particularly, in cloud where they're deeply integrated. And so that's another one.
We have different additions now with premium and enterprise. And so customers love the functionality and they want to unlock additional functionality in the products. And so they're willing to pay for our premium and enterprise versions as well. I can go on but one I want to touch on is also our third-party application marketplace. We have one of the best marketplaces in enterprise software and customers can easily adopt incremental functionality or whole new areas of functionality in our marketplace.
And so we see expansion across all of those vectors in various ways. And there's not typically one specific part that we see our customers take, but we're very comfortable and feel very great about that going forward given how sticky our products are and how much additional functionality they can unlock across the organization once they start becoming a customer. Thank you. If I can get another one in here it wouldn't you take up more time. I wanted to also ask about scaling. Because in the Shareholder Letter today I think you also noted that 35,000 user cloud instances are now available to your entire customer base. And if I recall getting to that scale has been a journey and looking across the market some of the other project management tools that are out there have some difficulties really achieving scale for large non-current users.
So I wanted to ask what has that journey been like? And generally what does it take to build such a highly scalable collaborative live project management tool? And would you view that as a competitive moat? Sure. I can take that question. It's Mike here. Look, there's data testament to R&D teams and specifically the infrastructural engineering teams there in terms of scaling our offerings in the cloud. There's a few things I would point to there. So a reminder for anyone listening. With a single instance of Jira Software in the case that you mentioned there we started our cloud journey at about, I think 1,000 or 2,000 seat range. We expanded to five then to 10. I think we've ended 25 and now we've just 35 and I believe we have 50,000 in early access program. So, continuing to scale a single instance of Jira Software.
At the same time, we've scaled multiple other parts of our back-end infrastructure to allow further increase beyond that amount in a single Jira Software instance. So you see that in our enterprise addition where you get unlimited instances. So you can have lots of 35,000 user instances at the moment. And obviously from an identity and scaling perspective you can go beyond there.
I would say, it's really a testament to our continued investment in our customers and the continued world-leading amount of revenue that we spend on R&D because this stuff is hard. It's just one of those problems that's very difficult. You need a lot of hard work and discipline over a long period of time to continue to work out what parts of the infrastructure are scaling and continue to obviously be ambitious and push that to upwards. We have many, many customers' on-premise and data center who were well beyond the 35,000 limits. So you won't see us stop there. We'll continue to push that limit higher and higher as we work with those larger customers.
Lastly I would say it's a testament to the platform that we've built because most of that scaling doesn't actually happen in the Jira Software world. It happens in the Atlassian cloud platform in our infrastructure layers below that everything from the networking layer all the way through to databases various shared services we have et cetera all have the scale to handle that, whether it's serving videos or whether it's mentioning users. Collaborative software is all about connecting with other people on your team.
So if you mentioned the user and it takes an awfully long time, it's a very poor customer experience you get low customer satisfaction. So it's not just about scaling the sheer numbers that's making sure that all the user experiences happen at scale very, very fast. And there's a huge amounts of smarts in AI and machine learning for example to make sure that when you mention a user, we dig across your 35,000 employees and find the exact person that you're trying to find with a couple of key strokes as fast as we can. So look we spend awful lot of time and effort on that and we'll continue to do so probably reflected in our MER and great cloud numbers and more to come. Your next question comes from Kash Rangan from Goldman Sachs. Kash, please go ahead. Hi, thank you very much. I wanted to say congratulations on the quarter, but [Indiscernible] a terrific executive. On that thought, how comfortable are you with the new CFO of Joe's caliber coming in, that you have reset the margins and that we can be very comfortable that you have factored in all possible investments in the company needs to make to achieve this cloud transition? Because I would imagine that our new CFO coming in probably wants to ensure that the Street is level set with respect to margin guide because you have a bag of Microsoft and cloud transition. So I'm just wondering how did Joe get comfortable with the level of investments that have already been spoken for and guided into the model? That's it for me. Thank you very much and congratulations. Thank you. This is Scott here. I'll answer that. Mike and I have been around for 20 years running -- last year we just celebrated our 20th anniversary in the last few months. And we've been public for seven years. And whilst each individual CFO coming into Atlassian brings a whole bunch of their experience and their opinions around how it should work, the philosophy about how we run the business and how we set guidance and how we interact with you our shareholders in an open and transparent way that is really set from mine at the top. And so, we're really excited for Joe to get here with his deep experience with Microsoft to we know they had their own cloud transition. But I don't expect there to be any material changes to the way we guide, to the way we invest and the way we interact with our shareholders as a result of that. And I'm super excited to have Joe on board. He's going to be a great addition to the team. I'm early excited about his ability to help us allocate capital across the amazing opportunities that we have in front of us. And that's really, really exciting, given he's done that extremely well at his previous positions. Your next question comes from Michael Turits from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Michael, please go ahead. Hi. This is Billy on for Michael. Thanks for taking the question. Can you just give us an update on the regulatory work you've been doing around the public sector, FedRAMP and maybe different industry verticals? And how much opportunity, you think is out there once you unlock these events? This is Cameron. I can speak briefly to that. So as we mentioned before, over the last couple of years, actually many years with our cloud platform, we continue to invest in, not just scale, as Mike just mentioned, but all of the regulatory data and compliance requirements that our very, very diverse customer base has. And in that we've been able to knock-off these cloud requirements, and you see this every single quarter and every single quarter as we announce these new capabilities, a new cohort of customers gets unlocked to start their cloud transition.
In addition to that, we do publish all of our future-looking roadmap in this area, up on our public cloud roadmap. And that gives just increasing confidence for our customers, so that they can plan ahead as well as engage with our teams on when they should actually start their migration journey. And that's been a critical part of our overall conversation going forward. So, we've done in the last just 12 months, HIPAA, Banfi, we have all of our SOI compliance and we continue to have additional requirements across the board, and we are continuing to our work on FedRAMP.
Our federal customer base is significant and we do have customers across the federal customer base, all on server and data center today. Great part there is, although, only majority of those agencies actually have cloud-first mandates, like all of them are simply looking for the ability to go to cloud and we continue to invest in our cloud platform to hit up those specific requirements. But it doesn't stop with FedRAMP, there's still many other specific industry-related regulatory efforts that we will continue to invest in.
In addition to that, I do want to call out our Forge platform, which was our new capability to allow Marketplace apps to be run within the Atlassian cloud infrastructure. This has opened up even more opportunity for our customers to build and deploy apps as well as our Marketplace partners to build out and have them basically secured within the cloud platform, giving our customers even more confidence, if they're in highly regulated industries. Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to Mike for closing remarks. Thanks everyone. Just thank you for joining the call. Two small things before we sign-off here. Firstly, congratulations to Scott on his interim CFO role. I think he's done a fine job today. We're super excited to have Joe join to take the wheel. Barrowing any emergencies we look forward to him joining us on our October call.
Secondly, as you saw in our Shareholder Letter, building on the success of the theme 2022 earlier last quarter, we'll be holding unique events now tailored to each of our markets. So, we'll kick things off in September, on the 29th of September in San Francisco in the Chase Center with a Work Management specific event, that we're calling Work Life. So please come check it out and see how teams can work differently together.
With that, thank you everyone for joining our call today. As always, we really appreciate all of your continued support and thoughtful questions. And last but definitely not least, thank you to all the Atlassians on a fantastic year. We will talk to you next quarter.",this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of Atlassian's website following this call . this call will include forward-looking statements . a reconciliation between IFRS and non-IFRS financial measures is available in our shareholder letter .,1.0

As always, our shareholder letter contains management’s insight and commentary for the quarter. So during the call today, we will have brief opening remarks and then focus our time on Q&A.
This call will include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions. If any such risks or uncertainties materialize or if any of the assumptions prove incorrect, our results could differ materially from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements we make.
You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Forward-looking statements represent our management’s beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise such statements should they change or cease to be current.
Further information on these and other factors that could affect our financial results is included in filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time-to-time, including the section titled Risk Factors in our most recently filed annual and quarterly reports.
During today’s call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are in addition to and are not a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is available in our shareholder letter, earnings release and investor data sheet on the IR website.
Please keep in mind that we would like to allow as many of you to participate in Q&A as possible. To facilitate that, we will take one question at a time. Please rejoin the queue if you have another question or a follow-up and we will do our best to come back to you later in the session.
With that, I will turn the call over to Scott for opening remarks. Thank you for joining us today. We are proud of our execution in Q1 against our long-term initiatives. We announced a new subscription offering in Atlassian Together, launched Atlas into general availability and held Work Life, our first large-scale customer event focused on a single market.
As you have already read in our shareholder letter, Atlassian is not immune to the broader, macroeconomic environment, but we remain steadfast in our conviction that we have the right leaders, products and strategies in place to capitalize on incredible long-term opportunities in front of us.
Turbulent markets provide an opportunity to shake up the leaderboards and we are poised to pay offense. We will focus our investments to take share and strengthen our market position in this environment.
We will, of course, balance our continued investments with the overall growth of our business and be responsive to the macroeconomic conditions. We continue to have line of sight to $10 billion in annual revenue and believe we will come out of this environment in a much stronger market position.
I am incredibly thrilled to pass the CFO baton to Joe Binz, who I want to welcome to his inaugural Atlassian earnings call. He’s only been here since early September, but has quickly gotten up to speed and will do far better than me in my short stint as interim CFO.
With that, I will pass the call to the Operator for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. I guess kind of a topline and the bottomline question. You guys mentioned in the shareholder letter and I appreciate the being upfront about kind of the macro impact you are seeing. Free-to-paid conversion slowed down and some of the paid, it sounds like NRR slowed down a little bit. What have you guys been seeing in kind of top of funnel trends? Is that kind of feeling as expected or did that slow down as well? And then you are sustaining the operating margin guide for the full year, even with the revenues coming down a little bit. Where are the areas you guys are looking to get the increased efficiencies as we think about FY 2023? Thank you. Sure. First off, this is Cameron. I will speak to the topline please and then I hand off to Joe to talk about expenses. So, yeah, as we mentioned, previous quarter, actually back in our August earnings, we spoke about how -- while we are seeing plenty of people coming in and trying Jira, trying to our free versions of our product and we continue to see that trend today.
Many more people coming in and signing up and using our products, we saw them starting to slow down, getting to that 11th user, entering their credit card information and becoming paid customers. .
So that trend definitely came through throughout the quarter and we see it today where we still have plenty of people coming in. Year-over-year growth of our free instances continues to grow, which is great, but just a little bit slower in the converting to actual paying customer.
The new piece we saw in the previous quarter was that, towards the end of the quarter, we actually saw user expansion in existing accounts. So this is largely people going from 100 users in Confluence to 110 users, right?
And that’s largely due to company slowing down hiring, trying to constrain their own internal IT budgets and using more of the license they already have. Now we continue to see growth just that user growth wasn’t nearly as strong as what we have seen historically.
On the other side, on topline, so while the user growth slowed down, we do continue to see migrations tracking along as planned, are additions working people from standard to premium and enterprise versions of our products, strong and cross-sell.
Jira Service Management specifically continues to be adopted well. So while we are affected by basically hiring rates and how quickly people are adding people to their organizations, the big projects like migrations or choosing their new IT service management tools, we have seen no slowdown in those efforts to-date. Joe, do you want to handle the expenses compensation? Yeah. Thanks, Cameron. Thanks, Cameron, and thanks, Keith. So there’s really two focus areas. First and foremost, we are making reductions in our non-headcount driven discretionary spending, and then, secondarily, we will be moderating the rate of planned headcount growth in the second half of FY 2023.
I’d say in terms of areas, Keith, I think, there’s efficiencies to be found across the Board, whether you are talking about gross margins or process efficiencies or even resource allocation, right, looking at where we have our resources allocated, make sure that we are constantly prioritizing investments and moving those resources with the highest ROI and most impactful things.
And as Scott mentioned, this is all with an eye towards strengthening our position in the large, high growth markets we are targeting and enabling us to emerge in a stronger position out of the downturn as we were going in. So, hopefully, that gives you a sense, but I would say, it’s very broad and based on those two primary principles. Got it. That’s super helpful guys. Thank you so much. Your next question comes from Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Hey, there. Thanks for taking the question. Appreciate it. And I am sure it’s going to be somewhat of a similar construct to the first one, but I will ask a little bit differently. So, a couple of parts. The first one is just clarifying some of Cameron’s comments from the first question. It sounds like it’s fair to assume that it’s more -- it’s less the cloud migration trajectory like the pace of migrations that you are seeing changing here that’s influencing the change in revenue target for cloud for the year than it is the expansion rate. So first part is just is that a fair assumption that, that 130% to 140% for large customers that we are seeing is what’s causing the moderation in impact? And then the second part for Joe is just -- I know you are relatively new to the call, but your views just around potentially giving more margin, what would inform that discussion versus just continuing to stay the course with the investment cycle? I know the company tends to think long-term. So just your thinking given the macro is changing a bit, I think, is useful here in the context of what you are seeing? Thank you. I am happy speak to the -- just to be very, very clear. Yes, we have seen no change in our migrations rates. Our migrations progress continues to be on track as it’s been the last few quarters with the server end of life coming up to February 2024, as well as our loyalty discount program, which will basically take another step down in June.
We have a series of compelling events that we have been working with our customers over the last couple of years. We get better in those conversations every day and the migration efforts continue to be right along with plan.
So no impact due to migrations, it is largely purely focused on people adding users, that user expansion within their existing use of our products that we have seen slow down a bit over the last quarter. Great, Michael. This is Joe. Thanks for the question. On the NRR question, the expansion rate question. As you know, we don’t provide updates on expansion rates on a quarterly basis. Directionally, it remains very healthy and above the 130% we discussed at the Investor Day. I think that’s indicative of the fundamental health of our business, particularly around upgrades to premium and enterprise additions customers adding new products and churn rates.
And while we talked about the macro impact on paid seat growth within existing customers, relative to expectations, the absolute growth rates there are still very good on an absolute basis. So that’s a big -- that’s also a big driver behind those healthy expansion rates. And I will turn it over to Scott to talk a little bit about the margin trade-off discussion. In terms of -- stepping back in terms of thinking about us long-term, like, we have been through multiple downturns in the business, like, we started in 2001, 2002 in sort of the dotcom crash, we went through 2008, 2009, and yes, we are now in the third downturn for us.
And what we have learned is that during those periods of time, like, if you can invest wisely, you can come out the other side with the leaderboard shaking up a little bit and you can come out higher on that leaderboard than you went going in and so that informs a lot of how we think about the investments through this period.
So there’s a couple of areas. One is, we think that we can pick up staff where other companies are shedding staff. There’s a lot of incredible people in the market who may only come on the market once a decade and we have an opportunity to pick those staff up now.
And so may be really thoughtful around kind of how many we hire and where we hire, but there -- our experience is that we can come out really strongly on the other side by selectively picking up stuff that other people are letting go.
We also in terms of think about what the opportunities and we said in our Investor Day kind of seems like a long time ago now, but early this year, we said, we have three really good opportunities that we were going to invest behind that was migrating our customers to the cloud at the fastest rate we can, building new products to that point A program and investing more in ITSM with our JSM platform there.
And so, again, we think those are long-term investments that pay off short-, medium- and long-term, we want to continue to invest in those areas and so we are going to continue to do that. And so we are going to be thoughtful around that. We need to make sure that does fit within a certain cost envelope and with the macro environments, like, we want to be conscious about what the cost in board use.
But again, our philosophy about investing for the long-term about having low priced products that are very particularly attractive in this market, picking up staff. That hasn’t changed through this cycle. Appreciate all the detail. Thank you. Your next question comes from Fatima Boolani from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Hey, Cameron. This question is for you. It’s a little bit of a counter factual. So I know you are staying committed to the proportion of your cloud growth coming from migration. But conversely, why wouldn’t we see a slowdown in migrations to the cloud if the sensitivity that you have seen most to-date is on the user expansion area. So, in other words, why wouldn’t an existing customer just sweat out the capacity that they have versus going to sort of a per user or need seat model where potentially the TCO in the short-term could be much higher. Just a couple of thoughts there on why that wouldn’t actually impair the migration cadence to the cloud. Thank you. So, basically, let me just try and rephrase the, why haven’t we seen a slowdown in the cloud migration rates when it is cliff, an effort for customers to make a change versus just sitting on their renewals and wait until the last minute.
The primary reason for that is that over the last two years ever since we announced the server end of life, now almost exactly two years ago, we have had a very well-engineered set of programs that we have released between loyalty discounts, new migration tooling, more engagement with our enterprise customers, incentivizing our partners and incentivizing our customers to ensure that cloud is the proper destination for them.
And many of them over the last two years have been in various stages. Some moved very, very quickly. Some are building plans today. Some are waiting, like, you said, to the last minute. But across the Board, we have seen that entire approach being, like, largely on track.
So they haven’t been seeing the, hey, should we might migrate to the cloud as a capacity challenge. It’s not like the 100 users, the fact that they need to more add users, they can add more users on-premises if they want versus adding more users on cloud. It’s more of the while we have been looking to go to cloud and we have made the strategic decision to go to cloud, there’s a whole lot more value that we unlock in cloud and more productivity for the users we have.
So let’s go through and continue to finish this project so that our teams operate more efficiently and have the best tools available to them even if we were going to have less people hired in the future.
So it wasn’t really tied to how many people are in the room, it’s more tied to them choosing the best solution for them long-term, and of course, reacting to the programs that we put in the market to compel them to move to cloud. Thank you for that. Welcome. Your next question comes from Arjun Bhatia from William Blair. Please state your question. Hello. Yes. Thank you for taking my questions. I am curious, just when you think about the macro impact that you are seeing, is there any way to just break it down any further between the behavior that you are seeing from larger customers that are maybe multi-product that are more committed than of a broader deployment versus smaller customers that are earlier in their journey? And then Joe, one for you, just when you are thinking about the rest of the year and the guidance that you have provided, can you just help us understand what you are incorporating from a macro perspective in the forward numbers? Thank you. Hey, Arjun. I can take that one. Look, I want to re-stress our philosophy of open company, no bullshit, right? We have told you every single quarter we have been public. We are going to be open with you and clear with you about what’s going on. We tried to do that best we can in the letter, right?
The two areas that we are seeing impact, again, is the free instances, the rate of converting to paid, and secondly is the rate of user expansion growth, the historical rate has been pretty consistent for us, slowing down a bit.
The reason for that is, we think both anecdotally and best guess is customers optimizing their spend, right? If you are going to add that 11th user, you are more likely today to think I will stay at 10. The good part about that for us is, we see no sort of decrease in usage or change in churn rates. These aren’t customers leaving Atlassian at all. These are customers who are dealing with their own turbulence and optimizing their spend and tuning the number of users they have, right?
We have also highlighted where we see as great opportunities in front of us and being quite clear about where we are playing offense and some of them go to the areas that you said. Cameron just addressed the migrations, which continues to be strong.
If you think about it from a customer perspective, there -- if you are looking at optimizing spend, cloud is an easier place to do that than on-premise, because you are -- can pay monthly and you can pay per user, et cetera. So that gives you a slightly easy optimization, and secondly, it’s a much higher ROI in terms of running the software. We do all that for you. So that’s why we see continued opportunities and migrations, which are tracking strongly.
Secondly, in enterprises, we certainly see that a significant opportunity on the back of 10 years of really great work of continuing to optimize for the enterprise. That’s a huge opportunity area for us.
And lastly, as we have mentioned repeatedly in ITSM, we are seeing really strong growth. So all those play into the enterprise that you talked about, but hopefully, that gives you some background color about where we think we are well positioned to gain market share in this environment and really excited about the future. And this is Cameron, I will add a little on. Thank you. Oh! Sorry. Just give you a little more view of the how we do SMB growth over our enterprise customer base growth. Now first and foremost, that the constraints in the growth rate of users, we do largely see across all cohorts. Like I said, all sized customers, industries and geographies, it seems to be broad across the customer base.
However, we do continue to see strength in our enterprise business for a few reasons, primarily due to the fact that migrations, which are going as planned, have an outsized impact when it comes to our enterprise business compared to our small- and medium-sized business, simply due to pricing dynamics.
The second is also in our enterprise business that we continue to see customers continue to standardize on our applications, choose the enterprise additions of our products when they move to the migrations, which continues to grow their inputs.
On top of that, in just over the last month, we have announced a partnership with Accenture, which gives us massive scale with one of the large global system integrators in the industry to help our customers through their massive transitions, whether that’s their agile transformation or their cloud transition.
And just today, as Mike mentioned, that our growth in IT service management market, we were named the leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant, which shows that even more enterprise credibility as we look to expand into IT operations and service management use cases in the enterprise. And then Arjun, this is Joe, you asked about the assumptions underpinning the guidance. We are assuming two fundamental things in our guidance. First, the current macroeconomic environment persists throughout the year. It does not get materially better or worse.
And then, secondarily, the macro impact on the business and the trends we saw in Q1 around free-to-paid conversion rates and paid seat expansion at existing customers also persist throughout the year and does not get materially better or worse.
So, in other words, the guidance assumes status quo on those two factors. Like most, we continue to monitor things closely, both on the macro side and on the business side and we are adjusting and responding to it.
As you know, there’s a lot of uncertainty right now and we think this is an appropriate range, given what we have seen to-date both in Q1 performance and our Q2 quarter-to-date performance and the underlying trends we saw there. Your next question comes from Alex Zukin from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Yeah. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I want to dive into that last answer a little from both Cameron and maybe others. I guess, if we think about the enterprise impact, like, can you maybe dissect the cloud revenue growth for the year, the takedown? Is it -- are the seat adds -- the headwinds from the seat adds, is that more in the mid-market, the SMB, the enterprise, is there -- would you say it’s being compensated by incremental module additions at the enterprise? Help us unpack that and give us a sense for when you started to see these issues, is it in the last two weeks of the quarter, how that’s trended in October? And from the financial perspective, is the cloud growth kind of exiting this year, where does that trend, because if I remember correctly at the Analyst Day, we talked about that 50% wasn’t just for this year cloud growth, but for a couple of years. So I am assuming it’s coming off for this year, but I just want to clarify, is that also off for the next couple of years. Apologize for the multiple questions. No problem at all. I will address the first part and then hand off to Joe. So as you know, our cloud growth, easy to think is that it’s new customers coming in, those customers adding users to the products that they have purchased.
In addition to upgrading additions to either the premium or enterprise version of their products. Also, migration is another big piece of our cloud growth, roughly 10% of our growth is due to migrations, and of course, cross-sell expanding out to our other products.
So to diagnose specifically what we saw in Q2, the specific areas we saw in Q1 was the net new customers starting to slow the rate. We still added over 6,000 net new customers, but we saw that somewhat slowing down as free customers slowed their conversion to paid customers and we saw that user growth.
So someone who is an existing cloud customer slowing down the rate on which they added more users. We did not see any impact to either migrations or edition upgrades or in our major cross-sell motions.
So it’s primarily just the user additions tied to largely hiring. Our customers adding more and more employees into their business and then slowing that down, which slows down our user growth. Those other FX -- efforts are right on track as we originally planned. Joe? Thanks, Cameron. And then Alex, your question on how we are going to exit Q4, we expect to exit Q4 with cloud revenue growth rates in the 40% to 45% range. Perfect. Thank you, guys. Your next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Okay. Thank you for taking the question. So I think of Atlassian as an unusual software company in a good way, a couple of the reasons being that, one, your quarters are typically very linear, and two, you have tremendous visibility into customer buying and usage patterns. And so, I’d have to believe that you had a very early warning of the paid user growth slowdown that began midway through the quarter. And with that said, what I am wondering is, was there anything that you were able to do that has enabled you to mitigate the slowdown as it unfolded, investors are pretty surprised to see results like this from Atlassian? And so the question here or the spirit of the question is whether you have the ability to make adjustments and navigate the difficult macro better than others? Thank you. Hi, Gregg. This is Cameron again. I will… Sorry. Sorry, Scott. Go ahead. It’s Scott here. Just want to sort of philosophically, Gregg, one of the things we look at, we are a long-term company and there are many of our peers drive their quarters really back from the sales team. They sort of say, how many sales people I got and how many reps do I have and that’s how they run their business.
If you look at our business, it really is a much more long-term self-serve model where our customers come and we are also from a price perspective, much more reasonably priced on a first day basis than many of our competitors out there.
And so, in terms of, for good and bad, there aren’t many things we can do within a quarter to affect the quarter’s results, which is why you see the linearity that you have seen over the years from the last year.
And so when I look about the macro environment and what we are seeing, we have cut this every which way, by geo, by product, by market segment. It really comes down to that customers are not adding seats and heads the way they used to add them, because the hiring environment has changed outside of Atlassian.
And so, we see that, we trend there, long-term we are really -- we have got -- we can sell more products to customers. We have a great product pipeline in point A products. We have great market opportunities in ITSM. The migrations are still going strongly.
And one of the reasons they are going strongly is that the ROI is just so compelling to them, though they pay us more money. The overall cost to them or TCO goes down, because they got less people managing things in an environment where they had to manage their own service and data centers.
And so, that’s a great opportunity, all those are great opportunities for us and not short-term do something within a quarter. They really play out over the long-term. And again, when we look at sort of the opportunities for us now, they are to take market share, because we have great products that are cost competitive versus competitors out there.
And what we are seeing here is that, we haven’t seen any materially changed in churn, like, it’s mostly on adding seats and so then also points to the stickiness of our products and so that’s the way I think about that. Very helpful perspective. Thanks, guys. I can also add on to just the timing of things that we saw. As we mentioned in August, what we were seeing in the August timeframe was the net new customers, the free customers converted to paid was slowing down going into August.
We normally through our summer season, the July and August tend to see user growth slow down across our customer base, largely due to seasonality, vacations and holidays. It just tends to be a normal seasonal trend where July and August are slower as people are not upgrading instances, adding more users.
What we noticed is usually most years when you come back in September, everyone is coming back to work, the holidays wear off and people start adding users and upgrading their instances again, and that’s when we actually did not see that normal user growth uptick that we normally do in September.
The great thing is that, one of the advantages that we do have is that, we have plenty of other growth drivers we can continue to leverage in our business, whether it’s upgrading additions, continuing to escalate our migration efforts or relying on expansion to other products of which we have even released a few new ones over the last few quarters. So plenty other levers that we tend to pull when we see user expansion slowdown. Great. Thank you both. Your next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Headcount accelerated to the fastest growth in 11 quarters kind of into the face of this slowdown. Can you just talk to what you are going to do through the next six months to nine 9 months and how you are thinking about that investment pace? And then I had just a quick follow-up on the geography perspective, EMEA looked like it had the biggest hit, can you comment on what you are seeing in EMEA versus the U.S.? Thanks. I will take the headcount and Cam can talk about the geo side of things. On the headcount, you are right? I mean, it is our high watermark on headcount growth. We do have from a seasonality perspective a lot of graduates coming out in the U.S. who started this quarter. So that gives this quarter’s numbers a boost.
And we are thinking about sort of what does our headcount moderation look like going forward, we are still going to be growing our headcount, but of course, moderating that growth in light of the macroeconomic conditions and ensuring those people are going on the most productive of projects. Cam? Yeah. From a geographic perspective, as I mentioned prior, the trends we tend to see across our customer base has been largely across all segments, industries and geographies. So when we look to Europe specifically or APAC, we have seen no quantitative change other than what we have already spoken about, the user expansion slowing down, but migrations, our addition upgrades, our cross-sell programs continue to be on track from a quantitative perspective.
Qualitatively, when we talk to customers, we do get plenty of discussions and concerns about largely uncertainty we see going into the next year. Plenty have financial concerns related to the variety of macroeconomic efforts that are areas that we see impacting their businesses. That has not cost projects to slow or migrations to slow down at this point, but it’s definitely a constant conversation we are having with those customers. Thanks. Your next question comes from Michael Turits from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Hey, guys. On the subject of the slowdown in both expansions of customers and conversions, you are trying to slower headcount growth among customers themselves. Can you say, perhaps, if there is you see anything in particular in the development world? In other words, among the headcount growth or not in your customers for software developers and how that may or may not be tied to what we have heard about in terms of the spend in cloud this quarter? Michael, I appreciate the direction of the question is, we are seeing headcount growth slowing our customers, where is that I think you are asking, which departments of our customers are seeing that headcount slow. Does that factor into other cloud spends and so forth.
I think it’s too early for us to have any sort of strong opinion on that, like, we feel across the entire customer base in our customers. So it’s sort of hard for us to be specific about that, of course, our history is selling more to developers.
But the thing to take away from last year’s result is, we are really speaking to our customers, we haven’t seen people decide to slow the migrations. We haven’t seen people try to reduce or sort of cancel contracts or anything like that. It really is just tied to headcount growth. But I couldn’t give you any more detail on which department that is. Okay. Can I just ask one additional question, too? I mean, you said you are seeing across all segments. But another way of thinking about it is not segments per se, but customers with different sizes of spend. And I think you obviously have some people spending a lot of money with you in the small companies or big ones. But there’s also the ability to have a fairly small spend with Atlassian, and therefore, maybe in some senses to fall underneath the radar in terms of big budgeting decisions. Do you see any difference there between where you are a big part of the company’s budget versus small? Yeah. This is Cameron to answer that. And not really, if you look across the base, actually on the small end, you see this coming in our free users, like, we have plenty of free instances with eight users, nine users, 10 users and then their willingness to put their credit card in and pay a relatively minimal amount to get into our paid plans, we have seen that slow down.
Even when we get to our largest customers, most of our conversations with our largest customers are about expanding to new product use cases, whether that’s Jira Service Management or Jira Align or having these migrations conversations if they are large on-premises customers.
So they are project based and a big portion of our revenue discussions are tied to that. Where we have less discussions with them, ask them adding 500 users or 1,000 more users, because they have rapidly expanded their development teams or what have you.
So the answer is, no. We have not seen user expansion tied directly to share of wallet or the current spend with Atlassian. It’s definitely much more tied to how many people are hiring and how much people are expanding their overall technology footprint in their businesses. Okay. Thanks very much. Your next question comes from Steven Koenig from SMBC Nikko. Please go ahead. Hi, gentlemen. Thanks for taking my questions. Given that like the higher velocity sales motions seemed to be the most affected here. I am wondering if you look at your existing cloud customers and look at the monthly people versus the annuals, are you seeing any kind of like earlier slippage in the monthly and are we going to need to work through 12 months of the annual customers renewing with adding fewer seats, like how do you think about maybe the net expansion rates for those two different steps of cloud customers? Thanks very much. Yeah. One advantage of our business model is that we have plenty of customers on monthly plans. We have the option to go annual plans across the Board. And we largely let customers make the choice. We have -- but the good news is, it’s not like we have all annual plans come up at one time every year as we have annual plans renewing every single month just like we have monthly plans.
So, no, we see that user expansion challenge that we saw over the previous quarter, continue to be, like, largely even across both our monthly and annual plans. We don’t see any major delta between the two.
Difference with the monthly plans is that, we will have much more accurately tied to the customers paying for exactly the number of users they are using within the product and allows us the annual plans where we can continue to watch those customers.
With cloud, we have incredible telemetry about the health and usage of the products, and allows us to proactively engage with those customers if we tend to see usage or activities starting to go into unhealthy territories, given us even more abilities to run customer success programs, training programs and alike. Got it. Thank you very much. Your next question comes from Ari Terjanian from Cleveland Research. Please state your question. Thank you for taking the question. Just asking a little bit differently on the user expansion, I appreciate all the color you have given thus far. Any way like you can estimate or break out like exposure to the tech vertical, I mean, it seems like kind of looking at the headlines, you have Amazon kind of slowing hiring, Shopify, Stripe letting off people. Just kind of curious, like, obviously, those companies were hiring pretty aggressively during COVID. So just kind of curious if you have accounted or have seen any like a benefit from those cohorts during COVID and if you are kind of expecting baking in for user growth from kind of the tech cohort in the coming months here? Thank you. Ari, yeah, I would understand your line of questioning is sort of what -- are there tailwinds that are coming off from COVID and like that we should be thinking about? And we have looked at this and we think about, almost every company these days is becoming a software company, whether you are a retailer or whether you are a car company or whether you are a transport company. Just every aspect of the economy is becoming a tech company and that’s why people have turned to our products.
And I don’t think that sort of secular trend is changing anytime soon and I don’t think -- the tech is a large industry. It lot large than it was 20 years ago when we started. We sell to tech, to banking, to manufacturing, like, all down every industry vertical we sell to.
And so I wouldn’t say we are overly exposed to technology workers. We do sell again products that help teams to be more effective and our history was to start with technical teams. But those technical teams are in every single company out there.
And when I talk to our customers, those technical teams are also these to people that most companies are doing their best to retain during the downturn, like, they are the ones that have taken a long time to build up, they have a lot of IP and they are very hard to restart. And so we think that, early first tech industry, but we do sell to technical teams across the Board and we think those teams are sort of last on the line to be reduced in terms of macro headwinds. Thank you. Your next question comes from Mark Hatch [ph] from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Yeah. Thanks for the question. This is Mark on for Adam. I wanted to ask about the loyalty discounting you are doing to migrate customers to cloud. And understanding this is still ongoing, but how would you size the overall potential uplift to revenue and margins as these discounts are rolling off and when would you really start to see that impact? Thank you. Yeah. So this is Cameron here. So the loyalty discounts and as those you have been following for a while, when we announced the server end of life, we basically had aggressive loyalty discounts that rolled down effectively every July 1st over a three-year period as we led to the server end of life.
So effectively, the sooner that our customers would choose to move to the cloud, they would get a bigger discount and then over the three-year period as the loyalty discounts roll down, they eventually get to list price and that’s still the truth for all of our customers.
So we still have a loyalty discount in place. It’s the last year of loyalty discounts going up until June 30th. As of July of next year, all customers are effectively paying on new contracts, be paying list. All existing customers, who are on one-year up to three-year contracts at the end of their three-year terms will be at list price as well. Joe, did you want to add anything? . Yeah. Cam, I was just going to mention the question around, when do we start to see those price changes and the impact of those in the model and the answer to that is it’s not immediate. So there’s two reasons for that, Mark.
First and foremost is the ratable recognition on subscription, which is 80% of our revenue. And secondly, the timing of renewals that happen throughout the year post those changes. So you won’t see an immediate impact when we go through those types of pricing changes, it will tend to run into the model over time. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. Thanks. Your next question comes from Peter Weed from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Thank you. Earlier you touched on net revenue retention and referenced back to enterprise, you talked about 130% and 140% previously and that you were still seeing NRR over 130%. Now I wanted to clarify, because obviously, your cloud revenue comes from more than large- and mid-sized businesses, whether or not when you said 130%, you were still exceeding that. Was that just for kind of the medium- and large-sized businesses or was that for that entire revenue base that you report on? Yeah. Peter, thanks for the question. This is Joe. That was for the entire customer base that we report on. Okay. And then as you are taking a look at the smaller customers within there that you are trying to get into paid, certainly, that transition is frustrating, but I think that you were alluding to it in the note here. But how are you seeing any competitive pressures there, I mean, certainly, you hear things like GitLab being thrown around as an alternative that people could use if they have a lower sophisticated organization. Is it genuinely that people are just not upgrading to paid or are you seeing situations where you are concerned with some of these customers that they be using other solutions to try to get done what Atlassian may be able to do better? Thanks. Yeah. This is Cam. This is Cameron. And yes, first and foremost, across the Board, whether it’s the new customer acquisition or existing customers, we see no real change in our overall competitive position. We have incredibly strong products, incredibly happy customers and we also have the certain critical applications where we are highly integrated into their environments.
Specific to what you mentioned, the free users converting into paid. We definitely haven’t seen any competitive dynamic there, because we still see them as free users of our products. It’s actually one of the advantages of our free program and that people will be choosing us and using our free version of our products and compared to going to an alternative vendor across the Board.
Also at a dollar level if budgets are getting more constrained and customers are looking to save money, across our entire product base, one of our core part that make Atlassian products. So attractive is that we are relatively priced, less expensive than most alternatives. So no change in competitive dynamics, nor are we seeing competitors being any direct impact to our free-to-paid conversion rates. Thank you. This is Mike. I just wanted to add in one thing to maybe add a little bit of a stronger message to what Cameron is saying. I think it’s actually an opposite behavior, right? We have talked about playing offense in this environment on a few shareholder letters now, and again, this quarter, the same.
We actually see the upcoming period as a good chance for us to pick up market share in a lot of our markets. We actually think we are very strongly positioned in all 3 of our major markets. Our investment in R&D are extremely affordable, high value products for customers is a great chance for us to pick up market share in an environment where customers are optimizing that spend. So that’s an area we are very bullish and going after. [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Fred Havemeyer from Macquarie. Please go ahead. Hi. Thank you. I wanted to ask, with respect to the slowdown that you are seeing in net new, sorry, free-to-paid conversion, as well as just user expansion. What we are seeing now in terms of layoffs, it’s certainly ahead of what we saw at the COVID pandemic. But I wanted to ask, if you were to compare or consider what you are seeing now to say, like, the start of 2020 when layoffs intensified, businesses began to freeze hiring and just capital froze. How have you seen or could you just generally compare and contrast what you are seeing now versus then? So, this is Cameron. I will do my best looking back to that area. Obviously, going back to 2020, at the beginning of the year, we just only saw this kind of right into COVID, we had two things that happened.
If you remember, that is actually when we changed our business model from going trials based to free, which resulted in a huge uplift in sign-ups and new free activations of our products, but we also saw that in line with the impact of COVID, small businesses shutting down and so on.
If you remember, our Q4 of fiscal year 2020, it was actually one of our slowest new customer growth quarters ever because of those two dynamics, our conversion to free, as well as smaller customers largely going out of business or not renewing. Two years later, now we are at the tail end of COVID and we are looking to see the trends, our net new customer number is still significantly higher than we had pre our free launch.
So even if you took out all the uncontrolled unknown pieces of the COVID dynamic over the last two years, our change of business models go into free has significantly altered our ability to acquire and attracting that new customers and we see that today.
In addition to that, the fact is we still every single day, continue to see more and more customers signing up, coming into our store, as I say, and clicking the try button year-over-year, which is the same dynamic we saw back then.
However, they are ability to get to the 11th user, enter their credit card, all that is significantly dependent on other environments that we don’t always have control of. The most important piece that we look to is, are they using our products, are they getting value out of it and we can be patient for the revenue. And that is what we see is consistent between that kind of early COVID months and what we see now a few years later. Thank you. And then just, I think, one follow-up on that. Also, Cameron, that was, I think, a great job, not just to try at explaining it. In terms of just Atlassian Together, the bundled solution that you have launched and announced this quarter, I know it’s very early days. But it seems like that’s more of an enterprise-focused offering and is there an opportunity outside of just driving sales into enterprise to potentially add this in or use the opportunity of a transition from some of these on-premise customers to either data center or cloud to onboard them into Together? Fred, it’s Mike here. Super glad you managed to put it out a product strategy question. Thank you for doing that. Yes is the answer. So, a reminder, Atlassian Together is an enterprise-focused offering. We announced at Work Life, a conference targeting work management.
Now we have more than 150,000 customers in the work management arena, so a very strong market for us. There’s no doubt that we have continued, as you have seen in our platform, to make our products, as we say, work differently together.
So we believe every team works in their own way, and we want our products to work incredibly well together and we also want to work with all of the other products that customers use as the number of products per customer, I think it’s topped 89 or 90 in the latest OCTA [ph] survey and it’s going to continue to go up, we believe.
Atlassian Together is an offering targeted our largest customers to allow them to purchase all of our work management applications together that work with each other and all the third-party applications generally used -- focused on customers who are increasing their spend significantly in terms of the number of users.
So when you are rolling out Atlassian’s Work Management applications from maybe 2,000 employees to 10,000 employees, it’s an incredible way to do that, because you don’t have to manage individual applications and usage across your employee base. It’s very early days. Obviously, as you mentioned, for customers coming from server or data center, they only really have access to Confluence on the server data center realm.
So Atlassian together includes Atlassian Access, Trello, Jira Work Management, Confluence and Atlas, which is our new offering. So those five products come in the Atlassian together package. If you are coming from on-premise and moving to the cloud, you only have Confluence.
So we do hope it is compelling offering for customers who are migrating in that space, far too early to see any actual results of that yet. Again, it was only announced a month ago. Initial customer feedback, I will say, is very positive.
People understand the offering, especially for those larger customers that are moving significantly up in terms of their employee access to our Work Management applications and the ability for them all to collaborate with each other. But we will have more updates for you as that rolls out. Thank you. Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to Mike for closing remarks. I just wanted to say thank you all for the detailed questions and for reading our shareholder letter and for attending today. Thank you to all the Atlassian employees for another [inaudible] quarter and I hope you have a great weekend, wherever you are in the world and we will talk to you next quarter.","this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of Atlassian’s website following this call . thanks for joining us on the call today, we have Atlassian's Co-Founders and Co-CEOs, Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes . this call will include forward-looking statements .",0.0

And thank you for joining Atlassian’s Earnings Conference Call for the Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2023. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of Atlassian’s website following this call.
I will now hand the call over to Martin Lam, Atlassian’s Head of Investor Relations. Welcome to Atlassian’s second fiscal year 2023 earnings call. Thank you for joining us today. Joining me on the call today, we have Atlassian’s Co-Founders and Co-CEOs, Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes; our Chief Revenue Officer, Cameron Deatsch; and Chief Financial Officer, Joe Binz.
Earlier today, we published a shareholder letter and press release with our financial results and commentary for our second quarter fiscal year 2023. The shareholder letter is available on Atlassian’s Work Life blog and the Investor Relations section of our website, where you will also find other earnings related materials, including the earnings press release and supplemental investor data sheet.
As always, our shareholder letter contains management’s insights and commentary for the quarter. So during the call today, we will have brief opening remarks and then focus our time on Q&A.
This call will include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions. If any such risks or uncertainties materialize or if any of the assumptions prove incorrect, our results could differ materially from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements we make. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events.
Forward-looking statements represent our management’s belief, assumptions only as of the date such statements we are made and we undertake no obligation to update or revise such statements should they change or cease to be current.
Further information on these and other factors that could affect our financial results is included in filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time-to-time, including the section titled Risk Factors in our most recently filed annual quarter and quarterly reports.
During today’s call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are in addition to and are not a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is available in our shareholder letter, earnings release and investor data sheet on the IR website.
Please keep in mind, we would like to allow as many of you to participate in Q&A as possible. To facilitate that, we will take one question at a time. Please rejoin the queue if you have another question or a follow-up and we will do our best to come back to you later in the session.
With that, I will turn the call over to Mike for opening remarks. Thank you all for joining us today. As you have already read in our shareholder letter, we closed out 2022, proud of everything we have accomplished in yet another unpredictable year. Despite the current macroeconomic environment, the massive opportunities in front of us has not changed. We continue to make great strides towards our long-term goals and we are ready to execute with relentless focus in 2023.
We have achieved a ton this quarter, shipping many platform enhancements and product features that deliver incredible value to delight our customers in the cloud, including delivering data residency in Germany, launching automation in Confluence, helping our customers to the cloud with migrations up nearly 2x from the prior year and completing several of our largest migrations to-date and showcasing our unique position in the ITSM market with impressive customer growth, multiple large swap-out stories and recognition as a leader by industry analysts and these are just a handful of examples.
We have always prioritized putting our customers first and we are seeing customers increasingly turn to Atlassian as a trust vendor asking how to operate their businesses better. 2023 will be all about helping our customers navigate these challenging times, absorbing the downstream impacts on our business and setting ourselves up for continued long-term success.
With that, I look forward to your questions and I will pass the call to the Operator for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Okay. Thank you very much, and good afternoon, everyone. So it sounds like the macro has had no impact on migration activity so far, even though really, you are seeing it in some other areas. You are still expecting migrations to add 10 points of cloud revenue growth this year. But in an environment where customers are clearly tightening their belt, why is it that you think migrations will continue unabated? Is the TCO advantage strong enough to compel customers even though they have to make a financial commitment, is the end of support date having a real impact there as well, any color would be helpful? Thank you. Hey, Gregg, this is Cameron. I will start off with some details and then I will probably let Mike add some more from what he’s seeing. So, as you already know, more than two years ago, we announced the upcoming end of life of our server products, and ever since then, we have been on this migration journey, helping our on-premises customers move from both server and data center to our cloud offerings.
And I have to say that even in the uncertain macroeconomic times, every day that goes by, I am more confident in our ability to not only attract our customers to the cloud, but convince them of the additional ROI savings that going to our cloud, the additional benefits from a feature perspective, from there we have been able to get increasing our ability to get through the contractual, legal and data privacy aspects and move to our customers to the cloud.
We made huge strides in actually migrating their data and their users to the cloud and then from there actually onboarding their users so they understand the new experience. This obviously can be an extremely complex exercise. But once again, we are two years into this and every single day goes by, we have been getting better.
I also want to recognize that we purposely built an engineered kind of this path over this three-year timeframe, using loyalty discounts, improvements in our products, so it would provide compelling events along the way for our customers to move.
And this just further establishes the demand for our migrations and we continue to feel strong about that additional 10% growth that we see coming from migrations going forward. Mike, do you have anything to add? Yeah. Thanks, Gregg. Look, I just wanted to say, it’s incredibly important in this environment to help our customers through as well and you talked about the TCO of moving to the cloud. I do think in an environment where customers are looking to get efficiency to optimize their spend, there’s increasing recognition that the cloud itself is a great ownership model for them. It’s a cheaper way for them to run and own and operate their software.
And secondly, the benefits of the platform that we have built and the integration across our products, especially as they are experimenting and trying new things, allows them to consume more of Atlassian’s products, and at the same time, do so while making their businesses more efficient, which is what our job is to help them become more efficient businesses, especially in these difficult times. So I think we are really well positioned in that way. Okay. Very helpful. Thank you, guys. Your next question comes from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. In the shareholder letter, you talked about more focused investments on a go-forward basis and the operating margin target for the full year comes up by a little bit. But it doesn’t really seem -- it seems like most of that came from sort of a better margin performance in the current quarter versus really changing sort of the investment profile for the second half. So you could talk to us a little bit about kind of where you are moderating investment, is there a potential offset and maybe to be really to the point, why not sort of more moderation considering the environment and work to drive the margin perhaps back to where we saw them historically in the low 20s? I will start -- yeah. Keith, this is Joe. I will start and then I will pass it off to Scott for additional thoughts. You are right, our overall view of H2 margin has not fundamentally changed from the prior quarter. We expect revenue growth to moderate in H2 driven by macro impacts we saw in Q2.
And then in addition, we had some timing impact on the pull forward of OpEx savings into Q2 that won’t repeat in H2 and we will continue to invest and hire against the terrific long-term opportunities we see. So those are the primary factors.
You asked about the broader work that we are doing around reprioritization. What I would say there, the work happening there comes in a lot of different flavors and takes a lot of different shapes.
Sometimes it’s about stopping something. It could be about sequencing of the events, moving something to a more milestone-based funding model, structurally lowering the investment level based on a strategy adjustment.
So as I think about the work we have been doing around focused reprioritization and resource allocation, it’s really included some flavor of all these things to drive the right overall business outcome.
And so we will continue to invest against the long-term opportunities, while balancing that and being responsive to the macro environment in managing costs in conjunction with revenue growth. And I will pass it over to, Scott, if he would like to add anything. At the risk of repeating you, Joe, just a reminder for those that may be new to the Atlassian story. Back in April, we chatted with you, our investors at our Investor Day and we talked about cluster of four growth opportunities that we saw ahead of us is those were around of cloud migrations, our ITSM opportunity to take market share there, better serving enterprise customers and launching and growing new product that we built on the back -- prior investments we have made in the Atlassian platform.
And what we have seen, though, is that those four areas are having great returns. We have got incredible momentum in those four areas. And we said about Atlassian in times of good and times of bad that we think about things for the long-term, where we want to invest over the long-term and make the right choices as a business to get the right returns.
And so we continue to invest in those four areas, we are regarding from other areas of our portfolio into these great opportunities that we have identified and shared with you, of course, responsive to the current macro environment and our commitments on it targets that we have given out to you. Excellent. That’s helpful. Thank you, guys. Your next question comes from Fred Havemeyer from Macquarie. Please go ahead. Hi, there. Thank you very much. I wanted to ask in regards to just what you are talking about in terms of product innovation as you are investing during this period. Certainly is notable, the focus on ITSM, could you take a moment perhaps and talk about how you think of product innovation development and just where Atlassian can innovate and drive another leg of growth as we just navigate and think about the other side of this macroeconomic environment? Yeah. Fred, I can take that one. Look, it may sound like a boring answer to you. I think the way we think about product innovation in the current environment doesn’t change to the way we thought about it a year ago, two years ago or three years ago, right?
We have a job to unleash the potential of every team and that’s all about making our customers more efficient at running their businesses. Again, we can’t help them make cars or rockets or drugs or provide financial services, whatever it is our customers are doing, but we can make their team is more efficient and we really try to keep that as a North Star across all of our markets.
At the same time, we continue to rebalance our priorities as we hear from customers and as we look at our resourcing. One of our advantages, I would say, is having a large investment in R&D, which is quite unique, is we are able to move those resources around a little bit more fluidly than other companies may be.
So we continue to innovate, we have a lot of new products that we have built over the last couple of years and we continue to work with customers in testing, things like Jira product discovery, Encompass and Atlas, and a couple of upcoming ones like is in alpha and beta. Those are examples of ability to ship new things.
At the same time, we continue to deepen our platform investment and one of the things as I just mentioned, to Gregg’s question earlier, when customers move to the cloud, their ability to consume multiple Atlassian products via the platform and connect them together with things like Smartlinks or analytics running across them is a huge advantage of the cloud and that all comes from the innovation and investment in our infrastructure and ability to manage all of that sort of thing.
At the same time, the innovation doesn’t just come in new product form. So we continue to work on the big enterprise aspects of our cloud in terms of scale and performance, in terms of accessibility. As you said, this roll out new data residency regions this month and we continue to work with our customers on what regions they want to see us data residency remain, things like BaFin and HIPAA and all sorts of the acronym soup that comes with the enterprise.
So those are all examples of where we spend our R&D dollars to continue to try to innovate on the things that customers want and are looking for. At the same time, we are obviously responsive to the environment that we just didn’t launched. Your next question comes from Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Hey, there. Thanks. Appreciate you taking the question. On the cloud target, can you just expand on what goes into the new range and what makes that the right range going forward? There’s some useful language in the letter, just around some assumptions that the macro worsened in the second half of the fiscal year. So maybe just what those impacts are, what gets worse and the letter calls out December as especially pronounced. I am just curious if there’s anything you can say on whether those trends how consistent in January or if things are getting worse or better? Any color there as we are just kind of sorting through everything that’s going on is helpful? Thank you. Yeah. Thanks, Michael. This is Joe. We did take a fundamental change from our prior cloud guide in the prior quarter and that we have three months more of data points, including December, which you mentioned and we have a much clearer picture of the trend line. And using that, our cloud guidance range assumes the macro environment gets worse in H2, and as a result, the trend lines from H1 continue into H2.
You will also notice we have maintained a 5-point range on that guidance with the low end of that range, not only assuming continued weakness in free-to-paid conversions and paid seat expansions that we have seen year-to-date, but also some macro impact areas that have held up really well, frankly, through the first half of FY 2023 like churn, upsell and migration.
So the rest of the picture is largely in line or better than three months ago. In terms of what we have seen in January, I’d say, we have incorporated that into the guidance and it’s consistent with the assumptions that we formulate the overall approach. Thank you. Your next question comes from Kash Rangan from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Hi. Thank you very much. So we have taken the right step in bringing down the cloud targets, I think, it happened a couple of quarters consecutively. What gives you the confidence, therefore, how can we get the confidence that we are at the point where we can assess, what are the leading indicators for your cloud business kind of the rest of the business seems to be in pretty decent shape. Are you seeing any signs of stability at all, it does look like December ended on a slightly worse note than September did and hence the forecast. But what are the leading indicators that you are looking at that we should be looking at for any signs of stabilization that could help us get comfort in the cloud forecast that have moved on? Thank you so much once again. Yeah. This is Cameron. I will take that one. So the two primary trends that we are seeing today that our headwinds are the free-to-paid conversions that we spoke about in Q1 continuing into Q2. We still see plenty of customers coming to our site, click in the try button and signing up for free versions of our products.
They are just more -- they are converting to paid customers, they are taking out their credit card at a slower rate than what we see in historic trends and that’s definitely continuing from Q1 to Q2. But, obviously, we can see as forward looking, we know how many people are signing up for our products. We know the activation rates of those customers. We know they are out there and actively using the free versions of our products and we are just simply trying to get them to add their 11th and convert to a paid customer.
On the user expansion side, that’s the other major headwind. This is basically people going from 20 users of Jira Software to 30 users of Jira Software. That, too, is another headwind we are seeing. We are seeing that largely slowed down across Q1 and Q2, and became more pronounced in Q2 within our smaller customer base. Once again, we see that in activity rates, we see the people adding their users and we see that in the overall monthly billing going forward.
That said, as we look into this particular quarter compared from Q2 to Q3, we have seen largely the amount of customers that were downloading or downgrading from the paid plans down to our free plan. That’s all people going from 11 or 12 users to 10 or nine users, actually start to subside and that’s come back in January a little bit more positively.
So we believe those are still the two headwinds that we are looking forward in the second half of the year and we have plenty of telemetry across our customer segments, geographies, industries and so on to understand if any of those trends are changing going forward. Got it. I mean how close are we to stability in those leading indicators you are looking at if you have a view? That’s it for me. Listen, there’s plenty of variability in the business overall today. On the top of funnel, people coming to our site and converted. I feel they are very stable between Q1 and Q2. The end user growth is much harder to predict and it might be hard to basically say whether that’s going to be leveling out or that we will see some change in the variability in the future. Your next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Hi. This is Luv Sodha on for Brent Thill. Thank you for taking my question. Just wanted to ask, thank you, Scott, for laying out those top four growth priorities going forward. I guess where does Jira Work Management and Atlassian Together rank in those priorities and what traction have you seen with that product suite? Thank you. Yeah. Luv, I can take that one. Look, we maintain incredible bullishness on our position in the Work Management space. Trello continues to be a monster. Confluence continues to grow really, really strongly. You see that with all of the enterprise improvements in the cloud, as well as automation and also of other things we shipped during the quarter.
So we are very confident in the overall position we have in Work Management and especially with its connection to both the software and ITSM spaces as companies increasingly get more digital, it’s a very unique position that we play.
A part of that Work Management strategy, as you pointed out, is to have multiple leading vectors, in terms of Trello, Confluence and Jira Work Management, depending on the structure people are looking for and where they are coming from and what they already have.
We see great traction for Jira Work Management in terms of usage in people who are heavily into the Jira role already. If you are into the Jira family, you have Jira Software, Jira Service Management. It’s an entirely logical step for you to add Jira Work Management, and obviously, integrates with all the rest of our products very well. Thanks to the Jira platform and the Atlassian platform.
It’s very early days in that product evolution. We are sort of a year and a bit in, and we continue to work with customers. It’s increasingly gratifying to see forms of standardization where people are moving off other project management vendors and collaboration vendors to standardize on Jira and Confluence and the Atlassian suite.
And that’s why you see us investing in two things. One is the platform story, things like Smartlink that I have mentioned beforehand, analytics, automation, being able to automate across our product set is a big part of what customers are turning to Atlassian for. And secondly, you mentioned Atlassian Together.
For those who are new, again, Atlassian Together is a packaging offering, which allows our customers to choose to take Atlassian wall-to-wall for Work Management in exchange for getting a series of different products being Jira Wealth Management, Trello, Confluence and Atlassian Access, all in the one package.
It’s extremely early days for Atlassian Together, I would say. It is still in beta testing with our customers, but the reception so far has been has been really good, largely for all the customer reasons that we talked about earlier in terms of the platform and the product set. Great. Thank you. Your next question comes from Alex Zukin from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So maybe just a two-parter. If we look into the trends around cloud revenue growth. Is there any way to get a little bit deeper in terms of the exposures for how many contextualize just the customers that are coming from the SMB side versus the enterprise side and maybe parse out where the trends got worse or stable in December and January? And then similarly, we picked up some anecdotes of server customers maybe wanting to wait a little bit more closer to the end of their service support date before migrating to either cloud or data center. So I would love to just get a sense of what you guys are seeing there versus a year ago or a quarter ago in terms of your assumptions. Great. Once again this is Cameron. Happy to dive into both of those. So, first and foremost, on the -- what did we see last quarter when it came down to SMB or smaller customer growth versus enterprise.
As we have already stated, the primary headwind that we saw more pronounced in Q2 was user expansion within our smaller customers who are largely on monthly contracts or we are moving from monthly down to our free tier and that was definitely the new piece of information that we saw in Q2.
On the other side, our enterprise side of our business remain exceedingly strong with migrations with cross-sell with Jira Service Management and Jira Align, as well as our addition upgrade standard-to-premium and premium-to-enterprise offerings continue to provide very stable growth within our enterprise customer base.
Obviously, with more than 250,000 customers, we believe that having such a massive customer base, a mix of SMB and enterprise globally across all industries and geographies is a massive advantage long-term for our business. As those small businesses become big businesses or more importantly, see people going from small companies into big companies and bringing the preferred tools and standards with them and that’s been core to the Atlassian strategy for some time.
To answer your question on the server side of things, that’s more good news. Like, as I already mentioned, this whole transition of server customers migrating to their data center or cloud is a multiyear journey, and obviously, the core focus there was to migrate customers to the cloud and we are largely in line with all of our goals that we have set for migrations ever since we started this journey a couple of years ago.
However, when we did this, whenever you announce an end of life of a product, we know we are going to lose some customers through the transition, and the good news here is, over the last couple of years, we have seen an increasing number of customers move to data center and you see that in the numbers, but as well as many of customers staying on server probably for longer than we expected.
That’s actually a good thing. I see that customers will continue to go -- until February 2024 before they are going to choose go into cloud or going to data center. But overall, it shows our ability to retain our customers, shows how sticky our products are and shows how mission-critical our applications are going forward.
And as I mentioned, whether Jira customer chooses server to data center or data center or server to cloud, all that shows future investment within Atlassian and commitment to our products. And I feel increasingly confident in our ability to get those customers to the cloud over the long-term regardless. Thank you. Perfect. And maybe just small, small follow-up. And is it possible to -- is that percentage of SMB enterprise for cloud, is that 50-50, is it -- from a revenue basis, is it much more weighted towards SMB than enterprise. Any kind of quantification there? Yeah. We do not break out the split of SMB versus enterprise. As I mentioned before, the one uptick in headwinds we saw in Q2 was the SMB user expansion. Our enterprise business continues to remain strong. Perfect. Thank you, guys. Your next question comes from Michael Turits from KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Yeah. I think -- well, I think, I will just take a question regarding developer headcount, because obviously, there’s been large numbers of headcount cuts in tech. For the most part, you don’t hear any discussion of it being better or worse for development engineering. But what are you seeing out there since where you came from is still on developer side? What are you seeing in terms of your selling into that user case of the development team? Is that getting impacted the same or disproportionately than others as people maybe slow down on new development projects I think that’s what we are seeing? Yeah. We have taken -- so as I mentioned, back to the one primary headwind we have seen that was different in Q2, which is user expansion within our smaller customer base. When we look into that, there’s no competitive differentiation, there’s no competitive dynamic that’s changed.
So it’s not like people are choosing other options or turning to other products that we see that some new competitive offering. It’s largely these customers slowing down their hiring, potentially trying to consolidate some of their licensing and the software that they over the last couple of years.
But we believe long-term, technology is still a major driver of growth across many different companies and many different industries, and that will only continue to grow across all geographies.
So we look across our entire customer base. We see it’s not just the tech or engineering-focused companies, but it’s in the companies in every industry, every geography have adopted technology and we see that why whenever we look at these trends that are happening, that happens broadly across all these different customer bases.
So long-term, we believe, is there going to be more technology, more developers in the future that are going to use our products to get their work on and collaborate with the rest of the business? Absolutely and we are set up with our multiple offerings to take advantage of that growth. Okay. But no relative difference in the decele between serving teams for software developers versus for IT versus for work for enterprise for business, is that correct? Yeah. This is Scott, obviously, talking, Michael, on that one. Look, just a reminder, we always started early on serving just the developer in an organization, the person writing code. We have around helping those developers, collaborate with the rest of the organization.
And so I believe that our latest number is something like a quarter of the users into software ops, developers writing code and the rest of it is product managers all the way through to designers and we -- a lot of our benefit we get exactly coordinating the work of the broader software and technology organizations through our ITSM offering that now go broader into the IT teams out there.
And so whilst we sort of core of what we do is helping developers like the broader problem we solve is actually how people get work done across their organizations. And that’s I think where we remain strong versus maybe point development products that are really just for developers.
And the other part is echo Cameron’s is that, no one -- it’s still early in the days of last and other things of other companies, but I haven’t heard that these developers, I am not getting other jobs elsewhere. What I am finding is those companies that struggled to hire developers previously are now able to pick up people where they couldn’t before.
And so I think that further proof points that development is not and software more broadly is not going anywhere at the long-term trend. And so, yeah, there certain bumps up and down, like, as we are seeing. I don’t think we are in five developers sitting on an unemployment line for very long just because the long-term trend is more and more software. Thanks. Your next question comes from Arjun Bhatia from William Blair. Please go ahead. Perfect. Thank you, guys, for taking the question. I wanted to touch on JSM and the ITSM opportunity. You certainly talked about that a lot in the shareholder letter and from what we can pick up, there’s a lot of customer partner excitement about the product. How do you -- how are the capabilities that you have developed with JSM compared to some of the larger incumbents that are in that market? And as you are increasingly selling JSM, how are you positioning it to larger enterprise customers that may already have an ITSM solution in place? Thanks, Arjun. That’s a great question. We built our ITSM solution in three areas that I remain the reason to our customers buy it. One is it is like a consumer-like offering out there and people will choose to use something else at the back end and install JSM the front end, because of its consumer-like offering. And so in some situations in very large organizations, we fight coexistence with existing solutions where we get put in at the front end to all systems there. I guess that’s just sort of proof point that’s a great advantage for us.
The second is our time to value and that time to value means that we can target the Fortune 500 with our solutions, whereas many of our competitors taking enterprise target a much smaller subset, they are willing to pay for the financial services in the six-month to 12-month onboarding and all the stuff that goes along with that and so that’s our second value prop.
And the third value prop for us is that we bring IT and development closer together, and no one else can say that. And again, that’s been the history of our long association with our developers work and deep integration with all of their tools.
And so our approach to this market is a long-term one. We are not aiming to go take the largest customers in this IT market to start with, because if you did that, you end up with a check box feature delivery mechanism where you need to check every box in order to switch something out and that’s not the product we want. We want to build a product that is loved by people long-term and serve the Fortune 500.
And so, looking the largest of instances, we find a coexistence, where people want the things that we can bring that the incumbents can’t, but they haven’t got the bandwidth or the desire to break out some of the core systems that those large incumbents provide.
In other cases, where you just don’t operate in that space at all. But we are very happy with the small, mid market sales that we make and the coexistence in those large areas, and for us, it’s a long-term gain and we believe those three advantages will play out over time. Yeah. And other… Go ahead. Sorry. I will just add a couple of other items just from our go-to-market side of the house, because obviously, we have espoused the benefits in share expansion for some time. But even the last month, we have taken advantage actually of like, listen, there is macroeconomic uncertainty. People are trying to save money.
In Jira Service Management, we actually increased the entry level from three agents for free to 10 agents for free, which actually is for, like, if you think about it, a company of 200 people will largely have 10 agents at most.
So we are helping really get many, many, many of our existing customers or new customers coming in the door to start using Jira Service Management in anger at no cost whatsoever. And of course, over time, we will continue to get them to upgrade the paid plans or move to premium versions of our products. So, once again, in this downturn, we are taking advantage to capture market share.
And then on the larger side of the house, like, in -- while we absolutely go into, hey, how do we start at a team or in a department, where can we basically help companies be a little bit more nimble, a little bit more fast and not have to think about it ripping to replace the entire IT platform, that’s been our primary strategy.
However, there are many companies out there that are trying to save money, trying to consolidate spend and Jira Service Management is a massive savings compared to many of the alternatives in the industry and we give a great compelling offering for customers to move to. So we have seen other strategies across the Board pay off in the recent quarters. Perfect. Thank you very much. Very helpful. Your next question comes from Ryan MacWilliams from Barclays. Please go ahead. Thanks for taking the question. So data center continues to gain share as a percentage of your sales. Are you seeing stronger than expected migrations to data center instead of cloud at this point and what is driving the commentary for moderating data center growth in the second half? Thanks. Yeah. This is Cameron again. And yeah, data center is a fantastic offering. I just have to say that. Like, there’s a reason people use data center, it’s provides the scale, mission criticality performance that many of our customers demand, especially in many of our largest enterprise customers.
As I mentioned prior, this is all about a multiyear journey away from server and to cloud and data center, and we have been making cloud the primary destination for these customers and we have been seeing those migration rates to cloud, hitting very much in line with our expectations.
However, many of the customers that potentially we might have seen say on server longer or potentially go to alternative solutions are choosing data centers. So we have seen data center continue to be an increasing space of demand for many of our server customers in the interim.
But I also need to call out that the path from server to data center is not a dead end. We treat -- continue to see many people moving from data center to cloud. In fact, half of our migrated paid seats that go from on-premises come from data center customers to the cloud.
So we see this as just a -- moving to data center is a great thing. The future investment in Atlassian, it’s more commitment to our products and absolutely sets us up for future cloud migrations in the years to come. And then, Ryan, to take the second part of your question. In terms of the guide, we continue to expect data center revenue growth to moderate in H2, that’s primarily because we are lapping some of the event driven growth in the prior year.
I would also highlight, though, our outlook is better than we expected three months ago, driven by the strong Q2 billings performance that we saw.
And then, lastly, it’s always good to remind everyone that data center revenue growth can be volatile given the portion of upfront revenue recognition in DC sales. So, as you think about the DC business performance, keep that in mind, as well as some of the pricing changes that are being implemented this month. Appreciate the color. Thanks. Your next question comes from Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Thanks. I want to go back to Work Management at the last Investor Day, this was one of the three key pillars of growth for you going forward and not mentioned even once in your press release, which I found quite strange. Can you -- outside of Confluence, can you talk about the rest of the portfolio there, would it be fair to say that growth over there is perhaps underwhelming, that competitively you are not getting the win rates that you would like to see against, yes and no, the Mondays of the world [ph]. Help me understand why such an important area of investment growth is not mentioned even once in your press release? Yeah. I will take that, Ittai. I am not -- no, I wouldn’t be curious at all. Look, I think, we are incredibly bullish on Work Management. So to your question there, I don’t think so. It’s -- I would say, it’s a different point in its life cycle as a market currently to where ITSM is, which is why us calling that out particularly in the press release. There are no favorite children at Atlassian don’t worry.
Atlas is doing really well, right? But it’s a very new product. We always say it takes two years, three years, four years, five years to build a great product and a franchise, and we are patient long-term investors towards doing that.
Everything in Work Management is targeted towards the Fortune 500,000. So Atlas and Jira Work Management, both of which are the newest offerings in that space. It’s early in their journey. I can’t say that enough, but we are pretty bullish, both Scott and I have been around two decades now and seen plenty of 1.0 products and 1.1 products and 2.0 products and understand how product S codes of adoption work in our customer base and so we are working diligently on that and both the teams are working really hard there.
Confluence continues to go from strength-to-strength. It’s always been a shining light in the Atlassian portfolio and continues to be so. So it doesn’t mean from the press release or anything else that we aren’t there. Again, we continue to get analyst recommendations and plaudits in various different waves and charts and all the different bits and pieces there.
And we continue to get great encouragement from our customers that we are the only Work Management vendor at scale and we are one of the largest scale wealth management voters out there that combines their technical and non-technical teams. This is increasingly a challenge for customers as they look across all sorts of different work that they are trying to manage.
Just as Cameron and Scott were talking about, ITSM being close to the modern ways of operating DevOps and DevSecOps and everything else. Same with work management, how do you get your marketing and finance and business teams closer to your engineering and operations teams, that’s a huge strength of ours in the area that we continue to do well from. Great. Good. I appreciate it. Thank you. Can I just come in there, if I -- just before we move on, because one thing we tried to do, we have got so much great news at Atlassian and one thing we try to do with our shareholder letters, we focus on one of our three markets at a time.
And so last quarter, we focused entirely on Work Management, and this quarter, we chose another market. And so, hopefully, we don’t continue to -- we are doing that. But what we really wanted to do is go deeper on one market at a time to help educate you our investors.
And so, I have to say, I want to get that across to people, maybe next quarter this people will think if we provide something else and that was the intent behind it. And again, think like, for us the way the collaborative work highlighted were a strong performer in our press release and so forth. But our intent is to go deep once a quarter with one market. Thank you so much. Your next question comes from Cindy Frances [ph] from Citi. Please go ahead. It’s Fatima Boolani from Citi. That’s the first time I heard that. Thank you for taking my question. Either for Joe or Cameron, I wanted to ask a broader question about your pricing strategy. So we appreciate you have been very consistent and transparent with your pricing increases in the base as it relates the server offerings and related maintenance offerings, as well as data center and data center maintenance. But I am curious to get your perspective on what type of customer feedback you are getting clearly because we are kind of in a different state of the market environment and in the macro environment. So I wanted to assess if there’s maybe potential fatigue from customers in terms of the discussions you are having on this front as you take prices up. And as a related matter, if you raise the floor on the pricing on these predecessors or form factors, relative to cloud, why is it that we are not necessarily seeing a more pronounced follow-through in cloud migration? Thank you. Yeah. This is Cameron. I am happy to talk about pricing strategy. It is a large portion of my day. So effectively, I think, you nailed one of the key points is consistency. Largely, we have been very consistent in the last few years in the size, quantum and timing of both our cloud price increases, as well as our server and data center price increases.
And that actually is to our advantage. Many of our customers understand, they expect and they budget ahead of those pricing. You also realize from a macro pricing perspective, Atlassian, our overall strategy is still to be the value leader that we are, when you look to a potential alternatives that at any -- they are close to the feature comparison, we are a fraction of the price of those competitors. So we always maintain that from that perspective.
I will be perfectly honest, going into this fiscal year and planning out our price increases, the cloud price increases in October and the server data center price increases in February that, I had my concerns, I have met with many of my customer -- my customer-facing teams, our renewal teams and so on to discuss how we were going to address potential customer feedback, and of course, how we are going to plan and address that.
I am very happy to say that, actually the price increases that we have done recently, both in October and now, actually it had no material different feedback from our customers than we have seen in previous years. So I have to say that, that’s a very big positive for us right now and once again shows the value that our products deliver.
On your next piece is, well, hey, you are doing these price increases, you are doing larger price increases on your server and data center products to effectively more incentivize the customers to choose cloud and I have to say, actually, that is driving exactly what we have expected on our cloud migrations and that’s why our cloud migrations are going -- driving that 10% growth that we have communicated over and again.
However, whenever we do a price increase on, say, server or data center, we also see customers having the option to go, hey, you know what we are thinking about data center, now is a very, very good time. Let’s do that before that price increase goes fully effective and we will see that uptick as well. That’s really impossible to understand exactly those dynamics of who’s going to choose cloud or data center through all of that.
But in general, what we have seen overall is much more customers sticking with us, either choosing to renew server or move to data center or move to cloud than we originally expected when we started this journey a couple of years ago. So, overall, no major pushback on our pricing strategy and our pricing strategy is delivering exactly what we engineered it to do, which is to incentivize our customers to choose cloud. I appreciate it. Thank you. Your next question comes from Peter Weed from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Thank you for taking my question today and all the details that you have been providing on all these other questions. Going to piece together a couple of comments that you have made so far and see number one, if I am understanding this and what the implications might be. Correct me if I am wrong, but it sounds like more of the headcount headwinds you have been seeing are really more on the non-technical side. I think you had a good case around developers are finding jobs easily and the strength in JSM and things like IT suggesting strength there. So correct me if I am wrong, that that’s where more the headcount headwinds are on the more non-technical side? And then I am trying to square that with what I have considered to be a very understandable story for these non-technical people being a very natural and important part of delivering products. What are you seeing that’s driving the weakness in those employees and how your customers are working? Are they changing how they work -- how they work and what confidence do you have that after this macro, they are going to go back to having the scale of teams that they might have had before on the non-technical side that will bring back the growth on that side of the business? Hey. It’s Scott here. And I think what you are asking is, hey, there’s a lot of tailwind behind software over the last couple of years. What does the future look like in those areas? And I get confidence around Atlassian for a whole bunch of ratings.
One is that, software is a general category and going anywhere, like, it’s in every area, whether it’s cards or it’s delivery or the AI/ML and stuff like that, that’s all going to affect everything like that we believe like all these innovations are going to require software developers. And so there’s macro time, like, yeah, people rebalancing their software teams at the moment, but the long-term trend is strong, but like there can be more and more people there.
Two is that because Atlassian helps connect the entire organization to get work done and we hope basically move more forward across the entire organization, we are not to holding to just the R&D headcount. And so as companies increase all the people involved with technical areas or non-technical areas, we are there to help them collaborate and so that helps me do well.
Also, if you look at our penetration inside companies, our largest accounts are smallest accounts, like we still have large increases like we are very well penetrated in the organization. And so I get comfort that over time our seats per customer will go up and we are not any sort of point of saturation there.
And lastly, if you look at the products, like, our product customer or products to see is still relatively low compared to the opportunity we have ahead of us. And so we have always tried to focus on not the things that do change but the things that don’t change over the long-term, I know Jefferies just talked about at Amazon, that’s something they focus on is -- focus on things on -- investments on areas that don’t change.
And teamwork and humans working together is a problem that’s always going to exist over the long-term and that’s where our investments have been. So I can’t predict the next 18 months, what look like in the broader macro economy, but I woke up and I feel like very well placed for the long-term. Thank you. Your next question comes from Mark Cash from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Thanks for the question. This is Mark on for Adam. I kind of wonder how level that the TEAM was asking and I was wondering if you could expand upon the impact of migrating data center and server advantage pricing customers to list pricing in regards to how that’s baked into the revenue margin guidance you just provided? Thank you. Well, I can speak. This is Cameron again. I will speak to the overall -- how we think about the pricing strategy broadly. The idea here right now, as you know, many of our server -- the server pricing that we have today, especially for higher tier customers, above 500 users on our 2,000 user 10,000 limited. There’s a significant price difference between server and data center or cloud. Today, if the customer chooses cloud over data center for those customers, cloud is a less expensive option.
However, the bulk of our data center customers are sitting on pricing that is significantly less than our cloud list price today. And what you have seen over the last few years is us doing incremental price increases to effectively close that gap.
All that pricing is available online. We expose all of it to our customers. None of it is hidden. All of our customers get the same price. And if you look to our historic price changes over the last few years, you can see that we are slowly closing that gap between legacy data center pricing and our cloud list price.
So within the next few years, eventually all customers, at least ,from a pricing perspective, have the incentive to choose cloud regardless. As far as how much growth that’s driving for our business, once again, that goal of 10% of revenue growth in the cloud is coming from these server or data center to cloud migrations. And then, Mark, this is Joe. The guidance -- the revenue guidance incorporates what Cam just said. We continue to assume that migrations will remain healthy. And then I would also say from a pricing impact on the model, just keep in mind, we do have ratable recognition on subscription which is over 80% of our revenue. So the timing on the renewals that happened throughout the year, you won’t see an impact when we go through those types of pricing changes. So we have also included that in the guidance as well. Your next question comes from Ari Terjanian from Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. Yes. Thank you for taking the question. Just wanted to double click on some of the investments you are making around the enterprise strategy. Can you just give an update what you are doing there to drive traction, maybe speak to some of the partner consolidation that’s occurred recently. And if there’s anything you are doing differently there to drive further migration and maybe speak to some of the multiyear contracts that were called out most recently to exit this quarter? Thank you. Yeah. Hi, Ari. Let me take the first half of that and then I will leave Cameron do the second half on the multiyear contracts. From the point of view of what we are doing, we have been on a long and consistent journey, right? We continue to be long-term oriented and thoughtful about how we approach the enterprise space as one of our major transformation as a business over the last decade, you would argue.
In terms of specifically what we are doing? Look, you have seen us continue to open performance and scale. So the scale offering we have continued to move up in the cloud. We now have 35,000 users in GA and 50,000 users is in EAP and you can bet that we have teams continuing to work on those sorts of aspects.
At the same time, our performance for individual customers has massively improved at those life scales over time. So it’s not just the ability to handle user volume, it is about the performance that those customers get, especially in lower spec to desktop environments with other Internet connections as we continue to get more and more global and have customers and users all around the world.
We continue to work on governance. We long believers that, if you look forward, you are going to have more governmental regulation in different countries, different geographies, different industry areas and that our platform and our infrastructure has to handle that. You saw that this quarter, we shipped a data residency in Germany. We continue in testing in other regions. We continue to do things like BaFin and financial services compliance in different areas of the world and we will continue to add more in those areas as we build them out over time. You can see all the details in the apps that we give over time.
And the third part we are working on is continuing and extensibility in the cloud. The reason that, that’s an enterprise concern is, because obviously, the larger our customers are the more they customize our software for themselves. Forge is a fantastic mechanism to customize our cloud offerings for themselves. Larger customers tend to have very bespoke things they want to integrate with various internal systems.
The ability to do that have us run it for them, have us handle things like data residency and handle the server loads and everything for them is a huge benefit of the cloud and we see customers moving for reasons like that. It simplifies their offering is one of our goals with the cloud right. We do all the hard yards so they can just focus on their businesses. Cameron? Yeah. And in addition to all of the R&D investments we have made to better serve our enterprise customers, I am extremely happy and proud of what we consider our enterprise transformation on the go-to-market side of our business. We have invested heavily to get closer to our largest customers and help them through this strategic transformation to the cloud, while maintaining some of the most efficient sales and marketing spend that you see in the industry and that’s the balancing act that we have had over the last couple of years.
But do you think we have had much more enterprise account managers to take care of our customers. We invested in technical account managers and solution architects to have more strategic conversations about the road map with our products longer term. We have things like executive advisory boards and deep dives and CIO counsel. This has actually allowed us to have strategic relationships with our customers and think much more long-term about how our products will be used in the future in their businesses.
You also mentioned you saw this in our channel with our partners that we have seen significant outside investment, as well as consolidation in our massive solution partner network. While we have over 700 solution partners, we see many of these customers or many of these partners starting to consolidate. I see this as a massive advantage for our customers as these companies provide more scale and more optionality for our customers and once again deliver more value, but also good for our ecosystem. Like any additional investment in our ecosystem will only drive higher, better outcomes for our business and for our customers.
And lastly, on the multiyear piece, it’s simply the nature of larger, more strategic deals. If we are going to go into one of the largest banks in the world or a large pharmaceutical or telecommunications firms, we are having a conversation with the CIO about a transformation to the cloud or enabling IT service management or work manager for their organizations. They are going to want a longer term commitment and that’s where you see these multiyear contracts increasing in the enterprise. Thanks. Thank you. That’s all the questions we have time for today. I will now turn the call over to Scott for closing remarks. Thanks everyone for joining our call today. As always, we appreciate your thoughts or questions and your continued support. And thank you to all the Atlassian all over the world for your dedication and resiliency. We hope that you are able to join us next week, either in person in Berlin or virtually at our Agile and DevOps event, Unleash.","this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of Atlassian’s website following this call .

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of Atlassian’s website following this call.
I will now hand the call over to Martin Lam, Atlassian’s Head of Investor Relations. Welcome to Atlassian’s third quarter of fiscal year 2023 earnings call. Thank you for joining us today.
Joining me on the call today, we have Atlassian’s Co-Founders and Co-CEOs, Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes; our Chief Revenue Officer, Cameron Deatsch; and Chief Financial Officer, Joe Binz.
Earlier today, we published a shareholder letter and press release with our financial results and commentary for our third quarter fiscal year 2023. The shareholder letter is available on Atlassian’s Work Life blog and the Investor Relations section of our website, where you will also find other earnings related materials, including the earnings press release and supplemental investor data sheet.
As always, our shareholder letter contains management’s insights and commentary for the quarter. So during the call today, we will have brief opening remarks and then focus our time on Q&A.
This call will include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions. If any such risks or uncertainties materialize or if any of the assumptions prove incorrect, our results could differ materially from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements we make. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Forward-looking statements represent our management’s belief, assumptions only as of the date such statements we are made and we undertake no obligation to update or revise such statements should they change or cease to be current.
Further information on these and other factors that could affect our financial results is included in filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time-to-time, including the section titled Risk Factors in our most recently filed annual and quarterly reports.
During today’s call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are in addition to and are not a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is available in our shareholder letter, earnings release and investor data sheet on the IR website.
Please keep in mind that we would like to allow as many of you to participate in Q&A as possible. To facilitate that, we will take one question at a time. Please rejoin the queue if you have another question or a follow-up, and we will do our best to come back to you later in the session.
With that, I will turn the call over to Scott for opening remarks. Thank you for joining us today. As you've already read in our shareholder letter, we delivered another solid quarter of financial results and continue the steady drum beat of innovation to help our customers transform the way they work. We've just wrapped Team '23, our annual Atlassian conference where we gathered with thousands of customers and partners.
The Atlassian community has never been stronger, and the enthusiasm for our product announcements was unmatched. We introduced Atlassian Intelligence, a virtual teammate, which uses generative AI technology and leverages the Atlassian platform to accelerate customers' work in a way that is tailored to them. With 20 years of knowledge reflecting how hundreds of thousands of software I-team, IP and business teams plan, track, and deliver work, Atlassian Intelligence is like a floodlight lighting up new customer insights. We're excited to see how AI will unleash our customer's potential and strengthen our competitive advantage.
In addition to Atlassian Intelligence, we also announced exciting new features and platform enhancements, including Confluence, whiteboards and databases support for up to 50,000 users now Cloud and Beacon, our new threat detection and mitigation product, just to name a few. It's incredibly exciting to think about the opportunities we have in front of us with unique features and capabilities for Atlassian Intelligence and the platform innovations we're delivering. Customers are more enthusiastic than ever to migrate to the cloud and move forward to helping them on that journey.
With that, I'll pass the call to the operator for Q&A. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
Your first question comes from Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho Securities. Gregg, your question please. Okay. Thank you very much for taking the question. Good afternoon, everyone. You mentioned in the shareholder letter that the Q4 guide includes an assumption of increasing headwinds for churn and for premium addition upsells, even though you've yet to see a significant impact in those areas. And I think that's prudent. But wondering if you could contextualize this a bit more for us. For instance, are you basing in a modest incremental headwind or would you say that it's more substantial than that? Yeah. Thanks Gregg. Really no change to our guidance approach that we took back in February. When it comes to the cloud guidance, specifically that cloud guidance range assumes the macroeconomic environment gets worse in Q4 and year-to-date trend lines continue into Q4. You’re right to call out. The fact that the low end of that range not only assumes continued weakness in the two drivers that we've seen to date around paid seat expansion at existing customers and free to paid conversions, but it also does include some macro impact to areas that have held up well year-to-date, like churn upsell and migrations. So we do expect and have built in pretty substantial macroeconomic headwinds at the low end of that range.
The other thing I'd call out really quickly is if you take that Q4 guidance, it puts our full year FY23 cloud guidance at 37% year-over-year. That's squarely within the range of the 35% to 40% we provided in February. So really no fundamental change overall in our cloud outlook or our approach to guidance. Thank you, Joe. It's helpful. The next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies. Brent, your question please. Joe, EMEA grew 22% this quarter. I think last quarter was 30%. It seems like you had some weakness in the region. Can you just give us a sense what happened there? And maybe I'm just reading too much into the numbers, but anything to call out there. Yeah. Awesome. Thanks Brent and great to hear from you. I'll start and then I'll let Cameron chime in. In EMEA, revenue trends tend to be quite volatile quarter-to-quarter than the U.S. And the reason for that is pretty simple. EMEA has been slower to adopt the cloud, so there is more data center revenue and the EMEA sales mix. And DC, as you know, is inherently more volatile for two reasons. One is revenue recognition. 20% of DC license value is recognized upfront. And then secondarily, customer purchasing behavior around data center pricing changes also creates some volatility. So I wouldn't read too much into that. It's typically just a function of quarter-to-quarter volatility, but I'll pass it to Cameron for more of the customer insight. Yeah. Repeating what Joe said there. But I would like to speak just to the cloud adoption in EMEA. Obviously, we do see cloud adoption lagging behind U.S. and the Americas, but in general, over the last year as we've done things like data residency in Germany as well as higher requirements for ban fee for financial services organizations, we've been able to see more and more of our larger customers in Europe choosing to go to cloud. We actually worked with a very large European bank over the last few months getting them signed up for cloud, and we're starting to migrate them today. So I will see that -- although they're lagging, we are seeing that adoption continuing to increase more in line with the U.S. numbers. Thank you. The next question comes from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Excellent. I'm going to sneak in two questions. One, kind of more tactical and short term in nature and one longer term. On the short term, and this is going off of Gregg's question, I think what a lot of people are trying to understand is what the shape of the quarter was and how demand held up through the quarter? And whether that influenced sort of the more conservative Q4 guide. So, maybe if Cameron gives us a view on kind of like how the quarter progressed.
The longer term question comes from sort of, I think the debate that all of us are having around like large language models and generative AI on whether they're going to be disruptive, or complimentary to a lot of existing businesses. You guys have already rolled out functionality when it comes to your service -- the ITSM side of the equation. So how do you guys think about that question of the -- by sort of the risk of being displaced by people utilizing these new technologies versus your ability and what's going to make you sticky and being able to benefit from them.
And does that necessitate at all kind of changing the pricing model, moving away from the pricing model, maybe to better sort of account for the value that you're adding that doesn't take place with the agent itself, but takes place on the platform actually doing a lot more of the work. Thanks for the question, Keith. This is Joe. I'll take the first part with Cameron and then Mike will chime in on the second. In terms of the linear nature of the quarter, we did not see anything unusual about the linearity of our billings in the quarter, nor did we see anything unusual in the month of April where trends were consistent with Q3. Cam? Perfect. Yeah. I'd say the only thing is, as all of you know, we did a price change on our server and data center licensing in mid-February. That, of course, causes some behavior throughout the quarter, but no -- nothing significant throughout the quarter beyond the -- reaction to the price changes. Mike? Yeah. Thanks Keith. Great question. Look, quite clearly what I can say from Atlassian's point of view, we think that AI large language models, as you mentioned, is a huge opportunity for us as a business. If you look at our fundamentals, we've always tried to solve human problems, not technology problems, right? Which means we have a lot of customer knowledge and data and trusted to us over the last two decades. We have a fantastic platform to build on top of that connects that, that knowledge together. And we have a guarantee team to build features on top of these things. So AI allows our customers to be significantly more efficient to get to our mission of unleashing the potential of every team. That's what we believe it will do.
So from our point of view, we think our best opportunity to grow our business through the Atlassian Intelligence feature set is to drive customer growth, right? We have a goal of -- in the long-term winning the Fortune 500,000, not the Fortune 500. And we think that these technologies will help us get there. That's why we're including the features in all additions rather than as a separate skew. It's not a good customer experience and we think we'll slow adoption to put it that way around.
We also, obviously, have a major trend as you roll -- well, we're all in -- the migrations to the cloud in our business. Our largest customers in data center have the most amount of knowledge and data built up over time, which hence they can get the most amount of efficiency. And with this feature set being only available in the cloud, it's a further reason for them to migrate or bring forward their migrations. And as we know that the migrated customers have really great economics for Atlassian, faster expansion rates, et cetera. So, that's the reason we are looking at it that way. Fundamentally, yes, a huge advantage for our customers, which is why we're in this business in the first place. And secondly, that's how we're looking at growing Atlassian's business through the Atlassian Intelligence feature set. Awesome. Appreciate the color. Your next question comes from Fatima Boolani from Citi. Please go ahead. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. Mike, maybe for you, or Scott, on that the Jira Service Management product pillar, a lot of activity and action in really boosting the use cases that JSM can be deployed in specifically around external customer support use cases. And we're familiar with certain vendors in that market. So I'm curious what else needs to happen to really drive more monetization scale in JSM, and particularly in the context of some of your very large customers who are working through a headcount retrenchment process where JSM can be a very labor inflationary investment. And then a quick follow up for Joe, if I may. Sure. I can certainly take that for you, Fatima. Look, we remain incredibly bullish on our position in the ITSM and ASM spaces. And obviously Jira Service Management is a huge part of that. I think as customers naturally are looking to be more efficient with their spend in a more turbulent and economic time, that would lead to advantages in Jira Service Management and continue to push those. We've invested heavily with Atlassian Intelligence feature sets and virtual agents and all sorts of other technologies that make customers more efficient, make agents more efficient, fundamentally allow them to process more requests per day, per hour, with hopefully greater custom fidelity as well. So, that's one of the reasons we're incredibly bullish at the moment.
Second is Jira Service Management, just to remind people, it lands predominantly in IT teams, but it does have a great expansion story to other parts of the organization in terms of like HR, finance, marketing, legal areas which are fundamentally service-driven parts of an organization, that have their customers being other parts of the organization. That has long been our thesis. Again, our fundamental philosophy is that there are far more agents we believe inside a company than other companies, think other vendors think, because we're not just targeting the IT team. That said, obviously we have a wonderful landing spot through the development and IT organization and expansion, and we continue to see that throughout the quarter as customers increasingly use Jira Service Management outside of IT teams. And that's a long term growth factor for us. I appreciate that detail. Joe, the question for you is just on the cloud trajectory. I know a lot of us have been grappling with how that segment is digesting and absorbing the pretty meaningful moderation you've seen and see expansion. And I know you alluded to in your shareholder letter that churn levels necessarily have not increased. But can you help us sort of understand, or at least, maybe put a -- some sort of a downside cap on how you're thinking about that dynamic where you're really actively trying to manage gross seat churn in order to support growth in that segment? Yeah. Thanks for the question, Fatima. When we look at the churn rates, especially customer churn, it's been very consistent and stable throughout the year. That suggests there's nothing that's changed from our structural competitive position. Customers continue to come to our site, try our products, our monthly active users, our free instances. All of that seems very healthy and strong. So churn has not been a big issue for us.
The primary driver of the pressure that we're seeing in that cloud segment is really around paid seat expansion at existing customers and the free-to-paid conversion rates that we've talked about. The remainder of the business, whether it's migrations or upsell or cross-sell, all those drivers pricing -- all those drivers continue to be very healthy from our perspective. So, that's really been the core issue that we've been working through. Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Hey, great. Thanks. Good afternoon. Appreciate you taking the question. Maybe one from me on margin. We entered the year expecting mid-teens operating margin. You just delivered a second consecutive quarter of 20%-plus. Maybe Joe, if you can speak to what's driving that uplift.
And then as a second part, at the investor session, there was a comment around fiscal 2024 as a year of continued investment. So any color in helping us square that with just anything else you're doing to help optimize on the cost side as we're thinking through the puts and takes of margin trajectory and some of the offsets you have within your control. Thank you. Yeah. Great question. Thanks for asking. If you look at our operating margin performance in the quarter, we did outperform our expectations by six to seven percentage points. Five points of that was driven by lower operating expenses and better operating leverage. Those operating expenses were -- favorability was driven in two primary areas.
First, we had less than expected payroll related costs from lower bonus expenses and headcount, including about $10 million in savings related to our restructuring. And then secondarily, we had less than expected discretionary costs in areas like professional services and T&E as part of our plan that we discussed earlier in the year to be responsive to the macro impact on our business and align our cost structure with revenue growth.
I'll let Scott talk to the comments at Team '23. The last point I would make just is the focus for the team has been around maximizing the return on every dollar spent, making discipline prioritization and resource allocation calls, and driving operational efficiencies. And I really believe the team has done a really good job this year of executing across those three things, and that's what you see showing up in that operating expense favorability. Scott? Yeah. Just to reiterate what you'd mentioned, Michael, for those that weren't at our investor call, our team conference, but yeah, we did say that. We see FY24 being a continued investment year. We still see huge opportunities out there in those areas. We talked about migrations, enterprise ITSM, that we're being aggressive in investing behind. And we expect those investments to continue through FY24. Of course, they're taking into account everything posted. Thank you. Your next question comes from Kash Rangan from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Hi. Thank you very much. Just a quick couple of introspective questions here. The cloud growth trade is certainly looking to be set for deceleration in Q4. As you look at next year, is there any reason to believe that cloud growth rate could reaccelerate at some point in fiscal 2024 based on your assessment of timeline of migrations and the product readiness? And also as it relates to generative AI, I'm wondering if you can -- and it's been hard to get clarity out of company management because it's such a nebulous topic. To the best of your abilities, can you prognosticate if this will mean that you will need fewer developers and fewer service people? Therefore, there is the idea of a shrinking TAM, but then you gain share relative to the TAM because your technology will allow to displace workers that do not have the generative AI capability. Or is it that -- it actually grows the pie because the number of developers will actually grow because the barrier to software development comes down. So people like me can start develop, hopefully that should not be the case. But how should we think about the TAM implication from a headcount perspective as a result of generative AI and what it does for developers and service people? Thank you so much. Hey, Kash. This is Joe. Thanks for the question. Obviously, we aren't providing specific quantitative guidance on FY24, but I would offer up the following how to think about it directionally, specifically as it relates to the cloud space. The big caveat I always offer here is on revenue. There's lots of moving parts, but the biggest being the macroeconomic outlook, which is highly uncertain. And as you've seen in FY23, that can have an impact on our business. We're not immune to those factors.
Beyond macro, I'd have you think about the following. Mathematically, we will have easier comps as we move through the next year. We will have a significant event in the second half of the year with the server end of life. And our focus there is really on migrating those customers to either our cloud preferably or data center offerings. We'll also have some benefit from pricing as prior price increases and less loyalty discounts layer into the model. And then lastly, the decisions that we've made this year around rebalancing and reprioritization to reinvigorate revenue growth will begin to land and have positive impact as we move through FY24.
So in the end, macro's going to play a big role and we'll see what that ultimately brings. But hopefully that helps you think through some of the other dynamics that will relate to cloud revenue and FY24.
Mike? Yeah. Kash, I can chip in if you're looking for prognostication, that's probably my column. I would answer two ways personally. Firstly, the software world, if you want to think about it, you ask if there's going to be less developers, et cetera. My view and our house view, I suppose is no, right? The simple answer to that is software is not demand constrained. It is supply constrained. We are constrained by the supply of developers in the world, not the demand, the number of ideas for pieces of software we could create. So, when you create tooling that makes it possible for efficiency of any form, you will soak up more of that demand with the existing supply. The supply won't go down. The number of developers, I don't think it goes down that's not the way, sort of human creativity, which is ultimately to software works.
Secondly, when you make software developers more efficient, if you're talking about artificial intelligence or large language models with code assistance and writing code, et cetera, or creating parts of software that makes far more software. The more software there is in the world, that's good for Atlassian in a generalized sense. We are not necessarily working on individual developers. Again, in Jira software, they're about a quarter of the audience are software developers. The more software you have -- the more need you have for still designers and program managers and making sure that we have the right software that we're building, you now have a lot of software to operate and run and manage. So the more software there is in the world, that's generally I think a good thing for Atlassian. There will be puts and takes across this world as it flows through. But those have been my two fundamental points.
We maintain incredible optimism for artificial intelligence and what it can do for us as a business to help unleash a potential of our customers, to help them create and manage more software in that market of our three markets. Thanks Mike. I will learn the code [ph]. Thank you. Your next question comes from Michael Turits from KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Hey, guys. I wanted to just talk about data center versus cloud. You're seeing that some of those impacts around expansion free-to-paid impacting cloud, data center beat in the quarter, and it sounds like you're looking for only a minor decel in data center going into the next quarter. So could you tell us what's supporting that growth on a relative basis versus cloud? Yeah. Thanks for the question, Michael. This is Joe. You're right. Data center had another strong quarter of revenue growth that accelerated to 47% and was better than we expected. And that was primarily driven by two things, stronger than expected renewals and better than expected seat expansions at existing customers. We were helped a little by deal pull forward resulting from the price change in February, but it was largely consistent with prior year and only slightly higher than our expectations and certainly not nearly as significant or pronounced as it was two years ago.
Having said that, migrations from data center to cloud remain very healthy. Year-to-date, over 50% of cloud migrations are coming from data center and that's up from about a third a year ago. So we've got good progress there as well.
And then in terms of the guidance, we do expect growth rates there to moderate a little bit in Q4 and beyond, and that's really driven by increasing migrations from data center and cloud and server to cloud, as we remove migration blockers and add compelling features and value to our cloud offering. And then secondly, in the data center, we are starting to lap strong prior year comparables in Q4. And so that's another factor in the growth guidance that we've given. Okay. Yeah. This is Cameron. I'll -- let's add a little bit on the data center side. Just largely basically talking to customers, we were at Team '23, roughly a few weeks ago, our many of our largest customers are there and many of those customers are still on data center, have been on data center for many years. Now just say just the tone with those customers over the last few years. I'd say last team, or a few years ago, three years ago, it was always about like, why should I move to cloud? What are the capabilities? Are you going to get to my data privacy requirements? You name it. I'd say that tone this year, just talking with all those customers is, okay, how do I get there? Right? You delivered the new AI, we have these new functionality. We're bought in now help us, guide us through this plan. And I just think that overall tonal shift has been super positive and helping get more data center customers moving to cloud going forward. Your next question comes from Keith Bachman from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Hi. Thank you. My question relates to what Cameron was just talking about. As you think about just philosophically in FY24, would you expect data center to continue to outgrow cloud or, do the compares and some of the other feature set things you were just talking about?
And then underneath that, you've talked pretty consistently about cloud is getting the benefit of 10 points of growth associated with conversions. As you think about what happens to that 10 points as you anniversary or get beyond the server date, which is mid-Feb a year away from now, does that cloud conversion go to zero? Or is there continued benefit as you migrate longer term from data center to cloud when you in fact perhaps move to enterprise version? So in other words, is there still a longer term benefit of cloud conversion or does that 10 points go to zero? Thank you. Thank you. So, this is Cameron. I'll talk to just largely the customer choice ahead of us. You're absolutely right. So server end of life goes into effect February of next year, and we still have a variety of server customers still sitting out there on a variety of sizes that are effectively need to make that choice between now and February. And many are doing it month by month. Obviously, many are going to wait till the last minute to make that choice. And they do have two choices.
Now, obviously we're going to lead and try and get as many of those customers to choose cloud, but obviously we have data center as a very strong capable version for them going forward. So, I see that continued option out. Post 2024, we'll still have a sizable data center customer base on which to continue migrate customers to the cloud. So, this migration journey that we are on does not stop February of next year. It is a multi-year journey as we continue to get all of our on-premises customers eventually to the cloud. Yeah. Thanks Cam. And I would say, nothing more to add to that. Beyond we continue to invest to grow and accelerate that migration to the cloud. We're removing blockers. We're making migration easier through tooling and support investments. We're also closing the gap on pricing between advantage pricing on DC and cloud with our overall pricing strategy. And just overall the cloud platform provides the best experience, whether it's analytics or automation or AI or collaboration and better TCO, those factors will only increase over time. And then, just to reiterate what Cameron said, there's a lot of runway left on that cloud migration story. And we expect to continue to see that even after the server end of life. Okay. Perfect. Many thanks. Your next question comes from Fred Havemeyer from Macquarie. Fred, please go ahead. Hey, thank you very much. I wanted to ask about Beacon. Actually, it caught my attention in your shareholder letter. Offering -- it's an -- of course an early access product, but shifting and focusing a bit on cybersecurity as it relates to just Atlassian's cloud ecosystem seems an interesting adjacency here. And I'm curious, with this early access program, are you seeing signs that there's demand across your customer base for just a broader set of cybersecurity solutions? Is this something that you think is specifically monetizable? And is there any sort of scale of customer that is particularly applicable to? Thanks for the question. Scott, here. Just a reminder, so firstly, there's a big demand for this sort of product from Atlassian from our customers, particularly at our use of conference. And just customers are excited by this. And if you think about moving to cloud, customers want to make sure that their data is secured and there's things that we can do, and all that so we can do, and we can see the shape of usage of our products that allow us to work with our customers on flagging things that might be of interest to them.
As a reminder that this is not a generic security product. This is across our data and our cloud. Now we have advantages because we have one platform in the cloud and we can offer Beacon across most of our products. So, there's an advantage there from a sort of consolidation perspective and from an IT admin play in a similar way you've seen us to access on the user authentication side. But this is really a product to help customers be very comfortable and with how their data gets used in the cloud. And in most cases, what we can offer here is, again, ahead of what the customers could do themselves in a behind the firewall setting. And so this is just yet another example of how the cloud is overall better for our customers than what they can do themselves and another reason for them to migrate. The next question comes from Alex Zukin from Wolfe Research. Alex, please go ahead. Hey, guys. This is Alan on for Alex Zukin. I just wanted to ask a financial question. If I think about the shape of NRR through the quarter, I know this isn't a metric you guys report to. But just to better understand the growth that you're seeing in the business, can you just at a high level talk about what that shape look like through the quarter and through April? Yeah. Thanks for the question. Unfortunately, no specifics to share with you today on the NRR. Given the macro pressure and headwinds, we do see on paid seat expansion, it is trending lower. There was nothing unusual about that trend in Q3 relative to Q1 and Q2. Those trends just continued into Q3. And I'd say lastly, the underlying fundamentals in our business remain very strong. We see no change to our structural competitive position, so we do expect those retention rates to recover once the macro picture stabilizes and improves. Got it. Okay. And just as a quick follow up. I appreciate the color on the guide for Q4 of cloud growth benefiting 10 points from migrations. Just so we kind of have the numbers correctly here, do you mind just kind of telling us like what that exact benefit was in this quarter and the last two quarters or so? Thank you. Yeah. We've consistently said we're getting -- overall approximately 10 points of revenue growth in the cloud business from migrations that hasn't changed dramatically throughout the year. Your next question comes from Ryan MacWilliams at Barclays. Ryan, please go ahead. Thanks for taking the questions. Just on a vertical standpoint, any verticals worth calling out that may have impacted the quarter or the guide? And at this point, do you have a sense maybe what percentage of server customers might choose to remain on server even past the end of life for a couple quarters after? Thanks. Yeah. This is Cameron. I'll take that. Yeah. Just from a customer perspective, as we mentioned, with over 250,000 customers and plus all industries geographies, the size of all type, we see that as kind of a massive competitive differentiation for Atlassian, giving us plenty of growth opportunities across the customer base for quite some time. The -- of course, the trends we've seen in seat expansion slowing down is broad based across the entire customer base that we see today. One advantage we have is that as every company starts bringing in more and more technology to deliver value to their customers, we obviously get to take advantage of that as we are helping companies with technology teams and business teams work better together going forward.
And then the second part on the server end of life thing, largely most of those customers we see -- there will be some that is a perpetual license. There will be some customers, we believe that most will choose cloud, some will go to data center and obviously some will continue to use the server licenses unsupported. Just about every customer size that I speak to largely is under a compliance requirement or just general it guidance is internally that they do not run unsupported software and that we'll be choosing cloud or data center post the end of life. So I really see that as a very small portion of the customer base. Your next question comes from Adam Tindle from Raymond James. Adam, please go ahead. Okay. Thank you. Maybe one for Mike or Scott. I was going back to my notes from this time last year where you announced free additions of cloud products. And you talked about it echoing an approach from 2008, 2009 where you brought in your customer base by offering a $10 starter license. So if we fast forward one year later, your customer account is still growing, so you're certainly broadening the base like you did in 2008, 2009. The question would be maybe take us back to the upsell motion from the starter license, and compare and contrast that to upselling from the free cloud, what you learned then and what you can apply now to improve cloud upsell. Thanks. Hey, Scott here, Adam. Great question. And so just reminder for those who haven't followed you asking stories for such a long time that back in the 2008, 2009 financial downturn, we introduced three versions of our behind the file products back then. And $10 starters, I was really -- what we introduced back then where you had to pay $10 and you got 10 uses of our products down from what was the couple of thousand dollars with our lowest price at the time. So very disruptive pricing changes. And that was a long-term play for us because we worked a lot of money on the table. People were previously paying us thousands of dollars, were now paying us $10 to get a version of our software.
And the good thing with that is it opens the funnel up to a whole bunch of companies that otherwise would not have considered our products and over the long term they go from 10 to 12 users and then start paying us on a different pricing curve.
So, echoing that, in the COVID time period a couple years ago, we introduced basically free versions of our products down from $10 a month in the cloud down to free. And soon we saw that open the funnel at the top of our customer acquisition side of things. And so natural questions asked, well, then how do you convert more of those free customers to paid? And how do you change that cycle? That is something we do look at. But honestly, most of our free-to-paid is based on usage and based on customer value and changing from 10 to 11 users. And one of the advantages of the Atlassian business model is that customers pay us as they start using more of our features, and we don't expand a huge amount of energy trying to call them, trying to encourage them. You could waste a lot of money in a sales motion doing that. And so what we do is spend a lot of time looking at the levels at which we charge for things and make sure that is the appropriate gates, and make sure we provide value to our customers. And so as they use our products more and more. We get the value as they increase their usage.
Now, not only have we done free -- at the start of COVID, when we saw a couple of months ago more interesting macroeconomic times, we decided to go harder on ITSM, on our JSM offering where we made it cheaper at the low end. And for competitive migrations for people that were switching out from other higher priced offerings. And so, at Atlassian, we talk sometimes about the price rises that come through at various parts of our cycle, but we also spend a lot of time working on how do we make it cheaper in other areas like in order to more aggressively get market share. And so for us it's a long-term play about getting market share and not really a short term sugar head [ph] of trying to convert those free customers to paid in any particular given time period. Makes sense. Thank you so much. The next question comes from Peter Weed from Bernstein. Peter, please go ahead. Thank you. I guess, there's two parts to this kind of both focused, maybe on a fall on even with the new customers. You certainly had a nice uptick this last quarter relative at the prior one on net new customers. And I guess there's two parts of it. One is we were backing out in our model, what portion of the -- kind of new revenue growth was coming from the two? And it looked like you were probably seeing kind of flat quarter-over-quarter revenue contribution from kind of new customers over the trailing 12 months. And most of the headwinds are really coming from existing customers. Does that seem about right? That the new customers were probably kind of like flattening and it was mostly the existing customers expansion that that had been the issue. Yeah. This is Cameron. I'll speak to the net new customer number. So, as we said before, the new customer number does jump around from quarter to quarter for a variety of reasons. That said, very glad to see the increase from Q2 to Q3 with over 6,500 net new customers. It's showing that there's continued demand for what we have, that we still can convert those free customers to paid customers. And it's nice to see the quarter on quarter increase. However, I do want to call out that challenge that we've been mentioning for the last few quarters of our conversion rate from free plans to paid plans is still lower than it was historically before we saw these macroeconomic headwinds.
As far as net new customer's impact into our short term revenue, it is minimal. And today where we always focus on the net new customer, overall number is really a better guide for our long-term portion of our business. Your next question from comes from Ari Terjanian from Cleveland Research. Your question please. Hi, all. Thanks for taking the question. Just a question on the cloud growth and expectations here. One, given the strength in data center, you called that out as better than expected in the quarter. Does that suggest potentially that future migrations to cloud may not be quite as pronounced, given customers are renewing on data center more than you expected?
And second, I believe in the shareholder letter it was called out for the first time there was an impact from seat count reductions. Do you believe that's more reflective of layoffs that are being -- that are occurring today or more reflective of the layoffs that we saw last year? Thank you. Yeah. Multi-part question here. This is Joe. I'll take part of it and then Cam will chime in. I'd say in terms of the data center to cloud migrations, not at all. We expect those to continue to be strong for the foreseeable future. Cam spoke earlier about the multi-year journey we're on. We continue to add a ton of value in the cloud. We continue to invest in migration, tooling and customer support. We continue to invest in data residency and scalability and certifications and extensibility and all the things, that are going to enable more customers in that data center category to move to the cloud. So, we remain very bullish on that opportunity.
Cam, you want to take the next part? Yeah. Yeah. I'll -- just the -- we see customers choosing data center as further investment in Atlassian. And our multi-year journey of getting customers to the cloud is very much on track with our expectations, and we increasingly are improve our ability to migrate customers every single day.
As far as you mentioned on the seat count reduction, in general I say is the biggest issue that we focus on is the paid seat expansion and customers are still expanding their seats. It's just not at the same rate that we saw before the macroeconomic headwinds. Of course, there are a subset of our customers, a very small subset, that have reduced their employee count over the last few months. And when their renewals come up, they're renewing at a lower tier than what they previously renewed, because they have less the users in their business. But overall, that is a small overall percentage of our customer base. The bulk of where we focus is really the paid seat expansion. Your next question comes from Jake Roberge from William Blair. Jake, please go ahead. Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to double click on that the data center strength you saw in the quarter. Is that more a result of new customers starting to land there or upsells within existing customers? Or is that really just the server migrations going more towards DC than you expected to cloud?
And then more of a high level one. But what's driving the seat expansion for DC versus the headwinds for cloud? Is that primarily a result of the enterprise focus in DC? Yeah. Thanks for the question. This is Joe. As we discussed earlier, when you look at that DC strength and resilience, it's really driven by two things better than expected renewals and then paid seat expansions at existing customers. Cam? Yeah. I have to say is this -- in the quarter, we have to remember we did do a price change on data center and that causes customers to make a choice whether they -- if they're thinking about adding users in the future there, it's a good compelling event that for them to choose data center. But once again, we see that path to data center. We prove it again and again. We have the ability to move data center customers to the cloud. Over the last year, half of the seats we've moved to the cloud are from data center customers. So, we see this as within the quarter. It's fantastic. People choose data center, but that's great. We can eventually get them to cloud and we're proving that every day. Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to Mike for closing remarks. I just wanted to say thank you everyone for your questions. Thank you to those who came to our analyst function at Team '23. And I hope you all have a fantastic rest of your day.","this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of Atlassian’s website following this call .

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of Atlassian’s website following this call.
I will now hand the call over to Martin Lam, Atlassian’s Head of Investor Relations. Welcome to Atlassian’s fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 earnings call. Thank you for joining us today.
Joining me on the call today, we have Atlassian’s Co-Founders and Co-CEOs, Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes; our Chief Revenue Officer, Cameron Deatsch; and Chief Financial Officer, Joe Binz.
Earlier today, we published a shareholder letter and press release with our financial results and commentary for our fourth quarter fiscal year 2023. The shareholder letter is available on Atlassian’s Work Life blog and the Investor Relations section of our website, where you will also find other earnings related materials, including the earnings press release and supplemental investor data sheet.
As always, our shareholder letter contains management’s insights and commentary for the quarter. So during the call today, we will have brief opening remarks and then focus our time on Q&A.
This call will include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions. If any such risks or uncertainties materialize or if any of the assumptions prove incorrect, our results could differ materially from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements we make. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Forward-looking statements represent our management’s belief and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made and we undertake no obligation to update or revise such statements should they change or cease to be current.
Further information on these and other factors that could affect our financial results is included in filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time-to-time, including the section titled Risk Factors in our most recently filed annual and quarterly reports.
During the call today, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are in addition to and are not a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is available in our shareholder letter, earnings release and investor data sheet on the IR website.
Please keep in mind that we would like to allow as many of you to participate in Q&A as possible. To facilitate that, we will take one question at a time. Please rejoin the queue if you have another question or a follow-up, and we will do our best to come back to you later in the session.
With that, I will turn the call over to Scott for opening remarks. Thank you all for joining us today. As you've already read in our shareholder letter, we delivered a strong quarter of financial results. We closed out FY 2023 with great momentum in cloud migrations, in enterprise, and across all our three markets. We generated over $3.5 billion in revenue this year, and over 250,000 customers now power their collaboration on our world-class cloud platform.
Amidst a challenging year, we're extremely proud of all that we've accomplished. We said we play offense in FY ’23 and that’ exactly what we did. We migrated millions of users to our world-class cloud platform, we built game changing innovations such as Atlassian Intelligence, launched new products like Jira Product Discovery, delivered increased scale on our cloud platform, and unlock data residency in new locations like Germany and Singapore for our global customer base.
Working deeply with our customers, we're more and more excited about the value Atlassian Intelligence will deliver by leveraging the latest advancements in large language models, combined with each customer's unique data, and our world-class cloud platform, with our two decades of data driven insights into how teams work, we'll be able to further unleash each of our customers' potential across all our three markets.
Today, we're seeing our bets pay off and that’s strengthening our conviction in our strategy. As we enter FY ‘24, we're eager to get after those large opportunities and believe we're well positioned to come out of the year even stronger.
With that, I'll pass the call to the operator for Q&A. We will now begin our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Hey, great. Thanks, I appreciate you taking the question, Joe. Given it to your first full-year guide, maybe you can start by walking us through the process there, the visibility into and confidence and framing those cloud targets for fiscal ‘24, and there's some commentary in the letter just around the proportions you're expecting between data center and cloud and just some details in there, I think it's useful to bring to the front of the call. So anything on just the signals you're watching and how the end of life event is taken into account, all very useful. Thanks. Great. Thanks for the question. I think I'd like to start with our cloud revenue guide of 25% to 30%, that assumes the macro headwinds in FY ’23 persist into FY ’24 and that migrations from server and data center will continue to be strong contributors to cloud growth approximately 10 points. So we do expect the momentum that we've seen in ‘23 on that front to continue. The low-end of our cloud guidance range assumes continued macro weakness throughout FY ‘24, as well as some macro impact areas that have held up really well in FY ‘23, like churn, upsell and migrations.
Finally, we do expect cloud revenue growth rates to gradually improve throughout the year, driven by the easier prior year comparables that we have in the second-half of the year. Now you mentioned data center. In terms of data center, we do expect decelerating revenue growth rates in FY ‘24, driven by a few things: first and foremost, lower migrations from server following the server end of support. We do expect greater migrations from data center to cloud as we remove migration blockers and enhance our cloud offering, and then of course, data center has difficult prior year comparables in the second-half of the year.
And then finally, we expect a steep decrease in our server revenue up to end of support in February 2024, at which point we'll no longer recognize any further revenue. So that's a general outline of how we're thinking about that for next year. Your next question comes from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Thank you for taking the questions. This is Sanjit Singh for Keith. How does, you know, one of the challenges in the last couple of quarters is sort of the screen to pay conversion. The letter suggested that was still, sort of, an impact again this quarter. Just wanted to get a -- as we go into next year, just wanted to get a sense of, what it would take to sort of reignite growth in that segment of the customer base. Is it something just a better macro, or there's things on the funnel side, the sales side, the execution side that could help create bigger rates in that part of this. Yes. This is Cameron. I'll speak to the new customer number. So in Q4, we definitely saw, that continued downward pressure on our free to paid conversion that we've been speaking about largely through the last four quarters or so. And although we do continue to increase the total number of free customers out there in the pool and service those customers year-on-year, simply those customers are slower to take out credit card and purchase our software, which is fine. We can be patient and convert them over a longer period of time.
The bigger shift that we saw between Q3 and Q4 was actually due to something that we had full control of. As we look to our budgets, and we are very diligent with all of our budgets this year, but we really went into our marketing campaign spend and marketing campaign budgets and looked at ROI of those investments. Based on the deep dive of that analysis, we were actually able to redirect some of our top of funnel spend towards higher value, longer term customers. The result here was that we got less customers overall in the funnel and convert it to paid customers in Q4. But the customers we did bring in will be -- by the higher or longer term value, higher ROI customers for that marketing spend.
Going forward, as Joe already mentioned, we do continue to believe that the macroeconomic pressure against the free to paid will continue, but we will always be optimizing our marketing spend for the highest ROI possible. And where we see good ROI, we will put more investment behind it. Your next question comes from Arjun Bhatia from William Blair. Please go ahead. Hey, thank you guys for taking the questions. Maybe one for Cameron or Joe. Just as you're thinking about how fiscal ‘24 plays out, how should we think about the cadence of the migrations that are left as we approach the February end of life? And, maybe this one's more for Cameron, but who are the customers that are still left on server? Do they tend to skew smaller, larger? Anything you can give us there, would be super helpful. Thank you guys. Thanks, Arjun. This is Joe, I'll take it first and then Cam can chime in at the end. We, as you we ended support for our server products in February 2024. Our focus there is obviously on migrating our remaining server customers to either our cloud or data center offerings, we expect that there will be uncertainty in quarter-to-quarter variability based on when and how our server customers ultimately choose to migrate. For now, we are assuming the trends we saw in FY ’23 with respect to how many server seats migrate and where they migrate to. We'll continue in FY ’24 directionally through end of support.
And then at end of support, we expect most of the remaining server seats that migrate will migrate to data center, and we've also built appropriately prudent assumptions for customers who will choose not to migrate in FY ‘24 into our guidance, and we'll be able to share more on quarter-to-quarter assumptions related to that server end of support dynamics when we provide our Q2 guidance next quarter. Cam? Yes. Just adding to that, I just want to highlight that this entire transition since we announced the end of server support almost three years ago, has been a multi-year journey and a multi-year investment across all factions in Atlassian, whether it's go to market, getting closer to our customers, whether it’s R&D teams, eliminating cloud blockers, delivering scale certifications, you name it. And of course, the variety of programs we've rolled out from price changes to loyalty discounts. And of course, this large compelling event with the end of server support coming up in February. So it’s been a multiyear journey, and as we've been saying, we're very been very consistent and very happy with our performance along the way. We've been able to retain a very large portion of our server customers, while getting our customers to choose cloud or data center appropriately, that's it.
We have about six months more as we come up to February. We have a significant server customer base still out there, they are of all shapes and sizes, I have to say, but they're the ones who waited the last to the latest to make this choice, which is perfectly fine. The good part there is we are in a better position than we've ever been to help those customers make the right choice for their company and transition as quickly as possible. Obviously, we'll incentivize our customers to choose cloud first and foremost in all of those conversations, but data center of course is there. And honestly, a great option for some customers out there who simply are still not ready to move to cloud.
As far as who will choose what, as Joe said, we largely see that customer choice falling in line with what we kind of seen over the last year. And of course, the customer's awake for the last minute, definitely will have data center as a easy migration path for them if they want to stay on prem. Your next question comes from Ryan MacWilliams from Barclays. Please go ahead. Thanks for taking the question. A two-part question here on 4Q cloud results. Could you maybe provide some context around what the contribution was from migration to cloud growth in the quarter? And how should we also think about the contribution from the expiration of the loyalty discount program to that fourth quarter cloud growth? Thanks. Yes, thanks for the question. The first part of the question in terms of migrations, the migrations contribution to growth in the quarter was very consistent with what it's been in the past. I think we've talked about it being approximately 10 points in FY ’23, that was a similar outcome in Q4. In terms of outperformance to the revenue guide, the outperformance was driven by stronger-than-expected purchasing in June and primarily in enterprise ahead of the expiration of our loyalty discount program and that came in the form of both more deals and higher contract value per deal and it drove strong results in migration, seed expansion and upsell to premium and enterprise versions of our products across both our cloud and data center businesses and better over the outperformance there.
The server outperformance in the quarter was driven strictly by stronger-than-expected renewals and larger deal sizes. And then finally marketplace outperformance is driven by app pull through on the stronger cloud and data center sales I noted earlier. Hope that helps. Yes. And this is Cameron. Just from a customer perspective, I just want to say that none of this was really a surprise for the customers. Now we've been very open along the way, for over the last few years about how the loyalty discount program would be staging down over three years and going away entirely on July 1st. And it's that openness that these customers, largely, we've been working with them for many months sometimes with these bigger customers for years, knowing that this date was out there and gave them a large compelling event to make that choice.
Of course, as I already mentioned, we still yet have another big date out there with next February, and we'll continue to work with our customers, who still remain on server between now that. Your next question comes from Kash Rangan from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Hi, thank you very much. I was curious if you could just comment on the transition that we’ve had, a transition of SAARs in the company and with the zero transition, how are you approaching the next year's planning? Are you looking for a new leader within the company hiring to the outside, what are the considerations on that transition? Thank you so much. Hey, Kash, Scott here. I just want to say a huge thank you to Cameron for his 11-years at Atlassian. And, Cameron has done, you know, every job at Atlassian, he's done marketing presales and now eventually, you know, which is after running all of our, you know, sales and marketing, and he's done an incredible job. And, when we chatted about this, it's been, you know, the right time for the Cameron to get back, because the cloud migrations and end of life of server are just are going so well. So, it turned out that's, you know, the right time for Cameron to spent a bit of time skiing given he was up in Tahoe at the moment.
In terms of what happens going forward, Cameron has some really strong a leaders under him, inside the business, particularly on the sales side. I just got a leader that runs most of the sales organization at the moment. And so we expect there to be a strong continuity, of that leadership. At this stage, we're, not saying exactly how that role will be replaced or refilled, but, I don't expect there to be significant changes from what we've done in the past. Your next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Okay. Thank you for taking the question and best wishes to Cameron. For micro Scott, you were very clear at the Atlassian summit in April that Atlassian Intelligence would be embedded in all of your cloud additions and be free of charge. But since that time, we've seen several software companies, GitLab to name one of them, announced specific pricing for their Gen AI tech. And so I'm curious to hear your thoughts on the direct monetization plans that are developing in the industry. Also, if Atlassian Intelligence delivers the value to customers that you think it can, could all of this potentially make you rethink your approach at some point? Yes. Hi, Greg. It's Mike here. Thanks for the question. Look, I would start with our philosophy here and long-term thinking as a company. We clearly believe that, Atlassian Intelligence and AI and new models are a huge opportunity for us. we think that software is supply constrained, not demand constrained. That will enable the creation of far more software. We are a content text based business and anything that allows you to manipulate, generate, pause, understand, text is very good for us as a company that targets collaboration and knowledge workers. We have a huge amount of data across our set of products and connections to third-party products and the best of big products in the world. That is incredibly valuable for us. So we are huge believers in AI and the potential of Atlassian Intelligence to drive significant value change for our customers.
Secondly, our philosophy is to live with R&D, to build and then customer value before thinking about monetization. I know there may be others in the industry if you go the other way around and announce a price then build something then work out of customer's care. We don't work that way, we go in the other direction. So, you've seen us execute that plan and that play many times over two decades and that's exactly what we're doing in terms of Atlassian Intelligence. We are super excited, and I believe you're at TEAM 2023, one of the best feature set, customer resonances we've had at the announcement and the launch of what we demonstrated to customers, huge customer excitement. Our job now is to turn that into actual customer usage in a huge manner first, and that is exactly what we're doing. Those features are now in the hands of the order of 1,000s of customers. and we are working every single day to make sure that those features deliver customer value and actually used, first.
We do believe they'll drive significant product competitiveness, and unleash your potential of every team, which is what we hear today. There are a number of ways we believe, as we've said before, that we, gain economically from the Atlassian Intelligence feature set. Again, first and foremost, we do believe it will continue to drive significant momentum and migrations of customers from server and data center products to the cloud. Atlassian Intelligence features only exist in the cloud and canon exist in the cloud. So anything that is a carrot to further improve that migration flow is a good thing for us economically as a business.
Secondly, we do believe it will drive product competitiveness and improve our new to new customer conversion rates and our win rates against competitors in all markets. Worth saying that we have built Atlassian Intelligence leveraging our cloud platform, which is both world-class and quite unique. This is a great example of why we spent five to 10 years building this cloud platform, because we can ship Atlassian intelligence features in every product in every category that we're in every market to improve our competitive standing across the board and we think that will come back in new customers and competitive wins over the medium to long-term.
And thirdly, some Atlassian intelligence features enhance and leverage features that are packaged into premium and enterprise additions. So we do believe it will drive some additional movement as customers go from free to standard, and standard to premium and premium to enterprise. Some features do exist in enterprise levels. For example, the Atlassian Analytics features that exist in the Enterprise edition, very powerful set of features to be able to use Atlassian Intelligence to generate queries for you is one of the resident features, but that will hopefully drive more enterprise addition upgrade.
So we do believe there's monetization opportunities for us in Atlassian Intelligence in summary. But philosophically, we're starting with R&D and building a deep set of core capabilities. We believe we can scale for the next five to 10 years as this wave takes over all software. And secondly, we're focusing on delivering customer value first. We are doing that every single day. We remain incredibly bullish about this area of the company. Your next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Thanks. Joe, on the operating margin, you're guiding down 200 basis points year-over-year. And then I think in the shareholder letter, you expect that trend to reverse. Can you just walk through the next couple of year cadence and how you're thinking about the investments you're going after and then maybe tie that into that expansion and how you're thinking about how that plays out? Thanks. It's Scott here. I'll take the first part about that, and Joe can get in with the details. And just to remind us of those who might be new to Atlassian story. Well, I think we've run a very successful and highly profitable business over a really long period of time. It's kicked off great. Free cash flow has great margins. And about 18 months ago, we identified a set of opportunities where we wanted to invest heavy arm behind those opportunities than we have historically.
And the three opportunities we articulated to you, our investors at our Investor Day were investing heavier in enterprise cloud investing heavier in our cloud migrations and investing more in our ITSM set of products. And on all three, I mean, super happy with the returns we've been getting migrations, we're continuing at the pace that we thought. We were ITSM, and particularly in this time of consolidation and people looking to get off high-priced legacy vendors. We've seen a lot of competitive switch outs. And in enterprise cloud, you've seen some of the number is now $0.5 million or $1 million deals in our shareholder letter, like we're seeing a great uptick in our enterprise segment as well. So all three of those are going really well.
Now you as investors have rightly asked, well, what does the shape of that investment look like? How many years are we doing that for? And in our investor letter this year, just that we just came out today, we shared that we expect the FY ‘24 margin profile to be the sort of lowest point in our margin, and we expect them to climb over the coming years back towards our historical norms.
Joe, do you want to add any more color to that? Yes. Thanks, Scott. Brent, I was just going to walk you through some of the mechanics. So in FY '24, we do expect operating margins of approximately 18.5%, as Scott mentioned. That's lower than this year, and it's driven by the strategic high-priority areas we're investing in that Scott and Mike have both highlighted including the areas of innovation like AI. Keep in mind in FY '24, we'll also be lapping the H2 benefit of restructuring savings and lower bonus expense that we had in FY '23.
In terms of FY '25, what's happening there is we do expect continued healthy revenue growth in FY '25 combined with our expectation of improving operating leverage as operating expense growth moderates, as Scott mentioned, particularly in the big areas of investment like cloud migrations and we will continue to drive general efficiency improvements with scale. So that's some of the mechanics underneath the philosophy that Scott articulated. Your next question comes from Ari Terjanian from Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. Congrats on the results, Cameron. I know you're moving at the end of the year, but congrats on a great run. I guess a question for you, a lot of strength here in the quarter on enterprise side. If you could double-click what do you think changed from a go-to-market perspective investments into Enterprise Advocates and the partner side that's helped drive some of these larger deals? And do you feel like Atlassian's at a steady state now in terms of the investments on the go-to-market side? Or is there more to come here as you think about the future? Thank you. Thank you for the question. And yes, we're very happy with the results we had in Q4 and the strength we continue to see in migrations in enterprise. But like I said, none of this happened overnight, and none of this was specifically just because of the go-to-market teams focused more on enterprise. This really has been a multiyear investment from Atlassian, largely with the commitment to get closer to our largest customers, and deliver -- honestly, to become the strategic partners that they want us to be.
Now this starts with R&D, and you see us deliver massive investments in scale. We have 50,000 users in our cloud products today, certifications, extensibility and largely just understanding our enterprise customers' unique needs much more closely. And then, of course, we match that investment in go-to-market by including our enterprise advocates, our technical account managers, our customer success managers and so on. And as we got closer, we've been able to get larger deals, longer-term commitments and become the strategic partners that customers want.
However, we've been able to do this all through evolution, as we've said, not revolution, and you see that today in our sales and marketing spend. So we've been able to actually get close to our largest customers to do these larger enterprise transactions, all while maintaining largely industry-leading sales and marketing expense, something that I'm exceedingly proud of and something that I'm very happy with my team will continue to do going forward is have that great balance of understanding our flywheel and product-led growth and all those great principles that Mike largely laid out earlier of how we're even thinking about AI.
But then, of course, when we're ready, go to our largest customers, and bring those solutions to them and, of course, get value and return for that. So we will continue to get closer to our largest customers, but we will absolutely continue to maintain our incredible efficient go-to-market structure going forward. Your next question comes from Michael Turits from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. So you said in a couple of places that migrations were strong, but you talked about both in the data centers as well as to cloud. I was wondering if you could drill on specifically on the migrations to cloud. So you mentioned things like data residency that were obstacles that were being removed. But are we in a position where whether it's because macro feels better and people are okay on TCO or some other reason that the actual migrations from let's just call it on-prem, but as a server to cloud improving at this point? Is that sustainable? This is Cameron here. So the migration plan, like it hasn't been a multiyear program we put in place. And as the customers choosing cloud, choosing data center has been very much in line with what we've expected. As we eliminate cloud blockers, whether that's data residency, scale, extensibility and to be very honest, we have a public road map where we show all of our customers, here's all the things that we are shipping down the road so that they can make the appropriate choices going forward.
It's a combination of all of those things that have allowed us to get these large customers choosing to move to cloud. Of course, as we've said, there are still plenty of customers out there that are ready for cloud would prefer to stay on premises and are choosing data center, and we will continue to see, I think, a large portion of customers going over the next year, choosing data center as that option.
But that's not a dead end. We largely see that investment in data center as a further commitment into Atlassian. And we've proven again and again that we can move data center customers to the cloud with half of our migrated seats coming from data center customers. So it's once again, we provide the optionality for the customers throughout if they choose data center, that's great. We'll continue to work with them, moving them to cloud and getting the most value from Atlassian long term.
Mike, you got anything to add? Nothing, Cameron. I think you now that just reemphasizing that the half migrated seats coming from data center is a really important milestone for us as we continue this long-term journey. Your next question comes from Alex Zukin from Wolf Research. Please go ahead. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just first, if we look at the cloud revenue growth number, and we look at -- we try to decompose net new ARR into net new versus migration versus expansion. You've talked a little bit about the migration dynamic. But how much -- like if we look at the -- if we just ask you like a cloud NRR metric and how much is coming from expansion. It would be great to understand that, particularly as we're getting into the later innings of the migration?
And then maybe just as a follow-up, to, you talked about healthy top line growth for fiscal '25. You gave the 25% to 30% growth range for '24, which we really appreciate, by the way. Is that a durable kind of growth rate? It's obviously a wider range given the macro uncertainty. But is that growth rate likely to stay durable particularly as maybe the migration tailwinds start to ebb a little bit as we get past the server end of life? Yes. Thanks for the question, Alex. I'd say, starting with your last question. In terms of FY '25, we're obviously not giving any guidance on that. To your broader question, I do believe it's durable. The value that we're adding to the products that cloud brings that's very specific, the value it delivers to customers, I think there's a lot of opportunity for tailwind in that business. And so directionally speaking, we should continue to see very healthy growth, as I mentioned, for FY '25. That will be driven primarily by cloud as the server revenue base goes away and increasingly, data center customers migrate to the cloud.
In terms of your first question on net retention rates, I would just say paid seat expansion and free-to-paid conversions continue to be impacted by the macroeconomic headwinds that we've seen. That would impact that area of the business. In terms of a specific expansion rate, as you know, we don’t quarterly retention and expansion rates. Having said that we talked about the macroeconomic pressures. And the underlying fundamentals in our business outside of that remain very strong, however, and we see no change to our structural competitive position. So we do expect those retention rates to improve once the macro picture stabilizes and begins to improve.
And then as you talked about earlier, I'd also highlight other aspects of key aspects of our business like migrations and cross sell and up sell and monthly active usage. Those all remain very healthy and speak to the highly valuable and mission critical nature of our product and those will also feed future expansion rate improvements. So our outlook is very positive on that going forward. Your next question comes from Fred Havemeyer from Macquarie. Please go ahead. Hi, thank you very much the question. Firstly, actually another thank you for introducing a dark theme as well to Jira. I think for people like me greatly appreciate it, especially when I'm on with some of my colleagues in Australia late at night. The question right now is really focusing on the migration tooling that you have. As you're looking at and kind of reviewing the learnings that you have and the investments you've made into your migration tooling?
Just how confident are you that at this point, you have the server to either data center or cloud migration tooling on-ramp capabilities really solved versus are there any significant risks you still see for some of those larger enterprise customers out server end of life to need to wait a little longer to have either like additional tools built out? Hey, Fred, I can take that. It's Mike, and thanks for the kudos on dark team and Jira. It's a good example of the amazing R&D team we have. It's done properly with design tokens and all sorts of things across our cloud platform using Atlas Kit. So it will be coming to other products shortly. It's already in hand for products that you see well across the area with a huge focus on accessibility, which has kept us into migrations. Dark team is quite challenging to do in an accessible way that works to meet all of the standards required for people who have accessibility issues when it comes to software.
Gets to some of the migration tooling questions that you've asked. Our migration tooling continues to improve quarter-on-quarter. We work really hard on the tools to make that as self-service as possible. And largely what we are doing is continue to work on the scale and speed of the tools to move huge amounts of data faster and faster the repeatability of those tools. Customers don't do one-shot migrations, especially the larger ones. They will migrate their data across, test it, migrate it again and do that multiple times. So the tooling becomes incredibly important to be repeatable and reliable.
And lastly, we work with customers who have lots of edge cases, some of them have 10 to 20 years of Jira family or Confluence data on-prem. They may have added their own database, they may have done a whole lot of things that we have to take these edge cases to move them across. We continue to work on how to do that as we get bigger and bigger customers, and we can counter more and more edge cases, more of the tooling is self-service and repeatable.
And lastly, we are continuing to work with app vendors and our amazing marketplace community to make sure that their app data and the apps themselves can be migrated as they move from our on-premise extensibility and plug-in systems to connect and forge in the cloud. That's quite a unique migration challenge. I would say every quarter, we get better and better at doing this. We can use less human power to do migrations. We can do bigger migrations. And I'm really proud of how the team is going on managing all of that tooling.
So continuing to improve I don't know it's -- your question was around, is it solved, it will get better every single quarter as it has done for the last three years, and we'll continue to do that as we migrate more and more server and data center customers at the time. Your next question comes from Peter Weed from AllianceBernstein. Please go ahead. Thank you. And great to see IT service management growth called out on the note. It was top of mind for us, too. We see it as a really large opportunity for you going forward. And obviously, it already is a large business. really impressive to see the 45,000 customers and 80% year-over-year growth. Kind of looking forward, how should we think about the total upside from here? Like what are the profile of the companies that on the largest opportunity going forward that will drive more growth? And how much additional headroom do you see in this over the coming kind of 3-ish years? Thanks, Peter, It's Scott here. Look, I think we have a huge opportunity for durable growth over such along a period of time. We operate in very large markets and take them one by one. You talked about Jira Service Management and ITSM. The opportunity there is we're the challenger in that particular market. And there's plenty of large incumbents there and putting it on happy customers in those large incumbents. And so there's just massive opportunities for us to take market share in that particular space.
In our migrations, we say, let me talk about wealth management for all. So there's just a huge opportunity there. That's a very large market. And if you look at the stronghold we have around developers and around development teams. And when I talk to CEOs these days around the world, like the biggest -- one of the biggest thing issues is how do they make the development teams productive, how do they get more out of the development teams. And when we look at customers consolidating around work management for all items, they can throw out other vendors, but they can't get rid of the tools, the power of their engineering teams. And so we have a huge opportunity for consolidation in our work management for all markets.
And then if I look at the innovations that we're bringing to our traditional Agile and DevOps market, we're a large player there, but there's just so many different customer problems that we can be solving for them. And you saw us launch Jira Product Discovery to target product managers. So if we start tackling more and more personas across there, there's just so much customer value that we can produce. And so I see huge opportunities in every market that we have at the moment. And so I don't really see any limit there. Migration of our customers from to cloud is just a stepping stone for us to be able to keep delivering huge value and increased cloud revenue. And, it’s Cameron. I'll follow-up just speaking with customers as well. The IT service fans, as we mentioned, 80% growth in our largest enterprise customers with Jira Service Management last year, which shows that, hey, we struck a vein here with the customers where if you look at the trends in the market, customers are trying to consolidate vendors and save money, Jira Service Management for existing Atlassian customers is a great opportunity. Customers also want their development teams and IT teams to come closer together to work on a common platform.
Jira Service Management provides that absolute capability and customers want more flexibility, quicker time to value of their investments. They don't want to spend six to 12 months rolling out these tools. They want to be able to purchase software, get it running and start delivering valor to their end users in days, weeks at most and Jira Service Management once again delivers value here. So in the IT Service Management market broadly, I think we have a very unique offering with a very unique value prop at a very unique price point. And all 3 of those reasons are the reasons why customers continue to look to us and invest in Jira Service Management. Your next question comes from Derrick Wood from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Oh, great. Thanks. I guess, Joe, this is for you. I wanted to ask about like some of the expansion headwinds being felt upmarket. I think with your smaller customers, I know a lot are on monthly contracts. So perhaps net expansion rates normalize quicker. But within your enterprise customers, you often have multiyear contracts. Customers would historically buy seats for growth to take advantage of pricing and we've heard from other seat-based models that as growth in the tech world has slowed, expansions on renewals can be a lot more challenging. So just curious, is that something you're seeing and do you think we still need some time quarters ahead to fully cycle through this with kind of longer enterprise contracts? Yes. Thanks for the question. Let me just talk a little bit about the differences between SMB and Enterprise, and I think it will get to your question. The SMB segment of our business is the most sensitive to macro and it has been the most impacted over the last year by the macroeconomic headwinds. We also do see the impact of changes in SMB in our cloud revenue sooner than in enterprise, simply given the mix of monthly cloud billings that we have in SMB. So I do expect SMB to be an area that will most benefit in our portfolio if macro improves, and we'll see that impact in a fairly timely way in our revenue and P&L when it occurs.
Now as you point out, Enterprise has slightly different dynamics. It's been less macro sensitive over the last year, still impacted by macro, but not to the same degree as SMB and as you pointed out, Enterprise also benefits from the investments we've made to unblock cloud migrations and improve enterprise capabilities, including premium enterprise SKU value. And they purchased that value through a higher percentage of annual and multiyear contract billings and that reduces the quarter-to-quarter revenue variability to some degree. So you will see that play out over time, and it does take longer for us to see that goodness from enterprise fully reflected in the P&L as a result of that. Your next question comes from Austin Cole from Citizen JMP Securities. Please go ahead. Yes, thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the results. So just cash now exceeds $2 billion on the balance sheet kind of a milestone there. I was wondering if you guys could share anything on how you guys are thinking about M&A strategy at this stage? Yes. Thanks for the question. I'll talk a little bit just in general about our capital allocation philosophy, which really hasn't changed. The first priority is investment to drive the long-term growth of our business, both from an organic R&D and sales and marketing perspective as well as you point out, mergers and acquisitions and strategic investments. And from there, we typically look to opportunistically return capital to shareholders as we're currently doing through the share repurchase plan. So Atlassian has always done M&A as part of its growth strategy, and that continues to be part of it going forward as well. Scott? I don't think there's any change to our philosophy, irrespective of what our balance sheet numbers look like. We've always been a company that thinks about the long-term in terms of our investments. And it's not going to change as a result of having a large or a small cash balance out there. We look at the right things suites like from a new customer acquisition perspective. We don't want to dig up a hole to the suit. We're willing to sit around and wait for something that really hits us and really provides value to our customers. And so for us, we're always on the lookout for great value assets, and we'll do them when the time is right, not irrespective of our bank balance. Your next question comes from Fred Havemeyer from Macquarie. Please go ahead. Hi, I’m back. Thank you. I wanted to also ask on the ITSM side of the business as well in Jira Service Management. Just the enterprise growth, in particular, I think you noted about 80% year-over-year is looking quite impressive. Just was hoping to better understand, to the extent you can describe kind of how much of those Jira Service Management customers you would qualify as enterprise at this point in time? And then secondly, what's really started to work there to be able to turn on that enterprise growth within Service Management? Cameron here. I'll call out what's driving the enterprise success in IT service management largely comes off the back of many of our enterprise investments broadly at the Atlassian cloud platform level, whether that was data residency, whether that’s certifications, all the same benefits that we had for driving migrations in large enterprise automatically get translated to Jira Service Management.
However, the Jira Service Management team has also been exceedingly focused on knocking down the specific IT requirements of those larger customers. And you see that largely show up the validation of that as we are in the leadership quadrant in the Gartner IT Magic Quadrant, which basically shows that, hey, yes, we check all the boxes that those customers require while maintaining that unique value of bringing dev and IT closer together at a at a relatively competitive price point.
So it's really the investment across the board in IT service management. As we said a few years ago now, we're going to double down this area. And as we paid off those R&D investments, and focused our go-to-market efforts as we reach out to our larger customers, and we're talking to them about migrating the cloud. We're not just talking about getting what they already have over to the cloud. We talked about expanding the overall Atlassian value prop as they move to the Atlassian cloud platform, and that's also helped us expand the Jira Service Management offerings. Mike? Yes. I just wanted to add on one thing. I was talking to an enterprise customer maybe a month, 1.5 months ago. And one of the things that was coming through to them was the value of the Atlassian platform. And one of the reasons why they opted for JSM. In particular, in this case, they used Atlassian in their Agile and DevOps, the Jira software and other products. The combination of development teams and IT teams is increasingly important. We have an incredibly unique value advantage there as every customer every company becomes a software company, that connectivity between development teams and IT teams is incredibly important.
That's powered by our investments in the Atlassian platform over time. You're seeing that come through in Atlassian Intelligence and a whole host of other ways. But it's really gratifying to us to see that resonating with customers, especially the large customers, and it's a big differentiator. The same actually applies on the connectivity between IT and service teams in an organization and the work management space.
So on the other side of our market combinations, as enterprise service management continues to roll out, our virtual agent technologies using Atlassian Intelligence, I think will be a huge boon to larger enterprises in trying to take service management more broadly from IT into HR, finance, marketing and other capabilities. This all relies on the power of the Atlassian cloud platform. It will continue to drive migrations of our largest customers there and I think be a differentiator in the ITSM space. Thank you. That's all the questions we have time for today. I will now turn the call over to Scott for closing remarks. So thank you to everyone for joining our call today. As always, we appreciate your thoughtful questions and continued support and a special thank you to the Atlassian team for your resilience and closing the year out with strong momentum. Also want to say a special thank you for Cameron, that was his last earnings call, I just want to say a huge thank you for the revenues you've given to Atlassian so far. Thank you all, and I'll see you next quarter.","this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of Atlassian’s website following this call .

We'd like to allow as many of you to participate in Q&A as possible. As of respect for others on the call, we'll take one question at a time. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott for opening remarks. Thank you for joining us today. As we've already read in our shareholder letter, we've been busy. We keep off FY '24 by executing well and playing effects. We continue to push hard on our biggest bets, cloud, enterprise and ITSM and those bets continuing to pay off. We're also shipping ever more new products and innovation to our customers.
This quarter, we wanted to encompass into general availability, who's on the heels of landing Jira product discovery last quarter, which is off to a fantastic start with several thousand customers already. I was just at our High-velocity IT Service Management event here in Sydney when we announced the general availability of Virtual Agent and Jira Service Management and debuted a host of additional AI capabilities.
We heard from some of our credible customers who shared how they migrated their legacy ITSM solutions to JIRA Service Management and are now delivering exceptional service experience sites on the network. Through our cloud platform, thousands of customers through our early access program are already realizing value from the AI capabilities to be introduced across our cloud products powered by Atlassian Intelligence. The early feedback has been terrific, and we're incredibly excited by the opportunity that AI presents us. Along with the organic innovation happening here at Atlassian, we also announced our acquisition of [indiscernible] and [indiscernible] . [indiscernible] built on our previous investment are service management and will enable enterprises to better account for and trust all their critical assets within their organizations. [ WOM ], which has a passionate customer base of 200,000 will bring the power of asynchronous video messaging to the Atlassian platform.
We firmly believe distributor work is here to stay and [indiscernible] will allow teams across the globe or even in the same building to collaborate seamlessly and deeply human waste. People are increasingly turning to video as a way to collaborate and consumer information and we're incredibly excited about the opportunities that video can be applied across our platform.
Our customers are looking to Atlassian to provide them solutions in the collaboration space, and [ WOM ] gives us an incredible opportunity to further unleash the potential of their teams. We're also playing offense on talent. Atlassian is the cornerstone of our success, and we're focused on adding and retaining amazing talent across the company, including great senior leaders. We recently welcomed Zane Ozdemir as our Chief Marketing Officer; and Vikram Rao as our Chief Cost Officer. And we promoted Kevin Egan to Chief Sales Officer, all of whom bring great experience to our leadership team.
I also want to acknowledge Cameron, as this will be his last earnings call with us. Mike and I are incredibly grateful for his 11 years of dedication, impact and most of all friendship. With that, I'll pass the call over to the operator for Q&A. Will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Ryan MacWilliams from Barclays. I appreciate you guys taking the question. I'd love to just double-click on the timing of the remaining migrations. I think at this point, there might be a little more server revenue that is on the model than invested expected so. Any expectation for like when those remaining migrations will move over and the composition of those remaining customers like are they more likely to go to a data center or a cloud from here? This is Cameron. I'll take the first here, and then I have Joe follow-up. So as many of you know, we have the server end of life coming up the next few months, mid-February. We cease all support for server customers after that date. And over the last few years, we've been actively aggressively going up to all of our customers across server and data center, essentially then to get them to the Cloud. And this has been very positive for us. It's gone very in line with our plans over these few years. But obviously, there are many customers out there that will wait until the last moment before they make this decision.
And we see that today in our enterprise pipeline. We have a healthy pipeline with enterprise migrations going up over the next few months. As far as what I want to make sure that's very clear here is, post February, we still will have many migrations. So many customers between now and February will be going from server to either data center or preferably cloud.
But for those customers that choose data center, we will continue to be migrating those data center customers to the cloud in the coming years. So the short answer there is, yes, we do expect to see a flurry of activity over the next few months with that big compelling event in February, but migrations will continue post the February date. Joe, you have anything to add? Yes. Thanks, Cameron. Ryan, really no change from what we discussed last quarter in terms of the server and the support dynamics that are baked into our guidance. As Cameron mentioned, we end support for server products in 2024. There may be significant quarter-to-quarter variability, as Cameron mentioned, based on when and how those server customers ultimately choose to migrate. We continue to assume the percentage split on migrated seats between data center and cloud will be relatively consistent with historical trends up to that end of support moment. And then with end of support, we continue to expect most of those remaining server seats that migrate, will migrate to data center and we continue to hold prudent assumptions to account for customers who will choose not to migrate in FY '24, and that's also factored into our guidance. I hope that helps. Your next question comes from Karl Keirstead from UBS. Just ask about your observations about the macro. I think every investor on the line is seeing some challenges across the space with, I'd say, a bit of a skew towards some pressure in the SMB space. Could you talk about the trends you're seeing, SMB versus enterprise? And then perhaps elaborate on the seat growth comment you made in the prepared remarks. Yes. Great question, Carl. Thanks for asking. You recall by the end of Q4, we were seeing signs of improvement and stabilization in SMB and a very healthy enterprise environment. Those trends continued into Q1 and played out largely as we expected during the quarter. Now keep in mind, Q1 is typically not a big quarter for us when it comes to large enterprise deals, and we have significant revenue mix from SMB.
Now having said that, there's really nothing unusual or noteworthy to call out in the relative Q1 performance between those 2 customer segments. In relation to the cloud aspect of Q1, the trends we saw in Q4 continued into Q1, and those were also largely consistent with what we expected. The cloud business does continue to be impacted by pressure on paid seat expansion and free-to-paid conversion at the top of the funnel. Although we continue to see some signs of stabilization as the rate of deceleration in those areas continue to moderate slightly.
The other parts of our cloud business migrations, upsell to higher-priced versions, cross-sell, customer churn, those all continue to be very healthy and perform in line with our expectations. And then from a linearity perspective, linearity in the quarter is what you'd expect to see, and the trends and impacts were fairly consistent across products, regions and verticals. I hope that color helps. Also just to add on there at the risk of three people answering one question. One of the tailwinds we've seen is consolidation. We are actually seeing that across the market, more and more of the conversations I'm having with customers large and small them trying to simplify the number of tools that they are using out there. And because Atlassian is so mission-critical, we are one of the vendors that they turn to, to consolidate on. A good example of that was Domino's, pizza that runs 4000 stores across sort of Asia Pac and across the world actually. And they consolidated 6 tools down to 1 Jira Service Management installation, and we're seeing that more and more across the customer conversations. Your next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies. Just on Karl's question on the overall macro. In terms of linearity, was there anything different that you saw throughout the quarter? Or was that also pretty consistent to your comments about what you've seen in the last quarters, a few quarters between SMB and enterprise. And also, if you could just add on many of you're kind of asking about close to $1 billion for Loom. Kind of what was the magic sauce, if you will, that drove that type of price point in the desire to complete that transaction? Thanks, Brent. I'll address the first part of your question regarding linearity in the quarter, and then Mike will pick it up on the Loom question. Linearity in the quarter was exactly what you'd expect to see. So there was nothing unusual or strange about Q1 from a linearity perspective overall. Mike? Sure. Joe, I can handle that. Hi, everyone. Look, from a financial point of view, we think Loom is a great acquisition for Atlassian. The strategic rationale always comes first for us in this particular case. It is a product that's leaning into a lot of trends that we think are working really well from the point of view, firstly, distributed work and the increasing desire for asynchronous collaboration across lots of different businesses.
Secondly, just the shift in the way that people are sharing and consuming video in the enterprise, specifically at the younger generation, become more a part of the workforce. And certainly, AI is changing the way that video can be created and consumed in really interesting ways that I think it will make it more a part of the formats that we all collaborate on and work over time. From a financial rationale, look, the business itself and the product of Lorne is going to continue as a stand-alone individual product, as we've said.
As Scott mentioned in his remarks, over 200,000 customers now, it's got a fantastic brand, and it's the leader in that space and is a fast-growing standalone business in and of itself. Secondly, we believe for ourselves, there's obviously a lot of opportunities in video and combining our video infrastructure team with Loom's video infrastructure team. We have video as a first-class citizen across our platform family of products today.
But obviously, the long capabilities will improve that in each of our spaces, whether that's in service management or in broad business collaboration or, of course, in software teams. And lastly, there's obviously an opportunity for us to combine products, as you've seen us do a little bit already with Atlassian together to cross-sell Loom as a product into our existing base of more than 265,000 customers.
So, we think it's a fantastic deal. We're super excited about the product we've been customers of it for a long time. I know think it can do great things as part of the Atlassian family. Your next question comes from Kash Rangan from Goldman Sachs. Nice to see the stability in your end markets. I was curious to see, what do you think about the data center growth rate at 42%. It seems to be outpacing the Cloud, probably should be flipped the other way. I'm sure you would like that, and we would like that too. any refined thoughts on how you view the data center business growth profile? And the things you might be doing incrementally in terms of functionality for the cloud product that would make it more of a compelling value proposition for the customer to go cloud as opposed to server products? Yes, Kash, this is Joe. I'll start. You're right. It was another strong quarter for data center at 42% growth. That was slightly ahead of our expectations, and it was driven by really strong renewals, migrations from server and seat expansion with an existing customers. It's worth noting we're growing a significant installed base on data center, which is a great stepping stone to the cloud for those who are currently blocked for moving to the cloud at the moment. And it's a good sign of how committed customers are to the Atlassian road map and platform.
And having a big installed base on data center is a high-class problem to have because that will fuel future migrations to the cloud. Cameron? Yes. I've had dozens of conversations with many of our largest customers about this exact decision that many of them are making. And the reality is we see having both cloud and data center as a long-term competitive advantage. For Atlassian, we provide optionality for these customers in the coming years. As far as the functionality perspective, the good part is, there is very few customers where we have not been able to handle all their scale, their data requirements, their privacy requirements, their compliance requirements, or their needs for customization to cloud. So rarely is there a technical conversation where customers can't go to cloud. It's really just are they ready? Can we move the migration? Where are the [indiscernible] their business? And is there the compelling functionality to move them over.
In everyone of those conversations, the customers understand cloud is in their future. It just comes down to the timing to get them over. But either way, an investment in data center investment in cloud is a longer-term strategic investment in Atlassian to get them further committed to Atlassian. And I know and we've shown with our track record that we can and we'll move data center customers to the cloud along with their business needs. Your next question comes from Fred Havemeyer from Macquarie. Thank you. Good to be catching up on this call. I wanted to focus in on how you're thinking about AI overall as an overarching strategy. And I can't fail but notice, of course, your new Chief Marketing Officer has a PhD in Machine Learning. A number of your product offerings you're describing, of course, including Loom, being able to integrate generate AI-related summaries. Just it seems like there's an overarching theme here. Of course, you spoke to a part of it, but from top to bottom, it seems like you're trying to become more like an AI-focused company as well.
So perhaps, could you elaborate on that? And just how you think of the ongoing Atlassian branding and what value might be marked? And perhaps being more of an AI-first company. Thanks, Fred. Look, I can take that first, and then Scott can follow on. Yes, certainly. Great observation. I'm not sure if you or ChatGPT observe that, but Zenith does have a PhD in machine learning. She's also our CMO and fantastic that will obviously be in addition to her capabilities in AA marketing, but obviously not the singular reason for bringing on board.
Look, I think I we couldn't be more excited by AI and live language models at Atlassian, right. We take the view that it's a huge opportunity for us for a number of different reasons. I think, in each of our markets, this technology transformation will be a huge change in the ability to deliver value to customers, which is where great software businesses are built. We have a lot of very valuable data from our customers that we are the custodians of.
And a lot of that data is textual and increasingly, video and audio effectively becoming text with AI. So we have a lot of their data, which is really important in AI to be able to give them fantastic answers or magical experiences.
Secondly, we have a fantastic platform that we spent a lot of time building. So you see that in Atlassian Intelligence features that we've already shipped. Our ability to shift those features to all the products in the family simultaneously is a result of new on a decade of building a cloud platform, having the customers' data centralized having singular editor and UI surfaces.
So our ability to get features out to customers, we're incredibly, incredibly bullish on beyond just our ability to build them. And thirdly, obviously, with our world-class engineering team and our R&D capabilities, this is a technology transformation. And so you need to fundamentally build new products or build additions to existing products or build features or change the way features are built. That takes a lot of internal R&D and expertise, and we have that in space. So we feel incredibly excited about what AI can do for our customers fundamentally and what value we can deliver.
Look, we're in the business of amazing products and delivering the right customers. It's like someone has given us a whole new painting set to paint with a whole new set of materials that we can create out with. And so we're extremely excited. We are certainly placing that at the center of our philosophies on building products. I think that's what software companies are doing. I'm not sure when people say, AI first company exactly what that means, but we are certainly heavily investing in our AI capabilities, all of the governance and privacy and responsible technology principles that are required to do that well for customers and give them the right data providence when we give them answers of any form.
But also making sure that we deliver those capabilities and that we are investing in and how we can do that. And this is going to take a few years to play out, but we're certainly really, really excited. Scott, anything you'd add on to that? Yes. Just a couple of things. We all know that AI is driven by unique data sets, and you can provide unique experiences when you have unique data sets. And if you look at what like has done over the decades we've been in business and the data we have, it's a really unique advantage for us. Firstly, our products are opened by default, which sounds like a simple thing, but -- if you want to train AI on data inside your organization, is that data can't be isolated to a few people.
And if you use Confluence, you, as one of our customers, you have decades' worth of data that's available to train their AI on and help them make decisions. That's a really big part of our advantage. The second one is that we have breadth across what we do in terms of the workloads and what people use our products for span the entire organization. And that allows us to do very unique data sets to make decisions across the entire organization.
And lastly, that also includes third-party products. We've talked about our open tool chain for a long time. And if you're a single vendor that just does one thing, you can provide information about that one thing. But because our open tool chain spans everything across an organization, we can provide experiences and AI insights that span your entire organization.
And so I think those are all really interesting. And then while the vendors work on a little bit about their AI features. We're out there delivering them on our platform, and we're super excited about what we deliver on a regular basis. And we just got a cadence of those things coming out to our customers on a regular basis. And so we're head down delivering the value to our customers. Your next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho. I had a follow-up on cloud migrations. You mentioned in the shareholder letter that the number of user migrations over the past year has risen by nearly 50%. And certainly, it's a high growth rate, but I think the increase was more like 2x a couple of quarters ago. So I'm wondering, is this change in growth just a function of law of larger numbers and tougher compares? Or is it also reflective of a much smaller opportunity set or even a slowdown in the appetite of customers to migrate to the cloud? Yes. This is Cameron. I'll take the first half of this and Joe add anything if he seems fit. The reality is that we've had ever since we have announced the server end of life, which was a little a little more than 3 years ago. now we have increasingly quarter-on-quarter, raised our number of migrated seats that come across the board. But of course, we saw some huge jumps depending on different times along that journey we've had based off of either our loyalty discount programs or price changes along the way.
As you remember, over the last few years, we've built in these compelling events. We have customers reasons to migrate throughout the years and the customers that migrated earlier, we're financially incentivized to do so. Faster the numbers that we are dealing with now are quite large and they continue to grow significantly quarter-on-quarter. And I believe as we go into the next few months with server end of life, many of the customers who've waited until the last moment will be making these decisions to get the data center cloud, and there will be a lot of energy around that.
The good part is all of our customer-facing teams, our partners, our migration experts, [indiscernible] are more than capable of handling any influx we get in the next few months as customers wait for the last minute to make their choice on whether to go to data center or cloud. And as I've already mentioned, post February, we will continue to have migrations continue to be a large part of our business as we move data center customers to cloud in the coming years. Joe? Yes, Cam. The only other thing I'd add, Greg, is we do expect FY '24 to be a very big year for cloud migrations. We've guided to 10 points of cloud revenue growth coming from migrations for the full year. Just to reiterate what Cam said, that's really driven by 2 factors. We do continue to invest and make terrific progress in enabling and unblocking more and more customers to the cloud. Our tooling, our support, our cloud capabilities get better every day. And then the second point to reiterate what Cam said, is we do have the server end of support moment in February 2024, and that will also contribute to migrations growth. Your next question comes from Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo. Joe, maybe one on margin. You raised the margin outlook fairly meaningfully. The 20% implied is now close to where you ended last year. Can you just help level set where you are from an investment perspective, how much opportunity do you see on the cost management side. And if there are priority areas for us to be focused on as the server migration end approaches, and maybe some resources free up as a result. That's also useful. Thanks, Michael. You're right. The stronger-than-expected operating margin performance in Q1 and our guide in Q2 was driven by greater operating leverage. And so we are seeing that primarily on the operating expense side. In terms of operating expenses, I would say it's been a team-wide effort focused on a few core principles. We're focused on maximizing the return on every dollar we spend. making disciplined prioritization and resource allocation calls and driving operational efficiencies as we gain scale.
As a result, the savings are really broad-based across all groups from developer productivity and cloud COGS optimization to G&A and everything in between. So it's happening across all teams, and we've made good progress to date. And I do think it's important to note while we do this, we continue to make the disciplined strategic investments in areas like cloud migrations and enterprise and AI in our core markets to drive durable long-term growth and serve customers.
In terms of the long-term trends, you're absolutely right. We've made significant multiyear investments in building out our cloud platform and building out our enterprise-grade capabilities. We do expect that those growth rates and those investments to moderate as we make tremendous progress against that over the next year or 2. So that's definitely an additional area of leverage that we should see in the model over the coming 2 years. Your next question comes from Peter Weed from Bernstein. Note, I think you did a great job of mentioning the strength in premium and enterprise edition upsells. But I didn't notice any conversation about cross-sells, new functionality for things like JSM that had been such a powerful growth engine recently. How has cross-sells been progressing? Any change in propensity to adopt new product, or hear I think from some other companies, we're hearing some end-of-year strength with strong pipeline. Do you see some increasing interest here and optimism for strength at the end of the calendar year? Or how are things going with kind of cross-sell, particularly JSM, I would say. Yes, thanks. I'll take the first part of that question, and then Scott will chime in. Cross-sell is absolutely a key driver in our cloud revenue growth rate model. We see a lot of opportunity to sell, to cross-sell additional products into existing customers. That continues to be very healthy. I talked earlier about the fact that that's been one of the areas of our cloud business that has held up really well and been resilient through the macroeconomic environment that we've experienced.
In terms of pipeline, I would just say, in general, our Q2 pipeline is very strong, and that's a function of everything that we've talked about that's held up well to date. It's the migrations, it's the cross-sell. It's the ability to upsell our customers to premium and enterprise additions of our products. So we're excited about that, and we're looking forward to a great Q2. Scott? I'll take that for you, Scott. This is Cameron. Yes, the well i reiterate the pipeline, the strength we see in enterprise today on our healthy pipeline is not just migrations, but it also includes Jira Service Management. We continue to see Jira Service Management's expansion within our customer base. Nearly 50,000 customers are on Jira Service Management today across all sizes, whether that's small customers as well as we're increasingly seen some large wins in larger enterprise customers with competitive replacements of legacy tooling.
I believe this is only going to continue to be strong as we continue to deliver new innovations like we spoke about earlier today with the virtual agents. And our merchant acquisitions to continue to innovate in the ITSM space. So that is a major focus for us. I also do want to highlight that many of our customers, actually one of the most exciting things about talking about customers about getting to migrate them over an enterprise is a lot of the new capabilities we've launched in our existing products, whether that's white boarding and Confluence, new automation capabilities, analytics capabilities, but we've also launched new products this year.
Jira Product Discovery, is getting a lot of attention within our customer base, and we've seen that getting rapid adoption within kind of the early adopters in our customer base. So very excited about that. And just over the last couple of weeks, we launched a new product called Compass. Focused on really hard core developer user base and really have a new innovative experience to help developers manage their complex services platforms. So I'm really excited across the board. Strength in Jira Service Management, but one, we can't lose sight of the many other products that many of our customers are very excited about. And in cloud, the reality is it's just way easier for them to adopt those products. they can simply just turn them on, add them to their environment and get value out of them.
So by the time we come around and have a sales conversation, many of them are already understanding the value that these products are providing to them. Your next question comes from Ari Terjanian from Cleveland Research. We noticed some incremental [indiscernible], so to speak, during the quarter around dual licensing, step-up credit, 6-month free trial for cloud. Could you speak to some of those efforts? And if they're providing any lift or also maybe potential dilutive impact on the revenue? Yes. This is Cameron again. I'll speak broadly just to everything we've done to incentivize customers to migrate in the past few years. And it's a, as I continue to say is, when we announced the server end of life 3 years ago, we had a carefully engineered set of programs to incentivize customers to migrate to the cloud sooner than later. This was a combination of pricing incentives with loyalty discounts extended trials so that customers could start using cloud at no cost and get used to it, understanding comfortable with the new functionality.
Or, of course, when customers purchase cloud to ensure that they can continue to run their on-premise environments,environments like data center during the migration experience, knowing that migrations take different extended periods of time. So hard ride, all these were well planned, engineered from day 1 and have them part of our migrations forecasts for the last few years. So we continue to roll those out all the way up to the server end of life in February. The goal really being to make it as easy as possible for customers who want to get to cloud to get the cloud as quickly as possible. Your next question comes from Jacob Roberge from William Blair. [Audio Gap] work and work management. And do you ever see that the potential to combine that with Atlassian together? It seems like you're planning to offer it as a stand-alone product off the bat, but could Loom gets integrated into that suite over time. Jack, I think I missed the start of the question. So tell me if I'm answering the wrong question here. I think the first half didn't come through. The question is interpreted as, Could LUM get integrated into some sort of a work management suite or bundle over time, like we've done with Jira Work Management, Confluence and Atlassian together. So I hope I'm answering the right question.
That certainly is a distinct possibility. As I mentioned, there's a number of ways that we're looking to continue to monetize and grow on as a result of the acquisition. One of those is certainly just loom by itself as a stand-alone product. It has a significant audience already. It has some really good viral properties and growth factors to it. and we think we can help continue that movement forward.
Second, certainly monetizing video across our audiences and improving, you might think about it as a competitive position of Confluence, it's a better video features, right? But thirdly, you're certainly looking at different bundles and opportunities in our customer base. I think you can be sure that we will do that thoughtfully when we come to looking at work management or ITSM. I don't forget there's a significant video component in knowledge bases and helping employees to and potential to share quick things either from the customer to the agent or from the agent back to the customer. So we will continue to look at possibilities of bundling and putting it into things like Atlassian together, yes. But our upfront goal will be to focus on integration and firstly, continuing the great growth rate of Loom as a stand-alone product, which is a fantastic business. Your next question comes from Keith Bachman from BMO. Many thanks for the question, Cameron. I think this is for you, if I could. When you talk about the conversion help the cloud of 10 points I was wondering if you could offer some commentary around what is that same metric? How much help is going to data center? And then for each of those, what happens after February 15? Any kind of guidepost on how we should be thinking about the conversion help for the customers that may be ongoing past the Feb 15 deadline. Any kind of commentary on how much conversion will help post that 15? Yes. So [indiscernible] clarity, so the 10 points of growth we mentioned is for our cloud business. That's just what came to the migrations and being clarity on where that growth is coming. So, and of course, as Joe already mentioned, a large portion of the data center growth today is simply server to data center conversions. All of that pricing is actually available on our website. You can see across all tiers. You can see what existing server renewals are and what the existing data center list prices are going forward. Now that's the. Sorry, Cameron, that wasn't my question. My question is how much, what's the same metric for data center. So of the growth, how much contribution are you getting from conversions? Joe, you want to address that? Yes, it's about 15 to 20 points. And then what happens to those 2 metrics after the end of life of server, do you think? Any kind of just directional barometers you would want to provide? I would say, in general, what you should expect post server end of support is, obviously, the server to data center migrations will start to decline. That's going to be a big driver of why we expect to see the deceleration in data center in the second half of the year. We haven't quantified specifically what that curve looks like. And a lot of it will depend on what the customer purchasing behavior is around that server end of support moment. How many of those seats move to data center, how many of those seats move to cloud and the timing on that. Your next question comes from Fatima Boolani from Citi. I wanted to talk about the cloud SKUs and the pricing increases that you've undertaken in the cloud suite of products and solutions, in addition, it seems that every October, like [indiscernible] pricing goes up by 5%.
So Joe, maybe the question is for you. How is that being contemplated in your guidance for the year. And as an added layer, can you speak to customers who migrated to cloud in the past, in the recent past, who are perhaps on loyalty discounts? And what that cadence of getting these customers on loyalty discounts up to MSRP, if you will, how that's being considered in your cloud guidance? And then a quick follow-up, if I may, please. This is Cameron. Let me just address pricing directly on the cloud. As you mentioned, we did have filed price increases go out this October, very much in line with the previous cloud price increases that we rolled out in October. As you mentioned, for our customer base, this is largely granted no customers like price increases, but it is from all the purposes of nonevent. Customers are, understand that these are a regular price increase that comes from Atlassian and relatively minimal at the, roughly, as you mentioned, 5% rate going forward.
Of course, we have many customers. Our primary goal here is to continue to migrate many of our existing on-premises customers. over to cloud. So it's always allowed us, you've always been very considerate about whether that pricing dynamic on our cloud list prices compared to on-premises customers. As you already mentioned as well, as part of the last few years, we offered loyalty discounts, which basically discounts off of list price for cloud over the last few years, and customers are on, many of the customers are on 1-year or 2-year contracts in cloud. When those contracts come up for renewal, they will be coming up at list price, whatever list prices at that time.
The good news of all of those customers understand that dynamic when we speak to them about the loyalty discounts and these programs. And more importantly, since most of them are on have plenty of, annual or 2-year contracts. They have plenty of time to plan accordingly for what their renewal will be. And then thanks, Cam. The question in terms of the guidance. As Cam mentioned, the effective price increase is roughly 5% blended. That's a good rule of thumb to use as you think about the impact that is built into the guidance. And do keep in mind, whenever we make these price changes, it takes a while for it to layer into the model simply because they're effective when the agreements are signed and that happens over the course of time is for our annual multiyear agreements. Your next question comes from Derrick Wood from Cowen. In the shareholder letter, you guys mentioned that cloud sales from your channel was up nearly 2x year-over-year. And when I look at your total cloud growth of 27%, that suggests that your partners are really generating a tremendous amount of your cloud growth and perhaps your own channels are a bit softer. Has there been a shift in go-to-market strategy to call out that's causing a higher mix of growth coming from your channel partners? Yes, I'll take that one. This is Cameron. So first off, we see that as a very, very good news. As all of you know, Atlassian's channel, our solution partner network is a critical part of our overall go-to-market and has been for all 11 years I've been here and even longer than that. The dynamic you're seeing with the partners' cloud growth in the recent months largely comes downside with our enterprise business.
We have, many of our enterprise customers have large enterprise migration needs. All of them usually when they take on a large migration are looking for some sort of technical or consulting health. And this is where our solution partners can provide direct access, plenty of expertise and honestly derisk the migration when it happens. So we have very much tied much of our enterprise go-to-market, not just with our direct sales, but joint sales with our solution partners to make those migrations happen. And that's why you're seeing the outperformance in our channel cloud sales over the last couple of years.
I also want to add, it's not just the channel. It's the reality is we've unlocked a ton of new capability in cloud as well as unblocked many customers because of the scale data privacy and compliance capabilities that we've released in the last few years, which only opens up our channel partners and the biggest customers that they are serving continue to open up those doors to have them sign up for new migrations contracts. Your next question comes from Mark Cash from Raymond James. This is Mark on for Adam. I wanted to circle back to the consolidation trend and Atlassian together. We're now a couple of quarters after announcing the offering. So could you first comment on the adoption if it's helping drive cloud adoption? And if the plan of seeing organizations expand seats across buying centers is actually playing out so far. Thank you. Yes. This is Cameron here. Apologies for the confusion there. Listen, Atlassian together is a key strategy to address what we see out there in the market of a variety of project management tools and used by different departments and different teams across the board. And we went to meet many of our customers, many of them are looking to try and standardize and consolidate on a single vendor to manage their teamwork needs. And when we looked out to the competitive offerings and what our customers are looking for, we realized we had a massive advantage with the broad suite of Atlassian products, not just Jira Work Management, including Confluence, new products like Atlas. To allow for customers to have a broad set of use cases supported by a variety of tools versus having, from a single vendor at a significantly lower cost.
We come out with many of those customers over the last year have made those decisions and are very happy migrating off of the other Federated sets of tools to the Atlassian Work Management Solutions. Now that's it, we are still, as you mentioned, a few quarters into this. It's still relatively early days in that offering, but we're definitely resonating with the overall demand for consolidating on teamwork tools. and platforms and going at Atlassian has been a massive advantage there. Your next question comes from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. I wanted to squeeze in two, if I can. On different topics. One on just overall customer count, it seems like another relatively smaller than what you've seen historically, customer ad quarter. Can you talk a little bit about kind of the trends that you're seeing with customer accounts and into the free-to-pay migration. But also you took away the disclosure of actually like a point number of the number of customers.
Just Atlassian has been like a price times quantity of like you add a lot of customers and then you make those customers bigger over time. Just wondering about like why to take away that disclosure. You're only halfway to your 500,000 customer goal. Why not give the specificity on a go-forward basis? This is Cameron, I'll address the first half of that and then hand off to Joe. So as you mentioned, as we saw over the last year or so, we saw the new customer number declining, largely as we saw free to paid conversion rates slow down. Now that said, we still continue to get plenty of customers coming in to our website, many years signing up for free instances and are using free versions of our products, and that only continues to grow year-on-year, but we just saw them being slower to get out their credit card or hit their 11 user mark into that paid cohort.
Good news, as Joe had already mentioned earlier, we are starting to see stabilization in that overall impact. And actually, we saw increase from Q4 to Q1 in that net new customer number. largely due to improvements that we have made in our funnel, specifically around the commerce and conversion experience, just simply making it easier for these free customers to purchase our products. Now that said, there's still plenty of uncertainty out there in the market, but seeing that stabilization and slight improvement quarter-on-quarter, we see as largely positive in Q1. Joe, do you want to speak more to the numbers of those? Yes. Thanks, Cam. Keith, we will continue to provide the total customer number on a directional basis. So, that will continue to be provided. We are also adding a new KPI that really goes to our strategy, and we believe this will help investors track progress against that strategy. We are increasingly focused on moving customers, existing customers to the cloud and driving expansion within that massive base, and as we pointed out in the shareholder letter, this goes hand-in-hand with our strategy of driving breadth and that total customer number.
So we are introducing an additional customer KPI for investors that we will report on a regular basis and to track our progress against this. And that's specifically the number of customers with over $10,000 in cloud ARR. At the end of Q1, as you read in the shareholder letter, we had over 40,000 customers that met that profile growing 18%. And the reason we think this is a valuable metric is because this represents over 75% of our cloud revenue.
So giving investors both the breadth and the secondary metric around shift to cloud and expansion, we think, gives them a great picture holistically of our strategy and our execution against it. Your next question comes from Michael Turits from KeyBanc. Maybe we can talk about JSM. One of the things that I thought was interesting at Team '23 was that movement to templates as a way of taking JSM beyond just the IT department in the other areas of enterprise. Perhaps you can talk a little bit about the success there and how much non-IT take rate you're starting to get with JSM? This is Scott here. That's something we're very excited by is the fact that we get really excited thinking about how health happens across an organization. It's typically a frustrating experience for sort of a matter where you sit in the organization, getting help from another team can be quite a frustrating experience. It's often mediated in slack or e-mails and you have to search for that information to actually get something done.
And while we see IT teams being sort of the forefront of making that a better experience. The more forward of our customers are saying, why is that not the case also for our legal department to get a contract reviewed? Why is that not the case and I want something to my HR department?
And, so as a result of that and building the features there, as you mentioned, with temples, 60% of our JSM customers now use JSM outside of IT. And I think you can see more and more of that. We're particularly excited because at a price point and with our usability, I think we have a better opportunity than any other vendors in this space to go beyond the traditional IT help desk. And so yes, we're really excited about that, and I'm glad you've recognized it. Your next question comes from Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. A couple of questions for me. First, can you give us an update on work management and your progress there in the field? And whether that part of the business is affected more by slower freight to paid conversions.
And the second question relates to the migration. It seemed like as part of your prepared remarks, you suggested maybe I got this wrong, that you expect some customers not to migrate? Can you give a little bit more color on that, have you already heard from customers that they intend to not migrate at all and just move elsewhere or leave without support? If you can give us more color on the magnitude of that cohort? Will be greatly appreciated. This is Cameron. I'll speak to the work management side of this and slightly to the migration piece, then hand off to Joe. So Yes, listen, work management is a key part of our overall offerings. And just remember, the products that we put in there our Confluence, our second largest product, and we have massive adoption across our customer base, and massive usage and has been a key part of our SMB as well as our enterprise business. And many of the new functionalities we drive in Confluence, whether that's the whiteboarding capabilities, automation capabilities, you name it, have been key compelling drivers for migrations themselves.
Adding our other offerings like Jira Work Management, which allows for much simpler business-friendly projects tied to your Jira usage is a great way to extend from those technical development and IT teams into these other business use cases and projects, and we've seen significant adoption of those Jira Work Management project templates. We have a new product called ATLAS allowing you to basically communicate the status and updates on who is working on projects and the status of those projects and the goals and OTRs associated with them, regardless of where the work is happening.
And as we already mentioned, Atlassian together, bringing all those products together in a single offering at a competitive price, allowing customers who are looking to consolidate their work management tools onto a single platform for Atlassian. So absolutely a critical part of our go-to-market going forward and part of our overall financial picture over the last year. As far as the migrations themselves, the server customers, there is a significant portion of server customers who have yet to decide to move to data center or cloud. And we are working with, every single one, I'll tell you right now is definitely aware of this February date.
And we will hopefully ensure that we guide them to either a cloud or data center decision post February. As far as going to alternatives or so on, really, we haven't had many of those conversations or see any spike. The migrations process has been very much in line with our plans and continues to be month-on-month. Joe, Mike, do you have anything to add? Yes. Thanks, Cam. In terms of the question on guidance, there is, as Cam mentioned, a server cohort that will not migrate to data center or server in FY '24. And we factored that into our guidance. We based that on an analysis of our server customer base, the trends we're seeing, the customer profile, the surveys that Cam mentioned. So we have accounted for that. We have a prudent assumption to account for that, and that is in the guidance itself. I can just add one or two more points on work management. Ittai. Firstly, I think we continue to see value in being quite unique in the market in bridging technical and nontechnical teams across the work management space. It's important to note that our 3 markets don't exist in isolation. They each have unique sales motions and unique target personas, but they are intimately connected in a lot of different ways.
For example, you might have marketing teams in Trello that need to connect to engineering teams and operations teams that live in Jira Software, for example, that uniqueness is a really good, a differentiator for us at the moment in the market. Secondly, with things like Atlassian Together, has been mentioned earlier in the call, consolidation on those spaces is a big part of things, and you've seen that with execution so far, but also with the Loom and with the other things that we are delivering and adding to that space. Again, Loom will sit in the work management area as far as Atlassian is concerned.
So just wanted to be clear that we are pretty steadfast in our commitment to work management. We think it's a huge opportunity for us, and we're not waffling around at all. Your next question comes from DJ Hynes from Canaccord Genuity. This is Luke on for DJ. So I'm going to dovetail off of the other questions around migrations after end of life. I'm wondering if you can comment just sort of how much flexibility do your customers have to extend beyond that deadline? How difficult is it for them to continue using those products once they're no longer supported. And then how long could it take for those remaining migrations to actually play out? This is Cameron here. A couple of different dynamics of that question. But first off, will customers, will we extend support to server customers post the server end of life? And the answer there is No. Those customers that gave those customers basically 3.5 years heads up to make this decision, and we're definitely holding by that. That said, if a server customer comes by, just so you know the server licenses are perpetual licenses. So their software will continue to work.
They just simply will not be able to get maintenance patch updates, new functionality or any support from Atlassian support teams. So we'll continue to function just fine. But once again, those customers eventually are going to want to have new capabilities or had something that they need support from and they'll call us up. Now if a customer does call us up, a few months after the server end of life. They're on a server unsupported license and need to help move into the cloud. we absolutely will help them move to the cloud as long as they decide to purchase a cloud license.
And with that, we're happy to have the technical conversation with them to help them move their server licenses up to cloud and whatever technical discussion is required. But that is the only place where we will, to engage those sort of customers, is if they have decided to purchase cloud itself. I'd add on to that, stepping back at the macro level. We've had a couple of years now where we've been focused on migrating our customers with a compelling event of server end of life. But at a macro level, half of the migrations we're getting are from data center. And so that figure doesn't turn off come February next year or if that's going to continue to be there.
And we're continuing to invest in migrating customers across and we continue to invest in making our cloud platform better and better. That's both attracting new customers to cloud and of course, continuing the migrations from data center. So these are investments that like over time, will plateau and we'll start getting our peak migration investments will, at some age start decreasing, and we also say where more and more of our customers are in the cloud.
And if you think about the innovation that we can bring in cloud because of the platform we've got there, that's what I get really excited about. Our ability to bring new products to market is way, way, way faster in the cloud, and you've seen that with our product discovery, you've seen that with Atlas with Compass, with Jira Work Management, which is easy for us to get our customers to migrate from Jira Software and give that nose user in the HR department or in the marketing department to study in Jira Work Management to track their work.
It's easy to put Jira Service Management into these customers and cross-sell there. So the ability for us to both build new innovation in the cloud is way higher, particularly because we built this cloud platform that we've talked about and you've seen and the reason we can bring AI to all of our customers and all of our products, so quickly is the investments we've made in this cloud platform.
And as we hit peak migration, like we'll be out a bit more and more asset behind building new things in this platform. And of course, acquisitions worked really well as well. The fact that we've got these new customers in clouds is way easier to introduce them to Loom than it is for a behind-the-firewall customer out there.
And so I'm super excited. I know we've focused a lot on migration historically, and I know it's really important and it drives a lot of kind of people spreadsheets about how they think about the business. But the more customers we have in cloud, the more innovation we can deliver, the better we can cross-sell our customers, the easier it is for us to get more incremental users inside our inside of products then go wall to wall. And so I'm really excited about more I looked around the opportunities we have and particularly in this moment when customers are coming up for consolidation and they're talking to us and saying, ""Hey, I got to get rid of plenty of other vendors out there because you're mission critical ""and you do things that no one else can.
And, you've got a lot of analytics that allows me to show how work moves across my entire organization. They are great conversations to have. And migration is great, but the real benefits are going to come on the far side of those migrations. And I think that's worthwhile pointing out. Thank you. That's all the questions we have time for today. I will now turn the call over to Mike for closing remarks. Yes. Look, thanks, everyone, for joining the call today. As always, I appreciate your thoughtful questions and continued support. It'd be a bit remiss of me not to thank Cameron for his 11 years of amazing dedicated support friendship and everything else, ending as our Chief Revenue Officer jointly over the last few years.
So just from me and from all of the team, thank you to Cameron before he heads off to his rocking chair and his fortune in retirement, and we hope he really enjoys that. Secondly, on the heels of our high velocity event that Scott talked eloquently about earlier. We have Unleash, which is our agile and DevOps market event next month in Amsterdam.
And we'll be hosting a virtual ESG forum, both of which investor, sorry, the virtual ESG Forum is later this month, both of which investors are welcome to please. We hope to see you there. And beyond that, we hope you have a kick a**s rest of your day.

I will now hand the call over to Martin Lam, Atlassian's Head of Investor Relations. Welcome to Atlassian's Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Call. Thank you for joining us today. Joining me on the call today, we have Atlassian's co-founders and co-CEOs, Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes; Chief Financial Officer, Joe Binz.
Earlier today, we published a shareholder letter and press release with our financial results and commentary for our second quarter of fiscal year 2024. The shareholder letter is available on Atlassian's Work Life blog and the Investor Relations section of our website, where you will also find other earnings-related materials, including the earnings press release and supplemental investor data sheet.
As always, our shareholder letter contains management's insights and commentary for the quarter. So during the call today, we'll have brief opening remarks and then focus our time on Q&A. This call will include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions. If any such risks or uncertainties materialize or if any of the assumptions prove incorrect, our results could differ materially from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements we have.
You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Forward-looking statements represent our management's beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise such statements should they change or cease to be current. Further information on these and other factors that could affect our business performance and financial results is included in the filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including the section titled Risk Factors in our most recently filed annual and quarterly reports.
During today's call, we will also include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are in addition to and are not a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is available in our shareholder letter, earnings release and investor data sheet on the Investor Relations section of our website. We'd like to allow as many of you to participate in Q&A as possible. Out of respect for others on the call, we'll take one question at a time.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott for opening remarks. Thank you for joining us today. As we've already read in our shareholder letter, Q2 was full of significant milestones for Atlassian. When we first went public 8 years ago, we had just over $100 million in quarterly revenue and supported 54,000 customers. Fast forward to today, and we've just posted our first $1 billion revenue quarter, Jira Software crossed $1 billion in Cloud ARR and we surpassed 300,000 customers.
These accomplishments are a true testament to our amazing team, our diverse and passionate customer base and the high-value mission-critical products we deliver. Mike and I are extremely proud and thankful for every single Atlassian who has helped to get us here. In Q2, our R&D engine continued to deliver incredible innovation across our Cloud platform. We rolled out Compass, Virtual Agent capabilities in Jira Service Management on our first phase of the Atlassian Intelligence capabilities into general availability.
We also welcomed Loom to the Atlassian family and have been thrilled to see the team deliver on their ambitious AI vision with many new features including enhanced editing experience that makes updating video as easy as editing a text document. Customers see the value where we're delivering in the Cloud and are turning to us for strategic guidance on how we can unleash the potential for their teams. We're excited by the momentum we are seeing across the business and remain laser-focused on executing against our key strategic priorities: Cloud migrations, serving the enterprise, IPSM, and now AI.
And we're in a great position to get after them with massive market opportunities, strong customer commitment to the Atlassian platform, a unique ability to combine over 20 years of insights with the immense power of AI, and most importantly, a world-class team.
With that, I'll pass the call to the operator for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Congratulations on a lot of milestones this quarter and what looks like a solid quarter. In the shareholder letter, you talked about even absent Loom still expecting an acceleration in the Cloud business into the second half. It sounds like you saw some signs of stabilization in the quarter, but I was hoping you could drill in a little bit further on what gives you guys the confidence to look for that to expect that acceleration into the back half of the year? And what still seems to be an uneven macro environment? Yes. Thanks, Keith. This is Joe. Let me start with the Cloud revenue results in Q2. They were up 27.5%. Loom contributed about 1 point of growth. So our results excluding Loom landed in the middle of our guidance range for the quarter. There were a few cross currents in that performance. So let me walk through them in terms of consumer -- customer segments and growth driver trends to try and help. And then I'll transition into your question on the confidence around H2.
From a customer segment perspective, we had very strong sales execution in the quarter, which drove healthy performance in our enterprise customer segment. This resulted in better-than-expected billings on an annual and large multiyear deals. A significant portion of which landed on the balance sheet, unearned revenue. This also drove healthy upsell to premium versions of our products.
Results conversely in SMB were slightly lower than we expected, and that was driven by paid seat expansion and a mix shift from monthly to annual subscriptions, which, as you know, signal stronger customers' commitment but also carries lower pricing. And as you know, dynamics in the SMB business, good or bad, are largely realized in the quarter given the linearity in that part of the business. In terms of the trends on our key growth drivers in the quarter, migrations from server and data center exceeded our expectations, and that's driven by the significant investment and execution focus we put there.
In terms of paid seat expansion, while the overall rate of paid seat expansion remained lower than the prior year, the pace of deceleration or slope of that trend continued to moderate from Q1. And within that trend, as mentioned earlier, enterprise was better than expected and SMB was slightly worse. We also saw the rate at which customers convert from free to paid at the top of our funnel stabilized relative to Q1 and that's another positive leading indicator.
And then finally, other Cloud growth drivers like cross-sell and customer retention churn and monthly active usage continued to be very healthy and performed in line with our expectations. And beyond that, we didn't really see anything noteworthy in terms of linearity in the quarter or across products, regions or verticals that were largely in line with our expectations.
In terms of the confidence around the H2 guide, the midpoint of our H2 cloud guidance range excluding Loom does assume slightly accelerating growth rates. The factors that give me confidence are the recognition of those strong Q2 billings on annual and large multiyear agreements rolling off the balance sheet, the increasing momentum on Cloud migrations as we focus on unblocking more customers for moving to the Cloud, and continuing to bring new innovation and value to our Cloud offering, the benefit of price increases that are laddering into the model and the momentum we're seeing in enterprise driving healthy upsell to premium and enterprise versions of our products.
I talked about the slope of the trend line on paid seat expansion rates, and that continues to moderate quarter-over-quarter. And I also mentioned the leading indicator around free-to-pay conversions at the top of the funnel. So those are the types of things that give me confidence in the ability to deliver accelerating cloud revenue growth in the second half of the year. And I hope that helps. Your next question comes from Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo. For Scott or Mike, there's been plenty of buildup and probably too much focus from us on the server end of life. For investors asking us what's next, the letter does a good job in framing some of that out. But maybe you can share your vision around what the cloud migration opens up for Atlassian from here.
And then, Joe, just as a follow-on the 10 points of migration tailwind that Cloud line has been -- how should we think about that post server end of life, will that at all lessen? Or does it simply shift more towards data centers? Any puts and takes there for us to consider are useful. Michael, thanks for the question, Scott here. Firstly, for those new to the Atlassian story, just a reminder, we said historically that about 10 points of our Cloud growth has come from migrations. And for those of you who really knew the Atlassian story, this coming quarter in the next few weeks, we will have our end of server support will be happening, which has been a 3-plus year journey with our customers. And so there's 3 points I want to make in answer to your question, Michael.
Firstly is that migrations will continue for multiple years. And we said historically that about half our migrations to the cloud come from our data center customers. In this last quarter, even with a lot of server customers migrating with the end of support, 60% of our migrations in the last quarter came from data center customers. So with that, we expect to see migrations continue for a long time to come. And we've also made huge R&D investments in order to continue our customers moving to the Cloud and you continue to see us doing that.
We've launched data residency in Canada. This last quarter, we also did launch Bring-Your-Own-Key secure software. We continue to remove blockers for our cloud customers and that continues to open up the aperture of migrations. The second point I'd like to make is that Cloud continues to be the gateway to the full Atlassian experience. And Customers, once they get to Cloud are really getting the best we can offer. And you see us continue to deliver innovation in Cloud. So whether that's comfort, which has continued to grow, Jira Product Discovery, which we talked about passing 4,000 paying customers, also Loom in our ecosystem and all the AI functionality that we have already developed and continue to develop are only available in Cloud.
And so with that, our customers get a better experience, but we also have an incredible opportunity to sell customers more products and more functionality that really makes a difference for them. And lastly, enterprise, the third thing is enterprise, which is through these migrations and having these discussions with customers around migrating to cloud, we've really deepened our relationships with our best customers, whether they're North American financial services customers or German auto manufacturers, these discussions have led to us being seen more and more as a strategic partner for them, and they want to do more with us.
And you saw that, we talked about Mercedes Benz in our letter that Mercedes Benz migrated 30,000 fleets from data center to cloud and -- of Jira and Confluence. And as part of that, we're so excited by the usage of our ITSM solution in that process that they then have adopted that and started using it with their customers. And so we are becoming more and more a strategic partner for these large enterprises.
Joe, do you want to talk about some of the puts and takes? Yes. Thanks, Scott. Michael, it's really too early to give a specific number on the migration impact to cloud revenue growth beyond FY '24. I would just echo what Scott said, we continue to expect migrations to be a significant driver of cloud revenue growth in FY '25 and beyond. That's driven primarily by the significant size of the data center installed base. There's a lot of opportunity there because those are some of our very largest customers. And for them, it's more a question of when and not if they move to the cloud. So we continue to expect to see migrations be a significant driver of cloud revenue growth beyond FY '24. Your next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho Securities. Okay. Maybe I'll focus on the data center business. So it's impressive that, that business is still actually growing 30% plus, even after adjusting for the net benefit from migrations, obviously, 41% reported. Joe, when you look at that strong growth, how should we think about the relative contributions from installed base expansion versus pricing versus net new logos? Yes. Thanks, Gregg. You're right. It was another strong quarter for data center. It was solidly ahead of our expectations, driven by stronger-than-expected migrations from server that's partially offset, as you pointed out, by the stronger migrations to Cloud. I'd say the biggest driver once you get past the net migration impact is really seat expansion. And that goes to my point earlier around paid seat expansion performance in enterprise was actually quite strong this quarter.
And so we believe that's a statement around macro as well as our ability to serve those customers and the big investments that we've made to improve our enterprise-grade capabilities, address things like scalability, certifications, data residency, app integration, all these things are very compelling in moving customers to the Cloud, but also in terms of -- and as a result of that, customers are staying with us, and their moving to data center is a stepping stone that will ultimately result in a migration down the road. So it's primarily paid seat expansion from our perspective once you get past the migration impacts. Your next question comes from Fred Havemeyer from Macquarie. I wanted to ask, as we start this year, we've once again seen that layoffs in the tech industry have been picking up, although it was substantially lower scale than what we saw in the prior year. So I wanted to ask, as we look at your outlook and the cloud revenue growth, how comfortable do you feel that guidance is once again derisk for the potential impacts from any sort of layoffs in the tech industry.
And secondly, have you seen any signs at all that these layoffs may be impacting anything in your free-to-paid conversion or anything else to date? Yes. Thanks, Fred. We haven't seen a dramatically different impact than we expected coming into the year relative to the recent announcements. Obviously, it's something we keep an eye on and track. If you think about the guidance, we really haven't changed conceptually how we freshened the guidance ranges for the Cloud. Just to reiterate, the high end of our cloud guidance range for the year assumes healthy acceleration in H2 growth rates that we talked about with Keith.
That's driven -- led by less macro headwinds and the related impact that would have on improving paid seat expansion. It also assumes strong migrations from server to cloud following server end to support and continued strength in data center migrations cross-sell, upsell and customer retention. On the low end of the guide, that -- for the year, that does assume increasing macro headwinds and the impacts you're talking about and the related impact that would have, not only on paid seat expansion, but also areas of our business that have held up well to date, such as migrations and cross-sell and upsell.
And then lastly, I would assume we do a relatively -- we get relatively weak results post server end to support on migrations from server to cloud. So at the midpoint of our guidance, we're assuming that paid seat expansion rates are kind of steady to where they are today, that drives slightly accelerated revenue growth. At the high end of the range, we get favorable macroeconomic outcomes that drive improvement in that and thus better revenue. On the low end, we assume that we see the headwinds and that impacts those paid seat expansion rates. Just to add on to Joe there. He talked about SMB paid seat expansion being a bit weak. But we went over the enterprise business, and we're talking with our biggest customers. I see great excitement amongst them for what we're providing. And that comes in a lot of different ways. It comes in competitive switch-out. We see a lot of our customers looking to us to replace more expensive versions of other products at this particular stage.
I had thought that might happen early in the economic cycle, but it's actually showing up pretty strongly now in a lot of the deals that we're doing of replacing other products out there that might be older and/or more expensive. We're also seeing that in AI and the excitement around customers who are excited to use our AI features. And then the new products that we are delivering in Cloud are having great customer reception.
But it's still very early days. I think that Jira Product Discovery is a great example we talked about where we're delivering innovation and value to these customers in Cloud and they're picking it up and running with it. So they're all strong areas that I think, are sort of counter to any layoffs in technologies. Your next question comes from Karl Keirstead from UBS. I'd like to focus on the remaining server cohort. The sequential decline in server maintenance of $10 million was at least a little bit less than I was modeling. Are you surprised by that stickiness? Can you offer us any help in sizing the cohort that will likely not migrate at the end of support date and continue to run on supported versions and perhaps offer a little color as to what that cohort looks like in terms of customer size, vertical, anything? Yes. Thanks, Karl. This is Joe. I'll go first, and Scott can chime in if he has anything to add. In terms of the server performance that you referenced, server delivered much better results -- than expected results in Q2, and it's certainly been more resilient than we expected over the course of the last year. I'd highlight this that it's not because of slower migrations to cloud and data center, those remain squarely on track, if not ahead of where we expected to be.
In general, what we're seeing is better renewals, better customer retention and less-than-expected churn, which highlights the mission-critical nature of our product and customer commitment to Atlassian's road map and platform. And of course, it also means mathematically, we have a bigger opportunity than we originally thought in terms of future seat migrations to the Cloud, which is a great position to be in.
In terms of the end of support moment, we're about 2 weeks out. And really, there's been no change from what we discussed last quarter other than that we're seeing those stronger renewals and customer retention. We end of server support in a couple of weeks. There's been no change to our focus around migrating as many of those server customers as possible. The customers that remain on that server installed base are predominantly larger, more complex accounts that are typically blocked from the Cloud at the moment. So we continue to expect most of those customers that migrate -- will migrate the data center. And we continue to hold prudent assumptions to account for customers who will choose not to migrate in FY '24, and that's also factored into our guidance. Yes. Just to add some color there. I think Joe has talked to the financial aspect of it. Obviously, with an end-of-life moment, it's hard to predict week-by-week basis exactly what happens. So we've put a lot of test into looking at every single customer that still exists on server and what it will take to get them across the Cloud in an ideal sense or to data center or if they can't move there. As Joe referenced, we had really come to the stickiness of our products and it's kind of a testament to what we've built and how valuable we are for our customers that we haven't seen churn there.
And for many of these customers who can't move to Cloud, data center is a drop in replacement that does not require many months of planning. And so customers can leave it to the last minute and switch out to data center, and I expect to see a lot of that happen as we cross the end of server support threshold in the next few weeks. Your next question comes from Kash Rangan from Goldman Sachs. Congratulations on the results. From a trend line standpoint, the Cloud migration is a big opportunity, clearly. But when you look at the trend over the last 5 to 6 quarters or so, the Cloud has decelerated from 49% or so, I think it was Q1 last year to 27%, and a big chunk of that is coming from migration. So if you look at the net underlying Cloud growth rate, it has decelerated or server continues to -- data center, I am sorry, continues to be a champion. It's gone from 54% or so to 41%.
Can you help understand what could be causing the dichotomy that -- maybe there is a preference for the data center product. If that's the case, then what does the long term look like for the company? Because companies generally either have a cloud product that wins or an on-prem that wins rarely does both win, but maybe it does for Atlassian. Can you help us understand what are you really betting on with your customers? Where do you wish your customers to really go and how are you going to make it happen? Yes, Kash, this is Joe. Customers are not choosing data center over cloud. What's happening here is server migration to data center and cloud both exceeded our expectations. And so we don't see more customers choosing one over the other. If there was any weakness in our cloud performance versus expectations, it's that paid seat expansion has been lower than we expected. And this quarter, it was slightly lower than we expected, particularly in SMB.
DC strength on the other hand, as I mentioned earlier, was also driven by stronger migrations from server as well as paid seat expansion. So we feel really good about the fact that customers are looking at data center as a stepping stone to the Cloud and ultimately, we want to get those customers to the Cloud because that's where our customers receive the best experience, the most secure experience from Atlassian, and it gives us a chance to add more and more value over time, as Scott discussed earlier in the call. Let me add to that, which is every customer I've talked to, whether that be a German bank kind of we would consider on a more conservative end of the scale through to small, medium-sized businesses out there even in regulated environments. All of them are telling me the Cloud is the future. And if you went 5 years ago, we were telling customers Cloud with the future. These days customers are doing calling me. That's the case.
And in many cases, is that, they either need the time to plan a migration if we've got tens of thousands of users, that is a chance not only to migrate to the product we have in Cloud but expand your usage of Atlassian, look at other products that we can replace and so we see a lot of that happening, but that takes a little bit of time at the largest customers or in some cases, but decreasing. Our customers have bought some Cloud and they are pushing us to say, ""Oh, I need data residency or a certification or FedRAMP."" So we're thinking about a lot of that with our customers. Your next question comes from Nick Altmann from Scotiabank. Awesome. I wanted to circle back to sort of the stabilization in the free-to-pay conversion. I guess when you think about how in the quarter, you saw that stabilize. Do you think that was an anomaly just because perhaps as a stronger spending period for software? Or you kind of see it stabilizing over the next coming quarters? Thanks for the question. We do see it as a stabilizing -- durable stabilizing factor. We think it's super important because it's a leading indicator of success. Today's land and new customers are tomorrow's expansion opportunity. So we fundamentally believe that a lot of that is macro driven. I'd also say we've done a good job of investing to improve the efficiency of our funnel and to improve the efficiency and the hit rate on that free-to-paid conversion.
And so hats off to the team inside Atlassian who is doing a phenomenal job on driving improvement there. So some of it is macro, some of it is absolutely our own execution. And overall, we feel it's durable moving forward. Your next question comes from Ryan MacWilliams from Barclays. Great to see data centers driving more than 60% of Cloud migrations at this point. So in the shareholder letter, and you've just been mentioning how you've been unblocking some of the largest customers on data center to help them move the Cloud. Do you have a rough idea of what percentage of data center revenue you would consider blocked today? And if unblocked, will these customers be willing to move to the cloud after recently moving to data center. Yes, Ryan, we're not going to -- I'm not going to able to -- sorry, go ahead, Scott. No, it's okay, Joe. You go ahead. Yes. Ryan, I was going to say we're not going to be able to provide a breakdown today on what that blocked percentage is. Keep in mind, those data center customers are primarily our largest and most complex. So you can imagine it's all the things we're investing against and making progress on. I mentioned earlier, scalability, data residency, certifications, app integration, a lot of investment, a lot of effort going to unblock that. That's why we're confident in the ability to continue to grow migrations from data center to cloud. And so we feel very confident in our ability to continue to drive migration over the next coming years. And Ryan, just to chime in, this is Mike here. I'll give you over to a brief because you haven't asked any product questions today. I've also -- it's about the long-term partnership with our customers. I think that's really important, even more so for the biggest of the big. One of the things that the customers will tell us is that they've been really impressed by our delivery over the last 3 to 5 years in the cloud of enterprise capabilities. We have a public cloud road map.
So we do talk about FedRAMP delivery, data residency delivery, compliance delivery across all the different geographies that we operate in. The last quarter, we hit 100% of that road map in terms of delivery on time and what that's building is this long-term strategic partnership, long-term relationship with those biggest of the big customers. We believe in our enterprise business over the next decade and hopefully many decades, it's about building a partnership with those biggest customers that we have.
And that partnership is built on trust. It's built on continued delivery of the things that we say we're going to deliver. And when you talk to those customers, as Scott mentioned, they are believing that Cloud is their long-term future. They understand that. They're working on moving in all sorts of different rates. We have a great proportion of our migrations coming from data center today, but that engineering delivery has been a hallmark of our strength in terms of building that partnership with those customers. And obviously, we intend to continue that over time. Your next question comes from Keith Bachman from BMO. Congratulations on the solid quarter and guide. Joe, I wanted to direct this for you. You've implicitly given us guidance for the June quarter, which is post the expiration of server. And I just wanted to get your thoughts to what extent is the June quarter a reasonable proxy without -- for FY '25 growth rate.
So I'm not asking for '25, but I'm just asking, is there anything usual in the implied growth rates for cloud and data center that we should think about as we're considering our '25 estimates. In other words, is the February deadline going to pull forward a bunch of revenues? Or is there anything else that we should think about for that June quarter exit run rate? Yes, thanks. It's really too early to talk specifically about FY '25. In general, I'll talk a little bit about the individual lines. If you look at data center, we do expect growth rates there will continue to decelerate as server to data center migrations drop essentially to zero and the data center to cloud migrations accelerate as we continue to deliver on removing Cloud blockers.
In terms of the Cloud, we've talked a lot on the call about migrations being a multiyear journey, so I won't rehash that. In addition to that, keep in mind, we have a number of other drivers in that model. First of all, paid seat expansion within existing customers is the biggest driver and even bigger than the migrations factor that we've talked about. And that has been an area in the model that's been most impacted by macro headwinds over the last year.
So a lot of your view on '25 is going to depend on macro outcomes. Then our opportunity to cross-sell additional products to our over 300,000 existing customers, our ability to upsell the premium and enterprise additions of our products is another significant growth driver. And then with the smaller impact, other drivers like the free-to-pay conversion that we've talked about, the price increases that we've made and new high-growth products like Compass, Jira Product Discovery and Loom. And I'd just point out, we're in a super dynamic space right now, particularly with and there's a lot of opportunity to add value with solid execution.
So we feel very confident in our ability to deliver healthy revenue growth over a multiyear period in the Cloud. And then obviously, server is going to be zero essentially in 2 weeks when we get to the server and to support. So that's the color I'd give you for now. We'll continue to update you over the course of the next 6 months. But that's how I would -- that's where our mindset is, and that's how I think about it directionally. Your next question comes from Fatima Boolani from Citi. I just wanted to shift gears to Jira Service Management. You're clocking in about 50,000 customers since about 3, 3.5 years from launch, about 20% of your base. But I was hoping to ask some more quantitative color as to how the monetization curve looks like? And when should we expect a JSM to become as a large arrival the size of Jira and Confluence as a revenue contributor to the business? I can take that. The -- look, we remain incredibly excited about JSM and the service management market broadly, both in terms of IT service management and enterprise service management for all functions within the business. I think we've done a really good job at continuing to grow that business alongside our other businesses that we have. It's always hard when your plan catch-up. It's got about a decade to catch up on Jira software in the Agile and DevOps market. It certainly has the potential to do that, and we continue to see it being our fastest growth broad market that we have.
It's also worth noting that for a lot of our customers, our strength is in the combination of the markets. So people who buy Jira Service Management, some of them as Scott mentioned are migrating off expensive and legacy tools, and we see increasing numbers of switch outs, which is always comforting to see but more importantly, they're buying it because of our connection to developers in connection to the work management market and broader connectivity across their organization.
Increasingly, you're going to see a blending of this as software and technology become the core strategic advantage and operating and delivering on that service alongside that is incredibly important. So I think we are very bullish on the long-term monetization of Jira Service Management and the ITSM and ESM spaces broadly, both because of our competitive positioning as we've seen and demonstrated this quarter and last quarter and the quarter beforehand. But also because of our connectivity to the two adjacent markets, which is strategically why we're there in the first place. Scott may have some customer color that you want to add on top of that? Yes. I just want to remind everyone that ITSM is right in Atlassian's valley wick like it really goes together with our Jira Software, which is development teams and all the other products we've got there work very closely with IT teams and increasingly so every single day. And that's something that only we deliver in this market and we've been recognized actually over the last few months by this. We were a leader in Forrester's ESM Wave, where we received the highest possible score for strategy. And as a company that -- we've been doing this for a while now, but it wasn't the thing we started with, it's really comforting to see that we were being recognized for the unique things that we -- only we can provide in the market.
And not only is that being recognized by analysts, but key switcher stories, right? We have a lottery travel company who've been a 15-year customer of one of our large competitors in this space, who started out -- who switched to JSM and switched away from that legacy vendor. And we see that again and again with a large logistics provider who moved 1400 agents to JSM. So we're really -- we've been strong historically in the SMB space. That's kind of where we started. We're increasingly seeing strength in the enterprise space as well, as well as industry analysts are recognizing us. Your next question comes from Alex Zukin from Wolfe Research. I want to maybe shift a little bit towards understanding the unlock in kind of the OpEx and COGS basis post migration. If we think about elevated COGS activity, salespeople continue to be focused on migration that start to unlock and focus on cloud and cross-sell, upsell. As well as the incremental R&D costs that you've been kind of putting into the entire platform as you've been doing this over the last couple of years. What's the right way to think about that opportunity on kind of the operating margin side and the OpEx portfolio as we go -- as we get even into the next few quarters? Yes. Thanks, Alex. This is Joe. Let me start with sort of our view of H2 on OpEx. And then I'll touch directly on your question around the points of leverage we see from an OpEx and cost management perspective. We'll see growth -- OpEx growth rates accelerate in H2, and this is really driven by two factors. One is the ongoing growth and investments in our core strategic priorities. Those are things like Cloud and enterprise and artificial intelligence, ITSM and the other core markets that we're in.
And the other thing is more mechanical. It's we're lapping the benefit we received in H2 last year from the restructuring and lower bonus expenses. You've heard me talk about our philosophy overall on OpEx management. We continue to focus on maximizing the return on every dollar spent. We're focused on making disciplined prioritization and resource allocation calls and driving operational efficiencies as we gain scale.
I'd say the other factor to keep in mind that's over time, not necessarily in the immediate future is on the other side of the significant multiyear investments in Cloud and enterprise capability, we will have the opportunity to reallocate that investment to other areas that will drive long-term growth. And that will be another potential point of leverage for us as we think about it.
In terms of gross margin, in general, gross margins will track with the revenue mix. Cloud gross margin structurally obviously have lower gross margin than our licensing business. So as that becomes a bigger mix of our overall revenue, that will put pressure on gross margins blended. At the same time, the mindset we have on cloud gross margins is to drive year over -- consistent year-over-year improvement through the great investments we're making on the engineering side to optimize cloud infrastructure to improve support and so again, you're right, we're going to make big investments on post sale activity to drive deployment and usage and engagement.
And then we're going to have an opportunity to redeploy that and become more efficient over time, and that will be part of that story. So that's the general framework on how we're thinking about both the cloud COGS side as well as the OpEx side going forward. Alex, maybe I can just add a small bit of color from an engineering point of view. Look, philosophically, I think all world-class engineering organizations in any large fast or SAP-type company should be working on continuing to optimize engineering costs. As you're running -- as we are an incredibly large Cloud platform that's now geographically diverse, as you see from all the data residency improvements and other things, there are opportunities to save money effectively by running things more efficiently over time. And some of that learning comes from scale, some of that learning comes from deployment, some of that learning comes from new technologies.
We certainly have a large investment as a world-class, world-leading R&D organization and continuing to do the things we did last quarter, cheaper, better, faster and more efficiently. Sometimes that money has returned, as Joe said, in the finances. At other times, it's invested in other things. So it might be we learn how to do things more efficiently and run systems and services more efficiently, that then allow us to do things like that a residency in a global sense, other times in things like Atlassian Intelligence, a lot of the AI features, it's about getting the features out first, and then working out how to cost optimize over time as we watch customer usage patterns, we can work our head of scale and make that more efficient.
So certainly something in engineering, we spend a lot of time working on, and we've had great results over the last 2 to 3 years as our Cloud platform has grown increasingly more complex, but also that gives us more leverage. Your next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies. An Atlassian Intelligence, I believe it's GA now. And I'm curious if you could give us a sense of what you're seeing and then ultimately, the monetization path in AI. And I guess one of the questions we're getting is if you're seeing a faster move to DC versus Cloud, does this slow your AI adoption pathway down or not? Brent, I'm glad. I can take that one. I was worried about you all not asking an AI question until well into the call. Just checking you're all updated. Look, Cloud, Atlassian Intelligence and AI generally is a huge advantage for Atlassian. Like we deeply, deeply grateful as a company that focuses on knowledge workers and unleashing the potential of the team, a company that has a huge amount of data that customers have entrusted us with, the ability to remix, summarize and give that data back in different forms to customers using a lot of these large language models and machine learning technology is incredible.
It's very exciting in terms of what we can deliver. As you mentioned, the initial Atlassian intelligence feature set, largely went GA during the quarter, it has had a fantastic customer reception. There's no other way to say that. We saw that when we announced it at Team '23 last year in Las Vegas, and we've continued to see that as we work with all of the early access program and the beta customers and now being in GA.
The ability to change how people do work in non-technical teams and in technical teams is just an unlock when we talk about our mission to unleash potential in every team. It's literally doing that in fantastical ways. We had more than 20,000 customers that use the features during the beta period, which, for us, as far as the beta goes is sort of off the chart in terms of interest, which is fantastic. And as you mentioned, we do see server and increasingly more of a data center customers. It being a factor in their movement, right? It being a factor in their migration. There's a clear logical understanding among customers, that the last language model-driven and machine learning-driven features are based in the Cloud, which means that the customers move to the cloud in order to get access to those features.
And it is another reason in a whole tapestry of reasons why customers are looking to move. And we've certainly seen really great adoption of those features so far, really excited about Atlassian Intelligence. Really excited about virtual agents and Jira Service Management continuing to just drive straight efficiencies for customers and again, driving that movement up to premium enterprise additions as we've talked about beforehand.
And lastly, as I mentioned earlier, Loom AI and the Loom intelligence features that we shipped last month. again, driving great adoption of Loom because it's a different category than the other Atlassian Intelligence features, but the ability to create and consume video more efficiently is really quite fantastic using some of these technologies. So I don't think our excitement could be higher and our commitment and the amount of resources we're spending in R&D to do this equal to the best in the world is paramount for us. Your next question comes from Ari Terjanian from Cleveland Research. Strength in deferred revenue performance was notable. I was wondering if you could help unpack how much some of the newer initiatives around step-up credits, dual licensing, hybrid ELAs as well as Atlassian Advisory services helped drive the strength in the larger enterprise deals there? And how should we think about some of those newer programs flowing through to revenue over the coming quarters, meaning to the extent there was dual licensing, how does that flow through to D.C. and Cloud? And similarly, advisory services, how does that like flow through to revenue, be it showing up in other or cloud or D.C.? Yes. Thanks, Ari. This is Joe. You're right. We were thrilled with our billings performance in the quarter. It was higher than we expected and was a record for the company. As you mentioned, you see this performance in our unearned revenue balance, which accelerated to 30% year-over-year growth. You'll also see it in the remaining performance obligations, which increased over $1.9 billion. The outperformance there this quarter was driven by great sales execution that we talked about earlier, and that resulted in several large multiyear agreements.
And those are the agreements that you were referencing, hybrid ELAs, dual licensing, they're having a material impact on our ability to grow our business in the enterprise space. I'd say the way you're going to see that show up is primarily in the form of migrations because a lot of that is targeted at establishing those relationships with our customers over multiple years.
Many of those customers are using data center as a stepping stone until they're ready to move to the cloud. It shows up both in a data center and our Cloud revenue rose from a P&L accounting perspective. And we basically attribute revenue based on the relative list price between those two. So it's roughly 50-50, give or take, between those two things as you think about the mechanical accounting of it. Thank you. That's all the questions we have time for today. I will now turn the call over to Mike for closing remarks. Thanks, everyone, for joining the call today from wherever you're joining the world. We really, really appreciate you being here. As always, also appreciate thoughtful questions and continued support of Atlassian and analysis. A small note, we look forward to seeing all of you, hopefully, at Team '24 in Las Vegas at the end of April. And with that, have a kick a*s weekend.","this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay on the Investor Relations section of Atlassian's website following this call .

I'd like to allow as many of you to participate in Q&A as possible. Out of respect for others on the call, we'll take one question at a time. With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott for opening remarks. Thank you for joining us today. We've already read in our shareholder letter, Q3 was truly a milestone quarter for last June. Today, Atlassian is a cloud majority company. We have over 300,000 customers using our cloud products, a 3x increase in paid fees in the cloud since we announced the winding down of support for server 3.5 years ago. And while this is just one significant moment among many across our multiyear cloud journey, we are thrilled with what we've achieved to date. We migrated more paid seats to cloud than we had initially projected, and our churn has been consistently lower than expected from our server base.
This big volumes about the [ medical rollout ] products play the value they deliver and our customers' desire to realize the innovation in our cloud products. We now have an even large opportunity in cloud than originally believed. You'll see us continue to execute against our road map and we have more innovation to pay the past [indiscernible] drive, durable future growth. We're also announcing that I'll be stepping down as Co-CEO of Atlassian on the 31st of August this year. It's been a difficult decision, but after 23 years, it's time to pursue some other passions I have. to be investing and to help grow and build the global technology industry. And while there is never a perfect time to step away, I'm supremely confident of where Atlassian is at.
We've got one of the best cloud platforms in the industry. Our .8 new products are gaining real traction with customers and revenue, AI [indiscernible] and exciting opportunities, and our customers are increasingly choosing to consolidate around Atlassian. And I'm proud of for the most experienced leadership team in our history. I will remain an active Board member and assume a special adviser role with Mike continuing on as CEO. I have complete trust in Mike leading the way to [indiscernible]. I'll turn it over to you, Mike. Thanks, Scott. Yes, milestone quarter for a number of reasons. Now there'll be plenty of time for celebrations and farewells as this is not Scott's last earnings call, but I do want to touch on his news briefly. As you all know, Scott and I have known each other for nearly 3 decades and have experienced every major life milestone together. This company simply would not be Atlassian without Scott. And I'm truly thankful to have had him by my side every day for the last 23 years.
In this next chapter, I'm sure we will remain great mates and trusted partners, and I'm glad that I can support him through this both personally and professionally as I continue to lead Atlassian forward as CEO. Atlassian has always been my #1 professional priority and focus. Scott and I have both won every hat over the last 2 decades, confident in taking over full responsibility of the company. I'm incredibly excited about the massive opportunities that we have in front of us across our 3 markets in work management, software development and service management. We are certain [indiscernible] and AI, where our unique team data and insights allow us to offer unique capabilities and unleash our customers' potential.
As we continue to attack our opportunities, I want to reiterate the commitments that we've made to continue to grow over the long term, while returning to our historical margin levels. We have a thoughtful plan in place to continue to drive durable revenue growth, and we feel really good about our agile approach to appraise behind key strategic areas like enterprise NII, while driving leverage as we scale, and we couldn't be more excited about the future. With that, I'll pass the call to the operator for Q&A. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Ryan MacWilliams from Barclays. Just like to hear about the overall macro trends at this point. [indiscernible] develop for hiring, like have you noticed any trends around the green shoots of growth for IT budgets or powering developers? And then separately, just one quick housekeeping item for Joe. What was the loan contribution to cloud revenue growth in the third quarter? And maybe how you're thinking about its contribution to the fourth quarter? Yes. Thanks, Ryan. I'll start. From a macro perspective, macro trends were very much in line with what we saw in Q2 and in line with our expectations. Enterprise was healthy across both cloud and data center, and that drove the record billings, strong growth in annual multiyear agreements. Strong migration and good momentum in sales of premium and enterprise additions of our products that you see rolling through our revenue results. The macro impact on SMB, on the other hand, continued to be challenging, although also in line with expectations. And that macro headwind in SMB lands primarily in cloud, given SMB makes up a significant part of that business. And within cloud, it lands primarily in paid seat expansion.
So stepping back more broadly within cloud, the trends in Q3 were very consistent with Q2 as well as our expectations coming into the quarter. And then paid seat expansion rates remained well below prior year levels, but the decelerating trend quarter-to-quarter did continue to moderate from Q2. So that's a positive sign. All of the other growth drivers migrations, cross-sell, upsell, new customers, monthly active usage, churn, et cetera. Those were all in line with our expectations and stable overall. And then in terms of Loom, we -- basically, from a quarter perspective, we're not going to provide specifics on revenue or growth rate. We were pleased with the growth we're seeing and excited by the customer reaction to the recent AI innovations we've been introducing into Loom's product line.
In terms of performance in the quarter, Loom revenue in Q3 was squarely in line with our expectations. And in terms of our fiscal year guidance, in terms of our overall revenue and operating margin guidance for the year, we continue to expect Loom to have about 1.5 points of impact on FY '24 cloud revenue growth for the year and for Loom to be slightly dilutive to FY '24 and FY '25 operating margins. The next question comes from Fred Havemeyer from Macquarie. Thank you very much. Scott, we know you're not leaving immediately, but certainly will be quite missed on these calls. I wanted to ask, with respect to those -- the super migration at this point, it's very encouraging to hear that churn was looking much lower than expected and primarily the customers have transitioned on to data center. But are there any customers that are left over at this point in time that might make a future transition after limping along for some period of time here? Fred, this is Joe. It's difficult to know exactly how many server customers remain running unsupported at this point. We believe it's a small number and certainly smaller than we thought it would be entering the quarter. We're not assuming any material contribution to either data center or cloud revenue growth from this cohort of customers moving forward in the guidance. And operationally, our focus now is squarely on enabling our data center customers to move to the cloud. The next question comes from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. This is Sanjit Singh on for Keith. I actually want to ask a question about customer call out that you had in the shareholder letter. You guys mentioned that [ FanDuel ] was able to cut tickets that require human interventions by 85%, which is a pretty fantastic result for [ Fanduel ]. In terms of that customer, are you pricing that and contract on a seat basis? And how would you think about when they achieve those types of efficiency gains? How do you think about the revenue opportunity with some of the [indiscernible] with the Elastin products. Yes. That's a great question, Sanjit, and I think one on people's minds is AI increasingly helps produce these incredible ROI experiences that we're seeing across softener base. And at the moment, we have historically priced our -- almost all of our products on some sort of seat basis with some usage basis that has happened in certain areas of the product such as BitBucket pipelines that we've charged for units to build and stuff like that.
We are experimenting going forward with more usage-based [ private seats ]. So it's -- I don't want to get into one specific customer, but we think that there is a world in the future where we do have some sort of usage back pricing around these interactions with the ROI from customers. And so we'll see more experimentation with that going forward, but [indiscernible]. Your next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho Securities. Scott, all the best in your future endeavors, even though I know, as Mike said, you'll be with us for a little while longer, fortunately. So my question is, obviously, this is just an upside quarter. Having said that, I think the big question is one of sustainability. The cloud revenue in the quarter was all in line with guidance with all of the upside coming from data center and marketplace and marketplace itself is tied to the data center as well. But we're never going to have another quarter of server migrations. And clearly, there was also a decent amount of pull forward given the recent data center price increase. And so as we look ahead into next year and beyond, the question is can it last, in fact, continue to show good growth. Yes. Great question, Gregg. Thanks for asking. Let me try and share a little bit of perspective on that without giving specific numbers for FY '25. At the highest level, the long-term revenue growth of the company is really driven by the opportunities we have in our three large high-growth markets that Mike touched on at the top of the call. and secular trends around things like digital transformation and software is a critical factor to the success of every company.
From there, there are several growth drivers across cloud and data center. In terms of cloud, given the size of the data center installed base, we do continue to expect migrations to be a key driver of cloud revenue growth over several years, although we do expect that impact to [ wane ] gradually over time. Now to drive migrations, we're delivering a cloud platform that provides the best customer experience with analytics and automation and AI as well as better TCO for the customer. And those factors will only improve and grow stronger over time. As part of that, we are investing in new and highly valuable product innovation as well, and much of that is only currently available on premium enterprise additions of our products, our cloud products.
And we are working to unblock and help customers migrate and deploy on our cloud and making good progress on scalability and certifications and app integration and extensibility, all of which are very relevant to our largest customers in data centers. So we have a lot of confidence in the migration space. From there, as you know, there are multiple growth drivers in the cloud we've discussed in the past, things like paid seat expansion within our existing customer base, our opportunity to cross-sell additional products to our over 300,000 customers upselling to premium and enterprise additions of our products.
And then with the smaller [indiscernible] growing over time, are other drivers like new customer adds and new high-growth proms, Jira product discovery and Loom. And of course, pricing is the final lever in the cloud model. In terms of data center, we expect organic expansion and pricing to be durable, long-term drivers given the high renewal rates on data center agreements and the enterprise nature of that customer base. And with AI, we are well positioned with the unique data graphs around high-value workloads, and there's a lot of opportunity in that space as well. And we're off to a solid start with Atlassian intelligence with more [ AI ] on the way.
And then finally, add on significant opportunity we have for further penetration enterprise, where we've had great signal and momentum over the last year. And overall, all up, we feel confident in our ability to invest behind and deliver healthy revenue growth over a multiyear period as a result of that. Gregg, I just wanted to chime in at a high level. I think -- there's given a very fantastic and comprehensive answer there. I think we should remember that any upside in data center is long-term upside for the cloud in terms of the destination for those customers over the long arc of time. I think our end of server journey, as you mentioned, from a migration point of view, overall, it's been a huge success, right? Over the last 4 years, we beat our original expectations for the number of paid seats that we migrate to cloud, we ended with less churn overall than we thought we would have over that 3- or 4-year period.
We've tripled the number of paid seats in cloud during that period since we -- since we announced the 3 years ago. I think the way I would zoom out and see that is, that is an example of Atlassian executing against the long-term goal as a team and as a company, and we can do hard things. We say this all the time internally. Data center customers moving to hybrid deployments, which is generally the way they go through in the middle and then to cloud. It's a different journey. These are our largest and most complex customers. They have different requirements, different things, but we will get them there.
We will execute against that mission over the next few years in the same way that we executed against the last mission, I have confidence in Atlassian to do that. And if you want a singular statistic of how that's going, again, the data center to cloud migrations over the first 3 quarters of this year, were up 90%, 9-0, on the first 3 quarters of last year on a year-on-year basis. So we are already migrating data center customers to the cloud. So that overperformance is a long-term good sign for us. Your next question comes from Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo Securities. Results were quite strong in a still tough environment. I think the stock is initially reacting more to the surprise news from Scott. So maybe you can both Scott and Mike give us a peek behind the scenes around how you have historically divided the CEO role? And Mike, would be helpful to hear more around is becoming sole CEO at all changes the role or key points of focus on your end from a product or a strategic perspective. I think just any detail there is useful. Thanks, Scott here. I'll the first [indiscernible]. Look, Mike and I have worked together for 23 years. We used to take terms, taking the bins out in our first office. So we've kind of done every job equally over that period of time. Mike's run go-to-market for well over half that time, I've run actual little less than that. I've run engineering Mike runs engineering products. So we've kind of done everything together over that period of time. And I think that's relatively [indiscernible]. I mean, ourselves unique actually kind of shared and give you those responsibilities and change them over time. I think it's also extremely unique there.
And so I don't think there's anything that Mike hasn't done before that we'll be picking up and in the philosophy is around how we run finances and how we think about the growth of business and investments like we've spent a lot of time together over the years, doing and though go and file it in to me for the last half a dozen years or so. Mike and I spent a lot of time together looking at where we want to grow the business and what our investment profile is so Mike, do you want to add anything? Yes. Thanks, Scott. Thanks, Michael. Look, other than Scott being clearly better than I was taking the bins out. We'll work on that going forward. But I want to say from a long-term point of view, eco Scout last point, right? Our philosophies as a company, our values, our mission to unleash the potential of every team and the culture. This has been a constant of the company for the last 23 years, and it's going to continue to be a constant going forward. We hope for a very long time.
We're a very long-term thinking company, certain ways of being that we don't expect to change nor do I think Scott would want them to change or no do I think that should change. Now we live in a highly changing environment. So we can't say nothing's going to change. What we can say is in the short to medium term, sort of the closer focus, we're very clear on our strategies and our execution. As Scott mentioned, we have the most experienced executive team we've ever had. I'm super lucky to get to work alongside the mall every single day, even executing through this mini project, if you like.
From a strategy point of view, look, we're very clear. We include our investors, our shareholders, our customers, what our focuses are in terms of the opportunities we have in the enterprise and with migrations. In terms of the ITSM and ESM market and continue to invest strongly there and seeing strong results. And then in the AI era, we have some fantastic opportunities. So those are the current priorities as we said. That doesn't change from yesterday to today, and we'll keep you updated as we move forward. Your next question comes from Alex Zukin from Wolfe Research. Maybe mine is tied to the data center to cloud journey that you've seen both over the first 3 quarters of this year, in the context of some customers kind of signing more longer-term deals and in the construct of kind of this notion that the end of server life unblocks the company's ability to focus on a lot more things. What does that mean for data center to cloud migration trends in terms of both from a financial perspective, maybe next quarter and next year, that 10 points you previously thought? And then just beyond, if you look at the activity of where those customers are migrating in terms of a tier basis and what that's doing to ARR or ACV growth. Yes. Thanks, Alex. A lot of questions there, so if I don't hit them all, bring me back. So I'll start with migrations. We do continue to expect migrations to be a key driver of cloud revenue growth in Q4 and FY '25. Despite a few if any server migrations post into support, this is due to the significant size of the data center installed base and the opportunity we have to enable those customers, some of our very largest customers to move to the cloud. And that opportunity today is even bigger than we expected it to be 3 months ago, given the strong customer retention and migrations from server to data center this quarter.
Having said that, we also expect the cloud revenue growth to gradually decline over time from the approximately 10-point benefit in FY '24, given the lack of server migrations. Now to drive -- I talked earlier about the things we're doing. So we have a lot of confidence in our ability to execute on that and to drive it. So that's how we think about the growth impact to cloud from migrations going forward. In terms of the deal structure, if you look at our overall deal volume this quarter, even though we had a large number of absolute deals, the mix between annual and multiyear were very consistent and similar to past quarters. So think of the overall volume growing and within that volume, the mix between multiyear and annual being the same. I just had a few small points to that, Alex. Firstly, in terms of deals like you're seeing a lot more hybrid deals, obviously, from the data center type customer. One of the points that we clear is the larger and more complex customers moving to the cloud is not a sort of a 1-day single button click event like changing an app on your phone, right? They have complex deployments with lots of [indiscernible] and they're enmeshed into deep customer workflows. This is fantastic for Atlassian. This shows how much value we have in our products. It means the migration journey is more of a gradual over time series of events. And that shows up in their hybrid both in terms of their deployment environment, topology and their deal construct.
I will say, we continue to be agile with our resources at Atlassian, we pride ourselves in our ability to move R&D around to where we need it to be. Obviously, with the end of server, we can move slightly more R&D towards the cloud, but we maintain a strong commitment to the data center business and continuing to move that forward. And there's still lots of work to do, right? We're incredibly proud of the work we've done in performance and scale, in governance and data residency. We rolled out 7 new regions this quarter and an extensibility and all the things that our largest customers need, and you'll see us continuing to invest in those over the coming year as part of the journey. Your next question, Keith Bachman from BMO Capital Markets. Yes. Joe, I think this is for you as well, but I wanted to talk about data center growth. So the guidance that you've given for Q4 of, call it, 40 to 42 with points of help, even net of help, it would have -- kindly stronger than I would have anticipated. And so if we look out over the horizon, is there any puts and takes that you can give us on how to construct or think about data center growth specifically. And just to even take a step back, as we look at Analyst Day next week, or the analyst event, I should say, that's very much looking forward to. Will management provide some longer-term model frameworks, either the top line or margin construct? Yes. Great question, Keith. Thanks. Let me start with the data center question and frame it in terms of long-term growth drivers on that model. We expect data center growth rates will decelerate through FY '25 just given the migration dynamics into and out of data center and the challenging comparables are going to have to FY '24 to the question earlier, we're not going to have another server and to support moment in FY '25. Having said that, in FY '24 growth benefited from migration flows from server net the headwind from data center migration to cloud. And with server and to support, we do expect that benefit to wane over the course of the next year to 18 months, given limited if any new migrations from unsupported server customers and accelerating data center migrations from cloud, we should see a much more pronounced decrease in that benefit in H2 FY '25 and into FY '26 as we lap the strong migrations from server in this quarter, at which point we'll likely have a net headwind to data center revenue growth driven by migration to the cloud.
So that's sort of the migration stories I think it's also important to keep in mind as you think about long-term data center growth rates, our customer base here is predominantly enterprise with very high renewal rates and price increases and expansion are the other key drivers beyond those migration dynamics. And we do expect those to remain healthy contributors to growth going forward.
In terms of Analyst Day, I appreciate the interest in that, really looking forward to seeing you and many of your colleagues next week. I'm not going to share a whole lot today other than to say we plan to share our optimism around the long-term opportunities we have how we think about the drivers of durable growth and the key areas of investment we'll be making that will enable us to deliver on that. And I'll share the rest next week when we get together. Next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies. Joe, I think many on the buy side are still hung up on why cloud is growing faster right now. And I know you're expecting to accelerate going forward. But what is I mean when you think about the differential of kind of the expectation versus what you're seeing, what has been holding cloud back as much? Is it just D.C. was easier to make the migration? Is there something else that's going on? Because I think most felt like this would actually move a little faster, and we know it's going to accelerate going forward for your guide. But just curious to get your thoughts on what you think is maybe can restrain some of the growth or maybe our expectations are just too big. Yes. With respect to the server and to support, Brent, you'll recall that we did talk about the fact that of the server customers that were there at end of support, we expected the vast majority, if not all of those customers to migrate to data center, right, because those are large customers with very complex environments. And it's a much easier migration path to data center than cloud. And most of those customers need a little more time. So [indiscernible] part of the model has performed in line or better than what we expected all year, and it's held up really well.
Stepping back at the overall cloud business. I think the main pain point has been around paid seat expansion and weakness. Everything else in the model has performed in line with what we expected entering the year. and continues to hold up really well in what has been a really mixed, if not difficult macroeconomic environment. In terms of paid seat expansion, our rate of paid seat expansion in the quarter overall remained below prior year levels, as I mentioned earlier. But I talked about the fact that trend quarter-to-quarter is improving and beginning to moderate from prior quarters. Within that trend, seat expansion rates in SMB continue to be particularly challenged. And so that's been, if you want to center the pain point there and the expectation delta that could be an aspect of it.
Our enterprise rates remain very stable. And so we continue to believe a big driver of this trend is macro as customers tightly managed headcount growth and costs and where we see SMB more impacted, broadly speaking than enterprise. So from our perspective, that's been the primary pain point and the headwind on the business from a cloud perspective. The remaining drivers, whether it's migration or cross-sell or upsell to premium additions even new customers are coming back in line. All of those aspects continue to perform well and in line with our expectations. So that's -- from our perspective, that's been the biggest expectation Delta. Next our next question comes from Nick Altmann from Scotiabank. Wanted to build on the last question a little bit. But just in your prepared remarks, you guys talked about how the opportunity around cloud today is much larger versus your initial expectations. And I was just wondering if you guys could impact that a bit. I mean you guys talked about seat counts on cloud or higher churn sort of was above expectations. But maybe just talk about why you see the opportunity more significant today than you did several years ago? what's sort of driving that heightened optimism? And just any other color you can provide around what you guys are seeing with your current cloud customers that's driving the upside versus sort of your initial expectations. Thanks, Nick. Its Scott here. A couple of reasons. One is -- let's just take the migration asset first, which is that in our migration models, everything has performed as expected. In terms of how many people we expect to migrate from server to cloud. What these companies allow people to trend out. And I think as pointed to the stickiness of our overall offering to our customers. These are the times when you would expect competitors or alternatives to be researched out there in the market. And we haven't seen that. We've seen people really stick with and double down on investment in Atlassian's products. And so -- they may not have made the first step to cloud. They've made the first by data center. But I can tell you with every one of those customers I speak to [indiscernible] that future.
And it's really, okay, they're either a feature from us or they want a particular data residency or a particular compliance that we're already working on. Or they just got a project internally that they're trying to schedule when they want to get the migration done. And so I have a huge kind of excitement around what that [indiscernible] migrations. If we take down the market size and opportunity, [indiscernible] next week around that. But I'm super excited by what that shows, bottoms up of just the opportunity inside our customer base. And that is getting larger for [indiscernible]. One is that we've got new products that are coming to market, our point products are gaining real customer usage and sort of early in the revenue on the usage that they're growing pretty fast.
And we know that those new products can then be sold across our entire customer base. Two is [indiscernible] we are seeing across the industry. And in times like this, our customers are looking to deal with less vendors, and they are looking for a single system of work across their entire organization to make sure that work can move across every department. And so we are seeing competitive switch outs of us to consolidate on last year and so that is really explained. And lastly, with AI and what we can do there, there's a couple of things. One is, I firmly believe that more software is going to get built on the far side of this. And so the market for people who want to use our tools and products and so forth to broadly help build software is going to increase. And the ROI or the dollars you can charge for our customers over time is changing whether they used or some other business model, but we're now providing so much more value for our customers than we were before the AI revolution came over the last 1.5 years that our opportunities there are alive. So I can go on and on. I don't know if it's Mike or Joe want to add anything to that. Yes. The only thing I would add, Scott covered all of the basics. And obviously, we're incredibly bullish about AI. We got some exciting stuff coming up next week. We hope to see you all there at [ 1024]. The Atlassian platform is probably one of the areas that I always think is underestimated in terms of durable growth and in terms of long-term advantage. Again, Atlassian is a company that thinks very long term and very strategically and thoughtfully as we go through Equinox and Solstice and Equinox and Solstice and Equinox and Solstice the world goes around and around, and we try to think about that across more than just a singular quarter. In terms of engineering, you see we have significant R&D investments, right? that is a part of how we think about the world.
And in the cloud, a large amount of that goes into the Atlassian platform. Building out the platform to scale across our products is a unique, competitive advantage. It is increasingly resonant with customers as a differentiator and as a moat that allows them to choose multiple products allows them to adopt more quickly, get automation across those products, get analytics across those products and build out the teamwork graph that underpins a lot of our Atlassian intelligence and other future capabilities. That is a super unique advantage that comes only from our large R&D investments and our long-term thinking and our ability to, in a capital-efficient way, fund that build out over a many, many year period, and it will continue to be so over the future periods. Your next question comes from Kasthuri Rangan from Goldman Sachs. Yes. Toggling from one call to the other. My question is, it looks like given the continued strength in the data center product, this is going to be here to stay for quite a while. So I'm curious, when you look at the product road map ahead, how much of an emphasis is being placed on the development side on the cloud, particularly with respect to the functionality. And when are we going to start to see a divergence by design, by intention between the cloud and the surviving entity. And what new incentives are we going to see in the fiscal years ahead and also migrations, are we going to make those migrations easier going forward? Sure, Kash, I can take that. Look, I would say from our customers' point of view, it's well understood that the cloud is our future and our customers know that. As Scott mentioned earlier, 5 years ago, you had a lot of customers that said, I'm not going to the cloud. Now it is a when, not an if, right? I do not run into customers who say they will not go to the cloud. I run into customers who say, we can't go now because of this reason or that reason, either internal reasons or Atlassian related reasons. The divergence of features to some extent because of the nature of the cloud. So you need to look no further than Atlassian Intelligence. AI and LLM driven features with large-scale foundational models requiring teamwork graph in the Atlassian cloud platform is not something that we can bring to a data center customer, and they understand that. It's a completely logical reason. And hence, an extra reason or incentive for them to migrate.
Now we are building continually hybrid supporting features in things like our migration tooling and in other areas as those customers move parts of their workload to the cloud, if you think about it that way. And that is helpful to those customers over time. Beyond that, we do continue to invest in the capabilities of data center for those customers, right, in terms of security, in terms of their scale and compliance and in terms of features where we can take certain features, which makes sense to build in data center and in the cloud simultaneously. So I think the customers understand that. In terms of additional incentives for DC customers to move from a financial and other point of view. We continue to work with our customers and our partners as to the best way to do that.
Often, it's not financially driven, right? It can be as much about compliance and data residency and Fed ramp and enterprise scale and all the things that we are continuing to work on with those customers. Next question comes from Fatima Boolani from Citi. Scott, congratulations to you for absolutely legendary run. Just on the point of the carats or the incentives for your existing data center customers to move to the cloud. I wanted to ask you the question in a different way. You always make substantial progress in solving for data residency demands and other [indiscernible] security blockers for some of your most regulated and complex customers. So I'm curious what is left to address or alleviate from a ""cloud"" blockers standpoint? And what type of investment should we expect that will entail in the medium term? And the reason I ask this is because the expectation is that your data center migrations to cloud are going to accelerate, presumably most of those blockers have been renewed. So I would just love a little bit more color on that front. Sure, Fatima. I can take some part of that. Look, I think, at the highest level, it's a pretty big test maturity that 3/4 of our enterprise customers in regulated industries have a cloud footprint today. So you talked about our achievements and thank you for noticing that, by the way, that's very gratifying. We have been working incredibly hard on those areas, and it is resonating with customers, and that's an important place to start.
Second, I would say these customers, we call them our largest, the most complex customers. That is one of the things that just takes time for them to move. Like for a lot of these customers, a 3, 5-year road map they're running in these large complex IT organizations. That's not about I think you referred to them as cloud blockers. That is just about that company saying, yes, I get it. I have these projects going on. It's going to take me a year, 2 years, 3 years. I'm going to move this piece first, and this piece second. Some of that's the natural progression pace of those customers.
There are certainly things we can do, improving migration tooling and lots of other things that we are working on. Some part of the paces were in terms of the customers. And there's no doubt, we will continue to work on governance, as we mentioned, we're in process with [ FedRAMP ] Moderate and we continue to work on things like that for governmental customers. We have more data residency regions we'd love to roll to for sure. There is always more performance and scale that we can [ kick out ] for our largest customers. So there are a lot of things that we have to continue to work on. In the app and extensibility area, we continue to ship improvements every single quarter.
Now the other thing is building customer trust. We see our relationship with the customers, especially in the subscription environments like data center and cloud is about demonstrating continued trust over time. They are subscribing to get our future offerings. We can see that in the last 2 quarters, we've hit 100% of our cloud road map in R&D in terms of delivery. So when these customers are making a multiyear or even decade-long commitment to Atlassian as they want to say that we're going to deliver on the things that we tell them we're going to deliver on, which is certainly what we've done over the last period of time.
That said, having customer conversations, they acknowledge they are clear and they see that we are continuing to remove the, as you call them, cloud blockers over time. So that trust is going up when you talk to customers. They are seeing our progress just as you are. So I hope that's helpful. Your next question comes from Arjun Bhatia from William Blair. Perfect. Maybe one for Mike or Scott, I just wanted to touch on the AI landscape, but maybe more from the sense of what it means for the role of the developer, right? We're hearing a lot more about text to code capabilities and how that's automating a lot of the workflow for the developer role and you have companies popping up that are addressing these start-ups that are doing this more and more. But from your perspective, how do you see the role of the developer changing? And maybe what does it mean from an Atlassian perspective? What does it mean about how Jira might need to change or evolve to manage the agile process overall. Yes. Thanks, Matt. I can certainly take that one. Lots of thoughts here. Firstly, AI is awesome for software development in the broadest sense, right? Large language models, their ability to generate code, their ability to understand code, which is arguably more important is phenomenal for the world. It -- we take the position that the world has a supply constraint in the number of engineers, not a demand constraint in the amount of ideas we have for software that we would like to be built. What AI does is loosens that supply constraint. We're not going to hit demand ceiling. So people will be able to do more with the number of engineers that they have is the way we think of it.
That is good for us for a number of reasons. Firstly, most developer time is not spent on coating. It's spent on coordination activities. It's spent on how developers work with product managers and marketing teams and service teams, how they support and operate the software and services that they've built rather than just the sort of classical view of coding a piece of software and then delivering it. That is a collaboration activity. That is a difficult hard problem that we spent 20-plus years working on, and I suspect to spend most of the next 20 years continuing to work on. Secondly, AI, we believe, will generate far more software, far more services and apps and tools, and that is a great thing for us, especially for things like Compass, which are about managing developer experience, software sprawl.
Again, resonating extremely well with customers only a few months into GA, but obviously -- but already taking off on a pretty strong growth path and well ahead of our expectations. So Compass and AI is a great thing that have more software. And thirdly and lastly, the ability of AI to allow nondevelopers to ""right"" code in some sort of a form to more programmatic capabilities is quite fantastic. You can see this in Atlassian analytics, where the ability to use natural language to turn into SQL and then chart and dashboards, it's kind of a developer like activity but allows a democrat at analytics to get to your data to understand it.
I think there'll be many, many more things like that, that allow these AI capabilities to -- we used to think of as software development, maybe that's the way to say it. So Scott, I don't know if you have any follow-ons. Just to be like the first , which is just that I think for people that don't write software, I think it may be not well known how little time people actually spend hands on keyboard writing code. A lot of software is working at the requirements and what it looks like and how do we want to build things and where is data going to come from. And so you can make huge differences in how much time developer spends with hands on keyboard. But percentage-wise, it actually doesn't change their week that much because they spend a lot of their time in Jira, in Confluence in like talking to customers, gathering requirements and you look at our products touch our customers, that's a way larger percentage of a customer's week than developed of development leases and writing in an IDE.
And so. The opportunity for us to say same time for these hands-on keyboard software developers is immense because like [indiscernible] time there, it's a huge difference. And so I just want to about because it's not particularly well known if you're not a suffer developer. Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to Mike for closing remarks. Thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. As always, we appreciate your thoughtful questions and continued support. We're incredibly excited for TEAM '24, our flagship customer conference next week in Las Vegas. We've got some incredible speakers, fantastic customers and some, hopefully, mind-blowing announcements that we can't wait to share with you. We'll also be hosting our Investor Day at Team '24. I really hope to see you there. And with that, have a fantastic weekend.","this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay on the Investor Relations section of Atlassian's website following this call . this call will include forward-looking statements . the call will involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions . a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is available .",0.0

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay on the Investor Relations section of Atlassian's website following this call.
I will now hand the call over to Martin Lam, Atlassian's Head of Investor Relations. Welcome to Atlassian's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Call. Thank you for joining us today. On the call with me today, we have Atlassian's co-founders and co-CEOs, Mike Cannon-Brookes and Scott Farquhar, and Chief Financial Officer, Joe Binz.
Earlier today, we published a shareholder letter and press release with our financial results and commentary for our fourth quarter fiscal year 2024. The shareholder letter is available on Atlassian's work life log and the Investor Relation section of our website, where you also find other earnings-related materials, including the earnings press release and supplemental investor data sheet. As always, our shareholder letter contains management's insight and commentary for the quarter. So during the call today, we'll have a brief opening remarks and then focus our time on Q&A.
This call will include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions. If any such risks or uncertainties materials or if any of the assumptions prove incorrect, our results could differ materially from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements we make. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Forward-looking statements represent our management's beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise such statements should they change or cease to be current. Further information on these and other factors that could affect our business performance and financials is included in filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including the section titled Risk Factors in our most recently filed annual and quarterly reports.
During today's call, we will also discuss nonfinancial metrics. These non-GAAP financial metrics are in addition to and are not essential for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is available in our shareholder letter, earnings release and investor data sheet on the Investor Relations website.
We'd like to allow many of you participate in Q&A as possible. Out of respect for others on the call, we'll take one question at a time. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for opening remarks. Thank you all for joining us today. As you've already read in our shareholder letter, FY '24 was an incredible year for Atlassian, and we're proud of all we've accomplished in a challenging environment. We generated $4.4 billion in revenue, over $1.4 billion in free cash flow and surpassed 300,000 customer. We continued our steady drumbeat of innovation in FY '24, shipping Atlassian Intelligence, compass and virtual agents for Jira Service Management into general availability. We also welcomed Loom into the Atlassian family and introduced Rovo and announced an entirely new era for Jira.
We closed out our 3.5-year journey of winding down server and successfully migrated millions of users to cloud and data center. As we continue to partner deeper with our data center customers, they understand that cloud provides the ultimate Atlassian experience with the power of our unified platform and innovations such as analytics, automation and AI.
We've continued to deliver enterprise-grade platform capabilities to this cloud, unlocking data residency in 6 new regions, increasing the scalability for Jira to support up to 50,000 users on a single instance and achieved FedRAMP in process designation, a critical milestone in supporting the U.S. public sector, Atlassian Cloud. These and more are helping pave the way for some of our largest and most complex data center customers as they map out their journeys to cloud. We now have over 500 customers spending over $1 million annually. The progress we've made and the momentum we are seeing in the enterprise segment, reinforces our conviction in our strategy to build and deliver solutions that help solve our customer's toughest team collaboration challenges.
We have a massive serviceable addressable market opportunity across our 3 customer  including a $14 billion revenue opportunity just within our existing customer base alone. And we are more excited than ever to seize this opportunity and accelerate our path to surpass $10 billion in annual revenue.
Lastly, this is Scott's last earnings call. It is truly impossible to put into words the impact that Scott has had on me on the thousands of employees, hundreds of thousands of customers and at Atlassian as a concept and as a company,over the last 23 years. It's been an honor to the Atlassian side by side him over the last 2 decades, and I look forward to his many continued contributions to the company as a Board member and in his special adviser role. Thank you, Scott.
And with that, I will turn it over to him. Thanks, Mike. I look back on the last 23 years, we've met prior about what we've built in Atlassian. And we've always believed that only through teamwork can be achieved as seemingly impossible. It's one of the 2 decades building products that enable our customers to do just that. Our products powered teams at the forefront of innovation for companies leading the next stage of space exploration to those developing ground baking medical discoveries that are saving lives. And it feels like we're only just getting started.
Atlassian is incredibly well positioned to see the massive opportunities in front of us across our 3 markets and in enterprise AI and of course, delivering innovation across the entire product portfolio. I'm not bullish than ever about our strong position to grow and deliver parallel value to our customers.
Before I close out, I want to take a moment to thank every single lesion around the world, past and present. People say this pace wouldn't be Atlassian without Mike or I, but the truth is Atlassian wouldn't be what it is today without each and every one of you. You drive emission forward and your dedication on wavering to then pie and make me incredibly proud. I look forward to seeing Atlassian continue to pursue a mission of unlisting potential every team, albeit from a slightly different seat.
With that, I'll pass the call to the operator for Q&A. [Operator Instructions]  Your first question comes from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Congratulations on a really remarkable career. It's been a real pleasure working with you over the years. So coming out of a real building year in FY '24. The FY '25 guidance for total revenue of 16% is disappointing to investors. We see that in the aftermarket reaction. Do you guys remain confident in the longer term 20% plus growth over the next 3 years. Can you help us bridge that equation? Where do you guys garner the confidence for like the 20% plus growth longer term, what are the parts of the equation that are going to turn on, if you will, as we go into -- FY '27 that we're not seeing today that give you guys the confidence to make that statement with today's results? Thanks, Keith. This is Joe. I'll start, and then I'll pass it over to Mike for more color. Despite the macroeconomic uncertainty and the execution risks related to the evolution of our market motion, we believe FY '25 will set us up with a strong foundation to accelerate growth in FY '26 and beyond. And keep in mind, mechanically, there are a number of difficult prior year comparables in FY '25 with the end of Server Mats revenue and event-driven purchasing around the server end of support. Longer term, fundamental growth drivers for FY '26 and beyond are very consistent with what we shared at Investor Day back in May. So it starts with the opportunities we have in our 3 large markets, those being software, service management and work management. Those are collectively growing at a solid double-digit CAGR. We have a $67 billion addressable market opportunity with $14 billion of that in our existing enterprise customer base alone. And then from there, we can drive growth in several ways.
We believe migrations from data center, given the size of the installed base will continue to be a driver of cloud revenue growth in FY '25 and beyond. And we're investing and working hard to enable those customers to migrate to the cloud. In addition to migrations, we have paid seat expansion within existing customers as we move to enterprise and enable more wall-to-wall adoption, then our opportunity to cross-sell additional products like Jira Service Management, Jira Product Discovery, Compass, Loom and Rovo. Over 300,000 customers is another great opportunity.
We have the ability to upsell to premium enterprise addition to our products, which is another significant growth driver. And then there are other drivers in the model like pricing and new customer growth, which is not a significant or term, but is a longer-term growth driver.
And then lastly, with AI, I'd say we believe we have a unique and differentiated position with data graphs around high-value roads, and there's a lot of long-term opportunity in that space as well. So overall, we continue to expect to drive healthy revenue over the next 3 years in cloud. And from a data center perspective, that customer base is primarily composed of large customers with very high logo retention. So growth from the customers that remain on data center will be driven by pricing and seat expansion and cross-sell.
So overall risks and tough comparables to navigate in the short term, but big opportunity in fundamental customer demand are there long term, particularly in the enterprise customer segment, as you can see in the momentum and traction we're getting there. We cited we have over 500,000 customers spending more than $1 million with us, which is up 48% year-over-year. So we feel really good about that. And then I'd just say, overall, we remain confident as ever in our ability to deliver revenue growth in excess of 20% compounded annual growth rate over these few years. Mike? Look, I think Joe those answers that incredibly well, Keith. The -- look, if I take his nailed the math there, right, we are incredibly confident in our 20% figure we've given over the next years and continue to be so today as we were at the Investor Day for all the reasons that he stated and how the math plays out. I will say from a qualitative point of view, the more customers they spend time with, the more confidence I have in that number from -- on the non-math side, I suppose. Most of the large customers I speak to, in fact, all of the large customers I speak to, would tell you that cloud is a WAN not an for them. So that gap between the server migrations ending and the data center migration is picking up pace, that we have high confidence that will mature through in our engineering road map and in the deliveries we have in cloud and how that's resonating with the customers in the stories to tell.
Secondly, increasingly, AI analytics and their platform and mentioned by those large customers as reasons for moving as well as our cloud delivery. So our proven ability to deliver as we saw with FedRAMP process this quarter is resonating with those larger customers. As is the new products that Joe mentioned some of -- so in Loom, Tiraproduct Discovery, Rovo, -- we have the best slate of new products in the nascent phases that we've had with very high customers, and it's when you do qualitative checks with customers. All of those exist in the cloud and all of those are going to drive that migration journey.
Lastly, I have a huge confidence in our long-term ability to evolve and adapt as a business. We've shown that over more than 2 decades. We're in one of those adoption places at the moment as we deal with the enterprise transition, I think, jointly. And that evolution capability that lasts will continue as we help those largest customers to go increasingly wall-to-wall across their enterprises. So huge bullishness for me that we'll hit those numbers that we've given out. Your next question comes from Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo. Objectively, 30-plus percent subscription revenue growth, 30-plus percent free cash flow margin, not something we're seeing a lot of across software. But in the spirit of the question is, Joe, you guided proud to 32% for Q4. The reported number came at 31%. So just hoping you could provide some context around what drove the delta in Q4? And maybe just help us frame the approach to cloud guidance for fiscal '25, if there's anything additional you're taking into account, obviously, a lot of moving pieces and factors to consider. So any compare and contrast with the approach to guidance here versus prior periods is helpful. Yes, awesome for the question. You're right, revenue was up 31% year-over-year in the cloud in Q4 that was slightly below our guided range of 32%. The variance to our there was driven by 2 factors: One is the timing of high-touch enterprise deals, which landed later than expend in the quarter and slightly lower-than-expected revenue from data center migrations. So I'll take each one of those and dive in. From a deal flip perspective, deals closed and billings landed in the quarter just later than we expected, and that impacted revenue recognition. There were a couple of factors that drove that. The first is what I'd characterize as the evolution of our high-touch go-to-market motions. We are driving larger, more complex deals that include more products and require more approvals. And in some cases, we're targeting large complex migrations and all that adds up to longer sales cycles than we anticipated.
Second, we always take a very disciplined and long-term oriented approach as we think through pricing and concessions on these deals. So we're not deadline driven. We don't do anything unusual or natural deal economics to close a deal at a certain time. And we're willing to be patient and wait for the right deal for both the customer and for us, and that's what we did this quarter.
In terms of the migration miss, overall migrations to cloud were slightly lower on an absolute basis in Q4 versus Q3, and you'd expect that following a catalyst like server and to support with migrations from data center slightly lower than our expectations, as you highlighted. The driver there is the complexity of these migrations. Data center customers are our largest customers with the most complex environments to migrate. Very different from the 1- to 2-day migrations that we can do with our smaller customers. Further, many of these customers when they do migrate, do so taking a hybrid approach over time. And then lastly, many of these data center customers recently migrated from servers. So there's going to be variability in the pace of these data center migrations quarter-to-quarter. And overall, our customers are clear that their ultimate destinations in the cloud, as Mike talked about, it's the best secure experience, and it's where all of our R&D and product innovation is pointed, so they can see the value we're delivering there and have a plan to get there. So it's just a question of what the timing looks like over the next several years.
The last part of your question was on the approach to guidance in FY '25. And what I'd say here is we have taken a different approach to our guidance this year and that we have taken a more conservative and risk-adjusted view of our revenue outlook entering the year than we did a year ago. We believe this is prudent given 2 factors. First is the uncertainty we see in the macroeconomic environment; and second is execution risks related to the evolution and transformation of our enterprise go-to-market motion. And so -- our guidance balances the trends we've seen over the last year with the uncertainty that is out there, whether it's macro related, or changes we're making inside the company. And it incorporates the assumption that macro gets worse as us risks are realized to form a more risk-adjusted and prudent view entering the year than we did a year ago. So hopefully, that color helps in terms of what we're thinking about from a guidance perspective. The next question comes from Ryan MacWilliams from Barclays. Maybe for Mike, I want to hear your thoughts on what's next for your go-to-market organization like alongside a new head of sales. Does it make sense to go out and also hire more seasoned enterprise sales reps into Atlassian? And how is the sales team so far transitioned from the migration opportunity into selling into more enterprises or selling new Atlassian products at this point? Yes. Ryan, I can certainly talk to that. It's a great question. Maybe let me start from the high level. I think I would categorize this as another evolution in Atlassian go-to motions overall. You've seen us do this before many times, and Atlassian is a pretty tough history of adapting to the environment, adapting to technological advancements like AI, but also changing the way we service support and make successful our customers. Our current go-to-market motion engine is obviously highly successful, right? We have a highly effective flywheel that serves the SMB and our enterprise customers as well, resulting in best-in-class efficiency and the financial profile that you're all aware of. And has given us a huge volume of customers and an enviable margin and cash flow profile.
We have made a series of evolutions in go-to-market, I would say, over that 20-year period. When we introduced data center, we added enterprise advocates. And obviously, we've shown a history of building a significant business in the data center world. When we added cloud, we learned to sell and migrate and support customers in the cloud and built a very significant cloud business over time. You've seen us do that. And then more recently, as we added additions in premium and enterprise additions in the cloud. We've added the muscles to be able to upsell customers and explain the success of their moving. And we have proof points of that in a strong adoption of premium and enterprise. So a series of evolutions we've had over time gives us confidence that we can continue to evolve and adapt as we have done.
As we've talked about the more than $4 million revenue opportunity in our existing base. We spent a lot of time evolving R&D over the last 3 or 4 years to better serve the enterprises in the cloud, and we've got great proof points of delivery there. And now we're continuing to evolve our go-to-market motion to sell, support and service those largest enterprises. As we said, we've got more than 500 customers that are spending north of $1 million, and that's -- we think we can continue to grow that portion of the customer base strongly and that evolution and that desire to keep changing and adapting and improving is one of the things that keep Atlassian at a seen a very special place to work. I do think it's worth saying at the highest levels, too. It's important that what you can expect not to change in that evolution.
First, I would say there is our discipline as a company. We've always prided ourselves on making economical decisions, understanding the deal economics in the enterprise as we do now better than ever before and being continually capital efficient as we grow that, as you've seen us do. Secondly, the long-term focus doesn't change. Part of this evolution is looking forward multiple years and seeing how that enterprise part of our business is going to continue to grow and evolve and how we serve those largest of the of the Fortune 5000 with incredibly complex needs and our opportunity to do so and to help them out in their businesses.
Lastly is maintaining a flywheel of our primary land motion for all customers, right? From the SMB customers in the Fortune 500,000 to the enterprise customers in that Fortune 500 and Fortune 5000. 2.5 of the enterprise focus is additive for our SMB growth motions are incredibly important and efficient number will remain so for the business as we keep evolving.
Now to the second part of your question, look, we will -- we continue to focus on the talent levels experience we have as well as growing talent within our business. There are a lot of areas that we continue to grow as we strengthen our go-to-market muscles to focus on the needs of our largest enterprise customers. We have a proven ability to manage multiple go-to-market machines, I would say, and thread them together carefully, and I'm sure we'll continue to improve and grow that. But really excited about this evolution pricing. Your next question comes from Arjun Bhatia from William Blair. If we can touch on the FedRAMP, the opportunity. It sounds like you're making progress there. I'm curious how long it might take before you can unlock some more federal deals in cloud? I assume you have a lot of existing federal customers on D.C. Are those customers that you can start to migrate over to cloud? Or is there still a little bit of a process to play out before the buying cycle occurs here in calendar Q3? In, I can certainly take that. Look, there's no doubt we have a huge volume of very large government customers in data center. And I would also say we have a large number of customers who service government entities who are also in data center who may not necessarily be government entities themselves. But obviously, in light of working with the government need FedRAMP or are easier for them to do businesses if they have FedRAMP capabilities. So it's not just about the government, the businesses around the government as well, which is a very large segment, as I'm sure you're aware.
We have continue to work with a lot of those customers as we've developed our FedRAMP capability to keep them on the journey and aware of where we're at. And I will say our cloud room at delivery is a really important point there. The last couple of quarters, we've hit 100% of items on our road map at or before the time and this resonates with customers. So you can look just as they can at our future cloud road map that is online to talk to compliance, to scale, to performance and to all the other things that we're building into that road map.
We have a series of customer examples who have stated as they've moved to hybrid ELA. I can give a very large global aerospace and defense company. It's a sort of 20-year customer of Atlassian. They signed a hybrid ELA quarter for the next couple of years and stated that FedRAMP and the inroads we've made in cloud security on the road map are call out reasons as to why they signed such a deal and move forward. So that gives us great confidence as we move to the in-process designation of FedRAMP, but also IPR and all the other compliance is that we've shipped as well as data residency and gives great confidence that we can move there. And obviously, be way okay as well, bring your own key encryption capabilities for this customer segment.
So that for data center customers migrating. There is a multiyear journey for a lot of these very large customers. Again, the reason that, that company so hybrid ELA is to enable them to start moving some workflows and loads to the cloud as the workflows and loads they have on-premise will continue there. And they'll move into a hybrid state for probably a multiyear period before being entirely in cloud. And we need to do that lets them test and learn about cloud. It will and see the strength of cloud, and they will move that over time.
I think that's a pattern we'll see with a lot of these larger start center customers that can have 10 hundreds, sometimes even thousands of Grand Confluent service running across their enterprise. This is a huge ability. This latent demand for Atlassian products and latent demand for cloud to kind of think about it that way, is a big strength of Atlassian, over the next few years. And I'm confident in our ability to unlock that and Sedran will be a huge unlock for government and government adjacent customers. Your next question comes from DJ Hynes from Canaccord. This is Luke on for DJ. So I was hoping to get some insight into the response you've received from customers since you folded JW into Jira. Just anything you've heard from both technical and non-technical teams regarding that change? And whether it's been a positive from a marketing and messaging standpoint in terms of driving interest across those 2 audiences? Luke, certainly, great question. I can say categorically, it's been a positive from customers' point of view. That one is a very, very easy answer. The system of work that Atlassian has continued to communicate and being sharper on over the last few quarters is very resonant with customers. The reason is a lot of our customers are incredibly technology-driven companies. They realize that technology is there. Core competitive advantage going forward in their business, whether they're building cars or rockets or fantastic or health care advancements or whether they're building databases, right, whether a technical or a nontechnical company, they realize the technology is their core fundamental advantage. And in doing so, they realize that getting their technology teams to work closely to their business teams and to exchange data back and forth and to be able to work in a comment tools and content patents is incredibly important for them to win in that technology-driven era.
That's one of the reasons why, although Jira Work Management was doing incredibly well as a product, and we were very bullish on it. We took the decision to merge the 2 into a single Jira to allow technology and nontechnology teams to work together. That has been incredibly well received by customers. It allows them to achieve those goals that they have, right? We have a series of stories where it also leads to 2 factors for Atlassian. Firstly, it allows the customer to consolidate on Atlassian of other work management tools because they have a singular cloud platform. And in the era where consolidation is incredibly important, that timing works very well for us and for them. We can talk to a company like Rivian that took 5 different work management tools and consolidate on the Atlassian Cloud due to the combination of Jira Work Management and Jira Software, save them over $2.5 million annually and expanded their use cases for Jira and to many other business teams.
And secondly, for Atlassian, it allows us to expand our seat count because the technology teams within an organization or a relatively small proportion, depending on the organization be from 5% to 25% or 30% organization. The other 95% to 70% of the organization is business teams that still have workflows and project capabilities they need. And Ravin is a good example where we've seen that where we've got both consolidation and seed expansion for Atlassian due to the system of work, and the platform that underlies all of our products. So incredibly good customer reception from this move. And as we continue to do Atlassian over the long term, it's about listening to customers and understanding what they need and trying to deliver that in our product portfolio, in our R&D and also in our go-to-market motions and how we explain to customers what it is that we do and help them with. Your next question comes from Fatima Boolani from Citi. Joe, this question is for you. Earlier, you were very explicit in the variant assumptions you are taking into consideration for the book of business for fiscal '25 and you need a specific reference to execution risks due to some of the enterprise go-to-market motion changes that you're making. I was hoping we could go a couple of layers deeper into what specific variables or assumptions you're considering or flexing to kind of arrive at that conclusion? And relatedly, changes in the sales organization and kind of the departure of Kevin, how is that flowing dose stream and the way you're thinking about just productivity and quota attainment and things like that. I'd really appreciate some more granularity. Yes. Thanks for the question. I'll keep it at a fairly high level in terms of the execution risk we see in that transformation or evolution of our go-to-market enterprise sales motion. As you pointed out, there is leadership transition there. And so that's always something you want to keep in the back of your mind as you think about forecasting over the next year. And then I would just say it's a nascent capability that we continue to build and develop over time. And we like highlighted the fact that we've been investing in the space. We have a foundation. But as we continue to make more and more progress, we're going to continue to evolve and build that. And whenever you're doing that, that involves risk in our execution against that level of change.
So from a high level, those are the 2 big factors, and I'll let Mike fill in fill in the details on Yes. Look, Fatima, great question. I want to -- I guess I want to start from my point of view, but nothing with gratitude and thanks for Kevin and the role he's played right. He's been an incredibly dedicated leader of our sales function for a number of years, has built an incredibly strong sales leadership team and has set up the foundation for us to make this continued transformation and evolution. So just have to call them out with great thanks from myself and from Scott in that context.
As I said, we are searching for a transformational CRO, we can continue to drive the next phase at ever-increasing scale. That search is well underway. And in the short term, look, I personally led and built the go-to-market engine we have today for our first 10 years, I guess, and continue to be incredibly heavily involved there and with the customers. Also, we have an incredibly strong executive team. I would argue the strongest we've ever had across the business. So incredibly confident we can lead the business strongly through that evolution. I think Joe has spoken well to the prudence of our guidance in light of this transformation, but more in light of the other things he mentioned the other factors that go into that there. And I think you've seen from us prudence and careful thought as well as hopefully openness and explanation about what it is that we are going through as we focus on the long term.
And lastly, I would reiterate our deep belief and confidence in the vent multiyear revenue CAGR that we've given out at Investor Day, and we would maintain those targets, both on the revenue side and on the return to historical operating margin side. Your next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies. Joe, as you know, the central question investors are asked is the cloud guide and ultimately, are you putting a little more conservatism into this forecast to give yourself more wiggle room. It's been -- I know it's been a challenging thing to forecast, given a lot of different factors. But has your approach changed here? Is anything change in the assumptions to give investors more confidence that they can really believe in that number.
The second one was just a follow-up on 2 months ago, you guided 20% top line, your guidance [ 16 ] Should we think differently now about the long-term growth? Or is this more of a tactical pit stop and you still believe in '20 over a period of time? Yes, Brent, thanks for the question. In terms of the revenue guidance, I'll just reiterate what I said earlier in terms of our approach, being a different approach to our guidance this year. It is a more conservative and risk-adjusted approach. And the reason and the drivers for that are the risks and uncertainties that we talked about. One is we see uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment. And second, the question earlier, we do see execution risk related to the evolution and transformation that we're undergoing on the go-to-market side. So we've taken all that into account. And the net result of that is we have a more risk-adjusted and prudent view this year going into the year than we did last year. So we have a -- 3-year 20% plus compounded annual growth rate on revenue. We talked earlier about the drivers of that. Nothing has changed in the last 3 months since Investor Day when we made that. We continue to reiterate our confidence around that, and we talked earlier on the call about the drivers behind that. Your next question comes from Alex Zukin from Wolf Research. I think maybe it would be helpful to just unpack kind of similar to how you at least commented in the letter on the margin side around the headwinds that investors should -- or the tailwinds that investors should recall that were onetime in nature on operating margins in fiscal '24, such that ex that the fiscal '25 margin guide is actually flat? Similar to that framing, if it's possible just to understand. If you look at the guide that you gave for 16% total revenue growth, but that's in light of these onetime tailwinds of end of server conversion because I think if I adjust for that, the guide is actually closer to '19. So just help us frame that because that's obviously not going to recur. And presumably, it appears from your commentary that the guide is more incorporating timing of certain deals closing on the enterprise side, maybe migrations on the enterprise side, that's informing the conservatism. But just maybe help better understand that a little bit. Yes, Alex, this is Joe. I'll take a shot at that. I think first of all, you started from an operating margin perspective and what are the factors there that are driving the lower year-over-year operating margin. As you point out, we expect our non-GAAP operating margin to be 21.5%, approximately in FY '25. That's about 200 basis points lower than FY '24. Keep in mind, as you pointed out, our FY '24 non-GAAP operating margin benefited from the significant outperformance in data center and marketplace revenue related to server and to support in H2. That impact was about 200 basis points. And so when you normalize for that impact, our FY '25 operating margins will be roughly flat year-over-year.
In terms of the cloud revenue deceleration and the comps there, we do believe cloud revenue growth will decelerate in FY '25. And the primary driver is we expect less contributions from server migrations now that we're past server and to support. And while data center migrations will increase, they won't make up for the -- migrations. Given the migration path for many of those customers, as we've talked about earlier, will play out over a multiyear period. with many evolving hybrid deployments. We've also incorporated, as you pointed out, prudent assumptions to account for the impact of worsening macroeconomic environments and execution risks in our enterprise go-to-market motions. So those are some of the factors that are driving that year-over-year in cloud revenue.
Now having said that we pointed out in the call, we remain optimistic long term and expect cloud revenue growth to accelerate in FY '26 as we lap the drag from server and to support and drive improving seat expansion, cross-sell of additional products and upsell to premium enterprise additions of our products that we talked about earlier. Your next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho. I had a follow-up on a couple of the go-to-market questions from earlier. Mike, you're looking, as you said, for a new CRO with expertise and leading enterprise sales transformation. But how do you define an enterprise sales transformation? And more specifically, how much do you foresee your go-to-market changing Atlassian, both in fiscal '25 as well as over the longer term? Gregg, how much is an interesting question. Look, I would say that we are -- continue to be a very long-term thinking company. And what I'd say that, I mean, at Investor Day, we talked about our R&D spend as a percentage of revenue moderating when we gave our long-term targets and our sales and marketing spend increasing from roughly that sort of 15%, 16% range, moving north of that. So you can see implied in that, that there'll be increasing spending, but I would argue in a cautious and careful way. And we're very good at the capital efficiency, the calculation of where the ROI on that spend is. And it's a relatively moderate increase in spending, especially when you compare it to our comps in the market and other companies, right?
We'll still be -- after that transition comparatively efficient on sales and marketing to most other software companies and still comparatively high spending on R&D because we believe that's where our fundamental advantages are. So Think about this as an evolutionary and adjustment in that manner. Now the transformation is about how we continue to take those 500 customers spending more than $1 million. And the huge lighten demand we have in data center and increasingly build deep partnerships with some of our largest customers in how we are helping them transform their businesses. This is a part of our evolution, right?
I've talked about when 15, 17 years ago, when we started the data center business, we were talking about moving $5,000 customers to be $50,000 customers. And now we're along that nowadays, but this is something that we are familiar with the history of the evolution that we've had. And I think it's a very smart example of how Atlassian continues to evolve through the years in ways that benefit our customers. In this case, we're looking at our largest customers that are -- when you speak to them, they're betting incredibly hard on Atlassian. They think that we are transforming the way that their company works. They want to roll out to ever-increasing numbers of scale, and they want to understand the philosophies of how we were there and build a partnership across our portfolio of products. That's what we mean by that enterprise transformation and how we sell support and ultimately make successful those largest customers.
Lastly, I will point out that we believe this is additive to our model, not a swap or a switch. We have a great capital-efficient flywheel in the product-led growth motion that we have at ending large numbers of SMB customers, but also landing in those enterprise customers, which is what makes the enterprise motion more efficient for us than other companies. So they work together in Your next question comes from Kash Rangan from Goldman Sachs. So Mike, a question for you with these transitions can be very hard, certainly in the goal is to come out more successful as a company. And clearly, you're on the way. As you've come out of the transition, what are the lessons learned? And how can there be further tweaks to the product strategy, go-to-market. I guess we all learned from the most difficult challenging times and we've come out mostly ahead. So what are the things that you have learned that you're going to adopt to the strategy company going forward? And also, from a bandwidth perspective, you're in an enviable position. You're now twice the CEO that you were before with Scott, of course, he's on the Board now, and then you're looking for a CRO. I mean there are some big shoes to fill. How -- and you talked about Joe very little quant talked about the what, how the different levers that exist in place to get the company to potentially accelerate. And one of the very first questions I had. But I'm more curious about the how you get there? What are the things that are being done internally differently is I know it's the long rambling complicated question, but I just wanted to hear you out a little bit more in depth as you start through all this stuff. Sure, Kash. I'm guessing I'm going to take that one. Look, I'd say a few things. Firstly I think I would start with saying we have an incredibly strong executive team. So a lot of the implication of your question is this all going to fall on my shoulders. And there's no doubt ultimately accountable does, I'm very comfortable with that. But at a high level, look, we have a great executive team. We have a great sales leadership team at the moment, and we are well familiar with this evolution and transformation motion and having it play out over the quarters and the years. This is not something that starts on July 1 of this quarter. This is something that's been going for a while. As you can see, we have more than 500 customers north of $1 million. This is not an entirely new motion for us, right? This is an evolution. There's nothing broken here, right? We're just continuing to improve and grow and stretch as we have done for a long time. The mix shift of being more and more additive in the enterprise, as we said, have come on the back of a huge amount of R&D investment into everything from data residency and BYOK to scale in the cloud to FedRAMP. And now we believe we have the opportunity to increase our footprint in that enterprise customer base in all of our customer markets, I would say, from software teams. And in ITSM, you've seen how strong the Jira Service Management business is at the moment and through work management and collaboration as the system work rolls out and we get a hard footprint.
So I think we feel the opportunity is there, and we're going to go after that. I think when you talk about what lessons have we learned look, -- we continue to see great sales execution as we go through. 1024 was a huge event for us in terms of a lot of things, product launches, but also in terms of pipeline builds, it was our largest enterprise event that we've ever held and confidence that comes from those customers often informs us in making these DC solutions and movements.
I would say that our strength as a company has always been our ability to learn and evolve. I'm less worried about personal workload and personal  then looking at the team of 10-odd people we have on the executive team, I guess, you'd say, and through the 1,000 leaders we have through the business and the 12,000 or more Atlassian staff and our ability as a collective to go after this mission. I feel incredibly confident that we can get to that and do that, and that's what we intend to go to. Your next question comes from Nick Altmann from Scotiabank. This is John Gomes on for Nick Altmann. You guys outlined some interesting examples at the Analyst Day in terms of the product adjacencies with Loom and the core. So now that Loom has been part of a lag for a couple of quarters now. Can you give us a better sense of cross-selling traction there. And as it pertains to FY '25, do you have any goal posts for how we should be thinking about the Loom contribution? Yes. Thanks for the question. I'll take part of that, and then Mike will follow on. You asked about the impact that Loom will have within our overall revenue and operating margin guidance for FY '25, we expect Loom to have about 1.5 to 2 points of impact on FY '25 cloud revenue growth for the year. And consistent with our prior expectations, we expect Loom to be slightly dilutive to FY [ '25 ] operating margins. And I'll turn it over to Mike on the cross-sell. I would say a few things on loan. Firstly, what an incredible product, right? The customer reception I would start there is fantastic. It is saving our customers a lot of time and meetings, and it's just a fantastic way to communicate, if any, you haven't tried it, I would encourage you to do so. We truly believe it can be transformational to the way that organizations work, the way that they work through video in an asynchronous manner and an increasingly distributed workplace that we live in. So our bullishness of the product and the product sector is still increasingly -- is still very high. .
Secondly, as a product, it continues to sell very strongly independently of Atlassian. And that's always the first step. I would say we've had a small amount of top spend to the business in terms of how it actually sells and Lumi continues to sell and drive a change in land in and of itself as our ability to and video, just as you would add a document rings true both with customers and also in the delivery part.
We are continuing to integrate lean into our business practices as we do, so into the Atlassian Cloud platform into a broader sales and marketing execution machine, that integration does take some time. We get better at it with each vision, but there's sort of a 2-stream effect there. One is the product continuing independently to sell strongly by itself. And secondly is the integration into our broader platform and the role it plays in the system of work.
Maybe lastly, I would say that the team -- the lean team that's joined us and the additional aluminates we've added to that continue to deliver a very strong product road map. If you look at the recent launches in Loom around integrations with Duran Confluence, but also in Loom -- continuing to work on you can just since added video. I think the product delivery there is going to continue to be important as we build the momentum in the Wind business. Your next question comes from Keith Bachman from BMO. Joe, I wanted to direct this to you. I appreciate your comments on being a bit more conservative on the outlook. And I wanted to tie that to some of the conversations we had in Vegas. And particularly, as we think about the outlook for the year, in cloud and data center. Just how are you thinking about 2 variables that would contribute amongst others, but in particular, as it relates to seats and pricing. How are you thinking about what the contribution from those in order to realize the targets that you've laid out for the year? Yes. Thanks for the question, Keith. From a paid perspective, our expansion rates in Q4 were consistent to Q3. That's an encouraging sign. But one data point is not a trend to make. And so we are assuming that we'll see continued pressure in paid seat expansion in FY '25. And that speaks to the risk-adjusted approach we took around macroeconomic. In terms of pricing, we continue to expect to have pricing increases throughout the year. That will be a driver of cloud revenue growth that has been in FY '24 and prior. And so you should expect to see a similar impact in FY '25 going forward. Thank you. That's all the questions we have time for today. I will now turn the call over to Mike for closing remarks. Thanks, everyone, for joining the call today. Appreciate all of your thoughtful questions and continued support. I guess I just want to add a small note on a personal level at the end here. It is Scott's last earnings call, and you've all spread in some questions today, which I'm sure is very tail for. One of -- when Scott sits down with graduates when they joined Atlassian with any new staff members, one of the things he said for more than 2 decades now, is it the one thing you want to leave them with is that they should leave Atlassian a better place than they found it. They should not treat it as a finished object, but rather a continued construction project that gets better and better. And that if they leave the company better than they founded, and that's the only thing they walk away with that we will all benefit. And I said that because I think if there's one person who's left at that's better than he founded it is Scott. And on behalf of the leadership team of the 12,000 current Atlassian and the 20-odd thus know how many Atlassians there are past and present add together. We all owe a huge set of gratitude and thanks for leaving Atlassian better than he found it is an underestimation for just a magical place to work and a fantastic and different company. And for me, personally, in from everybody else. I thank you, Scott for everything you've done to contribute to the business we have today and the place we are lucky enough to get to work a day and for a long time to come. So thank you very much for me. We'd love to do a lot to wish you the best in all future endeavors. With that, have a great day, everyone, and have a kickass weekend.","this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay on the Investor Relations section of Atlassian's website following this call . today, we'll have a brief opening remarks and then focus our time on Q&A . forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions .",0.0
