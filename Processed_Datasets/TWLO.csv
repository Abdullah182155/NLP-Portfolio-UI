My name is Mike, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions].
I will now turn the call over to Greg Kleiner, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Mr. Kleiner, you may begin. Thank you. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Twilio's first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Jeff Lawson, Co-Founder and CEO; George Hu, COO and Lee Kirkpatrick, CFO.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff. Thank you, Greg. Welcome everybody to this quarter’s call. We were pleased by the broad based strength across a number of areas in Q1, highlighted by strong expansion within existing customers and first time deals with new customers. The investments we are marketing in both the product and go-to-market funds continue to pay dividends with Twilio’s around the globe driving this execution against our strategic plan.
Total revenue came in north of $129 million, up 48% year-over-year and now at an annualized run rate for our business of over $0.5 billion, an exciting milestone for us. And the base revenue, the core metric we focus on grew by 46% year-over-year to $117.5 million.
The continued value and innovation we are providing for our customers, new and old, is helping to drive their success, which in turn drives our financial results. This success is best exemplified by our $1 base net expansion rate, which came in at 132% this quarter. All-in-all I’m proud of what the team here accomplished, a great start to the year. But we have much more do as we peruse our goal of fueling the future of communications.
On the last call I shared our top two company priorities for 2018, continuing our evolution into a strategic software platform for customer engagement, while expanding our position and the developer’s first choice for communications. We made further progress on both fronts in the last quarter, so let me spend a moment talking though some of the highlights.
The big announcement from Q1 in the engagement cloud was our unavailing of Twilio Flex, the first cloud contact center application platform that’s programmable at ever layer of the stack. We announced Flex at the Enterprise Connect Conference in March, the contact centers major industry event and based on the reaction from customers and industry analysts, it seemed to be the highlight of the show.
So why go deeper in the context center? Because we hear from our customers and prospects over and over that they feel trapped by their legacy solutions, especially large enterprises. These companies have traditionally required tremendous flexibility to customize contact center solutions to meet their unique needs with thousands of agents, the benefits of deep customization getting multiplied across millions of conversations annually.
The on-prem solutions of yesteryear allow this level of customization, but with great pain, requiring armies of professional services people, all verst in Accessory Technologies to compete the tasks, and then these bespoke solutions become fragile, difficult to maintain and these are harder to upgrade to modern capabilities.
To-date cloud offerings haven’t had the same level of flexibility, and that’s why large enterprise contract centers, largest bill set in our cash [ph] on-prem solutions. The contact center was once thought of as a relatively static asset; build and deploy a contact center and it will live for a decade or more. Who can blame them, the phone call was the only way people communicated with businesses for nearly 15 years, but now it’s moving much faster adding email and chat and SMS and mobile and social media and now even IoT connected use cases, the highly bespoke legacy solutions of old just can’t adapt.
In a recent study 40% of contact center managers said that their contact center systems don’t meet their current needs and 80% say it won’t meet future needs and that survey was done two years ago, so that future is now.
We are unique in approaching the context center from the view point of a platform. In fact, prior to the launch of Flex, Twilio has already been recognized as a leading contact center provider. We took the learning’s that we have acquired over the years from our large customers to take our products even further. Twilio Flex is the first application platform built to address the needs of the modern context center and scale. By delivering a platform, we bring the reliability, supportability and global scale of the cloud with the complete flexibly that customers previously got by running the application on-prem.
Because Twilio Flex is built on our existing super network and programmable communications cloud, it’s very robust, out of the gate. For example, we support the full list of channels supported by our programmable communications cloud. Of course there is voice and SMS and chat and video, but also merging channels like Facebook Messenger, RCS, Line and Alexa just work.
TaskRouter provides a sophisticated skill based routing agent, the beating heart of a contact center. Studio, our drag and drop visual application builder enables a broad set of builders within the enterprise, to build, edit, maintain things like Bot, IVR, [inaudible] and more. The developers don’t have to do all the work anymore.
Our newest part is the Programmable Flex user interface, which allows developers to build fully customizable agent and supervisor desktops and our partner market place where partner plug-ins deliver speed and flexibility to incorporate new functions, applications, data sources and more.
So what does this mean for our customers? They get virtually unlimited customization at every layer; no more Swivel Chair contact centers where there is multiple desktops that every agent has to move between to get anything done, because those systems can’t be integrated.
Built with Twilio APIs Flex can be integrated with almost anything. Customers get an instant omni-channle solution. Any channel companies what to use in order to communicate with their customers, either through our platform or through their own channels, they can do.
Customers get contextual intelligence, combining the machine learning, voice recognition and intent extraction to our platform where our customer’s data sense allows them to use AI to train models and use that learning to drive smarter interactions over time.
Customers get trusted scale because Flex sales up to 50,000 named users per instillation, a level that we believe most cloud solutions cannot handle. Customers get the support of the world’s developers too, with more than 2 million developer accounts in our platform and many millions more with the standard application development skills in the market as a whole. There is an instant critical mass of talent able to implement customer ideas. You don’t need esoteric proprietary training and skills; this is just web development and customers also get a robust partnered ecosystem.
Beyond access to our market place and pre-integrated solutions extending the value of Flex, we already have several system integrators in place, from regional players to global partners. With the launch of Flex, we will expand our efforts to start migrating the largest context centers in the planet who want to move the cloud, but couldn’t do it before. A good example of this is Liberty Mutual; we highlighted as our launch customer for Flex at Enterprise Connect.
Liberty Mutual approached us, because they wanted to begin migrating their contact center to the cloud. There was no solution they saw that provided them the flexibility they wanted with a modern architecture. So they started to build their own using Twilio’s platform.
We showed them Flex and they said, ‘we are in.’ Flex enables Liberty Mutual to launch a fully customized cloud contact center to all of their agents faster than they could have done before with the Liberty Mutual CIO noting that Twilio Flex allows us to move to a more programmable act model that provides full omni-channle capabilities.
It’s also important to note that Flex was built with our solution partners in mind. All along their journey in the contact center, some prospects have found that a SaaS application is the right solution for them and we are happy to get the customer on the right partner solution when that happens.
We are helping to bring customers and product to these partners. The components of Flex can be embedded by our partners and their solutions, to extend the value of their applications. The goal here is to up-level the whole playing field, as we work with our partners to attack this large market opportunity and help our customers move their engagement capabilities into the modern era.
For now Flex is in a pilot program where we are providing a select few customers with early access to the fully scope of functionality. The target market for Flex is very large contact centers, think 1000 seats in all. Most of the components are mature parts of Twilio’s product stack and now we are working to bring the newest components, especially the programmable desktop to parody for a boarder launch.
I’m seeing a familiar trend play out as we introduce Flex. Then there has been a certain magic to Twilio. When we show a developer for the first time that they can make a phone ring with a few lines of code, they start thinking of all the things they can now build. With the launch of Flex and the conversations we’ve been having with context center leaders, contact center developers, partners and end users, we are sensing that the same magical feeling. They are finally able to realize ideas they’ve had for years, but that were too costly, too time consuming or flat out not possible with legacy solutions.
We believe the migration of the context center market from legacy vendors to the cloud is just getting started. Industry experts estimate that the cloud has only penetrated 10% to 15% of the contact center market. So we have tremendous opportunity ahead of us for further traction in this market and we can’t wait to see what our customers build.
In terms of our second priority for the year, expanding our position as developers’ first choice for communications, we had several important announcements in recent months. Our job as a platform provider is to enable communications and customer engagement for our customers, regardless of the channel. One trend we pointed out many times is that communications is becoming increasingly heterogeneous. New apps and devices are gaining popularity, the capabilities of those consumer platforms are in context flex and consumer preferences are chaining rapidly.
Most companies have barely begun to leverage traditional channels like SMS and this growing complexity makes addressing these chaining preferences even more daunting. Our product aims to make this landscape accessible to developers and companies with a single API, much like we made the global carrier network easily accessible. We made more progress last quarter on that mission.
We were excited to part of Google’s broader rollout of Rich Communications Service, RCS recently at Mobile World Congress. RCS Business Messaging enables businesses to build more engaging, rich messaging experiences, while leveraging the reach of SMS. For example companies can utilize RCS to send branded messages, share rich context like boarding passes, include carousals for scrolling through product images, suggest replies and actions and gain insight into how messages are performing with accurate reader receipts and click through data.
With Twilio developers can use one EPI to deliver the best messing experience for each end users. This is a central point for many of our customers, including 1-800-Flowers who is able to quickly extend their use of our messaging products to include RCS support. They now use RCS to enhance their customer experience by allowing customers to modify orders, track shipments and place additional orders all within the message.
By using our platform, all with the same AKI we could help customers like 1-800-Flowers determine which customers are capable of receiving messages in the appropriate format to maximize the experience for each of their customers.
More recently we also expanded our channel capabilities even further by announcing support for LINE as well. We will continue to build support for these channels as they emerge to help our customers navigate through the chaos and deliver the best customer experience possible.
We also announced that our programmable wireless product has moved into general availability. Once again, we are cracking open a market that has historically been largely inaccessible to developers, wireless networks and we made it easy for developers to get up and running quickly. The internet of things market is expected to enable billions of new devices to be connected to internet, but providing this connectivity to the broader market has been restrained by carrier business practices that aren’t supportive enough of innovation.
In order to get billions of devices deployed, we first need millions of developers to being experimenting. While on beta we’ve seen companies from a variety of industries, like connected cars, fleet tracking, wearables, medical device diagnostics and more take advantage of our developer friendly API First platform to begin building IoT solutions.
And while still early in its evolution, we are devoting significant resources to our programmable, wireless efforts, given the potential to unlock yet another massive platform opportunity for the company and continue to open new possibilities for the developers of the world.
Overall I continue to be very pleased with our performance as we are executing against our strategic priorities across the board. We remain in the early stages of a massive opportunity and as we execute on our platform strategy, we continue to unlock more and more of this market. With roughly half of our headcount in R&D, our investments in innovation are extending the value of our platform and the success we are driving for customers even future. We remain committed to leading this market from its legacy and hardware to its future in software.
Now, let me turn the call over to George to highlight some of the interesting ways customers are using our products and also to discuss our progress in the go to market front. George. Thanks Jeff. Our go to market model continues to build momentum. We are engaging customers, developers and the market like never before with increased capacity and strong productivity across all go-to market functions.
Our Starter point [ph] is continuing to engage developers where they are to fuel our inbound interest and demand. Our developer of agilest participating in over 90 events globally in the first quarter along. One top of that we expanded our own Twilio Engage Roadshow at Superclass where we bring developers and business decision makers together to key cities including Atlanta, Dallas, Minneapolis and Chicago.
These events continue to be very successful in evangelizing the full breadth of Twilio’s capability to our customers and we plan to continue investment in this program. As Jeff discussed, perhaps the highlight of the quarter from a marketing perspective was the launch of Twilio Flex at Enterprise Connect.
Not only was this launch tremendously successful in terms of generating customer interest, with Flex we also saw a strong level of interest from partners, including launch partners like Accenture, Cognizant and Tech Mahindra. We believe Flex will be a key way to attract and build our SI ecosystem and also platform that many of our solution partners build on as well.
All of these go to market efforts where part of a strong Q1 for the go to market team.
I would like to highlight a few of our significant enterprise transactions that highlight the diversity and unique capabilities of the Twilio platform. The first few relationship I’d like to highlight is Marks & Spencer, a global 2000 retailer. This was a significant transaction where we were selected for the next generation intelligent IVR, using Twilio programmable voice, speech recognition, natural language understanding and intent analysis.
The Twilio solution enables Marks & Spencer to evolve from a static IVR and it simply forwards call to stores into an intelligent flexible IVR that could analyze the voice of the customer in real time.
Another significant deal is with the cross boarder division with of a fortune 100 logistics company. Combine the power of the Twilio engagement cloud, Twilio Programmable Communications. This customer used Twilio Account Security across one click checkout, merchant and development portals and several other workflows.
The customer also used Twilio Programmable Messaging, a voice authentication across several use cases, including billing alerts, shipping notifications and access verification. In being selected for this project we leverage our past success with other visions of this customer, including long time Twilio fans with the DTO and developer teams.
The customer also attended signal last year to connect with our team and solidify trust in the platform. We also launched a new project with the Veterans Affairs Medical Center, the VA is currently in the midst of a patient service makeover and they have secured funding to improved care and communications with an estimated 20 million veterans across the entire VA system.
One way to drive efficiency is through patient reminders and doctors appointments. Jeff has talked in the past about their growing rule of developers at organizations of all types and the VA is no different. One of the doctors in the origination is also a software developer and he was instrumental in bringing Twilio in to address their needs.
The VA is in the midst of rolling out an application that sends appointment reminders via SMS to their patients, replaced with a manual phone call in process. By reducing no shows the VA hopes to improve customer service and treat patients more quickly and we couldn’t be more honored at Twilio to be a part of this process.
Finally, we closed a major transition at a top five U.S. cable company. They recognized the cable industry’s poor reputation for customer care and looking to be the face of disruption by selling at customer engagement.
After attending Twilio Engage New York, this company is determined that they can use Twilio in their new eService application, to be able to intercept and score all customer interactions, providing a self service channels or a live agent chat, improving customer satisfaction.
The company’s enterprise agreement will enable them to access key Twilio products like TaskRouter, Programmable Chat, Studio, Functions, Enterprise Plan and more. This transaction highlights the power of the full Twilio platform, as well as the impact of some of our newer go-to-market investments.
So to close, I’m proud of our team for delivering such a strong quarter and I’m excited in our momentum as we continue to build the go-to-market engine that can help Twilio scale to $1 billion and beyond.
Let me pass the mic to Lee to discuss our financial results. Thank you George and good afternoon everyone. The invitation go-to-market approach Jeff and George outlined earlier continues to drive customer success, which in term fueled our revenue growth. Base revenue grew 46% year-over-year in Q1. Excluding Uber, base revenue grew 61% which is consistent with recent periods. A dollar based net expansion rate was 132% on a reported basis and without Uber it was 145%.
The increase in our expansion rates over Q4 was driven by growth across the breadth of our customer base and reflects the power of our platform business model. Our top end active customer accounts raised 2% of revenue in Q1 2018 compared to 25% in Q1 of last year. In this quarter, WhatsApp came in at 7% and Uber at 4% of total revenue. We had six variable customer accounts in the first quarter, flat sequentially and compared to seven in the first quarter of 2017.
Moving on to gross margins, Q1 results came in at 55%, up from 53.5% in Q4. As discussed since the IPO, we remain focused on doing the right things to grow the business long term rather than maximizing gross margins in the near term. As we walked through it at the Analyst Day, our gross margins can fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on multiple factors, including product, country and customer mix. We should expect gross margins in the range of the last few quarters of the remainder of the year.
We ended the quarter at 1027 employees. As you contemplate our values for the balance of the year, please note that we lapped a partial part of the Beepsend acquisition in Q1. Starting in Q2 our year-over-year revenue growth will include the full impact. Also as mentioned in our last call, we expect operating breakeven in Q3, the similar results in Q4, a signal will now occur in October.
So to wrap-up, we are extremely pleased and delivered another quarter of strong results and continued execution. Our powerful platform model, continued product introduction and successful go-to-market effort positions Twilio for continued high growth in the future. Operator. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. How is it going guys? Congrats on the quarter! This is Albert Chi on for Mark Murphy. For Flex you mentioned now you are targeting the largest contact centers with 1000 seats and above and so one, have you talked about pricing and do you see any reason why Flex wouldn’t be a wall to wall deployment. And I guess second, what vendors are you typically running into and replacing with Twilio Flex, knowing that you are still in the early stages of that? Hey, Albert. Thank you for the question, this is George. Yeah, we are very excited about Twilio Flex. We are definitely seeing a lot of interest. You know there is certainly no reason why it cannot be wall to wall for us within the contact center and we are definitely talking to companies about those types of opportunities. In terms of pricing, we have not announced pricing yet and we are continuing through the beta period to learn more as we work with customers and we’ll announce it before GA. Got it, and just one more follow-up. So, I am looking at the fiscal year guidance rates and not to read into things, but it looks like on a percent basis that you’re revising the variable revenue to contribute. It looks like one point higher than previously, but looking at the beat in this quarter came from mostly the base customers. So I am wondering if there is anything on the large customer side that is worth calling out for the rest of the year. Thank you. Yeah, hi Albert. This is Lee. So I mean in general you know we’re pleased with the results and you know we had strength across the overall breadth of our business. You know regarding variable revenue, it’s in that category for a reason. So you know some of that guidance flow through the year with over performance in the first quarter and as always you know we focus that conservatively on an outward basis. Got it, thank you. Congrats again! Your next question comes from the line of Richard Davis with Canaccord. Hey, thanks very much, just two quick questions. So one, I was like in Europe last week and there was a lot of talk not surprisingly about GDPR. How are you guys fitting into that you know regulatory dynamic. I mean some companies are offering consent you know paying back and stuff like that, APIs and stuff like that and then the second one is just you’ve touched on it before, but there is a lot of talk about interactive bots and using balance and not sure whatever. To what extent is Twilio a core technology in that eco-system, so GDPR and Bot. Thanks. Yeah, thanks Richard, this is Jeff. Regarding GDPR, GDPR is something we’ve been investing in for quite some time. We actually announced its signal in London last year that we have spent full compliance with GDPR of the May 25 deadline and we are currently forwarding it towards that and expect to meet that compliance.
We know that’s critical obviously for your PN customers that were a leader in that, but we also believe that taking the leadership role in data stewardship for all of our customers is critically important and then every customer, no matter where you are in the world is going to expect a great degree of care obtained to every piece of customer data that you handle and so we’re treating that standard as a global standard for all of our customers.
And second, with your question around Bots, we’ve had a number of Bot implementations built on top of Twilio whether via SMS, via chat. Our Understand product, Twilio Understands that we announced last year is designed to power those types of interactions when we got customers building those types of interactions on top of Twilio. As a quick refresher, Twilio Understand is a natural language understanding engine that allows you to take the things that a customer says or writes and turn it into the intents behind what they said, so that a developer can write, can programmatically write the answer to a question.
The first step to answering your question is, understanding what the meaning of the question was and so that’s what naturally what understanding is and that’s what our Twilio Understand product is. That product is still in the early stages, but we’re working with customers and getting great feedback and we are very confident that that’s going to be a great product for us. Great, super helpful. Thanks. Your next question comes from the line of Bhavanmit Suri with William Blair. Hey guys, thanks for taking the question and congrats! Let me add to that too. Just first starting on Flex maybe a little bit, just you talked about some of the partners but sort of just some sense of how the partner channel is playing out there? Have you seen any deployments of the partners of LED. I know its early, I know it’s still sort of in beta, but sort of you know are the partners thinking about what they are going to do with call centers in this new omni-channel sort of world through digital transformation. Like how are you seeing the partner interaction there and sort of as you think about reach, how does that play out? Just some sense of the partner activity in that channel? Yeah, great question. We’re definitely seeing a lot of inbound interest from partners. We’re talking everyday honestly to the existing Cisco, Genesys and Avaya resellers that are trying to figure out how do they move to the cloud and to the next generation contact center infrastructure. And I think you know the starting point for us we’re working with some of these partners right now and getting them trained on Flex and you know figure out go-to-market models with them together. I think it’s really exciting time, but really early days for us, but we’ve seen I think a level of interest driven by Flex that we really have not seen before from FI’s and I think that’s a big opportunity for us, mostly going after the legacy base of you know the old venders. Got you, got you and then a quick follow-up on all my questions, sort of on the long term strategic nature, but [audio gap] there’s two sets of partners, the guys who implemented, but as the IoT guys that are sort of saying I’ve got all these systems, I’ve got all these devices. I’ve got to sort of figure out how to embed applications around that. I’d love to just a little incent, a little more color, sort of who are you seeing playing there and what does the partnership channel there look like? Is it a combination of FIs for guys like GE, and so what’s in the reception to the product from those guys? Actually Bhavanmit, this is Jeff, I‘ll answer the question. I think that our offices for wireless is that if you’re going to connect billions of devices to the internet over the coming years you’re going to need millions of developers to be doing that work. In the same dynamics that have played out with voice and with SMS where we built a super network, gave the developers, let them get started, we’re throwing a little friction and then be able to experiment with their ideas and if experimentation is the pre-requisite to innovation, then we wanted to bring that same product philosophy to the world of IoT and to the world of wireless connectivity and that’s what we’re seeing play out.
We’re seeing developers pick up Twilio Wireless. You can get started with a few dollars. I think its $5. You get a starter with [$0.02 or $0.03][Ph] and kind of anything you need to get started and to get building, and that’s contrasted with the legacy business model of you know getting excited over connectivity for one of these use cases, which would be a long negotiation period, long sales cycles and you know big committed contracts to a carrier to already get started and we just feel that lowering the barriers to innovation, making it easier for a developer to see their ideas play out and testament customers is actually the key to having that innovation for us on top of Twilio.
Now regarding the partnership opportunity, we see personal carriers as big partners in bringing this product to market. We have obviously launched it with T-mobile as our launch partner in the United States. We see interest from other carriers around the world as well. We also see other companies that are hoping the IoT development ecosystem flourish as good partnerships like people make hardware and things like that and obviously in the past quarter we actually announced a partnership with Singtel in Singapore as well, a similar type of relationship.
And so we see a lot of opportunities to help point to a wireless in the hands of the world’s developers, whether that’s a go-to-market, that’s in partnership with carriers around the world who want to accelerate innovation on their networks, also via the hardware companies that are helping the developers get started with their prototyping on the physical side of it and I am sure there will be more to come. Got it, that’s helpful Jeff. Thank you guys. Congrats! Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Nikolay Bykov with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Hi, this is actually Jacqueline Cheong on for Nikolay. Congrats on the quarter. One question that we keep getting from the investors is how growth margins are impacted by the mix between customers of different sizes and as more of the business comes from larger customers that get a volume discount, how does that impact gross margins? Yeah Jacqueline, this is Lee. So gross margin is impacted by multiple items, given one of those items is customer size. As the customers get larger we do give them volume discount, so that you know they can get a better price as they grow in scale. You know we offset this with S&P gains and product mix, specifically our application software. Application certainly has a higher margin profile. Okay, thank you, that makes sense. And can you also give us an update on application services revenues. What percent of the mix were they in the quarter and what was the growth rate in kind of – in three to five years what percent of total revenues could come from application services revenue. Yes, I mean application services were up sequentially on the quarter and did grow well above our corporate growth rate. That’s a metric that we’ll give out just on a periodic basis as we achieve milestones, but we do expect it to grow significantly faster than our overall corporate average over time. We haven’t released any specific targets yet. Got it, and if I can just sneak one more in, what drove the higher free cash flow number this quarter? Yeah, that was really just working capital changes. So just some timing in terms of some higher recruiting expenses, some delays in payable and we expect that to revert and normalize in the next quarter. Got it. Thank you so much. Your next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin from KeyBanc. Thank you for taking the question. I want to drill down into a couple of different areas, maybe starting with Jeff or George around the base new customer adds. 5000 new adds this quarter. I think that’s doubled the number of net adds last quarter, kind of record numbers there. What drove that expansion in the quarter? Is it triggered by rolling out the new programmable wireless API, is it better sales productivity, help us understand that base customer ads there, what drove that in the quarter? Yeah, you know this is George. You know typically Q1 is seasonally a strong quarter for us for customer adds. I think it’s generally a reflection of the fact that we are engaging more with our customers and developers that signed up and I think we’re seeing that show up in the numbers. So its overall I think a reflection of our go-to-market investments plus the investment we’re making in developer acquisition and evangelism, but I think some of it is also driven by seasonal strength. Got it. So seasonality sounds like quite a big factor there. And then if I look at the net dollar expansion rate, that has been kind of declining for I think the last six, seven quarters. You got a nice reversal that accelerated this quarter. You know on one hand you had WhatsApp that certainly helped and on the other hand you had Uber that kind of washes that out. So what drove the net dollar improvement this quarter? The magnitude of that looks pretty impressive. Was it broad-based expansion at existing customers, was it just a handful of larger customers that float into the mix, help me understand what were the contributing factors there on the net dollar expansion number? Yeah, hi Brett. This is Lee. Just for clarification we measure that on base revenue only, so WhatsApp is not part of calculation and if we look at that expansion rate ex-Uber it has been very consistent over the last five quarters. So some of that drop was just us lasting the impact of Uber.
To the second part of your question, you know we saw strength across the overall customer base from the long tellerwave to our large customers and you know that overall strength resulted in the increase in the expansion rates. Great! Last question for me is, I must take one in here for George on the top U.S. cable provider. I can’t let you off without asking a question on that. What was the bundle again as you think about that and how fast was the turnaround there? You talked about that engaged relationship in New York and then striking that relationship, how long did that deal take to close and remind us the bundle and did you say a dollar size for that deal? We do not have a dollar size for the deal. We had our New York engage I believe in early December of last year, so that will give you a sense of probably the timing and obviously we closed the transaction in Q1, so we’re talking several months engagement cycle.
In terms of the bundle, it’s an enterprise agreement for us so it includes access to a broad portfolio of our software technologies focused really around voice technologies, including task router for chat studio functions enterprise plan and these are all things that are part of our you know early related sort of strength in this opportunity region contact center. Very helpful. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Pat Walravens from JMP Group. Oh great! Thank you very much. So George when I saw you at our conference in February you were talking about how your number one priority was doubling down on protocare and resources and the productivity numbers looks fantastic. So I would just love to sort of get an update for how you feel about those? I think that our strategy is we’re still on track with that strategy, so we’re still hiring people. The productivity is strong and I think that we’re seeing that strength in the numbers. And, are there any particular places where you see it more than elsewhere? Honestly we’re growing across multiple segments geographies. So we’re growing both in our commercial segment and our enterprise segment; we’re growing in both the U.S. and international and we’re also seeing strength across all the segments. Okay, great. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Brian White from Monness Crespi. Yeah, I am wondering if you can talk a little bit about how big you see the TAM for Flex and specifically when it’s going to GA. Sure, this is Jeff. The TAM for the contact center, essentially you’ll see numbers that do have a wide spectrum generally in the tens of billions of dollars from the low demand and sometimes from mid to high.
I believe the reason why you see a spectrum in this, because sometimes they included just the software or just the hardware or just the connectivity components of that end. What’s interesting about Twilio is that we really being all, every component you use in that contact center and so you get the voice minuets, the SMS, the Chat and the software and the management and sort of all in one from the benefits of the cloud. And so you know we think this is a sizable gamble though when you do, you know part of the research of writing answers you get which can be a little confusing.
As far as, although the second part of your questions, what was it? When it is going to go GA? Yeah, we are expecting to bring it to GA this year. I’ll remind you that a bunch of the aspects of Flex are actually already mature parts of Twilio stack, including our voice product, our TaskRouter, our Interconnect, a lot of the pieces that you need for a call center are parts of Twilio and already GA and then the parts that were newly introduced for the most part is the Agent Desktop and the Supervisor Desktop and those are the parts that we are busy right now bringing the maturity, as well as bringing the whole bundle together for our customers and we are working with a number of customers already and we’ve gotten great feedback and we look forward to I guess continuing to get that product out to more and more customers throughout the year. And Jeff, you have a lot of new products ramping this year. If you could just narrow down maybe the two or three new products that will have the more meaning impact on Twilio this year? Well I think we are excited about many of our new products. You know I think Flex certainly we are very excited about having gotten out the door and then in the announcements back in Q1. The response we’ve gotten from customers and from partners and from the market overall, analysts, it has just been really fantastic. I think we have really understood a customer paying point from our perspective as a platform that the market has not yet seen and so we are very exciting about Flex.
Although I say we need to get the product into customers’ hands, we just announced it and so will it have a huge impact on our numbers this year, probably not, but we are very optimistic about the power that that product can bring to the table.
Other products we are excited about are just the Twilio Wireless. We are very excited to get that into GA in Q1 and again, this is a huge market and a very large opportunity with IoT and I feel like we are just at the tip of the iceberg now with the opportunity that IoT represents, both globally as well as with Wireless itself has it gotten to GA and getting in the hands of an increasingly large set of customers. Great. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Will Power with Baird. Yeah, great thanks. Yeah maybe just coming back quickly to the first quarter, you know obviously know strong numbers, it sounds like it was broad based, but I wondered if there was any more color on kind of sources of upside relative to expectations, whether its application services versus SMS or Voice. And then the second somewhat related question, I wondered if we can get an update on kind of the international domestic split. I guess companies based on whether domiciled and what those kind of respective growth rates look like. Thanks. Yeah, I will, this is Lee. So as I said earlier, we saw strength across the broad breadth of our customers. I mean one of the beauties of our model is we work very hard, invest a lot of money and sales effort to mark our customers successful and then when they are successful and grow we share their success and we saw that in the first quarter.
In terms of your second question, our international spilt of business for our company headquarter outside of the US was 24%. Okay and any update on just what the growth trajectory looks like for those companies versus domestic companies? Yeah, I mean international growth rate is faster than our U.S. growth rate. Okay, thanks. Your next question is from the line of Stephen Bersey with MUFG Securities. Hey thanks. Just wondering for Flex, it sounds very interesting. I am just wondering how that might impact gross margin going forward? Will that require a bunch of new gear or will Flex simply leverage your existing infrastructure? Thanks. Yeah, this is Lee. So there is two components to Flex, so there is a pure software component, that will be a higher gross margin profile and then also there will be a significant pull-through of our programmable services which is the current gross margin profile. So in the long run we do see that as a positive uptick on the gross margin. Great and then I guess regarding Flex and the beta program, can you comment around maybe the number of beta participants in that? This is George. So [Audio Gap] our volatility focused beta program. We are talking double digit, not like thousands of people in the beta program. This is going to be focused on higher end customers, larger customers and for the beta program we will have smaller numbers in it. Great, thanks guys. Your next question comes from the line of Catharine Trebnick with Dougherty. Thank you for talking my question and congratulations. Any particular color you can put around what your average each customer and what’s the average sales into that customer. Particularly interested in between this quarter and last quarter if you could categorize that for us? Thanks. Yeah, I mean you know one way to look at it is our ARPU. So our ARPU for our beta customers was $9,100 on the quarter. That is up. It was actually $8,800 over the prior quarter and we’ve seen that ARPU growth rate grow consistently. If I go back to Q1 in 2015 it was $5,700. So that is an important driver of growth as we scale our business and with the higher expansion rate bringing on new products. We do see that in ARPU growth rate expand. Alright. Thanks. Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Kees with Summit Insights Group. Great. Thanks for talking my questions, and then I’ll add my kudos to the quarter, to the results. My questions are on LINE. It’s great to hear that [inaudible] LINE and you have accessed that to the users in Asia. Just curious how much of your revenue driver would that be. I know that you also had a Facebook Messenger, maybe take a step back looking at the messaging apps in general. Second, I have a question about... Jonathan, could you repeat that question please? Oh sure, sorry. I wanted to know how much of a revenue driver, if any – excuse me, LINE will be. I know well maybe the thing is just taking a step back and looking at the messaging apps, because I also know that you have a support for Facebook Messenger, a connection to Facebook Messenger. Is that – that type of connection, does that even move the needle in revenue? And then I have a second question about Flex? Yeah, absolutely. This is Jeff, I’ll answer the question. So this is still the early days of the adoption of a lot of these new channels. We are very excited about the opportunity these channels presents as we see our customers struggling to figure out which channel they should invest their development energy and which ones their customers are also going to want and we see it as a big opportunity to help them to adopt those channels and to write against once side of APIs and let them work everywhere.
As far as the revenue, to-date while these have been in beta periods we have not been charging customers. Really learning about the use cases and understanding what customers want out of the product as well as what challenges arise when you are done doing these new channels.
But if you look at the rest of the opportunities you know I think that it will all depend on the channels and depend of the use cases. If you look at Flex for example, omni-channel capabilities are one of the key selling points of Flex and in that when we are able to show customers that, would you install Flex, it will actually work over chat, SMS, Facebook Messenger and LINE seamlessly; well that’s the big selling points. But you end up monetizing Flex as opposed to the channel itself.
So I think that based on the use case and based on the channel there will be different monetization strategies. But it is the early days of the world figuring out how these new channels will play out and so we’ve just been in the mode of listening to customers and working closely with customers to understand how they intend to use these channels and how their end users want to use these channels. Okay great, that makes sense. My second question was on Flex. I know you are still in beta with that. You are talking about getting some partners working with the feedback on the on-premise guys. Just curious if you talked about or can you talk about reaching out to the Ecast guys, having them as partners. I mean a lot of the [Ecast] [ph] guys have partnered with the contact center provider. Have you thought about using them as an SI; are you trying to reach with enterprise customers, the developers of enterprise companies. Thanks. I wouldn’t rule it out. We see a wide variety of partnership opportunities with Flex given how programmable and flexible and extensible it is. That’s one part, as a partner. Anything is possible. Okay. All right, thanks. There are no further questions at this time. Thank you for participating in today’s conference.

Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Thank you, Greg. Welcome everybody to this quarter's call. As you can imagine, we're pleased with this quarter's results. The business, up and down the product stack, exhibited continued strength in the second quarter. We believe this shows the power of our platform model which combines our platform product strategy, our developer-first approach and our usage-based pricing model.
When our customers succeed, we succeed, sometimes even more than we planned for because of the pure size of this market and our leadership position. But we're not resting on our laurels. We see a tremendous opportunity ahead. As every company starts to become a software company, we continue to see our developer-first model working across companies of all shapes and sizes. We will continue to invest deeply to innovate and build market share as this is just the earliest stage of our opportunity to fuel the future of communications.
The primary metric we focus on, base revenue, grew by 54% to $135 million in the second quarter. This type of growth has been [ verified error ] for companies of our size and a testament to the team of Twilions around the world and their execution for our customers. Total revenue grew a similar amount to nearly $148 million. Our ability to drive more business with existing customers continues to power our results as we produced a dollar-based net expansion rate of 137% in the quarter. All of this was driven by our focus on innovation and customer success.
Our core voice and messaging product lines continue to drive the majority of growth in our business. These segments remain the lion's share of our revenue and are exhibiting strong growth even as new businesses achieve greater and greater scale. But they also provide the foundation of the growing success we're seeing with the Engagement Cloud, as each layer adds value to the layer above it.
As I first laid out on our Q4 call, the first of our 2 top level priorities for 2018 is furthering our push into a strategic software platform for customer engagement through our buildout of the Engagement Cloud. In the second quarter, we did our second major deal for Twilio Flex, our recently announced cloud contact center application platform, even though the product is still in beta. We also did several proxy deals. We saw continued success with the Authy family of products. We also recently announced the general availability of our drag-and-drop visual editor, Studio. Our strategy with the Engagement Cloud is working as we work to unlock more and more of this market.
Now let me take a moment to reiterate the power of our platform business model and how it enables us to see the opportunity with things like Flex. As a horizontal platform, developers can build just about anything with our Programmable Communications Cloud, and this is a different basis for innovation than companies that just build solutions. See, when you build solutions, customers come to you when they have that specific problem and they need it solved, pretty straightforward. But when companies have different problems that aren't solved by any of those solutions that are out there, most companies either try to cram their problem into the framework of that solution with varying degrees of success, or they just move on with their problems unsolved. But with Twilio's platform, some of the most innovative companies start saying, ""Hey, what if we can finally build a solution to our problems?"" And as we see these companies start to build, we ask them questions about why they chose to build on top of Twilio instead of just buying some prebuilt solution, and they unveiled to us the unsolved problems of the business world. We start to see this heat map of where we should invest next to solve big, unsolved problems for our customers. That's how the opportunity for Flex arose.
We have been helping customers both modernize and recreate their contact centers for years. And Flex is the next step in this evolution, taking the knowledge we've accumulated over all that time expressed through a new application platform product. Flex offers a powerful combination of cloud scale, along with complete customization at every layer that has never been done before. In the case of the contact center, we found that enterprises were stuck on-prem despite the fact that we're 20 years in this whole cloud thing. They're still on-prem not because they love it, trust me, they don't, but because the cloud hadn't offered anything with the flexibility you get from on-premise solutions where you can deeply customize your own installation to meet the specific needs of your company. They want the scalability, reliability and global reach of the cloud, but they can't give up those customizations. That's why when you talk to industry experts, they estimate that 80% to 90% of the very large contact center market is still stuck on-prem. So we intend to solve that problem and, in doing so, help migrate that 80% to 90% of the contact center market from their legacy on-prem and, finally, into the cloud.
Now I don't want to steal too much of George's thunder here, but Flex is off to a great start. I think our platform approach has uncovered an unsolved problem that enterprises are facing in their contact centers. We've recently expanded the beta program, and our development team is hard at work finalizing the last bits of the agent desktop as we prepare for the GA launch later this year. So while it's certainly early in the life cycle here, and we have a lot of work left to do, we believe Flex will be an important product line for Twilio for many years to come.
Our second priority in 2018 is to expand our position as developers' first choice for communications. Omnichannel communications remains an important goal for our customers, but one made more complex by the ever-changing field of channels and customer preferences. Communicating through SMS is still a mystery for many companies, much less dealing with all the new channels like Facebook Messenger, Google RCS, WeChat, WhatsApp, Alexa and many more. Our goal as a platform provider is to make this as seamless as possible for our customers by hiding the underlying complexity and making these channels available for a single, easy-to-use API. And we've recently taken several important steps in fulfilling this mission. Just last week, we were thrilled to join forces with WhatsApp with the launch of the Twilio API for WhatsApp. WhatsApp is an incredibly important communications channel in many geographies around the world, serving more than 1.5 billion consumers worldwide. Over the past year, we've been working with WhatsApp to allow enterprises to integrate WhatsApp messaging into their notifications and customer support work logs. This channel is now available in limited release with just a few lines of code on our platform. We're helping customers like Deliveroo, Hays, PATH and others explore the possibilities opened by this new channel. And we have developers starting to explore their new ideas with our Sandbox that's available today. And along with the ability to access this channel and many others through a single API, customers can take advantage of the same scale and reliability inherent to our platform as well as products like Studio and Flex to also support WhatsApp. For us, adding this important channel to our platform broadens our reach and opens up a whole new set of customers around the world who can take advantage of not only this product but the rest of our platform as well.
We are also investing in ways to leverage machine learning to help our customers build smarter communications. For example, we believe the contact center will be transformed by AI in the coming years. And Flex, as an application platform, is perfectly positioned to integrate with all the leading AI platforms and products out there. And our Programmable Communications Cloud, similarly enables customers to rapidly integrate AI solutions with their communications because it's all building blocks. For example, this quarter, we expanded our relationship with Google as a launch partner for 2 of their new efforts, Dialogflow and their Contact Center AI. At their Google Next events, we were able to demonstrate how one of our customers, Marks & Spencer, has integrated these Google services into their Twilio deployments to create better, more automated customer experiences. We will continue to work with the leading vendors in the space like Google to offer choice to our customers as they strive to optimize their customer reach.
Before I turn the call over to George, I'd like to thank our customers for putting their trust in us to deliver for them, and I want to thank Twilions around the world for their hard work and their constant devotion to our customers' success. The communications market is so vast, and the opportunities to help our customers use communications to engage with their customers through software are virtually endless. We'll be debuting our latest set of innovations at our SIGNAL conference in San Francisco on October 17 and 18, so mark your calendars.
George, let me turn the call over to you for an update on our go-to-market efforts. Thanks, Jeff. Q2 was another strong quarter for go-to-market as we continue to execute our core strategy. The investments we're making in our go-to-market engine are bearing fruit in the short term, bringing in amazing new logos while also, at the same time, deepening the relationships we have with existing customers. And just as important, we're also laying the groundwork for further growth and scale in the future. As a reminder, our priorities on the go-to-market side are focused around 3 core principles: one, winning the hearts and minds of developers wherever they are in the world; two, increasing our account coverage to better serve our customers and our opportunity; and three, building the foundation for future growth with partners, enterprise and international.
As always with Twilio, let's start with the developers. Developer evangelism remains the core driver of our inbound funnel. As we continue to execute our strategy of meeting developers in the field, we're supplementing this with our engaged roadshows that are bringing together developers and decision-makers. We've hit more than a dozen cities and interacted with well over 1,000 customers and prospects so far this year, driving both awareness and pipeline. All of these efforts are now leading up to our SIGNAL conference in October where we get developers, customers and prospects together to explore the future of communication.
We're continuing to increase our coverage as well while maintaining strong productivity, which is driving a growing number of transactions. We're also deepening our relationships with existing customers as evidenced by the expansion rate Jeff mentioned a moment ago. 137% is an amazing feat in the world of software, and we're achieving it at well over $500 million annualized run rate. One of the deals I'm most excited about for the last quarter was our second major Flex deal, this time with Shopify, a leading commerce platform company that I'm sure many of you know well. The power of Flex as the first contact center application platform is truly redefining the contact center market. For the first time, companies can build exactly what they need to support the specific requirements of their customer engagement while taking advantage of global cloud scale at the same time. As a development-centric company that is growing quickly, Shopify needs both customization and scalability. They chose Twilio Flex because they wanted a contact center that will fit their business instead of fitting their business with a software.
We're also expanding our coverage in the enterprise, so let's walk through a couple of the highlights from the past quarter. One interesting enterprise deal from the past quarter was an expansion of our relationship with Bank of America. This new project involves a voice application with the goal of increasing lead conversion time and creating new revenue opportunities. Another great, expanded relationship was a multifaceted deal with U-Haul International. You've heard Jeff discuss many times the growing role of software within companies of all shapes and sizes, and U-Haul is no different. To drive innovation across their company, U-Haul tasked its engineers with improving their customer experience and creating new service offerings. We've worked with their engineering team to identify several use cases to further their mission. U-Haul will be using a variety of our products from SMS, chat, proxy, wireless and video, and we've already identified many more use cases and look forward to deepening our relationship over time. Overall, we're just scratching the surface in the traditional enterprise. We have more than 10% of the Global 2000 as part of our active customer count, and we have a tremendous opportunity to grow that count and expand those relationships in the future.
And while I'm excited about the success we're having in the short term, we're also making important investments to help us scale to reach our full potential. I mentioned back in the Q4 call the addition of Ron Huddleston as our Chief Partner Officer. Ron has been hard at work since then building out his team as they work to create the foundations of our partner effort. We saw a taste of this with the partner lineup we announced in the support of the Flex launch back in March. And at the end of June, we launched our new partner program, Twilio Build. A successful partner program can be a force multiplier for customer success, whether providing specialized expertise, accelerating implementations or expanding our reach. Twilio Build is designed to help nurture consulting partners to help sell with us and solution partners that sell for us by embedding our technology in their products. Twilio Build includes all the people and processes partners need to be successful like training, certifications, pricing models, channel managers, a brand new partner community and more. I'm incredibly excited about what this program will add to our business over the coming years.
Overall, our momentum continues to grow as we execute our plan, I'm incredibly proud of our team and the results they delivered in Q2 and I couldn't be more excited about our long-term opportunity. Let me pass the mic to Lee to discuss our financial results. Thank you, George, and good afternoon to everyone. In Q2, we have continued strong revenue growth and achieved non-GAAP profitability 1 quarter ahead of plan. Our product innovation, coupled with our powerful developer-first go-to-market model continues to deliver success for our customers and drive our growth.
Let me walk through a few of the highlights. Base revenue grew 54% year-over-year in Q2. Excluding Uber, base revenue grew 64%. These results were well ahead of our guidance. And as much as I'm thrilled by the momentum and trajectory of our business, I would not expect the flow of outperformance for our guidance every quarter. As George and his team has transformed our go-to-market effort over the past year or so, we've also adjusted our forecasting process to better model the flow-through impact. You can see the results of it in our guidance for the remainder of 2018.
Our dollar-based net expansion rate was strong once again at 137%, or 145% without Uber. Our go-to-market efforts are creating deeper, more strategic relationships with our customers which fuels the growth engine for our business. The top 10 active customer accounts contributed 17% of total revenue in Q2, down from 18% last quarter and 21% in Q2 of 2017. Our top 2 customers contributed 7% and 12% of total revenue, similar to Q1 level. We had fixed variable customer accounts once again in the second quarter.
Gross margins were similar to Q1, coming in at 55% in Q2. While gross margins had been stable for the past 2 quarters, we remain focused on doing the right thing to grow the business long term rather than maximizing gross margins in the near term. You should expect continued fluctuations going forward. For the balance of the year, gross margins should fall within the range of the last 4 quarters. Though we're currently operating at the high end of the spectrum, we see things that could impact where we fall on that range by product, country and customer mix that will serve as provider fee, FX and more.
And to help with some of your models, we ended the quarter with 1,119 new employees, and our international mix of revenue is 25%. In terms of the bottom line, we hit the strong level this quarter, producing a non-GAAP operating profit 1 quarter ahead of the time line we outlined last year. This is driven largely by the revenue upside in the quarter. As we have mentioned for some time, getting to breakeven has been an important milestone for the company. Looking ahead, given our leadership position in this massive market, we should expect our priority to remain on reinvesting for growth rather than operating margin expansion. One item of note, on the balance sheet, the convert we've completed in May added about $479 million of cash net to our balance sheet in the quarter.
To wrap up, another quarter of strong execution from across the organization with excellent financial results. And investments we're making in both product and our go-to-market organization sets us up well for continued growth in the future. Operator? [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Mark Murphy from JPMorgan. So Jeff, I wanted to ask you, when you try to envision the future state of Twilio, perhaps 5 or 10 years down the road, how much of the business do you think could be in the contact center, if that is a market that, I believe, is nearly $100 billion in size? And just also, what do you think would be the ultimate mix of the business, which could be the higher margin variety or the -- I think what you referred to as the higher-level API, such as Engagement Cloud and Authy? Thanks, Mark. I mean, I think, obviously, we feel good about the contact center market. It's an area that's ripe for some better solutions, and we're happy to provide them and also have our partners provide them. The overall market, you're right, is very large. Depending on which analyst you talk to, it can be in the tens of billions up to greater than $100 billion because there's a lot of components of it, there's the software, there's the connectivity, there's services, all sorts of different aspects on it. But it's a very large market. The most important thing about that number is actually that multiple -- according to most analysts, about 90% of that market is still on-prem despite the fact that customers don't want to be on-prem. And so we think it's an area with a very big opportunity and one that we're excited to address. As far as how much our business is, I'm not sure I would speculate to answer exactly what I think it's going to be because there are a lot of use cases that, similarly, at Twilio, we see as areas that are ripe for disruption and new ways of going about as well as bringing those markets from legacy solutions into the cloud. And so there's a lot of areas that Twilio's investing in, there are a lot of use cases that we feel very excited about, and the contact center is certainly one of those. And I think there's a second part to your question, Mark? Yes. I was wondering, Jeff, in the very long run, what mix of your business do you think could be the higher gross margin variety, in other words, use cases or the higher-level APIs. Yes. Well, the Engagement Cloud strategy that we launched last year and then we reinforced with the launch of Flex earlier this year for contact center, this strategy we feel is working, and we're very excited about it. That said, our core business of programmable SMS and Programmable Voice, these are mature products that are at scale, and they continue to grow very quickly. And you'll also notice that as we roll out the Engagement Cloud products like the contact center, it is going to pull through more revenue from the underlying platform of voice minutes and SMS. And so we think that our Engagement Cloud is going to grow rapidly, and we feel great about that product as well as the software nature of those products, it is also going to continue to help boost the growth rates of our Programmable Communications Cloud. And so we feel really excited about both parts of those business. And I wouldn't, I guess, speculate on exactly what the growth rates are going to be of either one other than the fact that we feel both of those strategies are working very nicely. But the mix will grow over time, obviously, as we introduce new products in the Engagement Cloud. And as a quick follow-up, Lee, I didn't quite catch your comment. I believe you made some kind of comment about adjusting the modeling or adjusting the guidance methodology. And if I heard that correctly, what exactly are you doing differently? And maybe what is the magnitude of that change? Yes. A few things, Mark. So I mean the main point we wanted to make is as much as -- we feel really great about the business, business inputs are strong, our outlook is great, not expect beat this large every quarter in terms of revenue. And a little more subtle behind that comment was, as George has implemented go-to-market enhancements over the last year, we've gotten to better understand the impact of those enhancements, and we've incorporated those into our forecast. And that's reflected in the guidance we gave for the second half of the year. The actual methodology philosophy approach has not changed, however. Your next question comes from Richard Davis from Canaccord. Yes. So I saw you guys introduce -- or announce, I guess, Twilio Sync for IoT and embedded devices. And that space was like super hot, and it's actually probably calmed down to the point where it's actually a legitimately growing business. I realize you have a lot of products in your portfolio, but at least broadly at least, do you think like that would be an interesting vector for you guys? How should we think about that? Yes, sure. Now Twilio Sync is a product that we launched a couple of years ago with the ability to synchronize application state across a wide variety of devices, whether it's mobile devices, browsers, now what we added to that is on IoT devices. And we feel that the IoT market is obviously one that is ripe for a huge amount of growth given the -- overall, given the -- if you listen to analysts, it's like we're going to connect every grain of sand on the beach to the Internet, and so the amount of growth here is tremendous. And we like Sync as a connector for those devices. We think that's a product that's needed by developers as a lightweight way of taking data that's coming off of those devices and moving that data into the cloud as well as moving application state from the cloud, maybe some Web application or mobile application and moving it back down to devices. And I'll also say for the IoT market, probably our bigger play there is Twilio Wireless which, of course, is the wireless connectivity solution that we're primarily aiming at the IoT market to provide wireless connectivity over 4G, 3G networks to those devices. And that's a product that we're particularly excited about. Got it. And you can answer this, I'm sure, as a one word answer, yes or no, but you guys, I think, cleared the GDPR stuff and data protection with flying colors, is that right? Yes. That was in May, and we put a very large list across Twilio to meet the compliance obligations of GDPR, and we're excited to say that we met the obligations. And that's not just for our European customers, that is for all of Twilio's customers because we feel being a good steward of our customers' data and treating the data with the respect it deserves is a core aspect of any platform and really any product company going forward. And so we're excited to undertake the effort to prove to customers how we can be transparent with customers, how we treat their data and prove with -- by meeting obligations of the law that we are actually treating their data as they want it to be treated. And so we feel like that's a really good investment. Your next question comes from Alex Zukin from Piper Jaffray. So this looked a bit like an inflection quarter for you, with accelerating revenue growth both sequential and year-over-year, both base and total. And somehow you managed to pair that with some of the best incremental operating leverage you've seen. And given your customer count growth is roughly flat from a growth perspective with last quarter, can you maybe comment on some -- or shed some light on what is happening with either the use cases that you're seeing incrementally or is it some of the go-to-market synergies that you're finding? And what type of dollar-based net expansion rate do you think we should think about as being more or less sustainable for the back half of the year? And I've got a quick follow-up. Alex, it's Lee, I'll take that. So a few things behind there. First of all, when we look at Q2, I don't necessarily see it as an inflection point, just a continuation of the business, very similar to what we saw in Q1 with strength across -- over the broad breadth of our customer base. If you actually look at base revenue expansion, pulling Uber out, that was in the mid-60 range, and that number has been in the low to mid-60% range over the last 8 quarters. So as we've scaled this business, we've maintained consistently high revenue growth. In terms of the expansion rate, we expect to continue with a high and strong expansion rate. That reflects the power of our platform model and the go-to-market efforts. Over the long term, as the older cohorts become larger, that expansion rate will drop over time. But again, we feel really good about the efforts we're doing to keep it steady. You know what, Alex, maybe some other -- did you ask... Yes, I was just going to ask about -- maybe for George, the hiring trends year-to-date, where we are with respect to doubling quota-carrying headcount within the sales organization and maybe how you see productivity ramping throughout the year. So thanks for the question. Look, we're not going to give out specifics on our quota-carrying headcount and where we are, but I will say I'm very pleased with the hiring. We're on our plan. And so I think you're seeing that in our numbers. So we're excited about the momentum in go-to-market and just really, really happy about the progress. Your next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. This is Jon on the call for Heather. Just a question. You guys hit what is a fairly strong beat and you just had some traction in your higher margin products with the Engagement Cloud Platform, but your gross margins were sort of flat sequentially. And we know that you passed on a lot of these cost savings to your customers, but can you maybe talk about the pace of this gross margin expansion throughout the rest of the year and, I guess, over the course of next year or a couple of years or so? Yes, Jon, some of that wasn't completely clear, but I think if I understand you, there was a talk about our gross margin rate. So as we said since the IPO, our focus has been on driving top line revenue growth rather than maximizing gross margin in the near term. So as we look out over the rest of the year, in terms of our guidance, we talked about gross margin being in the range of what it's been over the last 4 quarters with puts and takes that could cause it to fluctuate a bit in either direction. In the long term, we feel very comfortable with our long-term gross margin model of 60% to 65% as the Engagement Cloud application services become a greater part of total revenue. And your next question comes from Nikolay Beliov from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. This is actually Jacqueline on for Nikolay Beliov. My first question is what's driving the increase in expansion rate to 137% this quarter? And any color on what the expansion rate is without Uber? Why don't we let George talk about go-to-market, the factors that are driving the expansion rate? And Lee, maybe you can add... Sure. We -- there's a couple of things that are driving it. One is we have more coverage, frankly, and more people working with our customers every day in the front line to help them find new use cases. Also, we're seeing momentum with new products and things like Flex which we talked about. So I would say those are kind of the 2 to 3 biggest things. Then jumping in, this is Lee. In terms of overall expansion rate going from 132% to 137%, the negative impact of Uber is less in this quarter. If you pull Uber out, expansion rate was 145% [ against Q1 ]. Got it. And maybe one more question, an update on application services revenues. What percent of the mix were they in this quarter? And what was the growth rate? And kind of what do you see in 3 to 5 years? Like what percent do you think it could be of total revenue? Yes, so that's a number that we talked -- we don't talk about it on a regular basis but we'll give out periodically. Last time we talked about it, it was 10% in Q4. Application services revenue still continues to grow very fast, much faster than the corporate average. And as a reminder, similar to what Jeff talked about in terms of the contact center Engagement Cloud revenue, application service revenue, even though it's growing very quickly, our Programmable Voice and Messaging revenue is growing quickly, and it also will pull through revenue -- that base in service revenue will pull through our Programmable Voice and Messaging revenue. So mix will gradually increase over time. We don't specifically guide to what that percentage will be, however. Your next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Yes. Sorry for the miscommunication before. I just had 2 questions for you guys. Obviously, you posted a really strong beat, so congrats on that. I wanted to follow up, I think, on the first question that Mark had, talking about some of the higher gross margin products like Flex. You seem like you're having some good traction there. Your gross margins were flat sequentially. I'm just wondering if you could share with us how we should expect the pace of gross margin expansion to play out over the course of the next kind of 12 to 24 months as that product ramps. And then the other question I had, just again another follow-up on Flex, is just when you are in the market with that product, what options are most often also being considered by customers? Yes, Heather. This is Lee. I'll take the first part of the question. So regarding -- there's also been a lot of excitement around Flex, however, the product goes GA later this year, so there's really not going to be a material impact on revenue in this calendar year, though we're very excited going forward. And regarding overall gross margin forecast, I'll go back to what we talked about since the beginning of the IPO, we're really focused on driving high-revenue growth, and that's the main focus of the business rather than maximizing gross margin in the near term. So we're still focusing on revenue growth. The second part of your question, Heather, the #1 competitors we're seeing out there for Flex at really the on-premise companies. Jeff talked about 90% of the world is still on-premise versus cloud. But we do occasionally see maybe a cloud SaaS provider. But the #1 pain point we're seeing in the field is people wanting to move off of on-premise and into the cloud, and those are your usual suspects: Cisco, Genesys, Avaya, et cetera. Yes. And are those typically end of life at a certain point? Like do you have experience knowing when those are kind of completely written off and when -- you mean some of those solutions you're mentioning are really, really old at this point, so how do we think about those kind of coming of age? Well, those products are -- those products have typically very expansive footprints inside these companies. And so what's nice about us, what we're doing is we're typically not ripping up the whole thing in day 1, we're taking it out piece by piece. I think honestly, some of these companies may have a piece of this infrastructure, it's going to take them years to honestly rip the whole thing out. So I think that's actually good opportunity for us over time. I think that, that means there's a runway for us for many, many years to be replacing old legacy technology. I don't think -- there's going to be no shortages of the opportunity for us to do that for years to come. Your next question comes from Bhavan Suri from William Blair & Company. I wanted to touch on 2 pieces here. One is, as I look at the platform today, you've got a couple of things that you sort of carved out from the call center stuff or sort of be in the insurance vertical. You've got sort of engaged, you've got some of the IoT stuff. But are you thinking about taking more pieces and applying them to very vertical specific things like a private wealth thing or something like that? How do you guys think about sort of the idea sort of verticalization? And again the platform is just very horizontal, but there are some really interesting spaces where some of your clients have done some interesting things and you could see repeatability there. Just sort of as you think about strategic, I wonder how you think vertical apps and verticalization or vertical frameworks for certain industries. Thanks, Bhavan, this is Jeff. So the way we generally think about it, we are a broad horizontal platform and beginning with our new application platforms which are still designed to be very broad entrants into the market. And that's one of the areas where we really excel is because all our products are APIs, even our application platforms are designed from the ground up to be completely customized in every way you can imagine. This creates a great opportunity for companies who are in vertical spaces to actually customize our solutions for those verticals. And so historically, we had partners take the products like Twilio Build and actually get them into verticals that I honestly never even knew existed. We've got like customers who provide CRM for auto dealers, CRM for hair salons, CRM for yoga studios, right? Like I didn't know those things existed, but God bless them, they do, and they use Twilio in order to get better communications into the hands of those companies. And so I think this is, generally speaking, part of our strategy, to fuel the future of communications, which is that Twilio, we're not a solutions company going after one -- just one thing or just one view of what that solution is, we are trying to up-level the entire playing field and help every company improve how they communicate with their customers. Now oftentimes the verticalization of those products is ideal for companies that are really deep into those verticals and can add communications into their products and then bring them to market with their existing customer base, and so we really like that strategy. Fair enough. And then maybe one for George. You touched on sort of sales overlay in terms of the go-to-market. One of the areas, I guess, we were talking about maybe a year ago, maybe a little longer, with the BPO market, and so the opportunity to create solutions for BPO players that were much more flexible that could tie in to like work-from-home type of situation like JetBlue leverages, things like that, just wondering if that's still part of the go-to-market, that sort of small sort of back burner? How should we think about that space? Because it is, sort of on a unit and usage basis, a fairly significant market from a call volume perspective. So just trying to think about any updated thoughts you guys have in that space. Yes, I mean I think -- thanks for the question. I wouldn't say it's a central part of the strategy, but it's certainly part of the vision of what we're working on, especially as we double down on the contact center space with Flex. And I think that it's definitely in the purview of -- or in the scope of what we're looking at as part of the -- especially the Twilio Build program. So I think that's probably the right way to characterize it, something -- a market we're interested in. I think we have an opportunity there. But I don't think it's front and center. I wouldn't characterize it as front and center. I think we just have such a big opportunity in the contact center space, and I think that's just part of it is for us. Your next question comes from Catharine Trebnick from Dougherty. Could you discuss a little bit of the competitive landscape and what you're seeing in the core SMS and voice piece of it? Thanks, Catharine. This is George. Honestly, we haven't seen any change. Landscape, it's still very fragmented, and we didn't also see a big delta in this quarter. Your next question comes from Pat Walravens from JMP Securities. So I have 2. My first one, Jeff, I think it's probably for you, which is, is e-mail something that you feel Twilio should offer natively at some point? And how do you start to think about that, the pros and cons? And then I'll just throw the second question out now, any update on the CFO search? Maybe we're just going to get to keep Lee, which should be great. Absolutely. On the first part of your question in terms of e-mail, we listen to our customers when we hear what they're asking for, and we've been very pleased with the channels and we've also -- we have heard customers at times e-mail as a part of their strategy, and that's why we announced a partnership a couple of years ago now, I believe, with SendGrid to actually make e-mail available in parts of Twilio's product. And so yes, we're really excited about that. And I think the second part of your question was regarding Lee? Yes. Yes. So the CFO search? Right, yes, the CFO search. CFO search is going well. We're meeting candidates. We -- I'm very thankful for Lee for being here for an extended period for a smooth transition. And so we've had the luxury of meeting a number of candidates and finding the right candidate for the role to take us to the next scale we're going to. So I feel really good about the search, and I'm also very appreciative of Lee to give us the time to be able to [ have more room to research ] to find the next person for the job. Your next question is from Mike Latimore from Northland Securities. This is Bailey calling on for Mike, a few questions. I'm just wondering how many beta customers you have currently on Flex and if you can share what the average size of these are. Mike (sic) [ Bailey ], this is George. So we're not disclosing the number of participants in the beta program, but we certainly are oversubscribed, I'll say this, and we have recently opened up the program to take in more people because we've seen such demand for it. In terms of the average size, we've said that we're focused on the enterprise space as kind of our initial starting point, and we definitely have seen the majority of the beta customers falling into that category of the enterprise seat level, 1,000-plus seats. Got you, great. And I guess, do you envision the pricing for Flex averaging less than a typical cloud contact center service would? And I guess the next question would be, would it be transaction-based or more of a SaaS model? Yes. Well, we are still finalizing the pricing as we work with our customers. The way we look at it, we are targeting some of the most demanding contact centers that are out there, some of the largest, with the most customization requirements of the contact center market that are out there. And so as we look at customers, we're not trying to be the lowest cost contact center out there, we're trying to be a very sophisticated solution for some of the most demanding customers that are out there. But we're going to finalize that pricing, and we'll be announcing it in the not too distant future. The pricing for Flex will have 2 components to it. There's a software component to it. So all the things that make the contact center function in all the ways that you want a contact center function, but there's also a component which is the connectivity. So if you're a voice contact center, that will also drive voice minutes on our platform. If it's an SMS-based contact center, drive SMS usage on our platform. But there's really 2 parts of those contact centers depending on what channels they deploy, whether it'd be a more usage-based revenue-driven on the platform side, but it's always going to be software-driven. And as far as the exact software model that we're planning to price it for, we're still finalizing that with customers. But obviously, we want to make Twilio Flex something that is aligned with what customers want and gives them flexibility in how they adopt it. And Twilio has always done well to try to lower barriers for companies to adopt Twilio, and so I think we'll probably do something in Flex that also makes it easy for customers to get started. Your next question comes from Will Power from Baird. I guess a couple more questions to throw in. I guess first, it'd be great if you could help us frame how to think about the WhatsApp API opportunity. Is that something customers were asking for? How do we think about the revenue opportunity over time? And I guess I'd be curious if there are any learnings, parallels, with Facebook Messenger there? And then my second question, you've got more cash on the books now. How do we think about use of that, maybe any parameters around how you might think about any M&A interest with that? Yes, thank you, Will. Yes, thanks for the question about WhatsApp as well. We're obviously excited to announce that last week. As we noted on previous calls that with other channel launches like Facebook Messenger, we believe that the continued fragmentation of the communications landscape presents a challenge as if -- how do I keep up and talk to my customers where they want to be reached, right? So our customers' businesses have that challenge, and we see a great opportunity for Twilio to help them to navigate this complex and rapidly changing landscape. WhatsApp is a bit different given its prevalence globally, there are parts of the world where WhatsApp dominates over means like SMS, and that means that any users are really predisposed toward WhatsApp and against SMS on how they want to communicate, either cost or reliability in those regions of the world. So I think that our ability to now service those regions of the world with their preferred means of communication will open up new opportunities for us in those markets. And so really exciting -- we're really excited to help our customers serve their customers now even better in some of these regions of the world where WhatsApp is the dominant form of communications. And I think there's a second part of your question? Yes, just around use of cash. Now that you've got more cash on the books, maybe any thoughts around M&A interest, how you might think about that? Yes, this is Lee, I'll jump in. So yes, we feel really good about the strength of our balance sheet, both our existing cash balance and adding the convertible. And really, we look at that as a way to accelerate our road map. So we're at the early stages of a big opportunity, and if there'd be some M&A opportunities down the road that could accelerate the road map or if it's a really strong team that could help move us forward, those are the type of things we'd be looking at going forward. Your next question comes from Brent Bracelin from KeyBanc. I guess, Jeff, for you, I was wondering if you could weigh in just on AI and machine learning. We've obviously been talking about this as a new kind of differentiator for the last 1 year, 1.5 years. What are you seeing from a customer interest standpoint, activity, new app development, leveraging some of your AI functionality? Obviously, you have the Google Contact Center kind of AI functionality to work with as well. But what are you seeing, let's say, over the last 6 months versus kind of what you expected on the AI front? Yes. Thanks, Brent. I mean, I think that AI will ultimately be seen is really the major driver of technological change for the next 10 years. I think I look back to the mid-'80s, you kind of had the decade of the PC being the driver of technological progress. But in the mid-'90s, it became the Internet and Web. We had 10 years of massive growth there. In the mid-2000s, we have mobile being the major driver. And now here out in mid-'22s, I think that AI is going to be a major driver of business progress for the next 10 years, and so we're really excited to be investing in AI quite a bit. Obviously, we use AI a lot under the hood at Twilio, so how we build and operate the company, things that you don't necessarily see as products, and then we have parts of our product that are actually powered by AI. And so you look at Twilio Understand, for example, it is a product that allows customers to build Natural Language Understanding that spans across many channels, whether it's a customer speaking to them in an IVR where -- we've had IVRs for 20 years, most customers don't love interacting with an IVR honestly because the accuracy rate was not where it needed to be, and that's why people have had, relatively speaking, a fairly bad experience with IVR historically. But I actually believe that machine learning is changing that story quite a bit because the accuracy rates have gone up as well as the free-form cognition that's going on is much higher than it was 10 or 20 years ago. And that is going to change, I think, the experience that people have. And so we're excited to be investing in that. But what's great about Understand is it's not just an IVR solution which, obviously, there's demand for it, but it also works across channels like text. And so you can have SMS conversations or chat conversations with a bot, and we can also power those experiences across some of the newer channels such as Amazon Alexa and Google Home and Siri and things like that. And so we think that the idea that there is one product that you train to build complex models that represent how people ask questions of your business and talk to your business, and then you can deploy those models against many different channels, those channels are constantly changing, so you want to build it once and deploy it everywhere, that's what Twilio Understand does. Now this quarter, we also had the opportunity to work with Google to bring Google's Dialogflow well into Twilio as well. And so Flex is -- Twilio Flex and the contact center, and as Twilio's platform evolve, we'll now be able to easily integrate Google Dialogflow in their services that customers are building on top of Twilio. So we think that part of being a platform is giving customers choices, and so it leads to let customers choose the natural language processing engine and platform that they choose, whether it's for Understand, we've noted that to be the case, but we recognize that's still in beta, or Google Dialogflow or others, we see this as a platform play that letting customers pick the platform of their choice will ultimately get them successful on a platform, and that's what we intend to do. There's a great customer story on the earnings call, in our prepared remarks earlier about Marks & Spencer, who's doing exactly that, like they have built an assistant called [ Connie ]. And here's a fun fact. [ Connie ] was the name of the first switchboard operator at Marks & Spencer, some 75 years ago. And so they named their assistant after Connie and are now using that to power their new IVR experiences with their customers with Twilio and with Google together, right? So we think that's a really powerful combination that is ultimately driving more use cases and the renewed interest, honestly, in this whole area. Who would've thought a few years ago that you'd be naming your IVR, right, giving it a name and a personality and all that. I think that's a testament to the belief that these engines are getting more and more powerful and more and more answer to offload some of the workloads in a way that customers actually like and provides great customer experiences unlike the IVRs of old. And so we're very excited about what Natural Language Understanding can do and, in fact, driving new decisions, new purchase decisions and an upgrading of legacy technology, we think that's a great potential boost for this business. [Operator Instructions] Brian White from Monness, Crespi. My question is on Twilio Build. I'm wondering if you could give us some type of number around the companies participating. And should we expect Build to have an impact in the second half of the year? Or is this more a 2019 event? Brian, thanks for the question. I'm very excited about Twilio Build. It is very early. We just launched the program. And so I would expect that, first of all, I don't -- I think it's a multiyear effort to build a meaningful, significant partner ecosystem, so we're taking a long view on it. And that being said, I think we'll see more impact in 2019 than, obviously, the second half of this year. Then our near-term goal is to focus on -- we're seeing a lot of momentum around Flex, and we're seeing a lot of demand for Flex partnerships. And so we are busy training and enabling people for that. And I think that we're -- our goal is to get the partner support we need to make Flex successful, and I see good traction there and I'm excited about that. So early days but promising signs, and I'm very excited about the opportunity with the team. And Jeff, just on the Twilio Programmable Wireless that became available, I guess, it was in April it went GA, what's the initial take so far? Yes. So if I heard the question right, I think you asked when my mom's birthday is. And it's today, so I wanted to wish my mom a happy birthday. And I think the [ real ] part of the question was about Twilio Wireless? Yes. Sorry, I had to put that in. So we're really excited we got Twilio Wireless to GA this quarter, so we're very excited about that. Wireless is a very exciting product because, as I mentioned earlier, there is so much opportunity in Internet of Things. And one of the things that really excites us that is around the corner for the Wireless is the emergence of some new protocols in the 4.5 and 5G specifications that are specifically designed for the IoT opportunity. And what that's going to do is bring down both the cost and also bring up the battery life of IoT connected devices who are connected to 4G and 5G networks. And so NB-IoT is one of those protocols, Narrowband-IoT. We think these are very exciting because they potentially present a great step change in how this technology is used, of using carrier provider networks as opposed to WiFi or Bluetooth to connect devices very easily, very reliably and now very cost-effectively and for long periods of time on one battery that will provide -- that can drive even more demand for Twilio Wireless. And so we're very excited about that product. It is just in GA this quarter, so it's clearly still in the early days of this product, but it's an exciting product for us in a big market. Your next question comes from Jonathan Kees from Summit Insights. I'll follow instructions and just limit myself to one question, even though I have several questions I would like to ask. I guess the question I'd like to -- I want to ask is, just curious, for the 2 deal that you had, that you won with Flex, were there contact center cloud vendors that were also invited to the RFP process? Or was it all premise? And kudos for the quarter, by the way. This is George. So that particular transaction was against a cloud provider, and -- but most of the other ones you're seeing in the beta program are looking at moving from on-premise solutions. There are no further questions at this time. Thank you for participating in today's conference, you may now disconnect.","we will turn the call over to Greg Kleiner, vice president of Investor Relations and Treasurer . the primary purpose of today's call is to provide you with information regarding our 2018 second quarter performance, in addition to our financial outlook for our 2018 third quarter and full year . forward-looking statements represent our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made .",1.0

My name is Sheryl, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.
I would now turn the call over to Greg Kleiner, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Mr. Kleiner, you may begin. Thank you. Good afternoon everyone. And welcome to Twilio's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call.
Joining me today are Jeff Lawson, our Co-Founder and CEO; George Hu, our COO; Khozema Shipchandler, our incoming CFO; and Lee Kirkpatrick, our outgoing CFO. The primary purpose of today's call is to provide you with information regarding our 2018 third quarter performance in addition to our financial outlook for our 2018 fourth quarter and full year.
Please note that we’ll not be discussing the pending merger of Twilio and SendGrid, as we’ll soon be in the SEC review process of the joint proxy statement prospectus related to the pending transaction. Q&A at the end of the call will be limited to matter related to our third quarter earnings.

I'll now turn the call over to Jeff. Thank you, Greg. Welcome everybody to this quarter’s call. Now before I begin, life handed me the microphone on this Election Day, so I feel it is my responsibility to remind everybody listening to please take the time to go through. Thank you. Now, on with the call.
In Q3, we drove success for our customers once again, which translated into another strong set of financial results. Our relentless focus on innovation and empowering developers continues to resonate in the market, powering our platform business model. And as George will talk to you in a moment, we are adding important new logos and driving deeper relationships with existing customers as well.
The investments we are making in innovation and go-to-market are clearly working. Base revenue, the primary metric we focus on, grew by 68% in the third quarter to more than $154 million; total revenue grew a similar amount to nearly $169 million; core voice and messaging, our largest businesses, continue to fuel our results.
The relationships our go to market team are building with our customers drove our dollar based net expansion rate to 145% in the quarter, as we continue to unlock more and more use cases within our customer base with a growing set of products. As I’ve been discussing throughout the year, our top two priorities for 2018 are to further our push into a strategic software platform for customer engagement through our build out of the Engagement Cloud, and to expand our position as developers' first choice for communications. And coming off our annual Signal Conference last month, we made several advancements in both categories.
At the Engagement Cloud layer, we announced the general availability of our contact center application platform, Flex. Flex was the result of many years of helping customers build-out new contact centers on Twilio, listening to them and learning about the complexities of what they were tackling. An important part of Flex is the workforce optimization or WFO, product that we added through the acquisition of Ytica in the third quarter. We've been working with Ytica for a long time and they have become an integral part of the Flex build out and the success we saw with early customers. Reporting and analytics are key components of any enterprise grade contact center, and we are thrilled to be able to offer this product as a core component of Flex.
At Signal, we had Shopify on stage, describing how they built and launched Flex for more than 1,000 agents in the course of about five months with three developers and two interns behind. We had several more customers commit to Flex pre-launch in the third quarter, and we have many more customers in our pipeline. Of course we have a lot of work to do to make our early customers successful, but I really think we have hit an important market need within a pretty unique offering. For the first time, customers can now have their case and needed to. Flex combines this scalability and reliability of our cloud platform with the ability to programmatically customize every element of the contact center experience. This is a powerful combination, and we believe we've created a fundamentally new way of delivering software value to customers, which will serve us well as we continue to build out the Engagement Cloud over time.
And as we look to grow Flex, particularly in the enterprise, helping our customers process payments in a complaint way is very important to unlocking the full opportunity. How many times has everyone listening today read their credit card number do a contact center operator. More times than I'm sure any of us want to count. But to help support this vision for our customers, we had e two key announcements at Signal, the launch of Twilio  and our PCI certification. Accepting credit card payments over the phone has long been a complex and expensive process but no more. Twilio  allows developers to add one minor code to their application to process payments, while using our programmable voice products, all in a compliant way.
Our launched partner for  is Strike, one of the pioneers in empowering developers around the world to more seamlessly embed payments into their software. The credit information captured securely through pay will be processed on their platform. And we couldn’t have launched pay without our voice platform being PCI certified. For those familiar with the payments industry, PCI or payment card industry certification is a must for any company's processing, transmitting, restoring consumers' credit card information. Until now, companies had to face the complexity of becoming PCI compliant themselves, or use that hardware-based payment processing tool's limited customizability. Our programmable voice product has been granted payment card industry's data security standard, that’s PCI DSS level 1 certification. Meaning that customers can now use our platform to process payments securely without having to do the development or complete the annual audits themselves. All of that has taken care of by our platform. Flex and  together make a great experience for customers.
Another subject on the mind of nearly every enterprise and developer in 2018 is artificial intelligent, AI, and how to harness this technology to create great experiences. To-date, AI and bots have largely been a lot of hype, leading to lots of unfulfilled promises and poor experiences from many consumers. At Signal last year, we announced Understand, our first foray into the machine learning natural language understanding space, to begin our work with customers to unlock this opportunity. And at Signal this year, we launched Autopilot, the next evolution of this product with a natural language understanding engine, a conversational application platform and an omnichannel hub.
What that means is Autopilot is a fully programmable conversational AI platform. We’re building custom bots, IVRs and even home assistant apps. With Autopilot, we’re empowering developers to build bots in real life at scale and with the user experience in mind. This requires conversational logic to enable natural interactions. The ability for developers to use their own data that train their bots to get smarter over time and the intelligence, hand-off the conversation to an agent if needed without losing any of the context. And by the way this needs to happen across all channels, voice, messaging, personal assistance, a difficult task but a common theme across many of our product efforts, really nailing an individual channel is powerful for companies. But the number channels is growing more complex by the day, and enabling developers to build once and deploy across multiple channels is incredibly helpful.
We also had two programmable wireless announcements at Signal. First, the Twilio Super-Sim, expands our efforts to provide global connectivity for our growing list of IoT customers through a single API. We are, in essence, duplicating the approach we took with the Super Network and the build out of our voice and messaging footprint. We added relationships with the Three Group, Singtel and Telefonica, increasing our network reach significantly across Europe, Asia, and Latin America. And we plan to add more overtime. Developers can now, through our software, use one API to optimize the connectivity to local carriers around the world for their devices containing our sim cards. As with voice and messaging before it, this allows our customers to focus on product innovation rather than mobile infrastructure or network access.
We also took an exciting step towards the future of wireless connectivity by launching the nation's first developer platform for the emerging narrowband connectivity market, or NB-IoT in partnership with T-Mobile. We firmly mentioned in the past what we see coming with the NB-IoT and how it has the potential to increase the addressable market for devices exponentially. See, most of the IoT use cases we've seen to-date have been focused on high value items like cars, scooters or freight connected by expensive modems. This market is still emerging and has a ton of exciting development going on. However, the NB-IoT is designed for devices consuming smaller data payloads, think, timestamps or GPS coordinates, status updates, and the like. And because the data consumption is lower, the modems can be cheaper and the power requirements can be substantially lower.
This opens up the potential for a whole new class of devices that; for example, could one for years on a single AA battery and have the lifetime bandwidth consumption easily included in the price of the device. This technology is really going to open up some interesting possibilities for developers in the world and we can't wait to see what they do. We also celebrated a milestone at Signal, the five year anniversary of twilio.org. When we started twilio.org, we set out an ambitious goal of sending 1 billion messages for good over a 10-year timeframe. And through a lot of hard-work and the power of our platform, we accomplished that in just five years. So our new 10 year goal is to have social impact organizations worldwide use the platform to help 1 billion people every single year.
I'm incredibly proud of the work the team has done to-date and the impact we are having on people's lives around the world. And as investors I hope you are as well. Beyond the great work twilio.org is doing, their customers are currently driving more than 1% of Twilio's overall revenue. And this segment is growing even faster than the overall business. So we believe that doing good is also good for business. Overall, Signal was an amazing event once again this year. I always come out of Signal super energized by all of the customer interactions we have, the new faces we get to meet and the opportunities we discover by bringing everyone together.
There are two other things I wanted to touch on briefly, management additions and our new head quarters, both important steps we've taken to prepare us for the future. We announced a couple of weeks ago that after a long and thorough search, Khozema Shipchandler will be joining Twilio as our new CFO. As I have discussed with many of you, the primary attribute we have been looking for was someone with a track record of operational excellence at scale to take us to the next phase of our growth. Khozema has spent more than 20 years at GE in a number of financial leadership roles across several multibillion dollar businesses. Most recently, Khozema was GE's Digital Chief Commercial Officer. Prior to that, he was the CFO and EVP of Corp Dev for GE Digital, the VP of Corporate Audit Staff at GE, as well as the CFO of several other GE divisions. We are thrilled to have him on board.
Also earlier in the quarter, we added Nils Puhlmann as our Chief Trust and Security Officer. Nils is a 20 year veteran of the security industry, having served as the Chief Technology Officer of Endgame and Chief Security Officer at Zynga, Qualys, and Electronic Arts. He also co-founded the cloud security alliance non-profit organization, which promotes the use of best practices for security assurance within cloud computing. You have heard me saying many times that trust is a number one thing we sell and Nils is a great addition to help shape our efforts here going forward.
In terms of our new headquarters, we've already outgrown our current facilities in San Francisco and we will be moving into a new building in 2019, actually the old Salesforce building in Rincon Plaza. We have acquired roughly 2.5 times the square footage we currently have in San Francisco, which will be brought online in phases over the next couple of years to support our growth. There is a lot of great history in that building and I look forward to adding to it.
And while we always have an eye towards the future, we continue to focus on what matters most, making our customers successful. You can see that in our results, as well as in the investments we are making in the future, we are operating in an enormous market, communications at a tipping point in its transformation into software and a market where customers have been miss-served by the incumbents. As I noted at Signal, we are in the early stages of a great communications renaissance. We are investing in its future and we believe customers will continue to award for these efforts.
Now, before I hand this call over to George, I did want to acknowledge Lee's many contributions to Twilio. Lee, you have been instrumental in making Twilio what it is today, and it's been a pleasure working with you for the last 6.5 years. Thank you for everything you've done for the Company over the years, including giving us the time to find such an amazing successor to the legacy you're leaving here at Twilio.
George, let me turn the call over to you for an update on our go to market efforts. Thanks Jeff. I would like to start by also thanking Lee for his tremendous contributions to Twilio. It's been my real pleasure to work with him over the last 18 months, and we will all miss him and we wish him the absolute best for his future.
Now, on to Q3. The go to market team did a great job once again, executing against Twilio's massive opportunity. Our core notion of bringing new customers onto the platform and making existing customers even more successful continues to work quite well. We remain focused on our three core priorities; winning the hearts and minds of developers; increasing our account coverage; and building the foundation for future growth.
Coming up, my second Signal at Twilio, we saw incredible momentum from developers, customers, executives and partners. We moved to a larger venue to accommodate our growing community this year, and our team put on a spectacular event. The reaction from developers to the new product announcements was amazing. We also had our largest ever Superclass a full day developer hands-on training session. In addition to a strong developer turnout, we also had enterprise speakers from companies like FedEx, Domino's, 1800 Flowers, Shopify and more, on the main stage talking about why and what they have built with Twilio.
We also held our first ever creators track, a VIP track to serve our growing community of business executives. At Twilio, we believe executives are doers too. They’re helping to bring the communications renaissance Jeff discussed earlier to their companies. We had more than 100 registrants to this track, who I believe walked away seeing Twilio in a more strategic light. Another new component of Signal this year was our Partner Summit. As I’ve been discussing throughout the year, we are in the midst of building out our partner program, which I believe will be an important driver of our growth in the future. We have several 100 people registered for the Partner Summit, and our main section was standing room only. We are seeing many companies coming from the legacy communications world who want to learn how to transition to the new world of the cloud, and they're making substantial commitments to build this future with us.
Turning back to Q3. We had a number of exciting new deals in the past quarter. As Jeff alluded to, we signed a number of Flex deals in the third quarter, so let’s start there. Flex is a long time customer of Twilio, and we're thrilled to expand that relationship in the past quarter by adding them to the growing list of companies, using Flex to reinvent their customer support experience lift and to deliver a caring experience to all of their constituents, whether it’d be riders, drivers or applicants. And as you saw in scale that 1,000s contact center agents dealing with these three groups of users, all with very different needs, like lost and found, filling, safety and more. In many cases, they have different systems and sources of data for each of these users across a number of disparate channels and interaction points, requiring their agents to look in multiple places to surface the necessary information in order to provide a resolution.
Lyft chose Flex to support their rapidly growing business, because it gave them the freedom to build a truly differentiated and customized omnichannel experience to provide better outcomes faster. Flex can not only bring all of their different channels under one roof, but also becomes the abstraction layer to all of the underlying systems. This enables a more contextual and personalized resolution process for all involved, while also giving Lyft the ability to not only respond to but anticipate and resolve future problems before they surface.
We also signed a large deal with Medallia in the last quarter. Many of you may know Medallia. They are rapidly growing cloud software company, focused on helping companies build better customer and employee experiences. And we’re going to power the SMS channel of their new Medallia conversations product, which help companies gather feedback and interact with customers in real-time to improve their experience as it's unfolding. Our global footprint and highly reliable platform were key to this win.
On the enterprise side, we had a great win at a Fortune 500 financial services firm in the past quarter. You may remember our deal with Morgan Stanley last year. We landed a similar opportunity with another bank who is looking to empower better, and the regulatory compliance communications between their many thousand financial advisors and their clients. Using Twilio, banks can now enable advisors to use their personal phones to text with their clients, while maintaining compliance. We have also signed a new deal with a Fortune 500 medical testing company in Q3. This company is looking to improve their CRM system. And as part of this effort, we'll be using our messaging platform to send SMS notifications for lab work, medication reminders, appointment reminders and more.
So overall, I'm thrilled with the continued momentum the team has been able to deliver, not only with short-term success but also laying the ground work for further success over the long-term. Before I pass the mic over to Lee, I did want to acknowledge the passing of a great friend and long-term colleague of mine, Ron Huddleston, our Chief Partner Officer. For those of you who never had the privilege to know Ron, he was a one-of-a-kind partner leader and one of the most positive, energetic executives I've ever known. Even though Ron was only at Twilio a short time, he made a tremendous impacts by launching our Twilio Build program and hiring an amazing partner team that will continue to carry out his vision. We will all miss him tremendously.
With that, let me pass the mic to Lee to discuss our financial results. Thank you, George and good afternoon everyone. The business continues to perform well in the third quarter as more and more companies are turning to Twilio to help transform the way they engage with their customers.
Revenue growth was strong once again with base revenue growing at 68% year-over-year. Excluding Uber, growth was 70%. The power of our business model was evident in our dollar-based net expansion rate, coming in at 145% or 147% without Uber. Please note that after the fourth quarter, we'll be moving away from the ex-Uber metrics. Overall, our growing list of product innovation, coupled with an expanded presence in the field, continues to drive success with customers. The top 10 active customer accounts contributed 18% of total revenue in Q3 compared to 17% last quarter and 17% in Q3 of 2017. Our top two customers, WhatsApp and Uber, contributed 6% and 4% of total revenue respectively. We had six variable customer accounts in the third quarter.
Gross margins came in above 55% in the third quarter, a bit higher than the range we've seen in the past four quarters. I would remind everyone of the same strategy we have been discussing since the IPO. We remain focused on doing the right things to grow the business long-term rather than maximizing gross margin in the near term. But simply, we are not a gross margin expansion story in the near-term, so expect fluctuations in our gross margin. We continue to see things that could impact our gross margins like product, country and customer mix, network service provider fees, FX and more.
An example of this is an expected change in Q1 2019 in our SMS messaging business through Verizon in the U.S. Previously, Verizon has treated all P2P, or person to person and A2P or application to person, messaging the same. Starting in February, Verizon is planning on creating a new service offering, which will add a quarter of the penny fee per message to all businesses with A2P SMS messaging use cases. This type of thing has happened before. It carries at a similar fee of short term messages a while back. Our short term business continues to grow rapidly and we expect the same in SMS as well, given its effectiveness as a channel.
Operationally, as with the shortcut keys in the past, we’ll be passing the surcharge on to our customers. While it will not impact the gross profit dollars we receive from customers sending SMS message at Verizon subscribers, mathematically, it will impact our gross margin. We estimate approximately 100 basis points drag on a quarterly basis to our corporate gross margins when this goes into effect in February of next year. Nothing like this that impacts the objects of our gross margin but not the reality of our business on a gross profit is a great example of why we’ve not been focused on maximizing gross margin percentage in the near term. For your models, we ended the quarter with 1,274 employees with 24 added through acquisitions. Our international mix of revenue was 26%.
You’ll also notice in the statement of cash flows about $30 million spent on acquisitions in the third quarter. The majority of this was for the Ytica acquisition Jeff mentioned earlier. We also purchased a small company to support our growing programmable wireless efforts. And these acquisitions had a material impact to our top or bottom line results in the third quarter, and expect that to be the case again in the fourth quarter.
Looking forward in the next year, we’re in the midst of our annual planning process so we won’t be providing detailed 2019 guidance at this time. However, I do want to provide some color on a few items. As Jeff mentioned earlier, we’ll be moving into new headquarters starting into the first quarter of 2019. Financially, this will have a couple of impacts; in CapEx, you should expect about $40 million of build out costs with mostly across the next three quarters; at the operating line, the fact that will contain double rent will likely push us close to breakeven on the operating line for Q1; like most of the businesses, we paid these seasonal costs from payroll taxes, 401(k) match payments and the likes in the first quarter of the year; and the actual rent situation will put incremental pressure on operating expenses in Q1.
As this is my last conference call as CFO of Twilio, I want to thank all the customers, employees and investors that I’ve had the pleasure of working with along the way. Twilio is a special place, and Jeff, it’s been an honor to work closely with you and the leadership team over the years. I am incredibly proud to leave the company in such great shape and hand the reins over to Khozema for the next stage of Twilio’s journey. It’s still day one. Thank you everyone. Operator? [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead your line is open. Thanks. Again, you leave us speechless with the great results. So congrats guys. And Lee, thank you to you and Khozema, good luck to you in your role. Although, it doesn’t seem like you need to do much there. Business doing very good. A couple of things, Jeff, maybe you could talk about the diversity of the business activity. I mean, clearly, your guys are executing very well. But help us think about the breadth of your product adoption. We’ve been customers. How much of that is a driver versus your core voice and messaging? And then Lee on your commentary on 1Q and the gross margin, the Verizon impact. Can you help us maybe translate the 1%, I think a quarter of a penny, I think you mentioned. Can you mention that in percent terms? What price increases is it from a percent standpoint? And if you’re passing it to customers, why would there be still a gross margin impact? Ittai, this is Jeff. I'll try to answer and I'll then hand over to Lee. So you've asked about the diversity and it really is strength across the board, both in the customers, the customer segments, the customer sizes as well as in the products. Now, across the customers, we are seeing great use cases at companies big and small, new and old. From our customer standpoint, we see a very strong dollar based net expansion rate 145% this quarter. But we are also doing I think an excellent job bringing new customers as well, but obviously they're earlier in their journey with Twilio.
As far as products go, you do see most of the growth is provided by our core products, voice and messaging, those are our largest revenue items. But we are very excited about products like Flex coming on board and we think in the future will be meaningful driver of revenue as well. But today, it's still largely our core products, voice and messaging, that are driving most of our performance. Lee? So in terms of pricing, it’s a quarter of penny fee on top of our three quarters of list price. And then no impact on gross profit. But since we are passing it through, it impacts both the numerator and denominator. So the gross margin will decrease. Your next question is from Nikolay Beliov of Bank of America. Please go ahead, your line is open. I just wanted to dig a little bit deeper into the expansion rate, and maybe if you can just discuss the continued momentum and the increase here in maybe three buckets. What you're seeing in terms of consumption by large, medium and small enterprises? The second bucket would be the impact from the newer channels. At Signal, Whatsapp seems to be doing well, whether Whatsapp and video are contributing to the increase in the expansion rate here? And lastly, is there more like customer pull beginning to catch on versus you guys pushing in and giving ideas to customers in terms of additional use cases you can drive? This is George. Let me talk about each of those, thanks for the questions. In terms of the net expansion rate, we see that across the board. Honestly, it's not concentrated in small, medium or large customers. We are very excited to see it strong across the board. In terms of the new channels, we definitely see a lot of outside developer interest in new channels and some of them are early for us like Whatsapp. But as Jeff said, the most important driver of our net expansion and growth are the core products.
And then in terms of customer pull versus push, I would say that we consistently have had a lot of customer pull. I don’t think that’s a new thing for us. And if you think about our core strategy, which is to win the hearts and minds of developers; first, those are the ones that are bringing us into customers but they are also the ones that are often dreaming up or tasked with coming up with new ideas and use cases. And so I think that’s what helped to drive the efficiency of our go to market model as to have that developer led customer pull is easier language. And I have a quick question for Lee, if you don’t mind. Lee, Flex, I was just doing the math in terms of the Flex price, software 130 usage, you placed 80% gross margin for software and 55% for usage, Flex should be around 70% gross margin. I was wondering whether that makes sense. And in general, if you can comment whether Flex will be gross margin accretive? Yes, absolutely. So you are thinking about the right way. And your numbers are definitely in the range. Flex, will be accretive on the gross margin basis. Just keep in mind we just went GA this quarter, so it will take time to roll out and have an overall impact. [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy of JP Morgan. Please go ahead your line is open. I wanted to start first a question with Lee. You have been trying to factor in the pipeline I think a little more fully into guidance. And of course the magnitude of upside might be a touch less than it was in Q2. But it's still a lot of upside. I guess I am curious did something in particular surprise to the upside, any particular product, any particular customer segment or usage scenario? And did George Hu's initiatives may be continue to outperform even as you try to factor them in more fully? Yes, I mean we're absolutely thrilled by the performance on the quarter, again, strength of the platform model and the go to market efforts that George has been leading. The strength, which is broad-based across the customer base and as Jeff and George talked about earlier, we’re still working on improving the forecast. This go to market notion is new. But again, we’re just pleased with the results and pleased with the future outlook. And then Jeff I wanted to ask you just regarding the Twilio Super Network. At Signal, there were a bunch of announcements. I think you had announced it now serves more than 90% of the world GDP. There was a comment that it can detect 97% of the network incidents in real time. It's GDPR compliant. I'm just curious do you see much more work to be done to advance the Super Network? Or is that at a point where it's so unique that you can shift your engineering efforts a little more rapidly into some of the newer vectors, like payments and AI and bots and so on and so forth? Please limit your questions to one per person. I will answer your extra questions. The work of the Super Network is truly never done. I mean, the communications -- the global telecommunications network is a very, very complex thing. And if you think about it reaching the world’s population reliably in a cost-effective way is a huge challenge. And so we continue to invest in that, for SMS, for voice, for phone numbers and now also on the programmable wireless side as well with our new Super-Sim. And so we believe that there is always great amount of work that we can do to better serve our customers when listening to the things they need from us that we can invest and build a better Super Network all the time. Your next question comes from the line of Bhavan Suri of William Blair. Please go ahead, your line is open. This question is for all of you, but I’d just love to understand. It’s obviously early days for some of the more recent products. But any early reads -- interest you’re seeing on  the integration with Strike there and Autopilot, any growth there and then any new IoT use cases? Thank you. I think as all of those, yeah,  and Autopilot, I mean these are brand new products we just introduced about 2.5 weeks ago. So -- and obviously still in beta. We just bought them to the market. So, it's too early to say, obviously they're not producing revenue yet as beta products. But on the beta stage, what we do is we work with customers, we see the use cases their building, we understand things we got right, the things that will become the road map, the things we want to add to it or change as everything goes on. So far, I would say, for both of these products, we got fantastic feedback from early customers.
At Signal, both of them had a lot of working sessions with customers where they could meet the products with their hands on, start using them, so far feedback has been great, but obviously there's only a couple of weeks of feedback to-date and it takes time for customers to build on them, deploy them, use them and give us even more feedback as we continue to scale.
I guess, IoT wireless as a product is doing really well. We're really excited. We think that has an enormous opportunity. It is a small part of our revenue today, but obviously the IoT market is a very big one and we think this is a bit early stages of the very large opportunity just the whole IoT market. We're particularly excited to launch the NB-IoT product that we brought to market with T-Mobile at Signal that we announced a couple of weeks ago, because as I've mentioned before on earnings calls the new protocols that are coming online to power even more IoT use cases are very power efficient and very cost efficient.
And if you can bring the cost down for IoT connectivity to connect to the cellular networks, you're always connected, you're not holding the working Wi-Fi and passwords or Bluetooth pairing all the sort of stuff, it's just connected to the network, you have to think about it and if that is extremely cost-efficient and you can purchase the lifetime of connectivity when you buy the device, there's no subscription plans or anything like that, that's going to increase the number of types of devices that can be built as well as battery life.
As I mentioned, if you can get the battery life down to something as always connected to the network and powered on the single AA battery for five years, we can -- that too will change the nature of the kinds of devices that can be brought to market. Prices of connectivity coming down, battery life coming down -- or battery life going up, this is going to rapidly expand the number of things that can be built in the IoT world. So, we are very excited about Twilio. I want to add on a little bit to that from my perspective. Obviously as Jeff said, these products are new, some of them, but I think it's very interesting to see that, for example, the reaction kind of apples to apples over the same time period versus understand last year for Autopilot, for example, I think is much stronger. And I think it really speaks to the power of our, one thing I get excited about in this business is the power of our business model and our product model and customer engagement model that if you look at the energy around Flex that was really based on our learnings from TaskRouter, which is a smaller API and then really bought in something that we're really, really excited about and the same way I think understand involved into Autopilot and we'll see where  and other things evolve over time, but I think the power of an API platform model to identify huge ideas with relatively small investments is something that I think is really unique to our model.
And I think that the evolution you're seeing in the AI front, even as Jeff said, evolution in the wireless front with some of these new announcements, I think, is one of the reasons I'm so optimistic about the potential of this company. Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Congratulations again on another quarter of meaningfully accelerating growth across every metric and I guess I wanted to ask about how we should think about that dollar-based net expansion metric given its expansion here over the last couple of quarters. And what type of rates do you guys think are sustainable or maybe, the intermediate term or the short term? And when will Flex become a meaningful contributor to that metric? Again, that expansion rate is being driven by driving deeper relationships with our customers and product velocity releasing new products. So nothing -- I wouldn't say it's really an inflection point, it's just our business as usual in the power, the platform model. Going forward, longer term right, it's extremely high expansion rate. In the long term, the older cohorts will become larger and they do grow at a less rate than the new cohorts. So over time that will decrease, but we still think it's going to be meaningfully important going forward. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Good afternoon. Thanks. Conversations around Flex coming out of Signal have been notably positive, especially around some implementation times and the pricing model you're providing there. I was hoping you could provide us with an update of around what you're seeing in that market today somewhere around the vision where you're headed and where we are in partner involvement there as well? Well, thanks for the question, Michael. This is George. Yeah, I think Flex is very, very exciting. We've gotten really, really strong feedback from the customers in the beta programs and you've seen that with Shopify and with Lyft now. So I think that's the most important thing. I think that we believe we have a hit product on our hands and what we're doing is building the capacity with the things like our partner ecosystem to support the successful deployment of the product over time. And certainly, while early days in that, I think we are growing the number of certified consultants on the Flex platform, we're making investments there. So I think that you're feeling and you're hearing from the customers and from us, the momentum behind this product, and we're kind of putting every -- we're putting our will behind to make it successful, so we're going to do everything we can to do that. And I think that we are still early, but early signs are very, very promising. Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open. I just wanted to follow up a little bit about Flex adoption and I was just trying to think through, I mean, obviously you've had a phenomenal developer-led model. I'm just wondering how do we see Flex adoption taking hold if you look that ahead? What's the mix do you think look like between developer-led versus partner-led momentum? Thank you. I think that right now -- this is George, again. Right now, the primary driver is developer-led. And I think it's interesting that even after our GA announcements, we had a meaningful inflow of new developer sign-ups for Flex. So the product has been announced in the market for a while, even though pre-GA. So I still think there is a lot of room to run in terms of developer momentum, 90% of the world's contact center infrastructure is still on-premise and I think there's a lot of developers that want to move to the cloud. So I think for -- we're still in the early innings of that, but I think the partner momentum will grow over time. I was very impressed with the turnout in the partner summit at Signal.
And I think one of the reasons was -- probably actually I'm very convinced the reason it was overflowing was because of Flex that there's a lot of partners and resellers that I spoke to that are still serving the legacy world that want to move to the cloud and they see Flex as a very -- not only a great technology fit for what the market needs, but also a very partner-friendly model in terms of the build mentality that's required for the product. So, I think you'll see both grow over time, which one will overtake which one over time, I think it's hard to say. We're just so early. I mean, the product just GA-ed two and a half weeks ago. But I think there's opportunity in both. Your next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open. This is Clarke Jeffries on for Brent. Thank you for taking the question. Coming out of Signal, we've been receiving inbounds from investors trying to understand the IoT opportunity, but I kind of wanted to dig-in in terms of how Flex plays into that. It seems to me that there's a little bit distinct advantage in terms of IoT support granted by the programmability. So I was just wondering, are we already planning for how Flex may be used for internal used cases in terms of supporting organizations with a lot of internal IoT footprint? Yeah. Thanks, Clark. This is Jeff. It's interesting. When we launched Flex back in Q1, actually one of the demos that we gave was in IoT integration, because something we are hearing from customers who are deploying IoT use cases is that when they need support having diagnostics and having data about these devices available to agents is critical. And also having alerts -- basically trigger context interactions coming from those devices is an emerging use case in contact centers. And ones that fixed feature of monolithic applications are just not going to be well suited to solve, because they lack the flexibility.
And so, this is one of the use cases we thought about when we built Flex. And one of the beautiful things about Flex is that, as its name implies, it is completely flexible. And so, emerging workloads around the IoT or things that are specific to the workflows of a company who is deploying IoT and wants to integrate those data payloads or alerts and things like that that are triggering communications to customers, they can build those integrations into Flex pretty easily.
In fact, the work type that occurs inside of Flex, it could be calls and chats, typical interactions you think of in a call center, but Flex has a very flexible notion of what's the type of work in which people need to do as one of the types that we envisioned here was IoT-generated work items. And it actually was one of the demos we used when we launched Flex on stage earlier this year. So I think there is something there that's obviously early both in IoT as well as in Flex, but I think that will be an area that can be interesting as time goes on. Your next question comes from the line of Rishi Jaluria of D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Just really quickly I think one of the exciting things out of Signal -- out of many announcements was just seeing the kind of launch of Twilio  and talking to the people from Stripe who are kind of excited to have this joint sort of product, so to speak. Just going back to talking about the partner ecosystem, is that something that you think you might be able to see with more other software vendors down the line, where there is this joint effort in kind of product development and product launch? Thanks. Yeah. I think that's a great question. And certainly we've partnered with other companies to deliver parts of our solutions in the past. For example, we partnered with Google for speech recognition is a good example of that. I think that with some of our newer technologies, I think that's really opening doors that we hadn't had before. I think I mentioned Flex already is one of them. But even wireless, for example. We've announced partnerships with Singtel and others that we're just not companies that we were working with in the past in this kind of way. So I think that as the footprint, the product footprint broadens, I think it opens many more degrees of freedom in terms of partners for interesting opportunities like Stripe and so on and so forth, which is why I think we've -- and one of the reasons, not primary reason, but one of the reasons why we continue to invest in the partner program in a big way starting this year. Your next question comes from the line of Will Power of Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open. I wonder if you can give us any breakdown between US-based companies and companies based outside the US? Are you seeing similar growth rates across both regions? And any difference in the types of products where you're seeing this kind of growth across different regions? Thanks. So companies headquartered outside of the U.S. was 26% of total revenue and international is growing a bit faster than the US. And we're seeing a usage and strength of our all products in both geographies. Your next question comes from the line of Catharine Trebnick of Dougherty. Please go ahead. Your line is open. More on the partner program. Could you -- how many partners do you have? And how many -- what's your pace for adding on in a particular quarter? And on to that, how long does it really get them to train them up on all the various products? And is one product more popular than the other? So I guess that was more than one question, but I'm just looking for more color around your partner program and the time from when you engage them to revenue. Thank you. So I think that' the partner program -- our partner program has multiple building blocks, if you will, or aspects to it. So I think the answer is dependent on what you're talking about. Obviously for our solution partners companies like Zendesk and others, that's been a business that has been there for a while now and is an important part of our customer base and partner base. And I think that already is, I think, in a good state and will continue to grow that.
For some of our new emotions to that are newer, one is our SIs and for there the big driver of that is Flex that I talked about. We're looking to build an ecosystem without giving exact numbers. We want to have a healthy mid to high double-digit number of partners in the ecosystem in a reasonable amount of time. And with a multiple of that as our certified ecosystem of consultants, and that's just early days. I mean obviously as Twilio continues to grow and Flex continues to grow, those numbers will multiply over time. But I think that's kind of where we're trying to get to in the near term to kind of explore what we see around the opportunity around Flex. And then we are just beginning to lay the foundation today for resellers, which we have really had in very de minimis fashion until this point. And so, I think that's another relatively unexplored opportunity honestly in partners. So I think it's a really exciting time for partners all around. Your next question comes from the line of Pat Walravens of JMP Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open. So George in your years at Salesforce, you saw economic cycle sort of come and go, right? I'm just wondering how you would characterize the macroeconomic and spending environment that you're seeing today? Well, even though I had at an Economics degree, macro is my worst subject. So I'm probably not the best prognosticator of all these kind of things. I will say this which is that obviously given the nature of our business that as companies and as consumers and the general economy is healthy, of course it's going to be a tailwind for our business. And so, we will continue to focus on our core strategy, which is focus on customer engagement, because I think that whether it's up cycles or down cycles the only thing I saw at Salesforce was that, you always had to go back to your customer. If times are good, you had to invest more. If times are tough, you had to be even more focus on your customer to be competitive. So I think that's really is something -- I think it's good to have a business model that your deal is relevant in all cycles and I think that is true in my old company and true in here as well. Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Kees of Summit Insights Group. Please go ahead. Your line is open. I agree with you in terms of taking us down on HP, which is a non-partisan issue. My question is, on -- I guess this partnership with T-Mobile, I guess I wanted to understand it better here. In terms of -- is this something that just limits the developers the Narrowband network with T-Mobile? I mean, I guess, I haven't seen too many of these partnerships more with the carriers. You seem to just aggregate all into the Super Network, where you have -- is anything that you have bunch of carriers there and you talk about them in that, and this is kind of unique in terms of just singling one out and then developing a partnership on their network. Just wondering, are you looking to add to that partnership? How does this went in terms of the developers and what they can do with it? Thanks. Generally, our SMS product and the playbook is going to get started in the United States and expanded over time. And so, I think that's pretty similar here. It's actually also unique kind of time for NB-IoT, because these protocols are just being rolled out now. And so, T-Mobile has just lit up their NB-IoT network here in the United States and we expect other carriers are in the process of doing that or going to be doing that in the coming year around the world.
And as they do it makes sense for us to have a product that allows the developer to build something that works everywhere in the world. But on day one of a product we've announced it in the United States in similar to what we did with our Super-SIM on the not Narrowband side, the broadband side of wireless. We started in the United States with T-Mobile, now we created Super-SIM and we work with other partners around the world, I can imagine the same thing could happen with NB-IoT, but these networks are brand new. Your last question comes from the line of Mike Latimore of Northland Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open. My question is what percent of your Flex deals are replacing the underlying contract center's infrastructure versus adding enhancements to it? And then, what's the process for selling Flex? Is it through the traditional channels like master ones? Can you repeat the second part of your question again? Basically where you sell Flex through traditional channels like you have in the past? So in terms of the first question, we do see a little bit of both. We do see a replacement as well as augmentation. Our larger transactions tend to be replacing some incumbent legacy solution. In terms of the channels, we're selling Flex the same way today that we're selling our other products, which is a little bit self-service, a little bit through our direct to sales team, and then I think what is different about Flex is I think there'll be more of partner opportunity for that going forward and we're definitely seeing a lot of partner demand to do services around Flex and also people that want to resell the product. So, I think there's an opportunity there over time, but that would require us building an infrastructure to support that which we would be in the early days of doing right now. There are no further questions at this time. Thank you for participating in today's conference.

I'll now turn the call over to Jeff. Thank you, Greg. Welcome, everybody, to this quarter's call. I'd like to start by welcoming all of the SendGrid folks, now full-fledged Twilions to the family. We're all incredibly excited to build a future together with all of you.
We had an exceptional Q4 that capped off an incredible year for Twilio. I wanted to take a moment to thank all of the Twilions around the world for all of their incredible accomplishments in 2018, including our R&D teams, moving our innovation forward while scaling our services reliably, as well as our sales and marketing teams, who brought on so many new customers in the year and made our customers widely successful by consistently wearing our customers' shoes, and our G&A teams who helped support the rapid growth of our business; and of course, to all of the Twilions and SendGrid folks who helped make the largest acquisition in the history of our company possible. Thank you. All of your hard work showed again in Q4.
Our core business continued to power strong revenue growth, amplified by a few one-time events, which Khozema will go into later. Both our core products, voice and messaging, continue to generate significant growth and drive our business. And our engagement platform strategy is working well.
It's changing the types of conversations we're having with customers and producing early success with products like Flex. And we've proven our ability to augment our developer-led go-to-market model with a significant sales motion, driving deeper, more strategic relationships with our existing customers and successfully acquiring new customers.
But we're just getting started. From our perspective, we're at the early stages of a complete transformation of communications from its legacy based on physical networks to its future based on software. And in that transition, we see the opportunity to help every company elevate their digital engagement strategy with their customers.
Our developer-first go to market is an efficient way to reach this broad range of companies. And with our platform business model, we see opportunities to power a tremendous range of applications for our customers across almost every customer touch point. And as a platform, we get a front-row seat to learn the major business problems that customers are looking to solve.
This view drives our product roadmap, resulting in products like Flex. That's why we plan to continue to invest across the company to support elevated growth over an extended period of time rather than taking profits in the short term.
Our product priorities coming into 2019 remain consistent with what we've discussed last 2018 but updated to reflect the progress we've made throughout the last year. We are focused on elevating Twilio into the world's leading customer engagement platform and expanding our position as the developers' first choice for communications.
Our engagement platform vision, backed up by the go-to-market team George's organization has been building, is up-leveling our interactions with customers and prospects alike.
For those who are able to attend SIGNAL last year, I hope you noticed the changes from the customer logos to the discussions to the sessions and more. And from a product point of view, the launch of Flex was just the first step of this evolution. The customer reaction to Flex has been tremendous but our journey has just begun.
Empowering developers to build a future has long been the foundation of Twilio, and we will continue our devotion to serving their needs. Obviously, adding e-mail to the platform is part of this strategy, but it's also expanding our efforts to meet developers where they are around the world, making further improvements [for council] [ph] and developer experience and launching a new version of TwilioQuest, our interactive learning system, and more.
There are well over 4 million registered developer accounts across the combined base of Twilio and SendGrid, and we look forward to powering their innovation in the future.
To help drive our efforts to scale the company, we've added to our executive team recently by welcoming Chee Chew as our Chief Product Officer. Chee has spent more than 25 years working at some of the world's leading technology companies like Amazon, Google and Microsoft.
Most recently, Chee was the Vice President of Consumer Engagement at Amazon, responsible for its core shopping experience on the web and mobile apps. Prior to Amazon, Chee was the Vice President of Engineering for Google, responsible for their real-time communications efforts, including Google voice and Google hangouts. His experience across the scope of customer engagement and software development will serve him well in his new role at Twilio.
We also added Donna Dubinsky, a technology industry pioneer, to our Board. Donna is a serial entrepreneur, best known for her role as CEO of both Palm and Handspring, innovators who created the first successful handheld computers and smartphones. Earlier in her career, Donna spent 10 years in sales, sales support and logistics at Apple and at Claris, an Apple software subsidiary.
Donna is currently the CEO of Numenta, where she is focused on reverse engineering the neocortex and applying that knowledge in the creation of machine intelligence. Her experience building leading technology companies will provide valuable insights to our Board discussions.
So to wrap up, we continue to put the right pieces in place to fulfill our mission to fuel the future of communications. As you can see by our results, voice and messaging remain incredibly vibrant markets, and we're thrilled now to add e-mail to the picture.
Between voice, messaging and now e-mail, we have the full breadth of ubiquitously used channels for customer engagement. And the reaction from customers, prospects and developers since our announcement of the SendGrid acquisition has been great. Together, we have more than 140,000 customer accounts, giving us even more visibility into the big, unsolved problems that we can help our customers to solve.
We feel that we have the opportunity to disrupt a massive market and are uniquely positioned to do so, collapsing the industry that has been fragmented between carriers, hardware, software and operators.
Our platform of flexible building blocks is much more powerful to customers, allowing them to both reinvent existing use cases and create entirely new ones. Learning from our customers who are building on the core components of our platform, now including e-mail as well, will help inform this future. This is just the beginning, and we are investing to accelerate our engagement platform vision for our customers.
Now in addition to adding Chee and Donna to the leadership of Twilio, we also added another fantastic executive to the team, Sameer Dholakia, the CEO of SendGrid.
So Sameer, let me turn the call over to you for some thoughts on our future together. Thanks, Jeff, and I'm so proud to be joining the leadership team and this extraordinary company.
One of most important aspects of making combinations like this successful is the people dimension and how the individuals feel about the cultural fit and shared values between the two companies. And I can say, speaking for all of the SendGrid folks, we are incredibly excited to work arm-in-arm with our new team mates.
While we won't to be reporting our standalone SendGrid Q4 results in full detail, I'm happy to report that we had another strong quarter of growth across the business, producing revenue of $41 million. More importantly, we've been hard at work planning for our future together.
One of the many reasons that led us down this acquisition path is the conversations we've had over the years with customers looking to create an integrated communications platform, serving the full scope of their customer engagement requirements. We've had a number of exciting discussions with customers and prospects about this potential once their platforms are combined.
A great example of this is a Fortune 100 retailer who spoke at our opening kick-off in January. They happen to be a joint customer of both companies and foresee a future where Twilio is the foundation of their customer engagement platform across all channels, letting their end customers choose their preferred method of communication for every interaction.
It's clear to me that both companies are kindred spirits in so many ways. We have an opportunity to help companies around the world to engage with their end customers in a whole new way.
To all of the former SendGrid shareholders who have supported us thus far in our journey, thank you. Thank you for your confidence in us along the way. I'm so looking forward to the next chapter as part of Twilio as we're still at Day 1 of this extraordinary opportunity.
George, let me turn the call over to you. Thanks, Sameer. We're excited to start this journey together as well. We've also been having many of the same conversations with our customers in the past few months. Our joint efforts in the field have just begun, but I look forward to what we can deliver in 2019 and beyond.
Let me touch on 2018 as a whole before to talking about the road ahead. 2018 was a tremendous year for the go-to-market team, and our investments produced tangible results. Our developer team attended more than 300 events across 20 countries in 2018, driving awareness in the developer community that fuels our business.
We held Engage at superclass events in 15 cities around the world, bringing Twilio to a new broader audience, including builders within the broader business community. We added significantly to our coverage while continuing to deliver strong results.
We launched our Twilio Build program, establishing the foundations of our partner programs that we believe will help to amplify our business in the future. And we held our biggest SIGNAL ever. Quite a year.
In the fourth quarter in particular, we were very pleased with the results and the continued momentum of the business. One of the focus areas for our go-to-market investments has been further penetrating the traditional enterprise, and our team closed a number of new deals in Q4.
Ecolab will be using our Programmable Messaging product as part of a strategic initiative focused on strengthening the productivity of their field service team. They'll be using our platform to send alerts and notifications to the field service team when customer requests come through with their contact center.
Also, STANLEY Infrastructure will be using our Programmable Video product to empower their support technicians for their distribution channel to video chat with end users.
This feature will be built directly into their mobile app, allowing remote technicians to show issues with equipment, diagnose problems and identify broken parts. The video will also be recorded for training purposes.
We're, of course, also very excited about the GA of Flex and the reaction we're getting in the market from customers and prospects. The product launch has now enabled the broader sales force to start working on deals.
We closed more early adopters in this past quarter as well. One great example was 1,000 seat deployment at a leading software company. This customer will be moving off of their legacy provider onto Flex while taking advantage of some of our new products like Autopilot and  to provide a better experience for their customers.
Another Flex win from Q4 was ezCater, an online marketplace that helps businesspeople order office catering from more than 60,000 restaurants across the United States.
This deal was yet another great example of where developers were involved from the beginning to the end of the process. ezCater's journey with Flex began when a few of the developers attended one of our Engage sessions in Boston to learn more about our platform.
ezCater runs a complicated contact center attempting to coordinate food suppliers, buyers and drivers through a white glove service interaction, and they found their existing provider wasn't able to support their needs as they grew. Flex is helping them to build a solution they needed to scale their business and serve their growing customer base.
And we're also seeing continued success with industry disruptors with our core products. A great example is a Programmable Voice deal we did in the quarter with GoDaddy, a company that empowers everyday entrepreneurs with 18 million customers worldwide.
One of the products they offer to support their community is an app called SmartLine that allows customers to easily add a second phone number to their cell phones, keeping their business and personal identity separate. GoDaddy will be utilizing our platform to support the SmartLine application both here in the U.S. as well as around the world.
We also entered into a new relationship with E*TRADE in Q4. E*TRADE sends a wide variety of messages to their customers from transaction notifications, to price alerts to news and so on. They'll be using our Programmable Messaging products for their SMS alerting option for our customers.
All in all, another great job by the go-to-market team in Q4. We continue to invest in the strategy that we've been laying out, more account coverage and increasing our bets in the enterprise with partners and internationally.
To drive our Twilio Build partner strategy going forward, we promoted Chetan Chaudhary, a Twilio veteran with an extensive background in building channel programs, to Global VP of Partners.
We're also planning to increase our account coverage again this year, including outside the U.S. because of the remarkable opportunity we see globally. In EMEA, we've hired David Parry-Jones, formerly of VMware and Microsoft, as Regional VP of EMEA, to lead our sales efforts and increase our account coverage in the region.
We saw tremendous success in APAC last year, so we're adding to that team as well. And on top of that, our plan to capitalize on the combined power of existing SendGrid and Twilio customers and products as well as developing new relationships, we have an amazing opportunity ahead of us in 2019 and the years to come.
With that, let me pass the mic to Khozema to discuss our financial results. Thank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm thrilled to have joined such an amazing company at a pivotal point in its history as we rapidly approach our first $1 billion in annual revenue. I look forward to interacting to many of you on the call today and the coming years. Let's dive into some of the highlights.
Q4 was an extraordinary quarter with base revenue growing 77% year-over-year. Our products are resonating with customers, and our go-to-market investments continue to work well. These results were driven once again by the success we are creating within our customer base with our dollar-based net expansion rate coming in at 147%.
As we previously indicated, this is the last quarter where we will be providing the ex Uber versions of both these metrics. So if you have them for your models, the ex Uber stats for both were 79% and 148%, respectively.
And while the majority of our base revenue growth came from the normal drivers of our business, we did have two items that amplified our Q4 results: First, we saw significant seasonal spending ramp from a large international customer that we added earlier in 2018; Second, we saw positive impact related to the midterm elections in the U.S. Combined, the two items added roughly 10 points to our year-over-year growth in Q4.
As you think about the impact from these 2 items into 2019, the spending levels from that international customer I mentioned have returned to more normalized levels in Q1, and the election-related spend obviously won't reoccur this year.
The top 10 active customer accounts contributed 20% of total revenue in Q4 compared to 18% last quarter and 17% in Q4 2017. We had 6 variable customer accounts in the fourth quarter once again.
Gross margins came in at 54% in the fourth quarter, in the range of recent quarters. The change in the sequential basis was driven largely by some elevated activity in lower-margin regions internationally and some end-of-year cleanup and software capitalization. Looking forward, simply put, you should continue to expect some fluctuations in our underlying gross margins.
Adding SendGrid to the mix will obviously provide an upward lift in the short term but our priorities remain the same. We are focused on growing the business around the world rather than maximizing gross margins in the near term.
We continue to see things that could impact our gross margins like product, country and customer mix, network service provider fees, foreign exchange and more.
So let me turn to guidance for a moment and how SendGrid folds into the picture. You can see the guidance for the combined company in the release. Note that all of SendGrid's revenue will fall into our base revenue category.
As the acquisition closed on February 1, we will be getting 2 months of contribution from SendGrid in our Q1 and 11 months in our 2019 results. This equates to roughly a $27 million to $28 million contribution to our Q1 revenue guidance and roughly a $168 million to $170 million revenue contribution to our full year revenue guidance.
So if you normalize for the full 12 months of 2019 in rough numbers, this guidance equates to about 45% organic year-over-year growth for Twilio-only base revenue and about 25% organic year-over-year growth for SendGrid or over 40% organic year-over-year growth for what will be the combined base revenue category going forward.
It's also worth spending a moment on our business plan overall and our philosophy for operating profitability in 2019.
As mentioned in prior calls, the focus of the company, given our leadership position in the early stage of this market, remains on the reinvesting of the business to drive revenue growth.
We plan to hire aggressively across sales and marketing and R&D, along with the G&A to support these groups in the coming year, which we believe will continue to drive elevated growth outcomes in the years to come.
In 2019, we expect these investments will result in a modest level of non-GAAP operating profit on a quarterly basis once we get past Q1. One other thing to note that's new in our guidance this year is an assumed non-GAAP tax rate of 25%.
So in summary, the fourth quarter results were very strong across a number of fronts, and we have a tremendous opportunity in front of us. We plan to invest appropriately to expand our presence around the world and drive our growth going forward.
Thank you, everyone. Operator? [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Alex Zukin from Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on another really strong quarter. Maybe the first one just for George, as we start to come to the anniversary of the some of the sales changes you put in place last year that involved slightly higher touch with potential accounts in the enterprise can you speak to the benefits you believe that you've seen in your dollar-based net expansion metric?
And then how might we be thinking about that metric going forward, for Khozema, and how does SendGrid folding into the business impact that metric as well? And then I've got a quick follow-up. Thanks, Alex. I'll answer the first half of that question. We feel very good about the strategy of increasing our coverage to work more closely with our customers. I think you are seeing that in the results of the revenue growth as well as the net expansion.
And we've seen lots of things, like we've talked about the Lyft Flex transaction, for example, coming out of just really providing a higher touch on that account is a great example. So we did execute that strategy.
And I'm very excited about the opportunity going forward because I think we've just begun -- really still beginning to work with [key 2K] [ph] customers and international customers, partners. I still think there's a world of opportunity ahead of us to work more closely with our customers and grow those accounts. And I think, Alex, just for the second part of your question there, we don't guide specifically on expansion rate. But I think as you can see from the comments that I made already about organic growth just based on our guidance, SendGrid is going to lower that number a little bit.
But I think just in general, we see really strong expansion rates going forward, and the business model and what George and his team's been able to do is working really well. Perfect, and just a quick follow-up. You mentioned some of the service provider fees, I think, before you've spoken a little bit about some of the fees from Verizon that go into effect in fiscal '19. Could you maybe talk about how that actually applies to -- what kind of tailwind that's going to be to revenues in fiscal '19, and how we should think about those mechanics also on a gross margin basis and how you see it evolving? Yes, of course. So Verizon is a little bit delayed, and it's unclear exactly when that's going to come in to play for the year. And so what we've done is fully remove any revenue impact from our forward guidance. Perfect. Thank you. Sure. Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Turrin from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Hey, great. Thanks, guys for taking my questions. With SendGrid, look, now that the deal's closed, I was hoping we could talk about maybe some of the initial low-hanging fruit you see with that opportunity and maybe what folding SendGrid into the Twilio go-to-market engine could do for that business over time as well. Yes, this is Sameer. Thanks for the question. And we're certainly very excited about the opportunity. I think there are lots of things that George and the go-to-market team here at Twilio have done with Twilio's go to market in 2018 that have every bit of opportunity for us to replicate.
So putting another market-leading API product into the bag of a very talented go-to-market team, we think, is going to be very exciting, both for new customers and our existing installed base. This is George. We're keeping off our campaigns now to market each other's products to their respective customer bases. And I think we're very excited to see the demand that comes from that, and interest that comes from that.
We -- I know our sales teams are very, very excited to sell the combined product sets, and it is -- that message is resonating with customers. So I think we're going to go hard at the opportunity. That's great. And then quickly, can we just touch on the Engagement Cloud today? Is there a way to think about customer adoption today versus where it was this time last year?
And without giving anything from your playbook going forward away, is there a way for us to think about the extensibility across additional use cases there over time? This is Jeff. I'll take the question. As we think about that Engagement Cloud, Flex is really our anchor tenant of the Engagement Cloud. And Flex didn't even exist 1 year ago. And in fact, we just introduced it early last year. We GA-ed it in Q4 at our big conference, so it's still a very new product for us. It's been well received by customers and the market, so we think it's got a good opportunity ahead of it.
But it is early days for that product having just GA-ed it. And our early customers are happy, and we look forward to getting many more customers onto the product over time.
But I'll also point out that with our core products of voice, messaging and our e-mail growing so nicely in such a large revenue size that the impact of the Engagement Cloud and Flex as a percentage of that total is going to take some time to catch up, obviously.
We're optimistic about Flex, we think it's for a fantastic product, and customers are excited by it as well. So there's a great opportunity there, but it's the early stages. Appreciate the color there. Thanks. Congrats on the strong results and year, guys. Thank you, Michael. Thank you. Our next question is from Nikolay Beliov from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. And congratulations on results. Can you give us a sense of the blended gross margins for 2019 as well as the guidance numbers for Twilio, how you're talking about 5, 6 years [ph] to make sure all models are aligned here. And secondly, when you think about free cash flow breakeven, I'm just wondering now with the combined models would you give us an update on [indiscernible]? Nikolay, I'm sorry, we didn't catch any of that. Your line is not coming through clearly. Not powered by Twilio. Not powered by Twilio, not coming through clearly. Can you try again? I was talking about blended gross margins for 2019, how [Technical Difficulty] And when will you be cash flow breakeven going … I think we got part of that about blended gross margins for 2019. Do you want to talk about gross margins going forward, Khozema? Yes. So we'll try on basis of what we heard. So the way that we're thinking about gross margins going forward is, is that we expect to land somewhere around the mid-50s. Obviously, with the addition of SendGrid to the mix, that will give us a little bit of a lift based on where we were from kind of a Twilio without SendGrid, and now, Twilio with SendGrid.
And so as we move through the year, we continue to expect to hang around sort of mid-50s. And then over the long term, obviously, we want to continue what [indiscernible] and are committed to do so in the long term to something that's approaching 60s. My second question was around breakeven on free cash flow margin. Nikolay, we're going to have to chat afterwards. We're having a really hard time hearing you. Thank you. Our next question is from Bhavan Suri from William Blair. Your line is now open. Hey, guys. Can you hear me okay? Yes. Good, All right, great. Congrats, really nice job. I guess I want to follow up a little bit on the SendGrid side, so maybe a quick question for Sameer here. You've done a really nice job with the enterprise team at Twilio with George. George, a nice job. And sort of -- if you think about where e-mail is headed as part of the enterprise play -- I think Sameer and Yancey, there was a talk about maybe augmenting the enterprise team at SendGrid.
Do you think that, that's a sales force that you'll leverage with Twilio folks in this relationship? Or do think it's a separate set of investments you need to make to keep those two machines working in parallel? How should we think about how this is going to play out over the next, say, 12, 24 months? Yes. Thanks, Bhavan. Yes -- no, I absolutely believe we're going to be leveraging the existing Twilio go-to-market engine and field sales force. We want to speak to the market with one voice about the incredible opportunity. And what we keep hearing from customers is they really do want one integrated communications platform. So we're going to have one sales force that's out there taking that message to market. Got it, got it. That's really helpful. And I guess one of the other questions I had is, as you think about sort of pricing power, the dynamics are interesting on the two businesses. In the one you are sort of a premium-price player at SendGrid, and the opportunity to raise pricing existed.
Twilio, obviously, on the course of just voice and text, that's been a business where the incoming [ph] volume, there's been some pressure over there. And then with the software piece, obviously, there's some pricing power, obviously, with that and Flex and things like that.
And maybe this is for all of you or whomever, but strategically, now as a combined entity, if we were to think about the blended price, do you think you have pricing power? Or do you think at this point it's stable? How do you guys think of that from a 3- to 5-year strategic process? Thank you. This is George. I think our focus is on creating -- delivering software value that takes advantage of having multiple channels. And we think that long term we're going to drive margin and higher customer count value, and frankly, just more stickiness with customers by working on that. So we're hard at work at that and that's a key part of our integration strategy. Got it. Thanks, guys for answering my questions and congrats. Thank you. Our next question is from Brent Bracelin from KeyBanc. Your line is now open. Thank you. One here for George or Jeff, and then one follow-up for Sameer. I wanted to drill back down into the base business. If I even take out the seasonal election benefit of $10 million, it looks like the average revenue per customer continues to grow at this 25% to 30% rate.
I guess my question specifically is what's driving that? Is there a handful of customers that are skewing that consumption rate higher? Is it broad-based? Are you seeing just improving sales productivity? Any color to help explain the strength even after adjusting for the seasonal election benefit. Yes, this is George. So the simple answer is it's broad-based growth. It's -- we see strong growth both in our largest customers as well as our long-tail customers. And I think it just really speaks to the amount of interest in the market. I mean, broad-based demand for engaging with customers in new channels and new ways, and we're benefiting from that plus, I think, the efforts of our go-to-market engine. Helpful. And then, Sameer, just as a follow-up here. What's been the customer feedback on the price increase that was implemented here at the low end? And then feedback on -- from some of your larger customers now that you're adding an omnichannel capability? Any color on those two things would be helpful. Thanks. Yes, Brent, no material change at all on churn rates related to the pricing change. Certainly, it's been adopted in the marketplace and recognized SendGrid as the premium provider in the market. So no issues there.
Second, in terms of larger customers, I'd say again, the feedback has been universally positive about the acquisition and the combination of the two market-leading APIs coming together because they've been asking for it.
They know what we can do with it to help them create a new customer engagement platform so they can transform the way they engage with their customers, meet their customers where they want to and how they want to be communicated with. So the reaction from customers has been tremendous. Brent, this is Khozema. One correction based on what you said earlier, if we got the question right, is that the seasonal benefit on the elections wasn't 10 points. It was the elections as well as the international customer we called out. Just wanted to clarify that. Those were the two, okay. Very helpful. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question's from Richard Davis from CG Financial. Your line is now open. Thanks. One kind of just tactical question and one more strategic. Europe is kind of, I guess, leading the world in regulation. Whether that's good or bad, you can argue about it. But I think on September 2019, you're going to have to do this strong authentication for payments and stuff. Are you guys positioned for that?
And then just the second question kind of ties in with just big-picture thinking about how you're going your business and customer engagement. Do you think about this as a vertical play or should we go up a stack?
Or is it -- as outsiders, we're just trying to kind of figure out how this thing plays out because I don't know, it's a pretty big platform so we're just trying figure that out. So two kinds of questions, tactical and strategic. Thanks. Hey, Richard. This is Jeff. I'll take the questions. Our PSD2 requirement in Europe is certainly a potential driver for our Authy business. Authy provides both two-factor authentication as well as identity verification, which are ingredients to how you can solve for the PSD2 requirements for transactions -- large transactions occurring on a bid counter or any purchase. So that is a potential driver for Authy. Cool. And then just how do you think about -- because you're helping guide companies in their kind of customer engagement market, leading them on that kind of end journey. How do you -- is there a way to think about that as outsiders?
I mean, I know you've talked about it, but is there -- should we think about you as kind of moving up, sideways, thoughts? Any additional color would be great. Meaning as it relates to PSD2 or just in general? Yes -- no, no, no. More with the whole Flex and all the other -- the tools in the platform that you're building. Yes, I mean, the reason why we have the customer engagement cloud, right, is customer engagement is the top of mind for just about every single company out there because what is more important than having a great relationship with your customers.
And in a digital era with every company becoming a digital company, how you engage with your customers is about these digital connections. It's about digital communications. And that is what most customers use our platform for, some form of engagement across a part of the customer life cycle.
Whether it is authentication a transaction with PSD2 or customer service or when you're doing sales, when you're marketing with e-mail and SendGrid or when you're doing field service. A number of customers this quarter had field service use cases. There's all these touch points that companies have with their customers.
And in order to compete in today's economy, digital economy, companies have to invest in software and they have to invest in great customer engagement. And I think that is the main driver of why companies of every shape and size in every industry can see Twilio as a solution to one of their biggest, most pressing problems. Perfect. Thank you so much. Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Murphy from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Thank you. This is Pinjalim. Congratulations guys and - on behalf of Mark here. Jeff, we hear a lot about Flex. I guess, that's the flavor nowadays. Everybody talks about Flex, about Twilio, but we don't care much about IoT, while you have been doing slowly a lot of stuff on the IoT side. Could you talk about some real customer use cases where Twilio has been used in IoT. And how do you think about the opportunity in that space? Absolutely. I'd say they use cases for IoT, for Twilio wireless are really there's two major categories here. Number one is the use cases that have leveraged the existing 4G networks, where you typically have relatively expensive modem and a relatively expensive data cost because it's piggy-backing off of these networks that were designed for essentially consumer use cases which are relatively speaking fairly expensive to deploy. Like this was originally built for smartphones.
And so you see things like asset trackers. And we see a lot of use cases in mobility, whether it's automobiles, whether it's fleet tracking of semi-trailers, stuff like that, but also in the micro mobility space, where customers with dockless bike and scooters, track those assets with Twilio wireless.
And so we see a lot of great use cases for the sort of 4G networks in that asset tracking-type category. Now you also have coming down the pipe a new category of use cases based on the narrowband protocols. We announced a new product, Twilio wireless narrowband at SIGNAL last fall, which is a new type of protocol that is a lot cheaper, both to operate the data cost, but also the hardware costs are a lot cheaper.
And what we see is, when you can reduce the cost of the modem that goes into the device substantially and when you can reduce the cost of data substantially, I'm talking about the order of magnitude or more, then that increases the types of devices and the number of devices that are ultimately going to get connected via wireless technologies to the Internet, and so you start to see things like sensors and -- smaller, less expensive.
The device doesn't have to be worth $100,000. If you don't think it's worth tracking, you can take a small sensor that maybe is a $5 sensor and throw a low-cost modem in it and bake the price of a lifetime of conductivity into the purchase price of that device and now have it connected to the Internet from the moment it comes out of the box through when it's already to the end of life.
And that is really exciting because it's a whole new category of use cases that open up for IoT that aren't available when the connectivity costs and the modem costs and all that are as high as they are now, and battery life, too, by the way. The battery life is going to come down massively. You can power a device for a 5-year lifespan of a device with a single AA battery. That's pretty interesting. It opens up brand-new use cases.
So those are the two major categories of IoT use cases that we're starting to see. The narrowband use cases, by the way, brand new. We just announced the product and those narrowband protocols, which are a part of the 5G rollouts that carriers are doing all around the world, those are just starting to come online. But we're way ahead. We've got the first developer platform for narrowband. Awesome. And quickly on the guidance -- on the 2019 guidance, it seems -- revenue guidance, it seems like it implies a lower level of dollar expansion rate that -- than you're used to, I guess. And I understand it's partly because of law of large numbers, but maybe there's some conservatism built in. Well, first of all, has there been maybe change in the guidance philosophy per se?
And second of all, can you help us understand how fast has been the expansion rate for maybe your oldest couple of cohorts going backwards and how that has been trending? Yes, thanks for the question. So let me -- there's a couple of things in there, so let me take them one at a time. So I think just in general, there's been no change in terms of our philosophy on guidance.
We're doing it the same way that we have, and that's been pretty consistent. I would say, just to get in the meat of it, we're coming off a really, really strong year. We feel good about the way that the business is trending into 2019.
And one of the things that's obviously happening is that the comparisons are getting tougher as we go forward and as we get -- become a larger company. It's still relatively earlier in the year, but I would say that as we approach to $1 billion, the growth is going to be harder to maintain at those levels.
And there's just not that many companies that are out there at that size and able to scale as rapidly as we have. And this is really best-in-class growth, if you will, at this scale. Thank you. Our next question is from Catharine Trebnick from Dougherty. Your line is now open. Thank you for taking my question. Great quarter. Are there -- you had discussed about how you're going to invest more into the marketing -- go-to-market strategy. Any particular regions, either North America or around the globe, that you see some of the companies are more aggressively adding Twilio capabilities and use cases than other regions?
And the reason I'm asking the question is a year ago Atlanta really increased in size. You added up to 50 people in the region, up significantly from the year before. So I'm just kind of looking for an idea, by region, what areas do you think are more golden nuggets for you than others? Thanks. That's a great question, Catharine. This is George. So first of all, as I've said previously, the growth we're seeing is fundamentally broad based. And we are investing across the board to capture the opportunity across different geos and segments.
That being said, we are going to -- while we continue to invest in the United States, we're also planning to invest a little more internationally because we see like a huge untapped opportunity there. And then in terms of your specific question around Atlanta, we just continue to diversify our talent base in the company, but I wouldn't read anything into that about where we see our opportunity. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question is from Dmitry Netis from Stephens Inc. your line is now open. Thank you. I wanted to touch quickly on the guidance as well, maybe in a bit the more granular manner. I look at the kind of the SendGrid and Twilio breakdowns you guys gave on the organic basis.
I can appreciate the 45% growth of Twilio heading into '19. That's -- you called it maybe slightly above the market growth rate and you obviously came off of a very strong 2018, growing 68%, 70%. So I get that.
But on the SendGrid side, now that you're combining 2 companies together, to be guiding for 25% organic growth doesn't seem that impressive given you came off of a 30% year in 2018 and you have tons of cross-sell selling synergies on a blended basis.
So just walk me maybe what the market's doing or is this just conservatism on your part? Like why aren't we accelerating kind of organic growth of SendGrid under Twilio umbrella? Yes, thanks for the question. So I would say just to start off, it's very early days in the integration of both companies. And so by definition, we're very, very early in terms of evaluating cross-sell opportunities and things of that nature.
We do feel good about the business. They had a really strong year as well. And at this point in time, we feel really comfortable with the guidance that we're providing for that part of the company. Okay. And maybe to just follow up on the margin side, which kind of goes along hand in hand here with the revenue guidance. You're guiding for -- you called out some continued fluctuation, but you also said sort of not to expect much of an uptick there, kind of mid-50s,
I think, is what you're guiding for the entire year. SendGrid comes in with a 76% margin, so you should be seeing maybe 4 or 5 points of uptick there. Why are you sort of guiding for mid-50s? Like, what's driving that? Yes. I mean, I think as we mentioned in the remarks earlier that SendGrid will obviously help the mix just in terms of providing an upward lift in the short term. I mean, there's a number of variables that go into our gross margins ultimately, things like international, product mix, what have you.
And so I think mid-50s is what we've said consistently since the IPO, and we don't necessarily see any change relative to that which we think has been pretty consistent. Okay. Great. And maybe one more if I could squeeze in for Khozema. You've now been on the job for 4 months. You're tasked with building say, a $10 billion company here. You're sort of scratching $1 billion already. What are the key areas that you're focusing on? And being new to the story, I'd love to hear your thoughts here. So appreciate that feedback. Yes, sure. I mean, I would just say -- to start off with, I mean I'm thrilled to be here, right. It's really a remarkable company. I think we're a truly unique moment in time in terms of the marketplace opportunity that's in front of us, and all the investments that we're making are really geared at maintaining a position of leadership.
More to your point, I think one of the principal dynamics of me joining and why I was selected ultimately is because part of scaling a company is better recognition and putting in the systems, tools and processes that grow with really scaling up an enterprise. And I think -- those are dimensions that I hope to bring to the role. And as we continue growing, we're going to have to continue investing in those areas. Thank you very much. Thank you. Our next question is from Will Power from Baird. Your line is now open. Thank you. Maybe just a question and perhaps a follow-up. Maybe first, probably, for George, just coming back to Flex. I'd love to hear your latest thoughts on go-to-market strategy, what inning you're in, where you are with respect to direct sales, partner relationships to push that product.
It was great to hear that you're already seeing success at the developer channel on that front. So I just would love to kind of understand going forward what the biggest opportunities are to kind of get product out in the market. Yes, that's a great question. So first of all, I'm really excited about the customer reaction to Flex. I think we have fundamentally differentiated products and architecture in the marketplace that is very compelling.
It's a company that I think the value proposition is resonating with the prospects and customers I'm talking to. I think that we are in the very, very early innings in terms -- the product just went GA last quarter.
So we've been laying some groundwork by hiring a team to go after the opportunity as well as building a partner channel. And we've seen some growth in terms of our number of certified partners, consultants, which I think is on par for where we would it expect to be. And we're seeing customer traction as well.
So I think that it's a very exciting time, and I think we have, as I said, a very differentiated product, which I think is really the starting point in any types of endeavor. So I'm very excited about the opportunity. Okay. And do you think -- I mean will it be the developer group be the bigger driver of that going forward or will it be some of these other partnerships that your processes are forming? We've said that our target market for the product is the enterprise, 1,000 agent and up market opportunity because of where -- our customization and kind of tailoring exactly for their business process, value proposition really resonates. And that is exactly where we are squarely focused right now.
So I think that will be a combination of direct sales. Obviously, we'll continue to have developers to bring in some of those companies, but I don't think fundamentally these accounts will be closed self-service. I think they're going to require some investment on our side to go after them and close these transactions. Okay, great. And then just a quick follow-up on the Q4 impacts. A, is there any way to get a split between the two items that were referenced, roughly 50-50 contribution in the Q4 benefit?
And then the second piece is on the international customer and the seasonality associated with that, is there something more one-time-ish in that? Or is that a seasonal impact that we should expect to recur again next year? Yes, good question. The international was slightly larger in terms of the impacts relative to the election, just to answer the first part of the question. And then -- and we viewed it as a bit of a one-time event that transpired into fourth quarter.
I mean it's hard for us to speculate, obviously, in terms of what plays out exactly with the customer next year. We really view it as more of a onetime. But we're certainly not assuming an uptick in our guidance next year based on what transpired in the fourth quarter. Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Latimore from Northland Capital Markets. Your line is now open. I think at one point you had mentioned you might give application services revenue sort of once a year. Do you have that for the fourth quarter or year 2018? We're not going to break it out today. I think it's not necessarily something that we're planning to break out every quarter. What can say is that we're certainly happy with the traction that we're seeing around application services. It's still growing faster sort of on an overall year-over-year basis, and we feel great about where things are headed there. Great. And then can you talk a little bit about -- how often is the sort of CIO getting involved in decision-making now versus a couple of years ago? And when they do get involved, is it more a cost discussion or more around security compliance? Any color around that would be great. I think that historically, Twilio started with the ground-up developer, if you will. And I would say starting a couple of years ago, we started to see a little bit more energy at the VP level and even the CTO level. Now we're starting to see broader-based executive penetration, I think, through our Engage program, our coverage, increased account coverage.
For example, we had a terrific creator summit at SIGNAL this past year which was focused on VP and above titles within our customer accounts. And that was very, very well attended, like well over 100 people at that event. So we're starting to us penetrate more into the higher-level titles. It's not specifically the CIO, I would say.
I mean, honestly, I think it's a lot -- sometimes it's a CTO, sometimes it's a VP of Customer Engagement, sometimes a VP of Customer Service. I think that we're not so much focused on that one title as much as just broadly speaking getting into the business and talking about customer engagement strategy versus a more tactical communications conversation. Thank you. Our next question is from Rishi Jaluria from D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just quickly wanted to get a sense for what sort of traction you've seen with Twilio Build so far, and maybe if there's any noteworthy partners or pilots that you can point to for -- within the quarter or in the pipeline. Yes, this is George. We're definitely on track for our program goals in terms of partners and certified consultants. We're seeing traction with great partners like Proficience [ph], which is a public company. They're investing in Twilio Flex, and we're doing some early transactions with them, for example. So I think good stuff and more to come. All right, great. Thanks, George. Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. Thank you for your participating in today's conference. You may now disconnect.","today's call is to provide you with information regarding our 2018 fourth quarter and full year performance . forward-looking statements represent our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made . if any of these risks or uncertainties materialize or any of our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual company results could differ materially .",0.0

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff. Thank you, Greg. Welcome everybody to this quarter's call. The core components of our platform voice, messaging and now e-mail, drove another quarter of strong performance in Q1. We continue to invest in innovation at all levels of our platforms, empowering developers to help their companies better engage with their customers. And as George will outline in a moment, our go-to-market efforts are performing very well.
Q1 was the first full quarter of general availability for the Flex. The feedback from our early customers has been great. As a developer myself, I know that when introducing a new product, the most important thing is getting the underlying architecture right. And our early customers are telling us that our application platform architecture is right. And we're listening to those customers and building on our roadmap for additional features and functionality based on their feedback.
This is also the first quarter that includes results, albeit only two months from our new Twilio SendGrid division. The early reaction from customers is validating our strategy of powering the future of customer engagement all under one platform. We believe we can create the unquestioned platform of choice for developers and businesses looking to transform their customer engagement now covering all of their most vital communication channels, including email.
From an operational standpoint, our integration plans are on track. The Twilio SendGrid folks have been great, and both teams are eager to learn from each other as we integrate our cultures and build our future together. The go-to-market teams are engaged and we’re seeing signs of early traction in our cross selling motion. One of the many reasons we were attracted to SendGrid was the similarities in our go-to-market model as the developer has always been the focus of both companies approach.
Together, in Q1, we hit an important milestone, 5 million registered developer accounts. The product teams continue to innovate as well, having launched several new services support offerings, as well as announcing support for AMP for email, a new technology being implemented by Google to bring a dynamic and interactive experience to Gmail. And we’re hard at work integrating our backend systems in creating even better customer experience.
We also launched Twilio for Salesforce another prime example of how we’re working to make it even easier for our customers to engage with their customers. Twilio for Salesforce allows businesses to easily add out of the box SMS capabilities, covering everything from one to one personalized interactions, alerts and notifications, campaigns and more, to the existing workloads in Salesforce CRM. Interestingly, this product was originally conceived up by the Twilio.org, the division of Twilio focused on social impact and survey social impact organizations. They saw the opportunity to innovate to the more than 30,000 non-profits that use Salesforce to manage their relationships with constituents, donors and volunteers. We are proud that every part of Twilio, including Twilio.org is focused on innovating for our customers. And when we do, the whole company can benefit.
We quickly noticed that traditional businesses were utilizing the product as well during the beta program. So we were excited to launch the product on the Salesforce AppExchange, and get it in the hands of an even larger audience of potential customers. We also continue to invest in trust throughout the product stack in this quarter as well. As you've heard me say many times, trust is the number one things we sell.
In Q1, our efforts on this front and evident in every layer of the platform, that’s the engagement part there. We launched PSD 2 support in our Authy two factor authentication product. The second payment services directive or PSD2 is a new banking regulation in Europe that requires time based one-time passcodes for all online and over the phone payments above €30. The PSD2 requirement will be a big shift for businesses conducting commerce in Europe, and we stand ready to help them with this transition.
At the programmable communications cloud layer, we continue to support efforts in the industry to combat the spurge of robo calling. If you’re like me, I'm sure you get continual stream of calls from unknown numbers with pre-recorded messages promising a wide variety of wonderful things. It's gotten so bad that if you're anything like me, you go answer the phone you don’t recognize the number, even John Oliver dedicated an entire segment of his show to this subject.
So case of any doubt, we design our platform from the beginning to prevent this type of activity. We do not want this business and we never have. We continue to work actively to deter bad actors from our platform, starting with our terms of service that expressly prohibit this type of activity to platform level take up, like rate limiting, verifications, artificial intelligence and more. We believe transparency is also important. So we launched a free service to allow consumers to look up any number to see where a call is coming from and help report suspected global calling.
Looking into the future, we believe that the next step is to put consumer back in control of their phone through tools to allow consumers to receive only wanted communication from trusted partners. We see a world where every time your phone rings, you can see who's calling, not just the phone number but the name of the personal business and trust in the accuracy of that information. And I knew for a software running on your behalf can decide what to do with the caller types. In this vision, everyone receives the communications they want and none of the ones they don’t. It's your phone and your call. We want to help everyone take back their phone. More to come on this for sure, but we're continuing to innovate on behalf of our customers to help bring about this future.
And our efforts to earn trust also extend to the super network as well. Phone numbers are a key component for many of our customers as they expand around the world. But the regulations governing the use of phone numbers has been different by country, by number type and by how they're used. In many cases, these regulations were written well before companies like Twilio or even Internet itself existed. In order to help our customers adhere to this myriad of regulations around the world, we are working with regulators and national carriers as we build phone number compliance functionality into our platform as an automated service.
We are partnering closely with our customers to support their applications and innovative use cases at global scale, while minimizing the regulatory overhead they have to manage. We believe that by innovating on the regulatory front for our customers, we can allow them to continue to grow rapidly in markets around the world, and this presents yet another opportunity for Twilio to differentiate our products in the eyes of our customers.
So before I hand the call over to George, I wanted to acknowledge the consistent efforts of Twilio around the world to make our customers successful. We have a once in a generation opportunity ahead of us to revolutionize one of the largest markets in all of IT communications, by moving it from its legacy and hardware to its future and software. It's still day one of this journey and I couldn't be more proud of our team and excited about the road ahead. George, let me turn the call over to you for an update on our go to market efforts. Thanks, Jeff. The go-to-market team performed very well again in the first quarter, driving another quarter of strong growth. Our focus remains on adding more coverage and executing on our plans to increase our presence within the enterprise with partners and internationally. We continue to see success with our Engage roadshow programs, bringing developers and businesses together. And we currently plan to more than double the number of events in 2019.
On the international front, we took our first steps to enter Latin America and Japan by hiring new leaders in each geography. We also began to execute on the cross-sell opportunity for Twilio SendGrid in the quarter, certifying reps, building pipeline and closing some early deals across the combined customer basis. Overall, the initial results are encouraging, but we're still very early in this opportunity.
Let me also touch on few of our wins from the past quarter. We signed a significant expansion with JUST EAT in the quarter. JUST EAT is a leading global hybrid marketplace for online food delivery, connecting more than 26 million active consumers and restaurants across 13 countries. This new deal will expand their usage of their voice and messaging products across several new countries and positions us to support their continued success around the world. A leading insurance and support company with more than 100 million customers around the world signed a new deal to modernize their IVR to provide a more conversational customer experience. This company will be using a variety of our products across voice, messaging, task router, autopilot, chat and video, to get customers' answers faster and through the channel that they prefer.
We also signed a new deal with Pit, part of the FREE NOW Group, the ride hailing joint venture of BMW and Daimler. In addition to being available in groups, Pit Is the fastest growing ride hailing app in Latin America, currently available in Peru, Chile, Columbia and Mexico, with more launches to come this year. They will be using our voice and messaging products to communicate with drivers and passengers alike. We added one of the big five banks in Canada as well. With millions of personal banking, business, public sector and institutional clients, this bank will be using a combination of our Authy and messaging products to provide an improved authentication experience for our customers using their online banking platform.
Last but not least, we continue to make progress with Flex, signed a number of deals, including the new relationship with Green Dot. Green Dot is a financial technology leader and bank-holding company with more than 50 million customers across their various products and business lines. Green Dot is looking to reinvent their contact center and create a world-class mobile customer experience. They will be using Flex and autopilot to create a more intelligent and automated way to communicate with their customers. Overall, we continue to see strong results from our go-to-market investments and we will execute on our strategy to reach more developers and businesses, both here and abroad.
With that, let me pass the call over to Khozema to discuss our financial results. Thank you, George and good afternoon everyone. The business showed continued strong growth in the quarter, which at our scale is indicative of the success we're driving for a growing set of customers. Obviously, the acquisition of SendGrid impact some of our metrics this quarters, so let me walk through some of the detail for a moment.
As a reminder, the acquisition closed in February 1st, so we got two months of contribution in Q1. Base revenue was $220.9 million in Q1. It's also worth noting that all of the acquired Twilio SendGrid revenue falls into this category. While we won't be reporting the precise Twilio SendGrid contribution on a go forward basis, their results were consistent with the guidance laid out on the last call.
Breaking those two components apart, the organic growth for Twilio's base revenue was above 60% year-over-year and Twilio SendGrid's organic growth for the sub-period was 30% year-over-year. Our dollar-based net expansion rate was 146% in Q1. These results are a testament to not only the success we're driving for our customers but the performance of George's team driving deeper and more strategic relationships with our existing customers.
Please keep in mind that this metric will not be impacted by the acquisition of SendGrid until we lap to close in Q1 of 2020. We ended the quarter with 154,797 active customer accounts with Twilio SendGrid contributing more than 84,000 to the count. Our top 10 active customer accounts contributed 14% of total revenue in Q1 compared to 20% in Q4, 2018, and 18% in Q1 of 2018.
Gross margins came in a little bit above 58% in Q1 compared to 54% in Q4 of last year. The largest contributor by far was folding in higher margin revenue from Twilio SendGrid, which drove a positive uplift of about 300 basis points. On an organic basis, gross margins also increased a bit sequentially as the base variable mix improved in Q1 and the large international customer that contributed materially to the Q4 results returned to a more normal spending pattern in Q1.
On a go forward basis, the story remains largely the same. You should continue to expect some fluctuations in our underlying gross margins. Our priorities remain the same. We are focused on growing the business around the world but rather than maximizing gross margins in the near term. We continue to see things that could impact our gross margins, like product, country, and customer mix, network service provider fees, FX and more.
And on that note, we recently got some clarity on the Verizon A to P or application to person offering we outlined a few quarters ago. As a reminder, Verizon is establishing the new A to P channel for long code SMS messages that will add a quarter of a penny fee for message to all businesses with A to P SMS messaging use cases. Verizon will be implementing this new offering in mid-May, and we’ll be moving customers over to the new service accordingly. We’ll be passing this fee through to our customers and we do not expect this to impact the gross profit dollar received per message, but it will impact the gross margin percentage.
So for Q2, you should expect about a 50 basis points drag given the mid-quarter change and roughly a 100 basis points drag to our overall gross margin percentage on a go forward basis. This should also add about $3 million to $4 million in revenue per quarter on a go forward basis. This is incorporated in the guidance provides today and added about $8 million to $9 million to our 2019 revenue forecast in total.
In addition, while we don’t any information to share about potential actions by the other U.S. mobile carriers at this point, I think it’s reasonable to assume that the others will implement similar offerings over the course of time. As an example, we saw similar progression in short code segment over the past several years. Given that Verizon has approximately one-third of U.S. mobile subscribers, the similar move by all of the remaining U.S. mobile carriers would result in an additional 200 basis point drag to gross margins in total if and when this scenario plays out. However, we have not assumed anything on this front in the guidance provided in the earnings release today, given the speculative nature of this commentary.
Finally, I wanted to provide some additional color about the quarterly progression of operating income inherent in the guidance we provided today, so you can set your models appropriately. On the non-GAAP operating line, we currently anticipate being slightly profitable in Q2, modestly in the red for Q3 due to our big customer event signal following in August this and then back in the black for Q4. Overall, with the strong results we are seeing, we plan to continue to invest in the growth of our business given the tremendous opportunity ahead of us.
Thank you everyone. Operator? [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Mark Murphy with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Thank you very much, and congratulations. If you can put it into robo-calling, I think that you deserve a Nobel peace prize, so it's great to hear about that. I wanted to start by asking you, it looks like Twilio is going to exceed $1 billion revenue run rate during Q2. And obviously, we understand the law of large numbers is going to start to apply. But does the pipeline currently give you decent line of sight to eventually reaching $2 billion in revenue? Or do you think that these abnormal growth rates can continue all the way to that $2 billion level over time? I mean, obviously, we're not going to guide beyond ‘19. What I would say is that, as you pointed out, we do see the billion dollar run rate certainly in the year. And we feel really good about the results and the momentum of the business right now. I think both numbers do get larger over time. And so I think the growth rates will probably fade a little bit as we get larger and larger. But we continue to make investments in the growth of the business, because we feel like we've got pretty good and elevated multi-year growth outcomes. Your next question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Jeff, on SendGrid, it's great to hear that the integration is moving smoothly. Maybe you can talk about today versus three months ago. How do you feel about the potential realization of the synergies between the two businesses? And then Khozema, maybe you can talk about application services, or any color there on the growth rates and the contribution of those products to revenue? So first of all, we're very happy with the progress so far in the integration despite only being a few months post close. The first thing we're focusing on is getting on-boarding the 500 SendGrid employees, making sure they feel at home at Twillio. Then on the go to market front, we've started to execute the cross-sell motion that we've talked about in the past of selling SMS and the broader messaging product to the email customer base. And even though we're just starting that cross sell and it's going to take some time to manifest, I think our hypotheses there are pretty good. And I think that the idea that customers want one platform strategy and one product that can solve many messaging needs that they have is a good one. Just on the app services that’s not one that we're going to break out every quarter or disclose. I think what we do see is really strong traction there that category is still growing faster than the overall business. And I think what we'll do is probably provide an update in the future here when we cross another one of our interim milestones. Your next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. I wanted to spend a little bit of time on Flex. Jeff, you said a few months ago that this is a year of pipeline build for the most part, that's what we should be expecting. But I was wondering if you could share with us given your comments on it on the call. How was it going versus your expectations? And were you did win in the quarter? You mentioned one deal, in particular. But what are the other solutions they were looking at and what were the reasons that Twilio won? Thank you. I think that the key thing for us, which is as a V1 product is to get architecture right and get the core differences between the usual monolithic app that people bought in the past versus our application platform approach. And the idea that companies and the developers want to take a contact center that’s in the cloud and fully customize it to meet their workflows and to get the efficiencies that making the contact center work exactly as they want it to. That core of the product is correct and that's what the market is telling us based on the excited response that we're getting.
And so as we hear from customers, if you think about the first customers we have, the thing that I'm looking at is those customers are happy and use the product, and the platform approach they that want. And so as far as like other products they're at looking at, I mean some of them are coming from an on-prem legacy world, other companies are -- they're trying to move to the cloud. Sometimes we get net new use cases that they're spinning off like a new channel, like chat is the instance for them to bring in any platform to be the basis for their growth. So there is not one story. But broadly speaking, it's customers coming from the legacy world generally on-prem approach that's where most of the market spend here is and that’s where the most requirements are that really require all that customization. And if you listen to the analysts out there, they say 85% to 90% of the market is still on-prem and not legacy world, and that's the part of the spend that we're going at. Your next question comes from Brent Bracelin with KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open. I wanted to follow-up possibly with the George or Jeff around just the SendGrid opportunity and specifically the cross-selling and where we are at. Obviously, SendGrid brings up pretty large installed base over 80,000 customers. Again, I know it's very early. But where is the locating fruit? What parts of the overall SendGrid base are you targeting? And what been, again very early feedback? So I think we're on track in terms of our pipeline building for the cross-sell. Obviously, we just got started. I think the thing that honestly we are excited about is using the data that we have around what the SendGrid customers are doing, the use cases they're doing. So it would tell us from the focus our go-to-market efforts around obvious opportunities to expand the portfolio. For example, as we see people doing very time sensitive account notification, let's say on email that's great opportunity for us to go in. And I've talked to them about SMS as a better alternative, for example and also vice versa cross-selling email to the Twilio base. So for both directions, we are on track is what I would say in terms of our pipe building for circle. And so I think it's looking good for us versus the plan we set out at the beginning. And any idea on the sales cycle for cross-selling at this point, or again it's just too early to tell? I think you're going to see it -- we're seeing it's varied. We are seeing some quick wins more actually on the email side, but also some of these are going to be just more of our typical sales cycle line. So I think it's going to be very just like for our core business and the sale cycles lines are great. Your next question comes from Michael Turrin with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. I know you've been busy investing continuing to build out the Twilio go-to-market engine. Last year, you called out some go-to-market enhancements, which drove some more pronounced upside on some of the quarterly results. And just wondering if there's anything there, which we should be cognizant of as we're lapping some of those efforts as we move forward throughout the year this year? I think in terms of the go-to-market investments, I think as I said in my prepared remarks, we're continuing to execute the plan. We laid out addition of how we're going to invest in coverage, especially in around enterprise partners and international and all that is continuing to move forward with good performance and strong growth. So I think continued strong growth is the message there. In terms of performance versus expectations, I think we talked about in the past that I think we’re just getting better about understanding impacts of our go to market investments. So I think that’s making us generally speaking better around forecasted impact of it overtime. And then on gross margin, you've provided some useful color there on the prepared remarks. It came in above our expectations for the quarter. Could you talk more about the driver specific to the quarter? And then to recap some of the impacts becoming on throughout the year, it sounds like basis points of headwind from the Verizon A to P for the year. Is that right? So SendGrid is really the large driver in there, it’s about a 300 basis points lift in terms of gross margins. I think the other one that we called out is there's that large international customer that we specifically identified in the fourth quarter that went into a more normalized mode, if you will, in the first quarter. And so we got a little bit of a lift there and then just I think the strength and base in general provided some additional juice. In terms of the balance of the year, I think the way that we see it playing out right now based on what we know is that based on Verizon, we see about a 50 basis points drag here in the coming quarter. Beyond that, just really an interesting transparency we were trying to provide some additional color around what other carriers may or may not knew through the balance of the year and we’ll just have to see how that plays out, but that’s not really factored in our guidance for now. Your next question comes from Nikolay Beliov with Bank of America. Your line is open. One part of the business we have not discussed in a while is the ISV business, an independent software vendor of business, which I believe a couple of years ago was 20% of revenues, growing in line with overall growth rate. Can you please give us an update here to the extent if you can? And as you guys move past the applications stack, how do you handle potential conflict with your own ISV customers? So we continue to work very well with ISV/solution partners. And part of our broad based coverage strategy, I talked about enterprise partners and international, we realized we're squarely in the partner realm. And so we’re growing our team there that’s working with all the ISVs from small startups all the way through strategic ISVs. And I would say that it’s the continued strong growth we see across the board also quite the size of these ISV as well. In terms of the specific question, the second part of your question, I think there is change in what we've stated in the past, which is that Flex applies for customers with the build mindset.
And for customers that want to buy it, buy it off the shelve solutions. We work really well with our exclusion partners that have built Twilio components into their contact center solutions. I think one thing that is a positive sign is we are seeing, we’re getting inquiries from more and more ISVs that are asking about potentially leveraging Flex components into their solutions. I think we’re early days. Those are going to be long conversations but these obviously strict strategic decisions for these companies. But I'm excited to see at least that level of inquiry from ISVs around Flex. Your next question comes from Alex Zukin with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Maybe the first one for Jeff, just as you continue to integrate SendGrid. Can you talk about whether -- where the synergies are from SendGrid's product roadmap towards your application services category? And then I have just a quick follow up on dollar based net expansion for Khozema? First of all, we have services as a technical concept, app services is parts of our products that have pure software component, carrier component, and so technically SendGrid is all into the app services category. But technical definition aside as we defined it ones in Analyst Day few years ago. As a broader strategy, you've got email delivery as an API that softened really nicely with our programmable communications cloud where we have a voice API, SMS API, chat API, video API and now email API. So as all the different channels layer in, including things like Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, the email as a critical part of that story makes a ton of sense. The developers need the API for email just like any of the APIs follows others.
Then at the layer above at the engagement cloud, that's where we see this opportunity to bring application platforms. You take the major application use cases that every company uses to run their business, in front of house of their business and provide them when they use our APIs but accelerate their double uses of play. So that's where new Flex comes in for the contact center side of things. And SendGrid has a product for marketing campaigns that actually works for the marketer in a similar way. And so overtime, I think what you see is the marketing campaigns product that SendGrid already has will become more and more API centric and will be able to have some of the capabilities like you see in the Flex, and start thinking more of an application platform. They originally built it as more of an application itself, and will turn it into more of an application platform so our app developers use it as well.
And so it fits in really nicely with the strategy of the engagement cloud to be the single system that a company can use to manage all this customer touch points on that customer journey, whether it's when you're selling to that customer, marketing to them, servicing them on the field, service them with customer support, there's always touch points companies have that we see companies leveraging Twilio to improve with better communications. And in every one of those categories the possibility of an application platform to accelerate and bring more customers onto our platform exists.
That said our biggest priority in the engagement cloud is making Flex success. And marketing campaigns is already a product, it's in the market and we feel strongly that’s a great product. But for the perspective of the application platform our major focus is on Flex as opposed to a major move in the marketing campaigns product in the short term. And then, Khozema, just on dollar base net extension, the 146% was again very strong in the quarter, particularly versus a year ago period. But on a sequential basis, it was roughly flat, down maybe 1%. Have we reached a new peak in this metric and then how should we expect that to trend through the year at least until we start getting into the SendGrid compares a year from now? I think over time, we do expect it to trend down a little bit. It's not something that we guide to per se. I mean, obviously, at 146 we feel pretty good about the where the figure landed and feel like it's a good testament to the business model. And it has been in the 140s for some time. But I think over time, you are going to see that it does decline a little bit over time just given that these older cohorts in particular are going to become really, really large as a part of the mix. Your next question comes from Bhavan Suri with William Blair. Your line is open. I guess just to touch on the first one, which is as you think about engagement cloud you think about now having email, text and Flex, which are different ways to reach customers and engage with them. How do you think about layering on two pieces, the workflow engine obviously and an orchestration layer. Workflow perspective of the same things that does come through text, come through email certainly that’s a complex process. I want to off load that to a IVRs and call center at some point. And then orchestrating that workflow so the customer deploy that. How are you thinking about deployment of that or the roadmap for that into the product? And is that something customers are asking for today? So as far as like orchestrating there goes and you see out in the studio is a product that companies or customers can use to build those orchestrations out as far as IVRs, or bots or even those logical flows of how the communications work. And as a general story I guess around those types of features, we listen to customers and we hear what customers need us to do, whether they need us to take the platform to make it easier for them to build the customer engagement they. And so for the roadmap of orchestration of work flows like that's what customers are telling us, their biggest pain points are those are things that we consider. But generally speaking, our road map is defined by customer need. And then one more technical question maybe for George here. You've touched on partners and ISVs, but I actually want to touch on the var channel a little bit, which has been really strong for the traditional legacy contact center guys with the var channel for Cisco, Avaya et cetera. Have you see any of them and my assumption is yes, but some color in terms of how many of them any large were working with Flex or start to say maybe we can do more complex interesting things with Flex and account legacy solutions. How is that traction with the var channel to legacy guys going? I'd love to get some color there. Thank you. We definitely are seeing interest from our vars for Flex. Obviously, as I said, we are just generally early days in overall Flex effort. But we're seeing interest right now that we are making some infrastructure plans to enable ourselves to better support this new channel parcel. So it's going to take some work on our side to be able to do all things we'd expect, billing, et cetera to support these guys. But we're seeing enough interest that we're evaluating all that right now, so that's the part that we're doing now. Your next question comes from the Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Understanding that's building your own Flex, but may be just on a go forward basis. Would you intend to offer details around trials going on or hours of free time that are being used? I guess just what metrics do you intend to give to give a sense of what the pipeline is building on Flex? I think, in general I mean it's not something that we're going to provide a lot of forward guidance on, or metrics really until it becomes a more meaningful part of the business. I mean, obviously, we're really excited about the progress in terms of the product and the traction with some early customers. But I think, for now it's just not going to be part of our underlying disclosures in terms of product detail. Your next question comes from Rishi Jaluria with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Going back over to SendGrid, just wanted to understand. I mean, you had a growing business on the email marketing side. And I know there’s a little bit discussion about this before and especially how can you integrate it with flex. But it there potential to bring that technology on to the core text and voice side and create the text and voice marketing API? Thanks. I think what you see is customers want to have one platform and one messaging strategy. And so one of the hypotheses for the acquisition of SendGrid is to be able to take higher level products we have things like Flex or marketing campaigns and have them stand multiple channels. So you see this is a major value proposition already in flex where flex isn’t just a voice product, but it also includes things like chat and SMS, and video, and all the channels that we have, including WhatsApp and Facebook-ing. And so at the engagement cloud layer, one of the key things that customers want is in omni-channel strategy I think for every one of these customer touch points. And I think marketing would be no different. Your next question comes from Jonathan Kees with Summit Insights Group. Your line is open. Just curious as the new features that you released last quarter, the one with Salesforce seems like it’ll be, the most likely to move the needle, and correct me if I'm wrong. I'm just curious in terms of how are you going to approach this here, just the sales. Are you just going to do your traditional method of working with developers, or are you going to work with Salesforce sales teams in terms of going into different customers and getting them to sell the feature going outside of the traditional developers' channel? Thanks. I think from my time at Salesforce, my experience is that you have to push these mostly yourself, but they're Salesforce. They have thousands and thousands of solutions that they are being asked to push every day. So the reality is the most -- the interest in this is the activity that’s going to come from our developers who want to connect Twilio to Salesforce and also through our own go to market channels. I think the good news is that obviously many of the customers we deal with are Salesforce customers, and I think that this connector will have we hope usage and opportunity with deals. So we’re very positive on that but it will come mostly through our distribution channels, not theirs. And if I could just follow up real quick that product is certainly more about your customers right now, so much by Salesforce your small investments that are happening there? Could you just repeat the question, I didn’t hear it very clearly… This product was more developed based on feedback from your customers, like an input from Salesforce… Well, absolutely, this came from our customers, nothing to do with any investment from them… One of the things that I really like about the Twilio for Salesforce product is that it came actually at Twilio.org. And so as you think about every part of Twilio and customers and innovating it's another great example of that. Your next question comes from Catharine Trebnick with Dougherty. Your line is open. You just launched that Twilio SendGrid, the expert service this quarter. Any plans, it looks like there's deep expertise to help out your customer base. Any plans maybe to train those individuals to help with the cross-selling the Twilio products into that customer base? Thank you. We already have worked very closely with the existing SendGrid customer facing teams to train them on identifying cross sell opportunities. This will be a part of it. But probably the main driver will be the existing people in place not the new people we're bringing on to focus on just this part of expert services. So that's where we are right now. Your next question comes from Dmitry Netis - Stephens Inc. Your line is open. Couple of questions one on a lot of the cross-sell questions on SendGrid Twilio or Twilio has been asked. But just curious to see -- and I could appreciate the holistic approach for one collaboration cloud where you have multiple channels. But are there any customers moving to SMS versus the email or vice versa, in those cross sell opportunities that you're chasing? Is there -- can you delineate that at all, or is it about equal impact from one set of customers moving to email from SMS and then vice versa from SMS? I think it's surely there are too many conclusions from the data we have. But we're seeing interest in both directions. I think that the dollar value of the ASPs that we see for the Twilio products are greater than the email product. So our belief is that in the long-term there might be a greater revenue opportunity in that direction but we're seeing interest in both directions. And then secondly, I wanted to follow up on this A to P Verizon disclosure you guys put out as it affects your margin, as well as revenue. And I appreciate being transparent about it and given this framework how to think about it. What I wanted to double click on is actually the revenue impact. If I heard you correctly, you said that this will be a positive impact to revenue in 2019, up about $8 million to $9 million, while a negative impact to margin. So how does that -- what gives you conference, there's a positive impact in revenue? How do you come up with that? Are you assuming any price erosion, price discounts with that or not? If you could double click on that and explain your thinking there that would be super helpful. It's actually much simpler than that. It's literally a pass through fee to our customers and so it carries zero margin. And so just think about it as we're adding the same numbers to the numerator and the denominator and so that's the margin rate drag that has no impact whatsoever on gross profit. But what you expect Khozema that if there is a carrier tax that you're passing through to your customers to customers, particularly the high volume ones might come back to you and ask for a discount? It's not what we've seen. And I think again -- I mean we don't have a lot of experience with it, because we haven't gone through the process yet. But that's not what our expectation of how it will pay out. Your next question comes from Will Power with Baird. Your line is open. This is actually Charlie Erlikh on for Will. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the customer adoption you're seeing in Europe or EMEA, especially since hiring ahead of the EMA business a little while back. Has sales meaningfully picked up in that region since then or is it still little bit too early to tell? Thanks. I think we're very pleased with growth and the traction we're seeing in EMEA since David has taken over. JUST EAT is a great example of that. And I think the best data point I can give you is that we're continuing to add capacity and coverage in EMEA and adding it more aggressively before David joined. S o I think that’s a sign of our belief in the opportunity and the momentum in the market. Your next question comes from Nandan Amladi with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open. You talked a little bit about SendGrid, but I have a platform level question. Given that product has a structurally higher gross margin, presumably you don't have termination fees associated with it. Is there any benefit to physically integrating SendGrid with the rest of Twilio, are there any plans to do that? And how closely will the roadmaps of those two sets of products be aligned? If I understand the question -- actually, I'm not sure I understand the question correctly. Can you repeat it? No I was something asking -- are there plans to integrate the SendGrid code base with the traditional Twilio platform? Is there any real benefit to doing that? And if so, how closely will the future roadmaps be aligned? I think in general we want the product experience of a customer of either Twilio or SendGrid. We want the customer to have a unified and great customer experience. And so in the fullness of time, we want customers to have one account, have one bill and be able to use any of our individual APIs as easily as you might use video or voice or SMS, you can use email, as well as able to use any of the channels in any of the products that we build above the API layer, so an engagement cloud layer. So you should be able to use any of these products seamlessly with one customer account, one bill and one great customers and that's what we're working towards. Your next question comes from Mike Latimore with Northland Capital. Your line is open. As your volumes grow and new verticals open, are you seeing the influence of the CIO on deals increase or does it really still remain heavily developer levered? I think that what we're seeing as we move up stack with Flex and other engagement cloud solutions is more engagement with higher level of decision makers, not just like the CIOs what I would say. I had significant prospects in our office last week, they flew here from Atlanta and they had both their CTO, as well as they actually -- they're actually two heads of products that both had the product in the room and then one developer of course there in too. So I think that continues to speak to our -- I think the uniqueness of our model, continue to bring developer along and that’s a unique asset for us in the sales motion but the people in the room are continually up-leveling. And I think you saw that with our attendance, and our signal, and our VIP track last year. And we’re seeing that lay out in more and more the types of people we're able to engage. But I wouldn’t focus exclusively on the CIOs. And how about the Twilio wireless product, you didn’t mentioned that but how does the pipeline look there? I think that we still have good momentum for the products and I'm glad you asked about it. And it's the product we continue to be excited about and we just continue to build pipeline and our product is on track, so excited about it. There are no further questions at this time. Thank you for participating in today’s conference.

With that, I'll hand it over to you Jeff. Thank you, and welcome to the team Zilli and thanks everyone for being on the call today. We celebrated an important milestone in Q2 crossing the $1 billion annualized revenue run rate with industry-leading growth at our size. I want to thank our customers who place their trust in us and helped us to reach this milestone. And thank you to Twilions around the world for relentlessly focusing on our customer’s success along the way. And while it’s a time to be excited about all the progress we’ve made and joining the exclusive range from cloud software companies that have reached this milestone, we see this as just the beginning.
We have the opportunity to change communications and customer engagement for decades to come. This is day one, and we're just getting started. These results were driven by strength across our core platform. Our developer first approach continues to drive success as every company becomes a software company and looks for new ways to engage with customers across multiple channels. And we believe no one is as well-positioned as Twilio to support companies through this transition.
The second quarter was also our first full quarter with Twilio SendGrid and we’re thrilled with the feedback we’ve heard from customers and the initial traction we are seeing. While it’s obviously still early in our journey together, a few customers are already seeing the value of combining email with SMS for their customer engagement. We couldn't be more excited about the combination of Twilio and SendGrid and the value we're creating for customers around the world.
Just a couple of weeks ago, we introduced the new automation and email testing features within the Twilio SendGrid marketing campaigns product. These new features provide frustration free workflows and integrated tools to build emails across one-time campaigns and transactional emails. Congratulations to the Twilio SendGrid team on continuing to innovate on this product for our customers.
The integration of SendGrid continues to progress well, as we combine our teams and drive to enhance our cross-selling opportunities. While this effort will continue through the remainder of this year, we’ve had some great cross-sell wins already, which George will talk about in a moment. The SendGrid acquisition has been a big event for Twilio, but let’s not forget the other big news story, which is Flex.
Our approach is resonating with many types of customers even in these early days. As we expected, the first implementations of Flex are among digital native companies who are looking to build and more quickly, and we continue to make progress with these great early adopters. We’re also early in numerous sales cycles with larger enterprises that have large existing footprints to augment over price. This is a huge opportunity in a market that is ready for disruption, and Flex has shown tremendous potential as customers have told us that we’re on the right path.
We’re very excited about what’s ahead and we continue to invest in new solutions because customer engagements that drives communications in an area customer’s have shown us is right for innovation. As this innovation is driving significant impact for organizations of all the types as they look to find new ways to engage their customers and improve their customer experience. I'm going to steal a bit of George's thunder here and talk about our relationship with the Veteran Affairs Medical Center, the VA, which we expanded in Q2.
You may recall, we first discussed our work with the VA in Q1 of 2018 as we helped power their vet text platform that sends appointment reminders via SMS to patients. The ROI for the VA has been incredible, driving savings of more than $110 million from the ripple effect of reducing missed appointments such as lost facility time and doctor and nurse time. And because of this great success, the VA expanded its relationship with us in the second quarter with enablement of this new feature open slot management, which dynamically offers and reallocates cancelled and available appointment slots to Veteran patients waiting for an earlier appointment. This feature was tested at small number of occasions locations and is now being rolled out nationally to support veterans across the country.
You know, I bring up this story, and stories like this because this is why we started Twilio by making communications more accessible for developers we are helping customers like the VA modernize, which in turn is saving the government and taxpayers money, while driving better healthcare experience for our veterans. And this is just one example of many, organizations of all sizes and in all industries need to harness the power of communications, and we continue to deliver new ways to bring these companies and their developers into our tent and make them successful on the Twilio platform.
And we're constantly looking for new ways to expose this vast array of companies to our platform, and get them started on the path of innovation. In May, we announced TwilioQuest 3, the next incarnation of our interactive self-paced online learning game, which will be launched next-week at SIGNAL. Inspired by the classics of the 16-bit era, this role-playing game helps developers and non-developers alike, learn the power of code and how easy it is to build apps with Twilio.
To date, more than 44,000 people have signed up for TwilioQuest. Nearly 70,000 objectives have been completed and more than 5 million experience points have been earned by developers who have used TwilioQuest to learn Twilio. We’ve also ramped up our enterprise hackathons, where we go on site at our customers offices to engage more employees and developers and help them build more solutions using the Twilio platform.
In fact, in Q2, we held events that customers like U-Haul and a major airline and we’re already seeing the impact on activity of builders inside those companies and several others. And we’re offering Superclasses, a self-paced day of hands-on technical training where engineers from Twilio product teams come together to teach best practices to our customers. What started at SIGNAL is now part of our engage events around the world, including in Nashville, Chicago, Melbourne, London and more.
In fact, in the second quarter, we hosted developers across nine events along with two online Superclasses bringing this experience to developers we otherwise wouldn’t meet in person. And then of course, we’ll be hosting another Superclasses this year at SIGNAL with coding exercises, presentations, office hours, and the ability to test brand new Twilio products before the release to the public. We’re continuing to expand our reach and bringing organizations of all sizes and all industries onto our platform because from what we can tell, every company can benefit from better communications, and better customer engagement.
I also wanted to give a quick update on the effort to help stop robocalling. I touched a bit on the scourge of robocalling in the last earnings call and the efforts we've taken since inceptions to prevent this type of activity on our platform. Yet robocalling continues to be an issue for all of us. Since our last call the FCC, FTC and Congress have all taken additional steps to help stop unwanted robocalls from reaching consumers.
And we’ve expanded our efforts as well, joining the alliance for telecommunications industry solutions or ATIS, and serving on its board of directors participating in its robocall working groups and supporting the technical solutions like stir shaking. And we'll continue to work with lawmakers’ policymakers and the broader ecosystem to find the right solutions. We’ll be talking more about this at signal. And speaking of signal it’s coming next week.
Our developer and customer conference takes place August 6 and 7 at the Muskogee Center here in downtown San Francisco. We have some exciting announcements ahead. So, please join us for two days of learning, networking, and fun, I hope to see you there.
Before I turn it over to George, I wanted to mention a couple of the highlights from the quarter. In June, we added Jeff Immelt, former Chairman and CEO of GE and current venture partner at New Enterprise Associates, to our board. Jeff brings nearly 20 years of executive and board room experience to Twilio, and will help guide us as we expand our enterprise and international business on our path to $2 billion and beyond.
Also, in June, we received the great place to work certification with 94% of our employees saying Twilio is a great place to work, and 97% of employees are proud to say, they work here. Thank you to all Twilions for creating such an amazing culture. It’s an extremely important part of our company and I'm really proud of what we’ve created.
And with that, I'll hand the call over to George. Thanks Jeff. Our go to market efforts continues to drive the strong growth we saw in Q2 as we execute on our core platform strategy, as well as extending our reach to the enterprise and internationally. We remain focused on expanding Flex’s presence in the market, as well as cross-selling Twilio SendGrid. Jeff highlighted some of the great things our marketing and developer evangelism teams are doing, so let me focus on the success we saw from the sales side in Q2.
One of our core themes has been expanding into the enterprise and our investments there continues to bear fruit. This quarter, we formed a new relationship with enterprise holding, the parent company of National, Alamo, and Enterprise Rent-A-Car, which has more than 10,000 neighborhood and airport locations to more than 2 million vehicles in its global fleet. Enterprise aiming to improve customer engagements by using new channels such as SMS, IVRs, and social to ensure customers have a seamless experience before, during, and after the car rental experience.
We also entered into a new relationship with the Fortune 50 retailer that is embracing a build mentality to improve their customer engagements moving from buying 80% of their software to building 80% of their software. This is another great example of how every company is becoming a software company. The first used case will add SMS as a channel for order confirmation, tracking information, pickup and delivery alerts, and the like. We look forward to supporting them throughout their journey.
Internationally, we expanded our relationship with the TransferWise, a money transfer company that moves more than £4 billion every month. They recently added their new borderless service, which allows customers to hold over 40 currencies at once along with a TransferWise debit MasterCard. With the new PSD2 regulations, which we added support for in our Authy product last quarter, TransferWise turned to Twilio for Q-factor authentication via Authy push, SMS, and voice. This is a great example of how Twilio continues to innovate and add value for our customers.
We seem to make progress with Flex, signed a new deal with Trip Action, a technology-enabled corporate travel management platform with their tremendous 5x year-over-year growth Trip Action found that they needed a new solution to scale and fit the needs of the business. Trip Action is known for their customer centricity and proactive support and wants to deliver an excellent user experience starting with chat and voice. And they knew that they could accomplish that with a fully customizable contact center platform that Flex offers.
On the partner front, we launched our Twilio Build program last year to support our strategic IFCs and SIs who are building on our platform. We're beginning to see a large amount of inbound interest from SI community in general, while particularly as it relates to Flex with some of the largest consulting firms being Flexed as a disruptor to the traditional call center market. We have also been investing in our IoT business and we’re seeing some really exciting used cases as cellular IoT continues to expand its reach.
We started with traditional machine-to-machine used cases like fleet tracking, but we progressed into new markets like smart cities where we are now powering the disruptors. Whether it’s a micro mobility with Skip Scooters who we formed a new relationship within the quarter or smart weight management with Senfolio, a property management with Twilio. The adoption of our IoT connectivity products reminds us of how our programmable communications cloud product inspired developers’ enterprises to invent new used cases.
In short, we are seeing increased traction and our focus on this offering is starting to pay off. As Jeff mentioned, this was our first full quarter with Twilio SendGrid and we are making great progress with our joint go-to-market efforts. In the quarter, we extended our relationship with Klaviyo, an automated marketing platform and a great SendGrid customer. After hearing and interest from their customer to engage the SMS, the added programmable messaging of SMS capability of product promotions, countrification’s and abandoned shopping cart used cases.
While it’s still early, this is a trend that we continue to see in the market and we are well-positioned as the platform to support marketing campaigns across multiple channels. To close, we’re executing well on our growth investments as we expand our presence in the enterprise and in international markets, and continue to drive success for developers and companies of all sizes in multiple industries around the world.
With that, let me pass the call over to Khozema to discuss our financial results. Thank you, George, and good afternoon everyone. We delivered another strong quarter of growth in Q2 as customers continue to choose Twilio as their customer engagement platform, and we saw great performance with Twilio SendGrid in its first full quarter. Let me take you through some of the details from the quarter.
Base revenue, including Twilio SendGrid grew 90% year-over-year to nearly $257 million in the second quarter. Twilio standalone organic-based revenue growth was 56%. Note that these results do not include any benefit from the A2P fees that we discussed in last quarter's call as there was a delay in the implementation timing which I’ll discuss later. Twilio SendGrid contributed approximately $46 million to base revenue growing 28% year-on-year on an organic basis, despite the difficult compare from the incremental GDPR related volume they saw in Q2 of last year.
Our dollar-based net expansion rate was 140% in the second quarter, a strong sign of the value that we are delivering to our customers. This has been driven by our investment in our go to market teams, and our ability to drive success across our customer base with the expansion of current used cases or the delivery of new used cases. Also, recall that this metric will not be impacted by the SendGrid acquisition until Q1 of 2020.
We ended the quarter with nearly 162,000 active customer accounts. Our top 10 active customer accounts contributed 13% of total revenue in Q2, compared to 14% last quarter and 17% in Q2 of 2018. Gross margin came in above 59% in the second quarter, up slightly from Q1. This was primarily driven by having three months of benefit from Twilio SendGrid in the quarter versus only two months in Q1.
Additionally, with the delayed implementation of the A2P fees, we didn't experience the expected impact to gross margin in the quarter. These are great results, but is important to remember that expanding gross margins is not our strategy today. We remain focused on revenue growth in gaining market share as we have since going public. Historically, we said we expect gross margins in the mid-50s, but with the benefit from SendGrid, we expect to see our margins in the mid-to-high 50s for the foreseeable future. And keep in mind, there are other items that can cause fluctuations in our gross margins, including products, country, and customer mix, network service provider fees, FX, and more.
Let me quickly touch on the new Verizon A2P channel, which I referenced a moment ago. The launch was delayed despite our earlier expectations of the mid-May timing. As we have discussed, we plan to pass this feature to customers, which will add the revenue with depressed gross margin rate, but we don't expect any impact to the gross profit for message. Accordingly, the guidance we provided in our first quarter call included revenue of $1.5 million for the expected impact over the second half of Q2 and $89 million for the full-year.
However, due to the implementation delay, we didn’t recognize any A2P related revenue in Q2. The latest information we’ve received suggest the implementation is still delayed. But due to the uncertainty around the exact timing, we are adjusting our guidance to remove any expected revenue benefit for Q3 and the full-year. If and when these fields are implemented, we will provide the benefit to revenue on the respected quarter's earnings call.
I would also reiterate my commentary from the last call, that we do believe it is likely that the other carriers will ultimately implement similar plans, but we do not have any updated information on the timing of such plans.
Finally, consistent with the commentary on our last earnings call, we expect to generate a modest non-GAAP operating loss in Q3, due to SIGNAL, which takes place next week. Keep in mind that SIGNAL was held in Q4 last year, which will also impact the year-over-year compares for both quarters. Our strategy remains to reinvest in growth to take advantage of the opportunity ahead of us, while operating the company slightly above breakeven.
With that in mind, we expect to return to a modest level of non-GAAP profitability in Q4. To close, we delivered a strong second quarter and our focus on growth investments is setting us up well for the second half of the year and beyond.
And with that, we’ll open it up for questions. Operator? [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Nikolay Beliov with Bank of America. Your line is open. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. This is actually Jacqueline Cheong for Nikolay. Two questions for you. One why is the expansion rate down from 146% in Q1 to 140% in Q2? And the base revenue guide up was only slightly up on a larger Q2 beat, is that due to tough second half comps and Verizon, or is there some other reason in the business? Yes. Let me take the second. This is Khozema. Thanks for the question. Let me take the second part first, and then I’ll get to the first part in a moment. So, in terms of the second part of your question in terms of the base raise and the overall raise, so the way to think about it is that in essence we kept the guidance effectively the same, the same time we took out about $9 million of Verizon revenue from the year. So, if you think about it on an apples-to-apples basis we’re effectively raising for the year with that out of the year, and so we feel pretty good about the input to the business, and how our growth is progressing, but that’s really the mathematical reason for that.
In terms of the first part of your question, I mean, in terms of the expansion rate overall, I mean, we feel great about 140%. I mean, I think it’s a real strong testimony in terms of the way that our business model is progressing. BB&E is one of the metrics that has fluctuated a little bit up and down in the past, but I think it’s been reasonably consistent with prior periods. It is down a little bit relative to the prior quarter, but again I mean I think we feel really good about the inputs of the business. We’ve always said that the expansion rate will fade a little bit over time just given the fact that we’ve got all the cohorts that are starting to grow at a slower rate, but that’s pretty consistent with our prior commentary. Got it. Thank you so much. Your next question comes from the line of Bhavan Suri with William Blair. Your line is open. Thank you. Hi, guys, thanks for taking my questions. I guess maybe I'll start of first with just Flex. I think George you touched a little bit here on Flex in the quarter. I guess, I like to understand what kind of demographics of the customers you're seeing as the only sort of Flex adopted, on the sort of patterns or trends, obviously you’ve talked about sort of Shopify and a few others like that. But those are very early sort of wide growth type of customers, of the people you're talking to [indiscernible] on in the pipeline, is there any sort of trend or pattern or [indiscernible] noncustomers size type of company things like that? I love to see little more color on what you're seeing there on sort of, I guess closely on the pipeline? Yes. Great question. I think that’s a great question because certainly we are seeing right now the early wave of adopters and those companies tend to be digital disruptors, disrupted companies build our cultures, more nimble companies looking to explore new technologies and I think Trip Action is a great example of that. Also, we are also targeting enterprises, but as Jeff mentioned those are going to be longer sales cycles and we're having those conversations as well, but kind of the early wins are more of that digital or early disrupted company type builder culture. Got it. That’s helpful. Thanks. And then I guess turning, just a follow-up to previous question there, maybe Khozema, not so much on sort of the – taking the Verizon piece out, but also think about it, the beat through last year, and I know you told us the beats can’t be the sort of the exception on the size we saw last year, but I was wondering as you told about guidance philosophy and you have been over a while now, has that changed at all in terms of how you're guiding or thinking about visibility given sort of, you know that even if we take that out, the level of the beats or the level [indiscernible] just maybe a marginally more muted in the world last year, so just wanted to – been a change of philosophy or how do you think about visibility or just a natural sort of long large numbers [indiscernible] now? Hi, Bhavan and thanks for the questions. So, again I just emphasize again the lack of the Verizon element to the year that we took out that we previously had in. I would say, look overall, no real change in philosophy. I think the inputs to our business continues to remain really strong. I think one dynamic since last year is that our ability to forecast the impact of customer growth keeps improving. And so, I think you’re just not seeing the significance of the beats, maybe be the same as they were previously as we really started to grow out our sales machine. I think the other dynamic is that well, I talked about the Verizon piece already so, that’s really the gist of it. Okay. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Appreciate it. Sure. Your next question comes from Michael Turrin with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Hi, there. Thanks. Wanted to spend a little bit more time on Flex and partners. With the implementations moving along and is there any more color you can add in terms of where we are in terms of engaging and expanding with the partner community and then secondarily how important are partners and how bring Flex to market, especially on the large enterprise side where it sounds like that’s kind of the next opportunity after this builder driven culture that is flowing if you were to start? I think it’s a great question and part of it is critical to our Flex strategy that’s one of the reasons why we’ve been investing in our ecosystem. In fact, we just brought over a fantastic new VP of our SI community over from salesforce, so we're really excited about that. And I think, we’re expecting or we're seeing what we are expected to see, which is that our partners are getting up to speed. They are learning how to deploy the technology. They are doing it successfully and we have a lot of lighthouse accounts now being deployed by partners with multiple partners in our geos being developed right now so that we can have the coverage we need.
And eventually, we would like to grow to even larger sizes of transactions and partner sizes. So, good progress, good moment and if you are coming to SIGNAL you can meet many of these partners, they’ll be there, great companies like Proficient and Presidio are continuing to grow and those early names throughout early are growing and developing. So, everything is on track. Thanks. Thank you. Can you spend another minute on PSD 2 that’s the second quarter you’ve mentioned that? Any updates on time line or demand or vendors or where this is coming as this is similar to GDPR, are they also aware you can help them in meeting this directive? Yes, it’s Jeff. I’ll answer. PSD 2 obviously presents us with an opportunity because you have got, you are essentially regulating the indication of transactions and we’ve got a great solution for our Authy product. And so of course our go to market teams are using that as a vector to what companies know that we have a solution in the market, transfer lives this quarter was the customer we mentioned on the call, who adopted us for PSD 2 and we think this presents a great opportunity for us, yet another vector for more customers to adopt Twilio. Great, thanks. Looking forward to the SIGNAL show next week. Thank you. Your next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Great. Thank you very much. Jeff, I was wondering there is so much debate in the market going back and forth about robocalls and I know you’ve done blog posts and you’ve talked about it before, but can you just give us an update on the revenue exposure, just I think it would benefit a lot of people who are even listening in, and then I just have two follow-up questions on Flex, if you don't mind? Yes. Absolutely so. Heather, [indiscernible] there is a debate going, I don't even like debate, I just [indiscernible] saying it is bad. As far as exposure to Twilio virtually nothing we’ve ran a platform for, since inception to not welcome those types of customers on real platform, and so the [indiscernible] platforms, I can't say that it’s absolutely zero, we’re vigilant about ensuring that people who do adopt Twilio, if they have the wrong motivations or as long that we don't want them to continue to operate as quickly as possible. Can you just share with people how you're able to do that to get them off the platform, if you do find them, because that’s the other thing we hear a lot about, sorry, but sorry to ask for more elaboration there? Yes. Sure. I mean, as far as the mechanics, we have a terms of service and acceptable use that allows to start-off with customers. [It’s more you touched on.] Yes, exactly. Yes. You couldn't look at the metrics, you see sort of things like answer rates and call durations and use some AI to look at those traffic patterns. We also have operations team that is obviously looking at these cases and I truly – matter of pattern matching for people or machines to see the patterns that exist in those behaviors and to read them out. Okay. Very helpful. Thank you. And then on Flex, my questions were, one, I guess do you have any pipeline goals that you can share with us for the year? You’ve always said like 2019 would be the year of pipeline holding? And then I’m wondering if you can share with us kind of, how long the implementations are taking? And if you kind of think about the competition now that the product has been in the market for longer, are you seeing any change in who you are coming up against in RFPs? This is George. So, we're not going to comment on our pipeline targets, but on the second part of your question, certainly we are seeing deployments that are coming in the kind of months category I would say because we have to remember that at the Flex application platform that developers are building on. It’s not a [SaaS] products, so we’re seeing timeframes in the months roughly. It depends obviously on the customer and in terms of the competitors we're seeing. I would say it’s not materially changed. I mean a lot of our customers are comparing us as legacy, some are comparing as SaaS product it really just depends, I wouldn’t say we’ve seen a meaningful shift there. Okay. Thank you. Your next question comes from Mark Murphy with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Yes. Thank you very much, Jeff. If you look broadly across your base, about 160,000 customers, can you compare and contrast the taste of activity you’re seeing with SMS text notifications, versus in-apps types of notification? And I'm just curious if they are finding that in-app is not feasible to try to reach the broadest audience or are they somehow examining it? Thanks, Mark. I mean, I think the SMS has been really powerful medium for companies to reach their customers for a very long time, because you don't require a user to download a mobile app. You don't require them to push okay, when you have the notifications alert. What you need is their phone number and their permission, and you're able to reach pretty much 100% of your customer base. And that's a really powerful medium to reach customers no matter what OS you're on, no matter what country you live in.
And so, while it does depend a bit on the used case, what we saw, you when push notifications first came out in, what, 2010, I think there was this question of like, how well is that going to replace SMS. And I think time has proven out that people are declining push notifications. However, thoughtful, meaningful SMS embedded into business processes and into contact flows, especially two-way is a fantastic way for companies to engage with their customers. And that's been driving the tremendous growth that we've been seeing in SMS now for more than a decade. Okay, great. And as a quick clarification, Khozema. If we were to adjust for your removal of the incremental A2P revenues for this fiscal year, it looks like you are actually raising revenue guidance for the year by almost $20 million. I just want to clarify, as that seems like an accurate way to think about it? I think if you do the total, that sounds pretty close. I think if you look at base, it's probably closer to high single digits. Understood. Okay. Thank you very much. Thanks for the question, Mark. Your next question comes from Brent Bracelin with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Thanks, and good afternoon. I guess, the first one for Jeff or George, found it interesting that you landed a Fortune 50 retailer. My question here is, how prevalent is this concept of aggressively moving towards a build versus buy going from 80% to – 80% buying to 80% kind of building seems like a pretty big material move? Is this kind of an anomaly, or do you think there's more active discussions and dialogues that you're having with customers that this can be more the norm over the next couple of years? And then I have a quick follow-up for Khozema, if I could. Yes. I would say that this particular customer is – the magnitude of this shift is the norm. But I do think that we've been saying for a long time now and I think it's really true, that every company is becoming a software company. And I do think there is an aggressive demand for, I see us globally for innovation through software. And we're riding this wave of customer engagement and digital transformation that by and large companies realize to differentiate themselves, they need to build software, they can't just use something off-the-shelf. And they also have very custom processes in their companies that – and legacy systems have to integrate with that required software development.
Now, some of that's happening for SI, some of that's happening in-house. But I think companies are realizing that the promise of hey, let's just buy a cloud app deployed and it's going to give me a differentiated perfect solution is just not reality. So, I do think that is a trend that we are benefiting from. And I think one of the reasons we're so excited about our future is that this marriage of the customer engagement, demand, plus the energy around building differentiation, I think, we sit at the intersection of those two really important trends. Helpful color there. And then I guess just a follow-up – yes, go ahead. I was going to add to it. I mean, I think that's one of the core hypotheses that Twilio has operated under – since our inception is that, as we have an increasingly digital world, every company needs to become a software company. And we've seen that more now, if you look at the brands that are on our earnings calls that we're talking about, or brands, companies on our website, history of our customers. It is increasingly every kind of company and it's fascinating, because you see a born out of competitive dynamics, right?
So, when one company takes this approach, and starts building and creating great customer experiences, then other competitors in the market will feel they need to actually have a great customer experience, too. And so, it is a matter of natural evolution, I think, of the market of every company needing to compete in a digital world and having to hire developers and to build their way into the future.
And so, I think it's a really powerful trend. That's kind of what I want to put a little exclamation point on it, because it is certainly one that you see headlines on that. I haven't read the headline in 15 years of like such – and such companies outsourcing all of its IT, that's a headline from 2000 not from 2019. Yes. And just to back of what Jeff just said, I think in this specific example, this new customers, number one competitor has been a TWILIO customer long time and also has been building solutions, I think it’s a not a coincidence that this customer now has seen that and was not a Twilio because they see some of this energy in the market. Very helpful color, I think you both. I guess as a follow-up to condense this increasing kind of build versus buy decision Khozema. The base business did cross over $1 billion run rate for the first time and while I don’t know lot of $1 billion business growing at a 50% plus organic growth profile. I was just hoping you could walk us through the growth levers, how you’re thinking about just growing that base business given you’ve crossed over now that that $1 billion kind of run rate threshold and how should we think about your building in the leverage to sustain kind of high growth, maybe not 50% growth, but how do you sustain growth at that level? Thanks. Thanks for the question Brent. Let me give you a few answers. I think the first thing is that, in general we feel great about the diversity of the customer base, so one of things that we pointed out in the discussion earlier is that, as we look at our top 10, I think that was a number that was more concentrated in the past and as the got to market machine which has really been unleashed, I think we’ve seen more and more used cases across a broader range of customers and just the diversity at that base and it has been really good for us.
So, I think that’s one. Another is that, we have really good contribution across all the different product lines, and so I wouldn’t per se point to any one of them as being a particular outlier. I think we’ve seen great roads for example of course in messaging and voice, but at the same time I mean we’re really excited about some newer products and we’ve had a lot of discussions about Flex for example, but there is also wireless and obviously with the addition of SendGrid, we’re quite excited about the growth from that business as well.
So, I think from our perspective whether or not we’re able to kind of sustain it of that high 50s growth rate, I think we feel really good about the inputs of the business in kind of their entirety and we feel great about crossing sort of the 1 billion run rate mark, but in general we feel like we’ re going to be able to continue to grow the business really across all fronts. There is a lot of more work that we can don on the product side internationally certainly is something I didn’t touch on, but I think we’re excited about too, but in general I think we feel great about where things have headed. Thank you. Your next question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Thanks, and good numbers guys. I guess Khozema I just want to go into the net expansion discussion, which we started the conversation with. I think you’ve made a comment that clearly it is very healthy, but you also expected not to decline materially going forward. You’re now going into the second half of the year where you have very tough year-over-year comps on the expansion rate. Help me understand how you can kind of keep it that level or you should see at least little bit more greater modulation and that figure just given the year-over-year comps here? Yes, maybe just to comment on the first part of the question. I did not say that I expected to decline materially, so I just want to clean that piece of it up. In general, the way that we think about it is that the expansion rate overall it’s an industry reading rate at 140%, it’s down a little bit, no doubt about that, but I think at 140% we feel like it’s a really strong testament to our business model, and the fact that we are able to maintain it at that level at our size and scale is really profound. So, I think in general, I mean if you look at the expansion rate, historically, it’s fluctuated a little bit, it’s gone up and down, it’s been incredibly strong over recent periods. You know, year ago for example, it was 137%, so it’s up a bit from there.
I think, in general our go-to-market model has been incredibly strong, we’re driving deep relationships with customers. The one thing that we’ve always said and maintained over the last several calls is that that expansion will fade over time. It is not that it’s going to be a precipitous drop, but it will fade over time and that is just the kind of long large numbers kicking into the way that the business is going to grow, but I wouldn’t take that as anything other than the business is just becoming a lot larger, but in general we feel great about our growth aspects. Very good. Just a follow-up. I don’t know that you’ve mentioned in the call, maybe I missed it, but what was non-U.S. revenue in the quarter? Non-U.S. revenue was 29%. Thank you very much. Good luck. Thanks. Your next question comes from Will Power with Baird. Your line is open. Yes thanks. Just a couple of questions. First maybe just to circle back to SendGrid and the integration progress good to hear some examples of the cross-selling opportunity, but I wonder if you could just kind of qualitatively help us understand kind of what any ran in that cross-selling opportunities, you think about go-to-market from the legacy SendGrid team and developers and Twilio and enterprise side there. What percentage of those folks are actively selling either e-mail or SMS depending on the organization and kind of what’s the roadmap from here on that front? This is George. We’ve made I think excellent progress in terms of integration. We’re on track with our plan when it comes to how we’ve been planning to integrate our go-to-market forces. We today have a sales force that is able to sell the full range of Twilio and Twilio SendGrid products to our customers, and we’ve also brought in the existing SendGrid go-to-market teams to create one unified customer experience. We’re not all the way there yet, but I think we’re certainly on track than what we planned and I think we’re seeing that in some of data points we’ve given you, and I’m very, very pleased with the team and what they’ve accomplished. Okay, great. And maybe, George, actually just a follow-up to you on some of the earlier comments on IoT. I wonder if you could talk about how you are thinking about the size of that market opportunity, it sounds like we’re very early in and when can that become more substantial, and what does 5G potentially mean to that? Does that open up more conversations, are you starting to see that yet? I think on a big picture level, obviously we’re excited about the opportunity. In programable wireless, we’re seeing many of these early adopters come and build on a platform. I think we are fulfilling on the promise that Twilio always stands for, which is opening up the innovation potential of a major communication space to all developers, not just the biggest companies in the world. So, we’re seeing companies of different sizes, but especially really innovative and newer companies building on the Twilio from choosing us and we are investing in the product and I think you’ve seen that a SIGNAL and we’ll talk about it more at SIGNAL, but we’re just on I think a very healthy trajectory. So, we’re excited to share some of those wins on this call.
In choosing about the 5G, I mean obviously for the customers that we’re having these conversations with, we are talking to them about all the evolution we’re seeing in the market including 5G. We’ve launched some of our products that are taking advantage of some of the innovation to market like our narrow band IoT products. We talked about our SIGNAL, so it’s definitely an evolving market, but obviously some of these things like 5G are still early, and we’re not – we are not having conversations at this point. Certainly, a very exciting space and we’re fired about the opportunity. Okay, great. Thanks. Your next question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Great. Thanks. Just diving a little bit more into Flex. You mentioned augmenting kind of being a way and then entering the customers, I’m just wondering if there is any kind of easier used cases that you’ve found and kind of pitching into some newer customers, understanding it’s early days and then maybe second, just any customer interest or any impact to business from the rollout of RCS, chat? That’s it from me. Thanks. I’ll talk of – this George. I will talk about Flex and I will touch on RCS a bit, although Jeff may want to expand on RCS some more. Certainly, look I think when you have an innovative product like Flex, there is this natural points that are easier for customer adoption, Green field used cases, used cases where companies are not actually outgrowing, their previous generation of technology.
I think that is Trip Actions is a great example of the latter, and those are the ones you’re going to see faster traction on and I think those were some of the ones we talked about already. And over time, I would expect that we would see more replacing legacy used cases, but the early adopters are going to be ones in the mode of new deployment or outgrowing previous technology. In terms of RCS, we’re definitely having conversations, but I wouldn't say it's a big needle mover at this point. Jeff, do you want to add anything to that? Yes. I mean, I think what you can think about with RCS is, it is a – the biggest change to SMS that's occurred in, what, 40 years, which is, it is essentially the same dynamics as SMS, but it adds a lot of new capabilities to the channel that enable you to do new things, such as transact on the channel with recommended actions, buy buttons, photo carousels.
I mean, it really turns messaging into essentially an app replacement for a whole lot of use cases. And so, we think this is going to further accentuate the power of messaging for companies to engage with their customers. When you cannot only, for example, send notifications or do – to a chat with a customer, it actually presents them with the option to buy it now right here or to send them images and maps.
And really, if you think about all the companies that have mobile apps that you don't download, but you would engage in a lightweight checklist, when you don't have to download anything to be able to accomplish many of the same goals, such as making purchases or engaging with supports, getting returns, getting information, whatever it is. That's the power of that RCS and some of these other new channels are going to bring to the world of messaging.
And I think that there is something of a secular trend forming of messaging becoming a more and more important medium for companies to engage with their customers. And RCS will take some time to play out, because you have carriers have to roll it out, you have handsets that have to support it, you have either OS upgrades or handset replacements that consumers need to do to get full support. And so, it's going to be this very – somewhat messy matrix, actually, of carrier support, a handset support of who actually can benefit from it.
And that's where a platform like Twilio comes in where you can – is a convenient solution for our customers, because it means that they can take their SMS that they're doing with us today. And as each individual user is capable of taking advantage of RCS, upgrade that conversation to the most feature capable – capabilities of that particular customer.
And so, we can bridge customers in a very seamless way as the leader in the space with SMS and bridging our customers into the world of RCS and beyond. And so, it's a very – we're very optimistic that this is going to be a fantastic medium for our customers to further engage with their customers, because they can do more powerful things. Got it. Thank you so much, guys. Your next question comes from Rich Valera with Needham. Your line is open. Thank you. Question on Flex. I know it's early days, but I'm wondering if you could characterize what a typical engagement process looks like for Flex? Any sense of the timing from sort of engagement to a sale? And then if you could give any color on whether customers are tending to prefer the usage-based model over the traditional sort of per user model? Thanks. Good questions. So, obviously, we – since we GA’d the product in the fourth quarter of last year, any transactions that we're talking about in Q1, Q2 timeframe are going to have – sales cycles are typically in a couple of months range, typically, weeks to months, depending on the customer scenario. We are working on longer-term ones, obviously, those are not –anything longer sales cycle, we're not going to be able to talk about at this point in time. And can you remind me the second part of your question, again? The use – the pricing models of customers are leaning towards the traditional or that the usage base? We're seeing both actually. It's interesting. We're seeing truly like interest in both options, both are viable and important options in the marketplace. And we're getting an interesting level of traction, I would say, on the agent hour model, I think it's in-line with the kind of general brand and value prop, the Twilio has in the marketplace. So, we're excited to see that. Great. Just a quick follow-up if I could on a modeling question. The bridge between the unchanged non-GAAP income from operations of $5 million to $8 million and the higher EPS, is that just interesting income? If you could just clarify what the bridge is there? I didn't hear the last part of the question. I'm sorry. The bridge – your non-GAAP income from operations, I think, is unchanged quarter-to-quarter for the year. It's sort of $5 million to $8 million, but the EPS went up and just try to understand the bridge there? Yes, it's basically other income. Got it. That's what I thought. Okay, thank you. Your next question comes from Nandan Amladi with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open. Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So, this might be a question for Jeff or George, kind of a philosophical one. Historically, you've marketed to developers more of a grassroots kind of effort. Now, with these prepackaged products like Flex, you're not only selling to enterprises, but you're also engaging a system integrator community. So, how does your go-to-market motion? And as a result, your marketing – data marketing efforts changed? Well, this is Jeff. I'll take the philosophical portions of it. And maybe I'll let George talk about the go-to-market implications, if there are any. But in essence, I don't see this as having changed. Our approach is still really to engage with developers first, and to get developers onboard with Twilio.
And then they bring us into accounts of all sorts of different varieties, whether it's the tech disruptors that were many of our early customers or now even bigger enterprises who are building software and hiring the same developers. Developers are really where our go-to-market and our awareness often starts.
And I think you see this borne out in most of these deals that we're talking about even when the Fortune 50 companies, the developers are often the ones who are saying, “Hey, Twilio is the answer to how we can solve this problem, let's get started.” And oftentimes, it starts by building that prototype with very little friction and that's how we get the momentum going in these accounts.
Now, when you have a bigger customer, Fortune 50 customer, you're less likely that they're going to say, great, we just want to put in our credit card and go live. Usually, there's a sales process in contracts and MSA design and things like that, and of course, we're going to engage in those conversations. But often, it's the developer who first brings us in.
Now, you asked about Flex as well. And I would just say that Flex is still a developer product. And while developer is not going to single handedly purchase the contact center, the developer again becomes a big influencer around the decision when you're looking at this world of, gosh, we've got to integrate all these systems together. We've got to create this great customer experience. We need developers. We need code to do that. And the developers can say, you know what, I've heard about this Flex thing, let me go give it a try.
And again, they can provision a Flex instance very quickly, self-service, they can build a prototype with very little friction and show the business what's possible. And then that often begins the engagement, begins the conversation with the customer about how-to bring Flex into their environment and to roll it out in a bigger way, which again leads to a sales conversation.
So that would be – my take is that, we've layered sales and a sales motion to a target the enterprise and to focus on customer success, but it comes on the back of the developer momentum that we've always had and we continue to have growth. And this is George. I agree with Jeff. I also see us augmenting that with some new motions to reach developers that historically we haven't reached before. And I'll tell you a story. Yesterday, I got a friend of mine who texted me and said, “Hey, my company just asked me to spin up a Twilio app by end of day today.” And so like – and I just want to let you know that, because he knew I work at Twilio. And I kind of – I called him later that day, I was like, so tell me the story of what happened.
And it turns out that this – what it happened was that, our sales team is [indiscernible] account. In fact, I met one of the executives of this customer at one of our New York customer dinners. And that – and there – that this is an example where it's kind of the opposite of our typical deployment mode, which Jeff talked about, which is that the developers inside this corporate IT department had not been exposed to Twilio interesting enough.
And because we had worked with them at the enterprise level, there was kind of a buy in at the enterprise architecture level if they want to use Twilio and then the message is given to the developers and they were starting to use it. And we're seeing that motion also to augment this amazing bottoms-up motion that Jeff talked about. In fact, we've done some enterprise hackathons, which Jeff mentioned in some of our customers to kind of – to add to that kind of motion.
So, I think that one of the exciting things, I think, there's a whole world of enterprise developers that we have not yet reached with our traditional motion, and I think it gives me optimism around more upside potential for the company. And I had kind of always been waiting to see when this friend of mine would start to use Twilio. And yesterday was the day.
So, I think that this go-to-market motion that we're layering it is bearing fruit. And it's not only augmenting the bottoms-up motion, but also creating new motions inside the company for organizations where the developers are more kind of wanting to adhere to a corporate standard. So, I think it's a really exciting opportunity out of us. Great salesman, George, like, wait for them to tell me that they have discovered Twilio. Thank you, guys. Our final question will come from Rishi Jaluria with D. A. Davidson. Your line is open. Hi, guys. This is Hannah on for Rishi. Thank you for taking my questions. First, it is great to hear Flex is doing well so far, I was just wondering if there are any major lessons that you took away from your second quarter of having it generally available and if there is anything that surprised you there? Yes. I think that we’re always learning about the product. I think that one big lesson was how to effectively sort of bring partners for one of the previous questions in to the motion of bringing them in earlier. I think that was a good lesson learned. I was trying to apply that in the second quarter. I also think that we’re getting, I think much better as understanding kind of the – how to make a customer successful frankly and we’ve started to build-up some of our own internal teams [indiscernible] architecture or Expert Services to help certain customers. So, I think we’re getting better with this success formula. I think we’re getting better in terms of our sales targeting and we’re finding the motion, but I think it all sits under the backdrop of, we think we’ve got a great value proposition in the market, and we’re excited about the interest we’re seeing. Great. That’s really helpful. And then I just want to go back to international performance, which you briefly mentioned. Last quarter, you mentioned hiring new leaders in Latin America and Japan and I was wondering if you could comment on how those two regions are performing and then general international performance maybe strength in specific regions you are seeing? Yes. I think that obviously we have hired and built – invest internationally is one of kind of the three kind of major distribution initiatives we talked about beyond our coverage strategy, which is enterprise international and partners. So, we’ve hired great leaders like David Parry-Jones for EMEA, got a great leader in Asia Pacific that is home grown and we hired another great leader for LatAm recently. So, I think we are starting to see that our investment in coverage and in leadership in those areas is working. Obviously, it is set against a backdrop of, you know like strong growth in North America as well. So, it’s nice to be in a business where we’re growing across multiple product lines, multiple geographies, but definitely we are investing in international and we're excited about the early results. Great. Thank you, guys. There are no further questions at this time. Thank you for participating in today’s conference. You may now disconnect.","our results press release, SEC filings, and replay of today's call can be found on our IR website at investors.twilio.com . if any of these materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual company results could differ materially from forward-looking statements .",0.0

My name is Daphne, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session.
I will now turn the call over to Andrew Zilli, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Zilli, you may begin. Thanks, good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter fiscal 2019 earnings conference call. Our results press release, SEC filings and a replay of today's call can be found on our IR website at investors.twilio.com. Joining me today are Jeff Lawson, Co-Founder and CEO; George Hu, COO; and Khozema Shipchandler, CFO.

With that, I'll hand it over to you, Jeff. Thanks, Zilli, and welcome everyone to this quarter’s earnings call. Before I begin, I'd like to take a moment to recognize and thank the nearly 5,000 brave firefighters and other first responders doing their best to keep the fires in Sonoma County at Bay protecting the lives, homes, and livelihoods of our neighbors to the north in absolutely horrifying conditions. Thank you, now onto our call. Our third quarter results were strong with total revenue growing 75%, tremendous growth that this scale that reinforces our view that we are still in the early days of this market opportunity.
And while we are the leader in the category today, we have much bigger aspirations. We are investing across the business in new products, new regions, and much more to position us for long-term success to take advantage of this fast growing market. We're very confident that the demand environment for our customer engagement platform and the inputs to our business are strong. I recognize that base revenue came in slightly below our guidance and Khozema will go into more detail on that, but that doesn't change our perspective that we've only scratched the surface and are excited about what lies ahead. We continue to help companies reimagine their customer engagement as every company needs to focus on building great digital experiences for their customers. Our commitment to innovation and customer success is driving relationships with companies of all sizes as the breadth of our product offering and our developer first approach position Twilio as the platform of choice for building meaningful relationships with customers.
I'm particularly excited about some of the new companies we've started working with in Q3, which George will talk about shortly and nowhere with this developer first approach more evident than at our annual customer event SIGNAL, where we welcomed more than 3,200 customers, prospects, developers and business leaders and introduced a number of new products and features. And at SIGNAL, I told you we had over 6 million registered developer accounts on our platform well today that number is now north of 7 million and climbing. Innovation has always been at the core of Twilio and you can see that in the new products and features we announced at SIGNAL the biggest being Twilio conversations.
Everyone has had the experience of getting a message from a brand only to find out that most times responding to that message doesn't work. But we've reached a point where customers expect this kind of easy, frictionless engagement with brands. At SIGNAL, I mentioned some brands who have figured out the importance of meaningful two way conversations with their customers, companies like Nordstrom, Macy's, Lyft, Redfin, and others. We've heard from many customers, especially as we launched Flex, that they see this as an opportunity to transform the way they engage with their customers and that's why we built conversations to make it easier for every company to build this kind of two way engagement across channels and deliver a better customer experience.
We also announced ads for Twilio SendGrid, a new offering within our marketing campaigns product to address more than $300 billion digital ad spending market. SendGrid ads synchronizes across all of your email contacts and allows you to target ads across three of the major advertising platforms: Facebook, Instagram, and Google Ads. This is all managed from a single UI and more importantly, the ads are informed by the intelligence of the email channel, so your ads can be smarter. We also announced the email validation API, which validates email addresses before companies send to them, decreasing bounce rates and improving sender reputation and inbox placement.
There's always a tremendous amount of energy at SIGNAL and this year was no different. I want to thank our team and everyone who attended for making this the best SIGNAL yet. SIGNAL is a great example of the innovation that Twilio continues to deliver to our customers. And because of this innovation focused on customer success and our extensive customer engagement platform, Twilio was recently recognized as a worldwide leader in the IDC MarketScape for CPaaS being named the de facto icon of the CPaaS segment for our vision and strategy to drive digital transformation.
The report highlighted how Twilio has almost single handedly created a new communication segment and specifically mentioned our recent focus on solutions such as Flex. This is great validation that our constant innovation and our vision of powering the future of communications is bearing fruit. Speaking of Flex, we're continuing to see great interest and traction with the product as we just passed the first year of GA. We're continuously innovating to add high value features our customers are asking for. In fact, at SIGNAL, we announced the Media Streams API to get companies access to the voice media of the calls coming into Flex, allowing real-time transcription, conversation analytics and more.
We also announced native CTI integrations between Flex and Zendesk and brought autopilot to GA within the Flex console. While it's still early for Flex, we are seeing some great wins as companies of all sizes continue their digital transformation efforts and look to move those contact centers to the cloud to better drive omnichannel customer engagement. One of the other announcements we made at SIGNAL was verified by Twilio, a new feature that allows branded trusted phone calls that are authenticated by Twilio. This is yet another step that we are taking to take back the voice channel and combat unwanted robocalling.
Now, I know that investors have concerns about the impact of robocalls and potential legislation on our business. We've talked about it on previous calls, but given the amount of noise, I wanted to address it head on today. When people talk about automated calls or texts, there are really two kinds of behaviors they might be referring to: automated, unwanted calls and texts such as those you might get from a fraudster and automated, but wanted calls and texts such as those you might get from your child's school. To be clear, we do not support unwanted automated calls or texts on our platform. Since day one, we have had many preventative measures in place. And since the beginning, we have proactively kicked customers off of our platform, who have been bad actors.
We welcome legislation that will further impinge these bad actors and are working with the FCC, Carriers, Congress, and industry groups to support this. That said we do support customers making automated wanted calls and texts, think about doctor’s appointment reminders, flight changes, fraud alerts or emergency notifications. There's a valid concern that legislation or regulation designed to target the bad actors could impact these good use cases. So let me address what we're doing there.
As of today, both The House and Senate have passed robocall legislation that we support and we expect a bill focused on SHAKEN/STIR implementation to be signed in the coming weeks. As a reminder, SHAKEN/STIR uses digital certificates based on common public key cryptography techniques to ensure the calling number of a telephone call is not spoofed. We have made great strides to help ensure calls in our platform will be signed under SHAKEN/STIR and expect to have those pieces in place by the end of the year in line with the industry goal for initial go live.
And just yesterday, we announced that we have joined the board of ATIS, the standards group that developed SHAKEN/STIR. We’re also a member of U.S. Telecom, the industry association, primarily responsible for advancing illegal robocall mitigation efforts. And our general counsel, Karyn Smith, sits on their board. With our involvement at ATIS and U.S. Telecom, Twilio is furthering our commitment to protect voice and messaging channels, partner with Carriers and other voice providers to combat illegal robocalls, protect our networks, and ensure we have strong federal policies that benefit consumers and businesses.
We continue to anticipate that Carriers will proceed cautiously when blocking calls as they understanding the consumers want and need to receive calls and texts from their doctors, schools, teachers, pharmacists and others. And importantly, since Carriers were given the option to automatically block calls back in June, we have not seen an impact on our customer's traffic. However, even if you looked at the most extreme case of carriers or legislation that allows the blocking of wanted communications including text messages, we currently estimate based on historical data that a single digit percentage of our total revenue could be impacted.
This is obviously the worst case scenario, but we expect that the actual impact will be de minimis. We feel confident that we are taking the necessary steps to ensure our platform is ready for these changes. And importantly, the FCC has classified text messages as a Title I service, which indicates that the commission intends to keep this channel largely regulation free. The carriers all support this approach as do others in the ecosystem including Twilio.
So to close, we are still in the early innings of this massive market opportunity as evidenced by the great customers, George is about to talk about our growth rate at this scale and the demand for our platform. We are focused on managing the business for the long run to help every company reinvent how they engage with their customers in this digital era. I want to thank all of our customers for trusting Twilio as their customer engagement platform and thank all the Twilions around the world for yet another great quarter and for their endless dedication to our customers.
And with that over to you George. Thanks, Jeff. Our team delivered another strong performance in the third quarter as we continue to build out the go to market foundation for the future for multiple initiatives, expanding our enterprise presence, expanding internationally and building a strong partner community. And these investments are paying off. In fact, during the quarter, we signed new or expansion agreements with more than 50 global 2000 accounts. A great sign of the traction we are seeing in the enterprise.
Internationally, we opened an office in Japan hiring a strong executive, Yoshihiro Konno, to lead the region. We continue to see success with our Engage Roadshows, where we bring together a community to learn and develop the future of communications. We're holding Engage events around the world with stops coming to Washington D.C., Toronto, London, Paris and Tel Aviv in the coming weeks. At SIGNAL, we heard from great customers like Netflix, Lyft, Morgan Stanley and others on why they chose Twilio to power their customer engagement.
Now let me highlight a few of the exciting deals from the third quarter. We entered into a new relationship this quarter with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Finance Center, the shared service provider for financial and HR services were approximately 650,000 employees. The USDA is using programmable messaging to authenticate their employees via SMS when they are logging in to review pay stubs, W2s, 401K allocations and more. In addition to onetime password authentication, the National Finance Center will use SMS to periodically send account notifications and reminders to their employees. This is an exciting new relationship with one of the largest departments of the federal government.
We also expanded our relationship with Chime, the fastest growing U.S. challenger bank platform focused on helping their members to achieve financial health. To accommodate their incredible growth, Chime chose Twilio Studio, our innovative visual application builder to build an inbound IVR completely from the ground up serving banking customers for any level of support on their account. They are disrupting the banking industry and we're excited to support them on their journey.
Last year, we started our expansion of Australia and we're excited by the progress there. We entered into a new relationship with Westpac, Australia’s second largest financial institution, and a global 2000 company with a market value of Australian 100 billion dollars. Westpac is rapidly expanding its digital efforts and needed a new solution for account notifications for its tens of millions of customers. Westpac chose Twilio Notify as its standard across its brand as we offered the most complete omnichannel platform with global scale. We look forward to working together with Westpac because they continue to meet the demands of the modern customer.
Flex continues to be top of mind for our customers and we've heard great feedback since we became GA in October of 2018. This quarter we signed a new relationship with Allianz SE, the world's number one insurer and one of the world's largest financial services groups working with a close business and developer approach. Allianz Direct chose Flex to power their customer and contact center agent experience. In combination with our partner Develop, Allianz Direct has rolled out Flex in several regions.
We also entered into a new relationship with CompuCom Systems, a subsidiary of Office Depot that provides end to end managed services, technology and consulting to enable the digital workplace. As part of their strategy to reimagine their customer experience, CompuCom chose Flex to provide a more seamless customer interaction regardless of channel for more than 2000 agents. These are both great examples of the massive shift in the contact center space and we are excited to help companies like CompuCom and Allianz adapt to the changing needs of their customers with fully programmable Flex platform. The Twilio SendGrid cross-sell efforts continue to progress well and this quarter we had a cross-sell win with a major global airline.
They'd been a Twilio SMS customer for a few years and in Q3 we expanded our relationship by adding Twilio SendGrid Email, which the company will use for millions of notifications each month including flight changes, checking reminders, delays and more. This was a strong team effort and shows the value of combining messaging and email for customer engagement. I want to personally thank all of the amazing SendGrid team members, who are working hard to make deals like this possible and all who built a product capable of supporting these great customers.
As we expand our penetration into a market like travel, we're continually encouraged that this opportunity truly spans companies of all shapes and sizes. On the IoT front, we signed an agreement with Mason, a leading mobile infrastructure as a service provider that Forbes calls the Twilio for tablets. Mason was created to help companies build and scale smart hardware products and its customers have used its services for ordering kiosks, patient engagement in hospitals and more. They were looking for a partner to scale their edge computing business and turned to Twilio Super SIM to connect the customized tablets they built for their customers.
While the IoT market is very early, we're excited about the continued traction of our IoT offering. Overall, we're well positioned as we head into Q4 and into 2020. We're making the key investments to fuel continued growth going into next year and we'll continue executing on our strategy to grow our enterprise presence, scale our partner ecosystem and expand internationally.
With that, I'll pass it over to Khozema. Thanks, George, and good afternoon everyone. Q3 was another strong quarter for the business. High growth of this scale is a testament to the power of Twilio's platform and showcases how our customers continue to choose Twilio as their trusted customer engagement platform. Now diving into the numbers, base revenue, which includes Twilio SendGrid, grew 79% year-over-year to $276 million in the third quarter. Organic base revenue for Twilio was $227 million growing 47% year-over-year. Twilio SendGrid grew 31% year-over-year to approximately $49 million.
As Jeff mentioned, while the growth was very strong, base revenue came in a bit lower than we expected. We've experienced rapid growth and with that come some growing pains. Consequently, a few of our older systems sometimes fall short of where we'd like them to be. We have faced some of these growing pains in the third quarter as we discovered some errors in our billing processes that resulted in a few onetime credits being issued to customers totaling approximately $5 million, which will also impact our ongoing run rate. Importantly, our internal controls identified these errors and we understand the root issues and are working to improve our billing related processes and other systems. We will continue to invest in systems to support our strong growth trajectory into the future.
Let me take a moment to discuss our current revenue disclosures and the change we are planning to make. Given the size and scale Twilio has achieved, we believe the variable revenue designation has become less meaningful and that total revenue is a better way to evaluate the overall business. Variable revenue has materially declined as a percentage of the total, 7% this quarter, 7% last quarter and less than 10% in 2018 prior to the closing of the SendGrid acquisition versus 16% in the quarter before we went public. Accordingly, beginning in Q1 2020, we will longer breakout base in variable, but we expect to continue to disclose the contribution from WhatsApp through 2020, which constitutes the majority of the variable revenue category.
One important note regarding this change is that dollar base now base revenue, so we will be shifting the basis of our expansion metric to total revenue on an ongoing basis and we will provide historical data using total revenue to normalize your models. Dollar-based net expansion rate was 132% in the third quarter, a very strong rate at this size and scale especially coming off of difficult compares from 2018. Additionally, the credits I mentioned impacted DBNE by a few points in the quarter.
As we approached the end of the year, let me provide a bit of context around what to expect for expansion rate over the next several quarters. First recall that strong political traffic and the ramp of a large international customer benefited growth by about 10% in Q4 2018. And we do not anticipate those to occur again this year making for a difficult comp in Q4. Second, SendGrid's historical dollar-based expansion rate had been about 115%, give or take a few points in any given quarter. And we’ll therefore lower the overall expansion rate once combined next year. As you may recall, SendGrid was acquired on February 1, 2019 and therefore only contributed two months to our Q1 2019 results. As Q1 2020 will have the benefit of an extra month of revenue from SendGrid, our expansion rate will also benefit and we expect a sequential increase from Q4 to Q1. The full impact of the combined expansion rate will be realized in Q2 2020.
Moving on, we had approximately 172,000 active customer accounts at the end of the quarter. Top 10 active customer accounts contributed 13% of total revenue in Q3 flat sequentially and down from 18% in Q3 2018. Gross margins were at 58.4% in the third quarter within the mid to high 50s range we've been communicating. Going forward, we continue to expect to operate in the mid to high 50s while the normal puts intakes, customer, product, country mix, carrier fees, FX and others may cause minor fluctuations. A2P carrier fees had no impact during the quarter as they have still yet to be implemented. We do not have any updates with regards to timing, but we will provide the P&L impact during the earnings call post-implementation.
As anticipated, operating profit was slightly in the red coming in at a loss of $3.6 million primarily due to SIGNAL, our annual developer and user conference, which was held in August. Additionally, we refined our process for accumulating inputs that feed our capitalized software process, allowing us to make better estimates. This could potentially reduce the amount we capitalize and more closely align our P&L with cash usage. As we get into Q4 in fiscal year 2020, we see a tremendous opportunity ahead of us to continue to increase market share and grow the company.
George has talked about some key priorities in the go to market efforts. And we believe investing in these areas today as well as our product innovation will position us to take advantage of this massive market opportunity. In that context, we now expect to finish 2019 with a slight operating loss versus our earlier guidance of $5 million to $8 million of profitability. We believe these investments will drive multiple years of elevated growth. Staying on profitability for a moment, while we're not optimizing for this today, I want to reiterate that this is an important long-term focal point for the company. We are in the early stages of a number of changes internally to drive efficiencies over-time including changes to strategic sourcing, working capital and stock-based compensation to name a few.
We've heard your feedback on our stock based compensation and dilution and are actively working to ring both of those numbers down over time. Some of these levers will also close the delta between GAAP and non-GAAP results. We don't have any specific items to highlight today with regards to these items, but we will provide more information when the time comes. Ultimately, the investments being made today enable Twilio to extend our market leading position and take full advantage of this generational opportunity.
With that, thank you everyone for joining and I'll now open the call for questions. Operator? [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. Thanks. Hey guys. Khozema I just – Khozema I wanted to really focus on this, the systemic issue of the $5 million credit. Just make sure I understand this. Is this a cumulative effect over multiple quarters that had to be clear in the quarter? Or does this just happen in this quarter itself and hope me get me get my hands around this? Yes, it's a little bit of both, so thanks for the question. As we said on the call, I think just based on the growth that we've experienced as a company. I think one of the things that we've looked at is that our systems are going through some growing pains as we explained. And this particular issue was related to our billing system where specifically some order forms were input incorrectly in sort of a manual fashion. And obviously this is not the experience that we want for our customers given that customer trust is really paramount.
And we went back and did a thorough analysis of the problem. And once we found some of these manual inputs, we promptly issued credits to the customers that were impacted. And there were a couple of them that were in the quarter, there were a couple of them that were preceded a couple quarters. We think we've got a good handle on what caused the errors historically and we've got controls in place now to address this going forward. So just to make sure as I think about the shift from September actual results to December, the September results already take this credit into effect, fully into effect. And December is now guided with this in mind. So still there is very little quarter-over-quarter growth in your core business from September to December. And I understand that last year you had that onetime the political, the midterms and the onetime large customer. But it seems like business activity or the volume of transaction is still decelerating quite substantially from September to December. Is there anything else in here that you think requires highlighting in understanding this? Yes, I wouldn't characterize it that way. Let me give you a little bit of the financials and then I'll have Jeff give you a little bit more the detail and George as well maybe from a customer perspective. I think in terms of the December quarter, we did take our guidance down by a bit more than the ongoing run rate. I think we feel like we've got a good handle on the issues and we're certainly actively working to correct them, but I think we felt it was warranted to put it in a little bit of an extra buffer until we're absolutely certain that all the issues are addressed. And we're not necessarily quantifying that, but I think we felt like it was prudent to do so as we work through the fixes that are entailed with that.
As it relates to kind of the year-over-year I mean – any way that you look at it really, we feel like that we've got terrific growth at scale that it's really impressive. The comps, as you mentioned, we've signaled for a long time, we're going to be difficult in the back half of the year. You pointed to the political traffic. I think we really read it again for example, that we had kind of a onetime customer that ticked up particularly last year. And I think we've been pretty clear that around our expectations that the growth rate and the expansion rate would slow down a little bit in the back half of the year. Just maintaining these rates is obviously hard at this size. And then again, the credits that we referenced, those impact a little bit our base revenue growth as I explained a moment ago. And we'll have a little bit of an impact on DBNE too. But we still feel great about where the business is headed. And let me turn it over to Jeff maybe to add a little bit more color. Yes. Hey, Ittai. So, I mean, despite the manual errors, I think we turned in a quarter growing 47% year-over-year organic at nearly a billion dollar run rate. And so, I'm really proud of what we've accomplished. So we're one of the only companies growing at this scale, at this rate. And we're very proud of that. We're focused on the long-term opportunity. This is one of those once in a lifetime changes that's happening and how companies engage their customers using all of these new digital channels and we're here to capitalize on that mega trend. And we're hearing all the right things from our customers about what they need and our ability to provide it. So, I look at it, it's a great market. We've got a great business model. We've got a great team and I see them all getting better as we grow. So I'm really excited about what lies ahead. Very good. Good luck guys. Thank you, Ittai. Your next question comes from the line of Bhavan Suri from William Blair. Hey guys, thanks for taking my question and thanks for the billings target, Khozema. I guess I did want to touch on the dollar base net expansion rates here, even if we had a few hundred basis points from the credits to billing issue. It feels like it decelerated reasonably quickly. I guess I just like to understand sort of obviously scale matters, but it was 100 basis points or 100 bps or 200 bps. And I’m just trying to understand if you could provide some common dynamics that have effect this metric. I guess, are you seeing changing spending habits within customers? Or was it just the volatility of how applications have launched that drives it up and down the speed of that? I guess just some of that color would be helpful. Yes. Again, let me provide a little bit of the math and then maybe I'll have George comment from a customer perspective in terms of what he's seeing. But I guess just as a starting point, I would say the short answer is no. Again, maybe just to reiterate, Bhavan, I think from our perspective, I mean the growth at the scale that we've reached is really strong. And I think again, we always knew that we would have pretty difficult comps in the back half of the year. If you recall Q3 2018, we had growth that was approaching 70%. And then going into Q4, we had growth that was approaching 80%. And we had a little bit of political traffic in there that was elevating that. And then we had this onetime customer that we actually tried to back out of the results last year to try to normalize it a little bit. That had an impact as well on the expansion rates back in that period.
And so, as we lapped the year, I think we've been pretty clear in our expectations that that DBNE would in fact fade over time in part because of the comps, in part because the business is just becoming a lot larger and we're running into the law of large numbers. And then the footfall in this if you will, this is manual error issue that we elaborate it on as it relates to billing associated credits. And so, you put all that together and that's what kind of results in the map that you saw on the DBNE that we got in the quarter. But I don't think it's anything related to some of the issues that that you pointed to. But let me turn it over to George and he can color on that a bit more. Sure. Thanks, Khozema. I mean, I would say that we don't see any fundamental change in our demand environment. We still see a lot of interest from customers and we haven't fundamentally seen a shift except for some of the dynamics that Khozema talked about, which are nothing to do with really our customers. We're excited, we're investing and we still plan to capture the big opportunity in front of us. Okay, helpful. Let me quickly just ask a follow up with Flex here. Obviously, nice wins there. I guess maybe George for you maybe touch on what sort of demographics are you seeing from the early adopters? And then how were the initial conversations going with the VAR channel. This is something you and I have talked about multiple times in the past. Just if I can get color on those two. Thank you. Yes, great question. So, I mean, in terms of the demographics of the customers, I would say generally speaking, it was consistent with what we said before. It's still a newer product. So we're still mostly in the early adopter phase. We have a lot of interest from kind of digital economy customers and very tech forward companies. We're excited now with Allianz and CompuCom to start to see the beginnings of expanding that more towards the mainstream. But I would caution that this is not the normal pattern. We’ve not yet – we haven't yet crossed the chasm. It's still a newer product. But we're excited about these green shoots. And I think it speaks to the power of the value proposition of the product. In terms of the partners, we're excited about the facts we're seeing there.
And, as I've mentioned, I believe in the past, we've not really historically that Twilio had a strong reseller motion or frankly infrastructure for resellers. We've been investing in that this year and are bringing some, some initial resellers onto that platform. We're testing it right now. I think it will be something that we'll be able to onboard more in 2021. I don't think it will be material for a while for us, but we are investing in it. And certainly, I think, Flex is definitely the catalyst that is growing interest in that for us. Great, thank you guys. Thanks, Bhavan. Thanks, Bhavan. Your next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy from J.P. Morgan. Yes, thank you. Khozema, the $5 million billing impact to Q3, is it also $5 million in Q4? And I'm just wondering for how many quarters do you think that would continue into 2020? Yes, thanks for the question, Mark. Good question. I don't think we see it necessarily continuing into 2020 in the way that your question intimated. I mean, obviously, it will impact kind of the way that we evaluate our run rate from an FP&A perspective. But in general, I mean, we feel pretty good about how things look after Q4. We’re obviously not guiding for that today. So, I don't want to get too far down the road on that one. But as it relates to Q4 itself and the way that we characterize our guide, as I said a moment ago, it definitely does have an impact on the ongoing run rate.
It's about a full $5 million. I think as you probably understood based on the comments that we gave a moment ago, it is a little bit – we have put a little bit of a buffer, if you will, into the way that we've guided into Q4 just until we have our arms fully around the issue. We just felt like that that was the smart thing to do in terms of the way that we communicated the way that things would play out for investors. And while we feel like we have a good handle on the issue, we do want to get through all the fixes. But it's kind of a onetime thing in nature we feel. We caught it ourselves and we think we're more or less out of the woods, but we want to be smart about the way that we convey it. Okay, great. And then how many customers will be receiving the credits? I don't have that number off the top of my head, Mark. It's pretty small. I mean we're talking about a single digit number, so I don't know it off the top of my head, but it's in that realm. Okay. The other question I had for you, I think we're looking at base revenue growth. If we look at it sequentially, it's around 7% in Q3 and then you're guiding about 9% for Q4. And if we trended that out and just considered how that would look across four quarters, I think it would get us to something like low 30s to mid 30s. And so, I'm just curious, would you view that as a fair assessment of the glide path on the base revenue currently? And maybe how we'd trend it into next year? Or would you look at this and say it's artificially constrained, I guess, again due to the billing errors and what sounds like a little extra cushion for Q4? Yes. Mark, I'm just not going to comment on anything into 2020. I mean we'll guide it that obviously when we do the Q4 call. I would simply say that in the back half of this year, we have some tough comps as we've signaled previously. We obviously had the political. We had that onetime customer that we've alluded to previously and we've got this billings thing. And so, you're going to have to kind of put that together in your model. But I think we just not in a position to be able to guide out to beyond 2020. I will say is that we feel great about what the results were in the current quarter, 47% organic in spite of the comp, in spite of whatever the self inflicted issues and we feel great about the overall inputs to the business. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin from Piper Jaffray. Thank you and good afternoon. One for Khozema and one for Jeff, if I could. Khozema, I wanted to maybe take a little different slice at the – that the slowdown you saw here. If I just look at the top 10 customer contribution versus the revenue outside of the top 10, it looked like the bulk of the slowdown and the fact you had an $11 million sequential decline in revenue at the top 10. But growth outside of the top 10 actually accelerated from about an 84% growth to 85% growth in the quarter. So as you think about the cohort of top 10 customers that did decline, is it safe to assume that that's where some of the bulk of the credits were applied? And maybe could you just talk about net expansion rates looking at this cohort outside the top 10 that actually accelerated in the quarter? Is there broad-based change to net expansion rates? Or do you think some of these top 10 customer decline sequentially or having a bigger impact on just that calculated net expansion rate? And then again, one quick follow-up for Jeff. Okay, a lot in that. It’s a good question. So just to start off with in terms of the credit itself and where that was placed or the credits. As I said earlier, there were a handful of them, single digits. There were a couple of different customers that would have been in our larger customer base off the top of my head, I don't think they were in the top 10, maybe top 20, but among our larger customers to be sure. In terms of the overall dollar value generated from that top cohort of customers, or in terms of trying pulling that up here, but I think overall that was up actually on a quarter-to-quarter sequential basis. And so, we feel good about obviously the fact that the percentages of total was about flat, which speaks to the concentration of our overall top 10 kind of holding steady or declining as time goes on. But, I think, the premise of the question is incorrect. We'll follow up on the exact map with you offline or in the callbacks, but I don't think that's right. Got it. I thought it was 18% last quarter, 13% top 10 next this quarter. It was 13 last quarter, 13 this quarter. That's right, that's right. Okay and then Jeff, for you getting some questions around RCS. Obviously, we saw four months ago, Google going kind of direct with RCS four months later, when I was in Europe four months later, now you have Verizon, Sprint, AT&T and T-Mobile joining up. I guess the question we're getting from investors here is how should we think about the potential impact of pricing relative to kind of this next gen SMS RCS service, this new consortium? And what that has to do? And what potential impact it could have on the overall business as you think about the next couple of years? Thanks. Yes, absolutely, Brent. Thanks for the question about RCS. So, first of all, Twilio has supported RCS since early 2018 and we're a strong supporter of RCS as a channel. And just as a reminder, you alluded to this. But think of RCS as an upgrade to SMS, right. So the reach is similar, the economics are similar, but it adds new capabilities that you can do within the message, things like commerce or maps or call to action buttons and more. And this is really exciting because we and the developers building on Twilio can build even more rich experiences inside of the core messaging app that's already on all the Android phones.
And so that's really exciting. It opens up new opportunities. Now, the CCMI, the cross carrier messaging initiative that was announced by the four carriers in the United States this week is about building inter-op between those four carriers, which we view will hasten its implementation and its rollout, which is good. So that we and our customers can really start leveraging it because the promise of RCS has been out there for a long time. It's just all been dependent on carriers rolling it out. And when you get the top four carriers in the United States agreeing on rolling it out and how they’re going to do that and inter-operating with each other. That's good. It means that our customers can get the benefit of RCS probably sooner than if the four carriers weren't inter-oping and cooperating on this effort. Your next question comes from the line of Nikolay Beliov [Bank of America Merrill Lynch]. Hi, thanks for taking my questions. My first question is for both George and Khozema. When you look at the expansion rate and specifically the customer cohorts outside of the top 10, what do you think – are the newer cohorts trending in line with the older cohorts? And part B of my question is, are you happy with the expansion rate of the older cohorts? Hi. This is George. Yes, for our newer cohorts, I wouldn't say that the expansion rate characteristics of them have changed materially from quarter-over-quarter. Okay. And I guess a different question for you both. Sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue picked up for the first time about 25% for a while versus historically 20% to 25% of revenues. Is 25% to 30% kind of like the new normal in terms of like sales and marketing spend as you guys overlay a direct sales force? Yes. This is Khozema. I wouldn't say per se that it's the new normal. I mean I think what we've said for a while is that we feel like that we want to continue making investments in the sales and marketing engine, so long as we believe those investments are efficient. I think the one particular outlier as you look at the Q3 numbers is SIGNAL, which shows up as a large onetime expense and also is a driver for the loss that we took in the quarter. So I think you're comparing a little bit of an apple and an orange there in terms of Q2 to Q3. Got it. Thank you. Yes, thanks. Your next question comes from Alex Zukin with RBC Capital Markets. Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. So maybe just on the favorite topic of dollar based net expansion, again. In terms of the guidance for Q4, if we add – and I know this has been asked a little bit, but I'm going to try it a different way. If you add back the credits, you do still see a fairly material drop-off that I think, I mean, by our math, which correct me if I'm wrong, it looks like it's in the very low 120s for Q4. You mentioned both the extra cushion and the bounce back in Q1 in terms of dollar based net expansion and then the anniversarying – completing the anniversarying. So is there any way you can help us just understand kind of which zip code should we be thinking about for a sustainable dollar based net retention? Is it in the 120s? Is it in the one teens? Is it higher than that? Just any help there would be appreciated and then I have quick follow-up. Yes. I'll give you – this is Khozema. Thanks for the question. I'll give you a little bit of a directional math. We don't guide on DBNE specifically, but I'll try to help you in terms of updates to your model. I think the way to think about it is that, in Q3 and Q4 both, as I mentioned earlier, we had extremely elevated growth rates in Q3 2018 and Q4 2018 and approaching 70% in Q3 and then approaching 80% in Q4. And as a result, you had this onetime political dynamic obviously, which contributed pretty significantly and then you also had this onetime customer that we called out. And so, those impacts are obviously stripped out in the back half of this year in the absence of an election and with that customer behavior having normalized.
The second dynamic is that as you pointed out, you do have this credit issue, which also affects a little bit our revenue run rate into Q4 as well. And so, you do have a little bit of a fade in both Q3 and Q4 relative to prior periods in terms of that overall DBNE. And so again, we don't guide on that number specifically. I think you're a little low based on the way that you marked it, but I don't want to provide any real specificity beyond that. As we get into Q1, it becomes a little bit more complicated obviously because you've got a January stub month, and then you've got the anniversary of the SendGrid acquisition, at which point we'll start to fold in that DBNE with our overall DBNE, which just by definition is going to make it come down a little bit. But based on the way that we're currently calculating it, what I will say is that we don't expect that combined rate to come down as much as I'd previously suggested. And again, we're not providing guidance around it for Q4 or out into 2020, but we feel quite good about continued expansion out into 2020. Got it. And then maybe just a follow-up for Jeff or George on Flex adoption. You signed a nice costumer Allianz. I think you guys have previously talked about this business potentially being a pretty meaningful contributor to overall revenue over the next few years. And I'm just curious how should we think about this business over the next two years from a contribution to revenue perspective on a decent timeframe? This is George. So, without commenting specifically on like revenue timeframes, I'll let Khozema to take that on. The question adoption, we are excited about the adoption we're seeing of our customers. And I think that obviously people that are interested in buying Flex are obviously talking to our existing customers. And I think that's a sign that we are seeing success with existing customers in the field. And, yes, we're encouraged by certainly these data points kind of continue us on our journey. And like I said, it's a long journey. We're early, but with a huge market opportunity, we think we have a very differentiated value proposition. And yes, we definitely think that this is something that has a potential for the long-term to be meaningful. In terms of its contribution to revenues, this is Khozema, I think it's in our revenue today obviously. We generate revenue off of the product today and obviously that will continue to grow as time goes on. It's not really a material contributor to revenue yet. We certainly expect it to be over time. I think what I've signaled in the past is that that our expectation is certainly that that would happen over the next several years. And we expect that to be a fairly material number as time goes. But I think in terms of its material contribution to revenue, I wouldn't really anticipate that until really the back end of 2021, maybe 2022. But as George said, we feel great about where things are headed and some of the most recent customer wins. Perfect, thank you guys. Thank you. The next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Hi, this is Dan Church on for Heather Bellini. I just have a quick question. It's been about nine months since the SendGrid acquisition. Any color or commentary you could give us on in terms of how cross-selling initiatives have tracked relative to expectations? Hey, this is George. Yes, I mean, I think you heard our example of the airline that we closed in Q3. So I would say generally speaking, we're on track. I think we've fully integrated at this point the sales forces and we are going together to existing customers and new customers to cross-sell the products. So, yes, I think I would characterize them as on track. Helpful, thanks. I think the rest of mine have been asked. Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Great, thanks. I wanted to refer to kind of the expansion agreement you’ve alluded to in the prepared script. And just to get a sense of timeline of those contracts closed or perhaps more broadly like as you had an applications, what you're seeing around sales cycles when you're not dealing directly with the developer? And then maybe on my second question, gross margins obviously remain very healthy in the quarter. Is there any customer account term we should be kind of thinking of from pricing competition or deals that you kind of walked away from? Thanks. This is George. So, I would say that in terms of the sales cycles, I think, you asked a good question in the sense that we definitely do see two types of sales cycles. I think the ones where we have a developer self-service start in the account, definitely can be relatively shorter cycles. And in our commercial segment, those can be intra quarter transactions at times, so start and complete within the quarter. As we've said, for example, on the other side of the spectrum, for Flex, which typically is not going to be started by self-service developers start, it's more of a sold product so to speak. We've been saying now that for enterprises, these are going to have longer sales cycles. And I think we're seeing that to be true. They're having, what I would describe, even more normalized enterprise cycles and I think that's frankly to be expected and I think that's totally fine. In terms of – can you remind me the second half of your question again? Gross margins. Gross margins, in terms of customer, we haven't seen like a material change in like churn or logo churn, customers leaving from that perspective. So I don't know if Khozema is providing more gross margin color, but that's what we're seeing in the field. Yes, I mean, as it relates to churn, I think George answered the question. I think the only other thing I would say about gross margins is it's in the zone that we have been signaling for a long time. It's kind of where we expected it to be. The only thing you really call out is that it was clipped by about 60 bps due to the billing issue that we've talked about a lot during the course of this conversation. But otherwise it moves around a little bit within that zone due to a variety of factors and we've talked about this in the past. Great, thanks. Your next question comes from the line of Nandan Amladi with Guggenheim Partners. Hi, thanks for taking my question. So as you merge the basic and variable revenue streams, what maybe the way to think about leading metrics as we head into next year? Well, I mean, I think maybe just to take a step back for a second. I mean, I think, the reason that – we're doing that in the first place and I think that variable revenue designation has become a lot less meaningful, certainly in terms of the way that we manage the company internally, the way that we run the company. And so, I think, it was a change that we felt like we should make. It was certainly something that I've been thinking about a long time since I joined the company. But kind of wanted to see the way that it would play out this year in terms of that particular metric, it's also declined pretty substantially 7% of revenue now.
So, I think, what you'll see from us going forward around growth is simply that total revenue instead of necessarily breaking out base variable. We talked about the fact that we would continue to provide some data around WhatsApp given what a significant percentage of variable revenue that's been in the past. But otherwise I think we feel pretty comfortable around total revenue as the metric. We'll obviously report on things like DBNE and ARPU, et cetera, but otherwise that – that's the suite of metrics that you should expect from us. Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Will Power with Baird. Great. Thanks. Yes, just a couple of follow-up questions. Khozema just come back just quickly to the dollar-based net expansion rate. I guess the one other piece that maybe I missed. I think you have said you pulled the variable revenue into that calculation as well. Is that going to begin in 2020 that you do that? And what's the anticipated impact just in terms of kind of level setting in front of that from again WhatsApp and variable revenue being part of that? Hi, Will. You mean on DBNE specifically? What's the impact associated with folding and variable as part of the total calc? Yes. Yes. I think it's going to be pretty de minimis honestly. I mean, I think, that's one of the many reasons that we've been thinking about doing this for some time. I think you won't see immaterial impact. I mean there could be an impact plus or minus 100 basis points, but I don't really think it will be material and something for you guys to think about. Okay. The second part of the question I missed. Yes, I know that that was it. I just wanted to… The timing of the change – the timing of – sorry, the timing of the changes, we'll make that change in Q1. And we'll provide you all with a bridge to make sure that you can see the different moving pieces, so that we're not just bringing a number on you guys for the first time. We'll kind of walk it through. Okay. And then maybe just a question for Jeff or George just the conversations API, it seems like a lot of excitement at SIGNAL from that. I recognize in beta here. But any further color you can provide on early use cases, customer feedback, how you're thinking about the excitement you're seeing? Is that kind of moves into 2020? Yes, absolutely, Will. This is Jeff. So just a quick background, we launched conversations to help companies to connect better with their customers, right. We have – like we've all got experience. A few years ago, it was kind of novel when you got a text message saying your flight was delayed or your flight was boarding or your package got delivered and that was exciting. And then when you reply to the message, it was like nothing would happen. You get back an automated thing. That said if you need help, call us, like it's not a great experience. And so, what we're seeing the leading companies out there do is say, hey look, obviously there's a lot of alerts and things like that and then you should be able to apply and the companies can route it to the employee, who can best help you, sometimes it's an in-store employee, sometimes it's a contact center employee.
It's a variety of workers who instead of like 20 years ago all of these people may have been sitting at desks with a desk phone and now people are out and about. They've got a BYOD device in their pocket and messaging is the preferred medium. And so, really the way consumers connect with the employees of the company has changed and conversations is the product designed to capture that change and enable every company to be able to service their customers in the way that those customers really want to talk to the company. I’ll say that it's brand new product. Obviously, we just announced it at SIGNAL, so it's a beta product. So it’s the very early stages of that product. But I think there's a macro trend here going on. It starts as often happens in the consumer world with how we engage with each other and then bridges into how we want to engage with companies.
And like that notion that I want to text with the company is not necessarily new, it’s just in the past, it's been a one way thing for most companies. And with conversations we're trying to answer the call of making that a two way dialogue. And what I'll say is that since we announced the conversations, no pun intended, it's created a lot of conversations with our customers. And so, I think we've struck a nerve there and it's started to peak interest from customers, but it's super early in the life cycle of that product. Yes, thank you. And your last question comes from the line of Rich Valera with Needham & Company. A follow-up question on SendGrid. Doing the math, it seems like it grew just over 30% in the quarter, which is I think a little better than it's been growing recently and well above, I guess, the 25% sort of bar you'd initially set. So I'm just wondering, given that you're still, I think, somewhat early in the cross-sell process, where you think the growth rate for that could go and could we see that sustained at a 30% plus growth rate in next year as you kind of really flesh out the cross-selling initiative? Yes, Rich. Hi, this is Khozema. In terms of the growth rate for the quarter, it came in at 31%. So your math is right, just about 30%, 31%. We feel pretty good about the growth prospects of the business. I mean, again, we're not going to guide out in the next year, but I think as I've said previously, we would be disappointed I think if the growth rate fell below that. And I think we have a really great shot at it being above that. And so that's kind of in the zone of our expectations. Again, I don't want to provide any like detailed guidance around the number, but our expectations have consistently been somewhere in that range. That's great and just one follow up, if I could, on the expense side. Should we think of the 4Q expense levels as sort of the run rates for going forward and sort of scale upward from them as we head into next year? Is there anything exceptional in Q4 that we would back out? Or is it sort of a good run rate to serve as a base going into the next year? Yeah, that's a good question. I mean, I think we're still figuring out what the 2020 plan is going to be, right. So I wouldn't one way or the other read anything into Q4 necessarily. What I will say is this – is that I think the way that we think about it is, is that so long as we see multi-year elevated growth at scale, we certainly see great opportunities to put investable dollars. And so, there is an opportunity for us to continue investing and continue generating great returns for investors. There's nothing onetime per se. But otherwise, we're looking at our investment deck for 2020 as we speak. And those are the kinds of returns that we're expecting is kind of what you saw in the Q3 from us 47% growth organic at scale. And hopefully we can deliver something elevated in the future. Okay, thank you. There are no further questions at this time. Thank you for participating in today's conference. You may now disconnect.

So in that spirit, I wanted to note that this week kicks off Black History Month here in the United States and, of course, at Twilio. In addition, last week was the celebration of Lunar New Year. So to all those listening, Happy Black History Month and Happy Lunar New Year.
Now, on to the results. Our fourth quarter was a strong finish to a big year for Twilio. Let me quickly touch on a few of the highlights for the full-year. We delivered more than $1.1 billion in total revenue, our first year of more than $1 billion in revenue and a milestone that we’re very proud of.
We acquired SendGrid, our largest acquisition to date, bringing a world-class team and product into the Twilio family. We powered nearly 800 billion interactions. We ended the year with more than 179,000 active customers. And in August, we hosted our largest ever SIGNAL, where we announced several new products, including Conversations, Media Streams, SendGrid Ads and more.
I spend a lot of time with customers around the world, from startups in Silicon Valley, Berlin, Singapore and more to Global 2000 companies, reinventing themselves as software companies in finance, healthcare, hospitality, retail and beyond. And throughout all of these discussions, there’s a common theme.
Companies are looking for new ways to build unbreakable relationships with their customers to build the best engagement experience. It is still day one for most companies, as they reimagine their customer engagement, which leads to a generational opportunity for Twilio to help every company adopt digital engagement strategies for their customers.
Our portfolio of leading communications channels, messaging, voice, video, email and more, combined with higher level application platform products like Flex, is driving deeper, more strategic relationships with new and existing customers alike, who are eager to modernize their engagement strategy. And even with the success we’ve seen, we know that this is still just the beginning.
And we know this success wouldn’t be possible without our developer community. They are the builders, the ones who take our platform and create new solutions and lead us into new product areas that continue to drive our growth. Flex is a great example of this. And in our first full-year with Flex in the portfolio, we are very excited about the progress we’ve made and the opportunity ahead.
We continue to hear great feedback from customers, including one customer, who signed and went live with several hundred agents in less than a month in Q4, who said, “Our prior vendor gave us Christmas presents, Twilio gave us a working contact center.” Our product team has done a great job delivering the features our customers are asking for, and in 2019, delivered more than 70 feature enhancements to Flex and complementary products like Twilio Studio.
And this quarter, we’re planning to introduce a highly requested feature, the programmable dial pad for outbound calling. This enhancement will bring outbound dialing at scale as a native out-of-the-box feature to Flex contact center customers.
As you know, 2019 was also the first year with SendGrid as part of Twilio, and we couldn’t be happier with the success and trajectory of that business. And customers are thrilled to have the email channel available as part of their customer engagement toolkit, and we’re happy to have it added to our customer engagement platform.
The Twilio SendGrid team delivered a great quarter, both in terms of deals, as well as overall performance and scale. George will discuss some of the customer wins, but I wanted to highlight a couple of numbers from the holiday shopping season.
On Black Friday, we processed 4.1 billion emails, which we thought was a lot until we delivered another 4.2 billion emails on Cyber Monday, 45% more than 2018. This is an impressive result and speaks to the success from the entire team in scaling our infrastructure to ensure uptime and deliverability.
I’m proud of the entire Twilio team, which more than doubled in 2019 to over 2,900 employees at the end of the year. And in November, we were named one of America’s Most JUST Companies of 2020, ranking in the top 100 out of 1,000 of the largest publicly-traded companies in areas, including fair pay, ethical leadership, customer treatment and more.
And more specifically, Twilio was recognized for providing a diverse and inclusive workplace, protecting customer privacy and creating quality jobs. This recognition is a credit to Twilions everywhere for creating such a strong culture and I couldn’t be more proud.
But as always, I believe this is day one of Twilio’s opportunity. We started Twilio with a simple idea, make the complex world of communications simpler. And by providing a toolset to developers, we’ve created new software categories, invoice, messaging and email communications all over the world.
But as it turns out, that communications platform was just the beginning. Using our platform, our customers illuminated an even larger act two for the company. It’s not just communications, which needs to be broken down into APIs and unleased on the developers of the world to enable their innovation. No, it’s the apps of engagement as well.
We began the next leg of our journey in 2018 with Flex, taking the idea of an application platform into the contact center. And what we’ve seen customers build and accomplished in the last two years is astounding, reaffirming that when we can help unleash software developers to innovate for their customers, companies win. We’re seeing this response in companies big and small, new and old, across nearly every industry.
And now it’s clear that while the market opportunity for a cloud communications platform is huge, customer engagement is the even larger opportunity as we move forward. As we all know, customer engagement doesn’t begin and end in the contact center. It’s all of the touchpoints a company has with their customers, from marketing and sales to service and support.
And so in the fullness of time, we envision enabling our customers with our platform approach across all of these software categories, becoming a wall-to-wall platform for customer engagement. And it’s this opportunity that makes us so excited about our future and why we are continuing to invest today to capture more of this massive market.
As I’m sure you’ve noticed, we have an ambitious investment plan for 2020. While we could take a profit this year, I think, that would have been a wrong decision. With a generational opportunity to disrupt not just communications, but also customer engagement software, the right decision is to invest for long-term growth and market capture, and that’s what we intend to do.
Our priorities for 2020 reflect our goal of truly capturing this generational opportunity. First, we continue to invest in our products to become the leading customer engagement platform, trusted by developers and enterprises globally; second, continue to scale our systems and infrastructure to support our customers and enable our employees to do their best work; and third, continue to deliver incredible growth.
We’re excited for 2020 and setting ourselves up for the next decade of growth and customer success.
With that, let me turn it over to George. George? Thanks, Jeff. The go-to-market team delivered an outstanding year in 2019, as our investments continue to produce great results. In fact, for the full-year, we more than doubled our number of seven-figure deals compared to 2018, a great sign that we are becoming more strategic to our customers.
We hosted more than 20 Engage in Superclass events around the world and held several enterprise hackathons, on-site hackathons hosted at a customer’s office, where their developers break into teams and build prototypes to solve business challenges.
Our Developer Relations team attended nearly 400 events and welcomed more than 150 new members into the Twilio Champions Program, where we recognize developers for their dedication to the Twilio platform and community. And, of course, in August, we hosted our biggest SIGNAL event ever. It was a great year and I want to thank the entire team for delivering these spectacular results.
We continue to see tremendous momentum in the fourth quarter. So let me highlight just a few of the wins the team closed. We signed a new deal with PayPal, the global digital payments company with more than 300 million customers. As their SMS traffic increased, PayPal sought a new mobile messaging platform that would scale with the company’s growth.
After attending the Creator Summit at SIGNAL, PayPal selected Twilio as its SMS delivery platform to engage with their customers in a more efficient and cost-effective manner. This was a fantastic team effort, and we’re thrilled to be working with this customer.
We formed a new relationship with a Fortune 50 media company that is using Twilio in two different parts of their business: one, replacing an internally developed solution with our programmable video; and two, to power Click to Call services in their proprietary customer experience platform, allowing field techs, agents and management to reach customers quickly and easily and provide higher levels of customer service.
This was also our first full-year with Flex and we are extremely happy with the progress and momentum we are seeing. Here are just a few of the Flex deals we signed in the quarter. We signed a new Flex deal with Southwest Airlines, the world’s largest low-cost carrier with more than 60,000 employees.
Southwest is integrating Flex with their existing platform, their internal IT helpdesk, bringing alerts, green pops, self-service and reporting to their agents, ultimately reducing call volume and total costs.
We expanded our relationship with HubSpot, a leading provider of marketing, sales and customer service software for growing businesses. In addition to expanding its use-of-voice functionality built into their sales hub product, HubSpot is also using Flex with parts of their global sales and support teams to improve productivity and provide omni-channel communications with domestic and international audiences.
We also signed a great new Flex deal with a Fortune 100 company that was looking for a new way to engage with their customers using conversational commerce, who needed a solution that would provide the ability to handle interactions with millions of customers. Flex was selected to become the backbone of their new conversational commerce engine, with plans to ultimately roll out the solution to all of their global experts and in-store employees.
A key focus for us has been expanding our international footprint, where we are strategically targeting named countries with strong developer ecosystems, coupled with large software spends. The international opportunity is tremendous and our early investments in these regions are paying off.
In fact, in the quarter, we announced the opening of our Paris office. And on the heels of that announcement, we signed a great new relationship with Blablacar, the European carpooling leader headquartered in Paris. For years, Blablacar have been dealing with multiple vendors to connect with customers and wanted to consolidate. Already a great SendGrid customer, they chose Twilio with our extensive super network and easy-to-use SMS API to help them innovate on their customer engagement as they continue to scale.
We also expanded our relationship with Woolworths, the leading Australian supermarket and a Global 2000 company. Woolworths developed Willis Go, [ph] an application that allows communication between their fulfillment, delivery drivers and customers. The app uses Twilio proxy and Twilio voice for calls between driver and customer and Twilio SMS for account notifications, along the delivery lifecycle.
We signed a deal with Rappi, the first unicorn out of Latin America that connects a network of couriers to deliver anything from meals to medications to cash. They are already a great proxy SendGrid and voice customer. Now Rappi is expanding to use Twilio messaging for SMS marketing, as well as our verify APIs for text their new payment service, RappiPay. This is a great example of a company building on Twilio, experiencing great success and expanding to more use cases. We’re excited to continue to support Rappi and their outstanding growth.
As Jeff mentioned, we are extremely happy with the performance of Twilio, SendGrid and our cross-sell efforts. We’ve made great strides in our integration. And during the fourth quarter, we unified the buying process by bringing Twilio SendGrid products onto the same order form as our core products. This is an important step for streamlining our customers’ purchase process.
In addition to the cross-sell expansions of Blablacar and Rappi, we also started working with a Fortune 200 bank. Like many financial institutions, they are undergoing significant digital transformation and turned to Twilio to help power their new customer communications hub, which will be the front-end of communications across banking, credit, mortgage and payments. They selected messaging and email to turbocharge their customer communication efforts across SMS and email, with additional channels planned for the future.
My focus for 2020 remains on expanding our enterprise and international reach and continuing to build out our partner ecosystem. The early investments in these areas are paying off, but there’s still a lot of room for us to go.
Overall, the go-to-market team delivered a great quarter to finish off another strong year. With our investments over the last couple of years, we’re well-positioned for 2020 to continue to move up market and build more strategic relationships. Thanks, again, to the entire team.
And with that, I’ll pass it over to Khozema. Thanks, George, and good afternoon, everyone. 2019 was another great year for the business. Twilio continues to enhance customer engagement strategies for leading companies around the world and be the communication platform of choice for developers.
Before getting into the numbers, let me quickly touch on a couple of items. First, we published the quarterly earnings deck, which can be found on our Investor Relations website.
As a reminder, starting with our Q1 2020 report, we will no longer be disclosing separate base and variable revenue categories. This reporting change will impact our calculation of dollar-based net expansion, which historically was calculated using base revenue. In order to help with your models in this presentation, we’ve provided our historical expansion rates using total revenue back to Q2 2016, the quarter we IPO’d.
We also provided what DB&E would have looked like, where SendGrid included in all prior periods as well. This is an important view as you consider the combined DB&E rate going forward.
We also provided a slide for revenue that adjusts our Q4 results from the impact from the two one-time items in Q4 2018. As a reminder, those two items were related to stronger-than-expected political traffic and the ramp of a large international customer. We intend to provide a quarterly earnings deck on our IR website going forward.
Now jumping into the quarter. Q4 base revenue, including Twilio SendGrid grew 65% year-over-year to nearly $307 million. Organic base revenue was $253 million, up 36% year-over-year, strong growth against a difficult comparison from last year. As you’ve heard, Twilio SendGrid had a great finish to the year, delivering nearly $54 million of revenue in the fourth quarter, up more than 30% over last year.
Total Q4 revenue was $331 million, up 62% year-over-year and 36% organically. For the full-year, we delivered total revenue of $1.13 billion, up 75% over last year and 47% on an organic basis. SendGrid contributed $177 million since the February 1st acquisition date. This will be the last quarter that we break out SendGrid revenues separately.
Dollar-based net expansion calculated using base revenue was 124% in Q4. For the full-year, dollar-based and expansion was 136%. There remained a total of six variable customer accounts in the fourth quarter consistent with prior quarters. WhatsApp represented approximately 6% of revenue in the fourth quarter. Because we will no longer be breaking out base and variable going forward, we expect to provide WhatsApp’s contribution to revenue in 2020.
We finished the year with more than $179,000 active customer accounts. Revenue from our top 10 active customer accounts contributed 14% of total revenue in Q4, compared to 13% last quarter and 20% in Q4 of 2018.
Gross margins came in at 57% for Q4, consistent with the mid to high-50s that we’ve discussed in the past. It was down slightly from last quarter due to some increased international usage we saw in the quarter, along with the normal puts and takes, including customer, product and country mix, carrier fees, FX and others. For 2020, we expect gross margins to continue to be in the mid to high-50s.
Looking at 2020, we’re expecting revenue of $1.475 billion to $1.490 billion for growth of 30% to 31%, driven by strength in our core products and continued high growth of newer products like email and Flex.
Importantly, while the Verizon ADP program went live over the weekend, our guidance does not include any revenue benefit or margin impact from ADP fees. We are also guiding to a non-GAAP operating loss of $50 million to $60 million for 2020.
Let me walk through the progression you should see throughout the year to help with your models, as well as talk about the rationale behind these figures. You can see our guidance of a loss of $22 million to $25 million in Q1 and we currently expect Q2 to show a higher loss, given that SIGNAL falls in May this year. Afterwards, we expect smaller losses in Q3 and then get back to break-even in Q4.
Now as to the drivers behind these investments, some are transitory in nature that we believe will benefit the business greatly in the long run and one is a bit more structural. First, we’re opening an R&D Center of Excellence in India to provide a force multiplier to our R&D efforts. Getting this office off the ground will drive a good deal of investment in early 2020. But we believe the long-term benefits of these investments are substantial.
Second, we’re stepping up our investments in our systems and infrastructure to drive further efficiencies in our internal processes and position us for scale with the anticipated growth in the coming years. We have discussed our billing system as an example previously and we have also identified opportunities to enhance the systems supporting our quote to cash, procure to pay and engineering processes, with the objective of improving efficiencies and achieving higher optimization in these areas. This step-up in our investments here in 2020 will ensure infrastructure is ready, as we continue to deliver elevated growth.
Third, we’re continuing to invest aggressively in our go-to-market team and Flex, in particular. We’ve maintained efficient sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue. And as we’ve said previously, so long as we can continue to make those investments in an efficient fashion, we will continue to invest in this area.
In particular, we see significant opportunities in the enterprise, internationally and in Flex. On flex specifically, over the last several quarters, we scored significant wins with digitally native and enterprise customers, and we continue to see tremendous interest in the marketplace. Jeff mentioned the programmable dial pad and there are also a number of other investments that will add significant features and functionality to our existing products.
Finally, you may recall, I mentioned we were looking at making changes to our stock-based compensation philosophy on the call last quarter. We’ve heard investor feedback regarding SBC and dilution. And to address this, we have begun implementing certain structural changes around stock-based compensation. These changes will take time to flow through the numbers, but we expect a near-term cost that is more than offset by reduced dilution over time.
We’re not going to go into detail on these changes today. However, we believe these changes will help us drive stock-based compensation expense as a percentage of revenue down over time as the company scales. These investments will enable Twilio to continue to deliver elevated levels of growth, scale the business and create leverage over the next several years.
Before we open the call for questions, I wanted to mention that we plan to hold an Investor Day this year on Thursday, May 21, during our SIGNAL Conference in San Francisco. Stay tuned for more information from the IR team.
To close, 2019 was another strong year of growth and innovation for Twilio. After a little more than a year at the company, I’m even more excited to be here and help lead this company, as we continue to disrupt this massive market and deliver our customers’ continued innovate with our customer engagement platform.
Thank you to, everyone, for joining. Operator, please open the line for questions. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Great. Thank you so much, guys, for taking the question. I wanted to ask a little bit, you cited the ambitious plan for investments in 2020. You talked a little bit about where they’re focused with the R&D Center in India, for example. But also wanted to ask a little bit if you could share with us some color on how we should think about that increased investment from a direct sales perspective? And if maybe you can share kind of their direct sales growth that maybe you had or sales capacity growth you had in 2019 and if you’re actually thinking about accelerating that growth into 2020?
And then just a follow-up, I think, George, you commented about the unified buying process and getting to that between Twilio and Send for Q4. How significant is that streamlined purchase process? And how important can it be for 2020? Thank you. So, Heather – hey, this is Khozema. There’s a couple of questions in there. So just to take the first one, I wouldn’t say, there’s a step-up per se in our sales investment. I mean, we’ve been investing in that area pretty significantly over the last couple of years. We found that, that investment has had a pretty strong payback. We’ve been efficient in terms of the way that we’ve spent that money. I think we’ve maintained really strong and efficient percentages in terms of sales as a percentage of overall revenue.
And so I think as long as we see the efficiencies that we’ve been seeing over the last several years, we’re going to continue making those investments. It has stepped up a little bit from year-to-year over the last couple of years, but nothing really markedly.
And I think, as we explained earlier in our prepared remarks, I think, what we find is, is that as long as that efficiency exists, as long as it delivers elevated growth, we’re just going to keep making that investment. So that – that’s kind of the first part of the question.
And then let me turn it over to George to answer the second part of the question. In terms of streamlining the sales of SendGrid Twilio sales mission, that’s gone, I think, that’s going very well. We had – we’ve been integrating the systems and the teams. We had a plan of integrating the specialists overlay team. We turned our SendGrid team into an email specialist team, that has gone very well. We’ve actually seen the results of that some of the deals we talked about on the call.
And then what we’ve been doing over the last quarter is really been streamlining the infrastructure below that in terms of the order forms and order processing. And I think that our customers are going to benefit from that as well. So I think that puts us in a very good position for 2020 to do even better on that front. Thank you. Your next question is from Meta Marshall of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Great. Thanks. In terms of kind of some of the G&A improvements that you’ve made, just on kind of how many – like when should we see the impact of that? And just on completion of a grander review after some of the billing issues last quarter? Just kind of any direction as to where those investments are focused?
And then maybe a second question is just on Flex and just progress with system integrators, any insight there would be helpful? Thanks. Yes. So there’s a couple of things in there Meta. Let me just – let me hit the billing piece of it first, then I’ll kind of talk about some of the other ones. So just in billing, in general, I’m sure this question is going to come up later. And I think in terms of whether or not we’ve seen any issues relative to what we saw last quarter, the answer, in short, is no. It is an area that we’ve obviously made a number of investments in.
Our confidence in that process and in our people is extremely high. And I think any future issues that we might anticipate in that particular area, we do not think we’re going to have a material impact on any of the guidance that we’re providing today. I would say, in addition to that, we continue adding feature and functionality, some additional controls as well to ensure that, that process is robust and continue scaling with the balance of the company.
There’s sort of a broader point around systems process and infrastructure more broadly. We pointed to quote to cash, for example; engineering tools and systems, as another example; and then a third being around procure to pay. I think these are all broad processes, obviously.
We think that they’re good investments that we can make in both the processes and the systems associated with those. And we think there’s – this now is the right time to make some of those investments and we think that’s going to provide long-term leverage to the P&L.
The third thing, you mentioned G&A. I don’t think we particularly called it out per se in our prepared remarks. But just a note on it, since you mentioned it is, we have had some leverage in the G&A line over the last couple of years. I think some things that we’re doing, along the lines of processes and systems, I think, the India investment, not necessarily G&A-related, but will help over time. And then, we alluded to some of the things that we’re doing around SBC, all of those things, we think, structurally will drive long-term improvements in the P&L. On the Flex SI side, I feel very good about the progress that we’ve made. Our goal has always been to grow the ecosystem of partners to the place where it doesn’t hold us back from a sales side of being able to make customers successful. And if you look at some of the logos that we’ve closed, both in the current quarter, as well as previous quarter that we announced that we’re talking about global customers, global deployments and that speaks to increasing SI coverage.
And I’m also very excited about our recent hire of our new Chief Customer Officer, Glenn Weinstein, who comes to us out of a major global SI. And that, I think, will continue to turbocharge our direction as he brings his experience and leadership to continue to accelerate our efforts to work with the SI community. Great. Thank you, guys. Your next question comes from Alex Zukin of RBC. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. So maybe just to – I’ll try to maybe ask the – Heather’s question different way around sales rep hiring. I think, given the level of investments that you’re making in the business and given the opportunity set, should we assume that 2020 could see the same type of rep hiring acceleration maybe as 2018?
And then on the – on dollar-based net retention, if we look at the trend line, how should we think about that rate, as we start to kind of look at the back-half of next year? Obviously, there’s a tailwind in the first quarter. But just curious what your updated thinking is about the trajectory of that rate over the course of the year? Yes. Let me take the second part first, in terms of DB&E. I mean, obviously, it’s not something that we’ve historically guided to, and we’re not going to guide to it today for the balance of the year.
With that said, I mean, I think one of the things that we try to do, so that you guys could work with appropriate numbers for your models is, is that we put a page into the investor deck that illustrates what the DB&E would have looked like, had SendGrid been a part of the business since the IPO of the company.
And so that gives you a pretty good run rate sense in terms of what some of your expectations should be around that number. And we’ve also pretty consistently said that, as the business is growing and getting so much larger, that we do anticipate that, that number is going to fade a little bit over time, just given the law of large numbers. But otherwise, I mean, we feel good about the number that we put up certainly for the quarter, certainly for the year and have good expectations relative to our guidance into 2020.
In terms of the sales investments, maybe I can start and then if George has anything to add, he can do that. I wouldn’t say that there’s anything sort of extraordinarily out of the ordinary in terms of those sales investments. I think, what we try to do is provide a bridge around, there’s a number of different investments that we’re making all at the same time in the current year. That’s one of them. That’s one of them that we found a lot of efficiency in.
And so I think we have an opportunity to continue investing there in a market way and we’re going to keep doing so as long as it’s efficient. It’s not an uptick relative to where we’ve been. It’s not an uptick relative to what you saw maybe from a few years ago. I think, it’s kind of a steady state, but that in conjunction with some of the other areas is the step-up investment – in investment. I think, Khozema said it well. Honestly, I view us as mostly continue to hire on a – our grower sales capacity on a very steady clip. As long as the efficiency is good, we’ll continue to do that. And we’ll – honestly, a lot of the 2020 numbers are going to reflect hiring that we have done already in 2019, and especially the back-half of 2019. And so, I think a lot of that’s already baked in, so it doesn’t speak to just a 2020 difference, it’s just a lot of the 2020 numbers reflect activity that’s even happened in 2019. Your next question comes from Nikolay Beliov of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Hi. I have a couple of questions for George. George, you mentioned seven-figure deals were up 2x the last year versus the prior year. I was hoping if you can give us some more color and maybe anecdotes on why you guys win in those deals? What are the main drivers customers are choosing Twilio, et cetera?
And my second question is, there seems to be more of a streamlining of the sales process around solutions, around marketing operations, customer service and more use case-based selling. If you can talk to us a little bit more details how you’re setting up the sales organizations to do that, which contract in the path of sending SMS or voice or video, now it’s more use case than solutions-based selling? And how that might impact the sales cycles. Thanks so much. Yes. Thanks for the question. So in terms of the larger transactions, I think that mostly it’s just a product of us growing our capacity, as well as growing more strategic conversations. I think, if you came to SIGNAL this past year, our Creator Summit, which is our kind of executive track grew significantly in attendance, which I think speaks to us having larger conversations. And we mentioned on the call, or I mentioned on the call that PayPal came out of that or that was a factor in the PayPal conversation.
So I think it’s a really just a factor of capacity, plus more strategic conversations, as well as the product set evolving to have those more strategic conversations with technologies like Flex, like Conversations. And I think that – that’s the product of our positioning around customer engagement, frankly, versus kind of where we’ve been.
In terms of the use case selling, certainly, look, we are constantly evolving the way we talk to our customers. If you followed us in our Engage Roadshow and kind of the way we articulate the customer engagement message, I think, we’re getting smarter about pitching use cases and solutions absolutely.
But fundamentally, our approach to sales is pretty straightforward, which is that we believe that because we position as a customer engagement platform, we want to have one account team that owns the broad relationship with the customer. It’s able to sell multiple products, multiple APIs, multiple solutions versus having a lot of separate Salesforce is going after different like a messaging versus voice Salesforce.
We have one team that really is there to work with a customer to understand our end-to-end customer engagement vision and then help use the Twilio platform to really help bring that vision to life and we’ll support that with a small number of specialist teams. But the heart of our conversation with customers is a broad-based multi-product end-to-end solution-oriented conversation with the customer. Your next question is from Brent Bracelin of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Thanks. One for Khozema and one for Jeff, if I could. Khozema, just trying to go back to the investment ambitious plans here, and the question really is why now? Is this really about investing ahead for scale and scaling the business, or is there something you’re hearing from customers and customer poll that they’re asking you to do more, so external versus internal? Yes. I mean, I think it’s a little bit of both honestly. I mean, I think in large part, I mean, just to kind of answer the question broadly, we see a lot of opportunity. And I think you always want to invest behind that opportunity. And the kind of implicit trade that we’ve always made with investors is that so long as our investments yield elevated growth that we feel like those are the right investments to make.
Now, more specifically, in terms of internally, we obviously lapped $1 billion in 2019, which we feel great about. And just given the rate at which we’re growing and the scale of the company, it sure feels like right now is the right time to invest in all the different systems and processes and infrastructure that go with scaling the company. Certainly, if we were to wait and do this several years from now, that would be a lot more difficult. And so this is kind of a – an advanced investment on our ambitions in that respect.
I think the other dynamic is, as you heard from both Jeff and George, there’s a lot of enthusiasm in the marketplace relative to our products. Flex is the one that we called out specifically, but the same goes for all of our other offerings. And we have an opportunity on the back of that enthusiasm to be able to really capture market share. And that’s exactly what we want to do.
And I think if we can do that in a smart and efficient way, we kind of talk to you through a progression that we expect in terms of the P&L for the year. We feel like now is exactly the right time to make those investments. Helpful color. And then, Jeff, just one quick one here. Conversations, API, you’ve obviously talked about that, there was quite a buzz once you release that product. Any color relative to adoption uptake? Is that trending in line with your expectations – above your expectations? Any color there on Conversations would be helpful? Yes. Thank you, Brent, for the question. It’s nice to be able to talk in our Q&A session. We – we’re excited to launch Conversations at SIGNAL last year. And as a quick reminder, this is a product that is designed to enable multi-channel and multi-party conversations across channels like SMS, MMS, WhatsApp, chats, and more. And we see use cases across a wide variety of industries, places where you essentially want a plurality of people inside of a company be able to engage with a customer in a SINGLE long running conversation scenarios like in retail, where you might have a store in play, talking to a customer, as well as a contact center agent talking to a customer or a delivery scenario like where you have a delivery person delivering an item that was prepared by a restaurant, that is supported by a contact center, right, these are complex interactions that are now increasingly happening over messaging type channels. And so this product is there to address it.
As such, this is a beta product. So it’s new in the market. It’s only been in the market since August when we announced it at SIGNAL. And so we are in the early phases. We’re getting customers educated about the product. We’re seeing customers adopt it, and we’re seeing them give us feedback. And so it’s doing exactly what I’d expect as a beta product, which is getting customers onboard, getting them educated and having them show us where we should take the product in addition to getting into GA and where it is going to continue to grow in the future.
So we’re very happy with the progress. so far. We think this is a large untapped opportunity, because a lot of these workflows that I mentioned are actually brand-new. These workflows didn’t exist five or 10 years ago, especially over messaging. And so to be able to bring a leading product to the market, that is addressing this new use case for which there has really not been a solution in the past, it is really exciting. We continue to work with customers and looking forward to bringing that product to GA and growing it from there. Your next question is from Mark Murphy of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Thank you. Jeff, you’re commenting on plans for not just contact center, but also mentioning marketing and sales, service and support and those are monster markets, they have these huge application stack. Could you share any insights on how you can complement what Salesforce offers in those areas? And just how you plan to innovate there to kind of change the game like you have a Flex?
And then Khozema, I was wondering what are your assumptions for election traffic this year, given it looks like there’s going to be less of that activity that will happen on Twitter and Google in the past? Absolutely, Mark. Thanks for the question. So I’ll start by answering your question about the engagement platform. What we’re seeing is basically a different approach is needed by certain customers, where a platform approach as opposed to an app-centric approach, for certain customers and certain needs, is really benefiting them. And that’s what we’ve learned from Flex.
What Flex is really designed for companies who want to build and for companies who are putting the developers on the front lines of winning the hearts and minds of their customers by using technology and using software and importantly, using digital channels to go out and win in the market and be able to build what the customers want them to build. And we don’t think that opportunity is limited to just the contact center. We see opportunities across a wide variety of customer touchpoints to really bring that platform approach to enable the innovation of our customers.
Now, that said, we are really focused on Flex. Flex is a big undertaking. We are in the early days of that product. We’re very excited with the progress. And so as a company, we are very focused on the success of Flex in the short-term. But what we want to point out is the bigger picture here is that, we do feel there is an opportunity, as we listened to customers and the customers guide us to use a similar approach to tackle a wider variety of problems.
Now, I think this is a very different approach than anyone in the market. I think it’s very complementary to existing approaches that are out there today. And so I’m really not thinking about anything from the perspective of what other companies are doing. I’m really just thinking about how are we listening to our customers and providing something that customers need in order to unlock their innovation with a different approach than we will have seen before. Hey, Mark, this is Khozema. On the political traffic, we are building in some expectation of revenue from political in the 2020 guidance, but we’re not breaking it out. I would say that we expect some return to what we saw traffic-wise back in 2018. And I think depending on how it plays out during the course of the year, we may or may not provide updates on that, but there is a little bit in there in terms of the guidance. Your next question comes from Rishi Jaluria of D. A. Davidson. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Hi, guys. This is Hannah on for Rishi. Thank you for taking my question. So I’m just following up on the previous question. So it’s good to hear you guys have been having success with Flex during the quarter. I know it’s still early, but could you talk about any changes you’ve seen in the competitive environment, or with win rates, especially as you’ve added the new functionality like [bringing new] [ph] dial pad? I think that – I don’t think we’ve seen a massive change in the competitive environment. I think what we’ve seen is our playbook for essentially, being able to close a Flex transaction, I think, has gotten more sophisticated. And I think it’s much more predictable now at this point. We’ve brought on – we’ve grown our specialist team in this area and they’ve worked really close with our customers to build something that’s repeatable.
I think we have a good sense at this point of which type of customers or the builders are the best fit for the product, have the need and the internal DNA to be a great fit for Flex. And so I think we’re more productive, frankly, with our sales calories on Flex than we were, let’s say, this time a year ago. So I feel like that has really made us be much more able to predictably and successfully work with Flex customers and grow that business over time. And that’s why I think we’re very positive about the product. Your next question is from Michael Turrin of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Hey, there, thanks. Good afternoon. Last quarter, you called out newer expansion agreements that I think the reference number was 50 G2K. And I just thought that’s useful in terms of classification. I don’t want to sort of push you into guiding to that on a regular basis of providing that color.
But I think what would be useful, given some of the questions here around investment spend would be just wondering if there’s a thumbnail sketch you could maybe give us in terms of how you view core G2K penetration today, whether it’s in terms of greenfield opportunity and landing some new customers, or just even where you view penetration within existing customers relative to what’s possible, given kind of the evolution of the platform you’re describing here today? I think that it’s very clear from no matter how you slice the data that we have a massive greenfield opportunity in the G2K. The vast majority of the G2K today is not spending material dollars today with us and even the ones that we have that are – we have – and we also have many that are very small customers, one of the leading car rental players in the world, for example, today probably spend like $4 a month with us and that’s the customer that we’re working with. And we think over time could probably be spending hundreds of thousands of dollars with us. And that’s just an example.
So there’s really no shortage of opportunity. And every time that we talked to a small customer or a greenfield prospects, there’s definitely opportunity for Twilio. And I think that’s one of the reasons why we are excited about this investment. Because we believe now that over the past few years, we’ve proven that we have a playbook that can successfully go into the enterprise, go to the G2K. And as we’ve hired capacity, it’s proven to be productive. So – and that gives us confidence that we can continue extend and bring this playbook to more customers and more opportunity. Michael, we’ll think about incorporating that metric on the Investor Day. I mean, there’s a number of ones that – we’ll probably break out, not going to say what those are, obviously, today, but we’ll take that into account. Your next question is from Derrick Wood of Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Great. Khozema, you guided for 44% to 45% growth in Q1 and 30% to 31% for the year, which does imply good amount of deceleration. Anything to share around assumptions with the progression across the year? And whether or not you’re expecting any change in run rate from some of your larger customers?
And then just as a follow-up on Flex. When you guys launched Flex in Q4 of 2018, it was a 1.0 solution. Just curious how much it’s matured? How to think about the major milestones in 2020? And what you guys think that could do for demand for the year? Thanks. Yes. Thanks, Derrick. So for Q1, and I think the one big thing that you have to bear in mind is, is that we get the benefit of an extra month of SendGrid relative to the compare in Q1 of 2019. And so that elevates the number a little bit on an inorganic basis relative to what it would look like on an organic basis. That’s for the remainder of the year, I mean, we feel good about the guidance that we provided at this time. And I think that we’ll be able to hit those numbers and feel good about our overall expectations. Your next question comes from Patrick Walravens of JMP. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Oh, great. Thanks very much. So, Khozema, when we met with you back in November, you were talking about all the projects that you would like to be able to fund in – if I remember, I’m right, there was order to cash, which was the billings and then there was customer experience, which was basically a lot of interfaces and connections, and then there was maybe procure to pay and maybe the data architecture. I’m just wondering, are – does this plan funds all four of those areas? Hey, Pat, good to hear from you. I think it does. I mean, I think as we called out earlier in the prepared remarks, I mean, these are big areas. They’re cross functional, they require a number of different systems and processes to work efficiently. And these are investment areas that we’re stepping up our spending in to be able to scale the company for the future.
And I think, as we do so, we think that these investments will allow us to more efficiently deliver elevated growth, scale the business and then ultimately create leverage. So I would say, relative to the wishlist that you alluded to, certainly a 90%-plus of that is included in our investment level. Your next question comes from of Bhavan Suri of William Blair. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. I guess, this one is for George. Jeff, maybe a little bit here. But if you look at your your G2K customers or just even a large enterprise and you talked about a greenfield opportunity. And let’s exclude Flex for a second. The use cases seem really different, right? So private wealth messaging application, a car ride sharing application, a pizza delivery application, right? So we can go through all of these.
But one thing that happened to the platform is the common use cases allow you to sell faster and easier into that industry of the vertical. I’d love to just understand how you guys are, a, seeing, what kind of common use cases are appearing across verticals that allow that sort of pay [indiscernible] doing this, you guys should do this or benefit of doing this, allow you to penetrate the untapped players in the same verticals in that G2K space or cross-sell other stuff.
Obviously, the platform has been great and Flex is a great use case, but just the core offering and even for programmable wireless, love to see if you’re starting to see common use cases and how you guys think about using those sort of drive penetration within those specific verticals? Hey, Bhavan. Thank you. This is Jeff. I’ll take the question. So, I think it’s interesting. If you think about every company, big and small, new and old, the good really doesn’t matter the vertical, every company is looking to engage with their customers across all the various touchpoints they have with their customer and then connect the dots, like make it, so it’s not a bunch of disparate, disconnected experiences, but it really feels like a customer journey that plays together.
And so when we talk to customers, typically, there’s something that is the starting point. Some place where they are really trying to increase the customer engagement, that is obvious. It’s the pain points in their product or in their customer experience, and that’s the starting point. And we start working with them.
And then from that starting point, we have this opportunity. It’s like the foot in the door. And so what’s the rest of the customer journey and what’s the next big pain point, and that’s part of the company that is trying to improve that customer experience.
And so I’ll give you an example, right? This is – it’s a pretty common type of flow, where a customer might come to us and say, well, the first thing you want to do is really just alert a customer when such and such happens. When my package ships, when the color is ready, and when the food is ready, when your table is ready, when you’re trying to log in, whatever it is. And you say, great, we look at them in that first use case.
But then the natural next question is, great, what happens when people reply to that message? Oh, that’s a really good question. And so that starts to get into a conversation about how we’re using messaging in, for example, their contact center or if they reply to that message ought to be routed to the delivery person or the retail store agents, or wherever it is, that can be a conversation about Conversations, no pun intended.
And so you can see how it naturally leads from like the obvious use cases that are often like the lowest-hanging fruit inside of a company to create a better type of engagement and then expand it out from there. And so I think, there’s like every account is a little bit different, like what’s on their mind when they come to us, what their pain point is and what it is they’re trying to solve for. But there is a common playbook in many ways of going in and saying after we solve that, like how do we ultimately in the fullness of time connect all these dots together to create a really compelling customer engagement model or customer journey in this area that you’re coming thus far is just a starting point. Yes. I think just to add on to that. I think, look, I think what Jeff said is absolutely true. I think at the same time, we’re always looking to streamline our cost of sales by in a reusing patterns that are leverageable across use cases and also across verticals. So I think you’ll see over time over the next few years, you’ll see us start to add some more vertical orientation, let’s say, to some of our sales efforts. We have like some really, I think, very small, big, like kind of green shoots on that front.
And then I do think that, as Jeff said, across industry, there really are some common patterns and there’s depending on which industry six to nine use cases that we typically promote over and over again and train our Salesforce, I think, pretty rigorously on. And I think all of that makes us more confident that we can continue to ultimately long-term scale the investment and maintain good productivity, which is what ultimately this is all helping us do. Your next question is from David Hynes of Canaccord. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Hey, thanks very much. So maybe for Jeff. One topic that hasn’t come up on the call is the opportunity with IoT. I think we all get the applicability for connected doorbells and home security stuff. But maybe what are some of the less obvious areas, where you’re seeing customers innovate? And then big picture, is this opportunity just a nice to have, or do you think it could be a material contributor to the business at some point? Absolutely. Thank you, David, for the question. We – to answer the latter part of the question first, I think, the IoT is a fantastic opportunity and I think it can be an enormous business for us. I kind of think of it as a – the next platform that we’re starting to build. But if you roll back the clock 12 years when we started the company, we started with voice and then we added messaging and that really led us to customer engagement as the big area of the company.
But we’re planting seeds now for the next big platform that will expose the next great set of use cases and that is the IoT domain and that’s what we’re doing with our Twilio IoT product.
Related to your question, like what are the non-obvious use cases? Yes, it is interesting. When you think of IoT, people often jump to the stuff that you wear the sockets in your house, because that’s what we as consumers see. But actually, I think, a much bigger area, both of existing marketing opportunity is in a lot of the industrial type applications and in the smart city type applications.
One customer we had on stage at SIGNAL last year is in the smart garbage space, which is one that I don’t know about you, like I never really thought about a lot in my life. But when the customer explains the problem they’re solving, it makes a ton of sense, right? You got garbage trucks that drive around blindly just running the same route every week, stopping it every garbage can and half of them are empty and the other half of them are overflowing.
And so with their solution, they can put a smart sensor inside of a garbage dumpster that says the fill level and then notify centrally, which dumpsters need to be emptied and which ones don’t. And then the trucks can drive around to just the dumpsters that need emptying. And it saves fuel, because they’re not driving the dumpsters that don’t need emptying.
Their customers are happier, because their dumpsters are empty when they need to be. Everybody wins, and they save a lot of money and environmental impacts are great. So there’s a lot of different aspects of it. And that’s a good example of the use case that like I never would have thought of before we launched this product. Yes, now we see in the domain of smart cities and industrial type use cases, fleet tracking, there are tremendous opportunities in IoT, and we’re seeing new use cases arise because of the narrowband opportunity.
In fact, the smart garbage customers in sale is really enabled by the fact that MBIoT has the very lightweight battery drain profile that it does, which means they can put this sensor wirelessly connected to the Internet into a garbage dumpster and not have to recharge it always. It’ll last for years on a single battery, and that’s a key enabler of some of these brand-new use cases. Your last question comes from Ittai Kidron of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Thanks. I guess, I want to focus a lot on you, George, the Salesforce and the build-out there. I mean, the portfolio is clearly growing quite extensively in the range of discussions you have with companies is almost on a quarterly basis is expanding. Help me understand how do you think about productivity with such a moving goalpost? And how do you think about the efficiency of the Salesforce that you have? How do you measure that? What kind of gains you expect there? And that will be great.
I mean, I think a lot of people understand the push into the enterprise that comes probably with a little bit longer sales cycles. But help me understand what can one person really deliver well within the portfolio that you have right now? So I think it’s a good question. Obviously, we’re not going to go into like all the details of – all our sales metrics. Just at a high level or a conceptual level, if we look for how much incremental revenue and margin can a salesperson bring in relative to their costs. I mean, it’s not that complex, a calculation when you think about it that way.
And our goal is to – we have very good productivity right now. And our goal is to over time as we scale the Salesforce, scale it as long as we see that efficiency and productivity staying high and ideally try and maintain it where it is. I think it’s very hard as you scale to large numbers to actually grow the productivity of your Salesforce dramatically.
So I wouldn’t use that term. But I think if we can maintain high productivity and certainly clear our hurdle rate for investment, then I think we feel good about it. And we’re at that point right now still, so we’re expanding. We have completed the allotted time for questions. Thank you for participating in today’s conference.

Before I begin discussing the quarter, I want to express that safety has been top of mind for us these past couple months. Our decisions are driven by a belief that the safety of our team, our customers in the world at large are what's most important. With that in mind, I hope that you all are faring well during this challenging time, and that you and your families and friends are safe and relatively comfortable as we ride this out.
I also want to stress that safety of our employees has been top of mind during COVID-19 and we move to a fully distributed work model in early March. I want to thank our employees for their flexibility during this time and for their mutual support of each other, and of our customers. You all exhibited the Twilio magic, and I thank you.
While we wouldn't have wished it this way, in many ways, Twilio was built for this. Our platform provides three things the world needs, digital engagement, software agility, and cloud scale. Technologies such as messaging, email, voice and video have enabled many parts of the economy to continue working, while keeping its participants safe. Moving quickly, building prototypes and iterating as our needs evolve has been critical for nearly every kind of organization. That's the essence of agility. And Twilio has enabled organizations to reimagine many of their communications workloads in days and weeks, not months and years.
As you can tell from the numbers, Q1 was a strong quarter for the company, both before the COVID-19 impact again and as the impact is starting to be felt across society. Our diversified customer base currently consists of over 190,000 organizations, spanning many industries, countries and companies sizes, from startups to fortune 500s, non-profits and even government bodies. This diversification served us well during this period of time. While some customers saw declines, others saw growth. As you can imagine, customers in hospitality and travel have exhibited very unusual patterns during this period.
First, there were spikes in volume as airlines and hotels dealt with rebookings and cancelled flights during the transition from pre-COVID-19 into travel restrictions and shelter in place protocols. Then, there was a stark decline as business slowed. Another example is that rideshares saw a large decline during this time, with offsets in many cases by sharp increases in demand for food delivery, curbside pickup and retail logistics.
In addition, telehealth and work from home contact centers saw a pickup of adoption during this time. While we are cautiously optimistic, no one can predict what exactly will transpire in the back half of the year given the uncertainty of the macroeconomic environment. So while we are certainly seeing headwinds to our business and certain industries, we believe that we have a resilient business model because of our diversified customer base. And long-term, we expect that usage and many of the impacted industries will return and others that may be newer to use cases will continue to grow in importance. We also saw other use cases where a project that was slated for sometime in the future became ""we need this now."" And we made several product announcements in the quarter to strengthen our offering.
We announced that several of our products are now HIPAA eligible, meaning customers can more easily utilize our voice, video, SMS and fit products to develop communication workflows containing protected health information in a compliant way. HIPAA is another milestone for Twilio in elevating our data privacy and security to meet the needs of our HIPAA compliant customers. And we are committed to providing a platform trusted by customers and patients.
We also released Flex Dialpad to public beta, enabling outbound calling from Flex Instances. We also announced Flex Boost, which provides technical, operational and financial resources for contact centers affected by COVID-19. Shortly thereafter, we also launched Video Boost giving qualified prospects three free months of our video API. We've seen companies across multiple industries adapt in real-time to the COVID-19.
Digital transformation projects that could have taken years such as transitioning from an on-prem contact centre to the cloud instead took a weekend. Developers and companies big and small got to work, reconfiguring the world for a work from home and nearly 100% ecommerce reality.
Let me give you just a few used cases across various industries that we've helped our customers with over the last couple of months.
With shelter in place and social distancing going into effect, demand for telehealth solutions has soared. Virtual care became a new reality for doctors, nurses, clinicians and millions of patients around the world and Epic, the company that supports the comprehensive health records of 250 million people mobilized to build its own telehealth platform, powered by Twilio's programmable video. The solution allows providers to launch a video visit with a patient, review relevant patient history and update clinical documentation directly within Epic.
Protecting customers and employees from unnecessary in person contact became a top priority for many businesses including Comcast. Over the course of just a few weeks, developers at Comcast integrated Twilio voice into their homegrown customer database, enabling technicians and customer care to contact customers for service requests remotely. They also initiated a pilot to incorporate Twilio video into the same database, which can enable a customer to use the camera on their phone to show a Comcast technician their setup and the technician can walk them through a self diagnosis and repair without ever setting foot in their home.
With widespread school closures, online learning has gone mainstream in [indiscernible], posing new challenges to keep students engaged and on track with their studies. Blackboard is using Twilio SMS for critical communications to connect patients and teachers and keep students updated. And schoolclosures.org deployed a distributed contact center on its Flex, in two days to connect families and teachers during the closures with an educational specialists who have experience teaching from home.
Nearly every contact centers, especially those on-prem needed to be reconfigured to support distributed workforces and increased usage. The city of Pittsburgh needed a way to enable 311 operators to continue to perform their critical work without going into the legacy on premises call centre as usage was spiking in response to COVID-19. They turned to Twilio Flex for a solution. And within four days, we're up and running with agents working safely from home and no disruption in service for residents.
Nonprofits have also had the scale up to support the unprecedented demand of the current environment. City Harvest provides New Yorkers with emergency food relief in a safe way through Trunk a Phone, an SMS reservation system built in partnership with United Way for New York City on Twilio. And with 62% more clients scheduling appointments and a 474% growth in volume of messages from partners. They are helping more people basically get food during this critical time.
I'm incredibly proud of the Twilio team for how they performed in the first quarter and how they've adapted to the ever changing environment. We know that circumstances like these often bring opportunities and based on the numerous new use cases and unprecedented digital acceleration that happened over the last month, I believe that this time has actually created even more long-term opportunities for us to address.
As such, I'm even more excited about what lies ahead for Twilio. I want to give a thank you to our twilio.org team for everything they've done to respond to this pandemic. Within a week of COVID-19 being declared a global pandemic, clear.org donated a $1 million to various organizations focused on driving the medical response to COVID-19 and serving low income at risk populations, who may be severely impacted by the virus.
Twilio is also matching employee donations two to one for charitable organizations focused on the COVID-19 response, including the CDC Foundation, Global Release International, Gift to Asia and the International Medical Corp. These acts are part of our initial response to pandemic, but we are acutely aware of more need in communities around us and we'll continue our efforts to invest in our communities during this time of need.
I also want to welcome a couple of new leaders at Twilio. We recently hired Christy Lake as our new Chief People Officer, and she'll be responsible for our global people to driving the company's talent development and acquisition strategy and growing the Twilio magic around the world. We also welcome Steve Pugh as our new Chief Security Officer to lead Twilio's global trust and security team responsible for corporate physical and cybersecurity, we're excited to have you both on board.
Before I hand it over to George, I want to thank those who are on the frontlines of this pandemic, the medical professionals, the truck drivers, the food delivery workers, the grocery store workers, the manufacturing workers and everyone else who is playing a role in slowing the spread, or providing us with the stock shelves in our local stores. Thank you. Thank you for everything you're doing for the rest of us.
With that, I'll hand it over to George. George? Thanks, Jeff.
Our team delivered great results in the first quarter as our investments in go-to-market continued to expand our reach. Customer engagement continues to be top of mind for companies and we are helping them drive new ways of digital engagement. When we closed our offices in early March, the team did a great job continuing to engage with our customers. Our marketing team shifted several plan in person events to virtual, if more than 30 virtual events Q2 from the Twilio engagement center programs to roundtables to lunch and learns. And our first ever virtual engage events that we held in mid-April with more than 1500 registrants.
Our Developer Relations team also did a great job engaging our extensive developer community online, through Twilio TV and Twilio Quest and more. In fact, our developer community spent 150,000 minutes plus watching our live video content this quarter 528,000 minutes watching on-demand video content and averaged a total of nearly 100,000 minutes learning on Twilio quest, thanks to the entire team for being there to support our customers and developers throughout the changing environment.
I also want to thank our partner ecosystem for stepping up during this challenging time, providing needed implementation services and Twilio packages for mass alerts, remote agent contact centers, AI powered bots and more.
As you heard from Jeff COVID-19 has drastically accelerated digital transformation projects across many industries. We are uniquely positioned to help with our complete customer engagement platform. In fact, we saw 25% increase in average daily signups from March 18 through April 30 compared to the first 11 weeks of the quarter. This is a great opportunity for us to introduce Twilio to new customers or expand with additional products with existing customers, whether it's adding video for telemedicine, voice for IVR, or email for updates notifications, the current environment as presented multiple entry points for us that expand our long-term opportunity. But it's bigger than just individual channels as companies need to act quickly to move their contact centers to the cloud.
Prior to this outbreak, it was estimated that of the roughly 15 million contact center seats in the market about 17% were in the cloud. Now it is expected to be 50% by 2025. And Flex provides us a great opportunity to help companies with this transition with a fully programmable contact center platform.
Let me discuss a few deals we signed in the quarter. As you know, expanding our international presence has been a key area of investment for us over the last couple of years. We've opened several new offices and the percentage of our total headcount outside of the U.S. has increased from roughly 19% to 27% in just the past year. This strategy is paying off as we continue to land and expand with some great international companies.
For example, we expanded our relationship with New Bank, the largest fintech company in Latin America. New bank became a Twilio email customer in 2019 and turned to Twilio to help them scale their contact center to keep up with their growth. In Q1, New Bank chose Flex to power their several thousand contracts that are agents that are trusted programmable platform, thanks to our team in Brazil for building such a great relationship with New Bank.
We also signed Flex deals with AB InBev a fortune 150 conglomerate. We entered into a new relationship with Standard Chartered Bank a Global 2000 company and leading international banking group with more than 87,000 employees across 60 markets. Standard Chartered, which has been in business for more than 160 years, is an incredible example of digital transformation. And they selected Twilio to build their new enterprise messaging platform to provide the flexibility, performance and scale their needs to provide the best experience for their customers.
We expanded our relationship with the Fortune 100 brick and mortar and online retail company, and it's been a customer for several years, and a brand many of you have likely interacted with recently. They're building a new workflow to expand our usage of Twilio SMS for their mobile and web applications. This new workflow will offer order and shipping notifications via text messaging to guest who purchase through those channels.
Adding emails to the platform has been very successful, as it allows us to offer customers a single platform for their digital customer engagement. And we continue to see email drive great new deals for us. We entered into a new relationship with a large car manufacturer that needed a new platform at a reliable deliverability of two factor authentication for their customers, as their existing solution was not performing. They selected Twilio, as their platform of choice combining email and SMS to provide a more reliable and integrated solution to ensure a better experience for customers.
We also expanded our relationship with one of the world's largest consulting firms as they add an email to power marketing campaigns and customer notifications across several products. They chose Twilio, due to our ability to quickly integrate into key applications across their business in over 120 countries, enabling product teams to ideate, test and deploy with little friction.
Overall, we had a strong first quarter. Looking forward, we remain focused on supporting our customers through the current environment and ensuring our platform and our team are ready to support them as they adapt to this new environment. We're continuing our investments in our go-to-market efforts as we extend our enterprise presence, expand internationally and grow our partner ecosystem. We believe investing in these areas today will set us up for the long-term.
Thanks to the entire team for delivering these great results. And with that, I'll hand it over to Khozema. Thanks, George.
[Audio Gap] compared to 29%, both last quarter, and in Q1 2019. WhatsApp contributed approximately 7% of revenue. Verizon's ADP or application to person messaging fee was implemented on February 1 and contributed approximately 4 million to revenue. As a reminder, this was a direct pass through to customers and did not impact gross profit dollars.
First quarter non-GAAP gross margin was 57% and was negatively impacted by 70 basis points from ADP fees. We will continue to provide the financial impacts of ADP fees throughout the remainder of 2020.
Non-GAAP operating profit came in at $6 million stronger than originally forecast. This outperformance was primarily driven by revenue favorability as well as reduced travel and office expenses plus slower than planned hiring.
Now, let me discuss guidance. While we continue to see strength in our business, the macroeconomic environment remains dynamic, and we feel it best to employ prudence in our guidance philosophy. As such, we are withdrawing guidance for the full year. However, we're providing guidance for the second quarter and expect revenue of 365 million to 370 million including ADP fees for growth of 35% year-over-year at the high end. To-date in Q2, we've continued to see a net increase in usage relative to our expectations and strong growth in the overall business, a testament to our resilient model and broadly diversified customer base.
As Jeff said earlier, we believe we were built for this kind of environment. We've performed a variety of scenario analyses across used cases, industry verticals and geographic mix to better understand possible impacts to our revenue. And while we're not going to get into the specifics of these scenarios a revenue guidance naturally takes into consideration headwinds from the more heavily impacted industries like travel, hospitality and ride sharing, as well as the offsetting benefits from customers and education, healthcare, retail and others.
To note customers that we categorized in those specific impacted industries have averaged less than 10% of Twilio revenue over the last several quarters. That number excludes email. In short, there are puts and takes and so far we've seen more puts. We expect the second quarter operating loss in the range of $15 million to $20 million.
As we discussed on our last earnings call, we view 2020 as the year of investment portfolio given the strength of our balance sheet as well as the size of the opportunity in front of us. Our intention is to continue investing through the cycle. We believe this is in the best interest of Twilio and our stakeholders and will continue to generate elevated growth outcomes for the foreseeable future, enabling us to come out of this current environment in an even stronger position.
Let me give a brief update on each of the areas of investment we laid out on our last call. For our R&D Center of Excellence in India, we are leasing office space, but for now, we have virtually opened that office continued with our hiring plans and have on-boarded a number of employees who are currently working remotely. We are continuing to hire for our go-to-market teams with a focus on enterprise reps, international expansion and Flex specialists. This remains a critical investment as we continue to drive deeper into the enterprise and become our customers' platform of choice when it comes to digital engagement.
Lastly, we continue investing in our systems and infrastructure. As Twilio continues to grow, we want to leverage the benefits of scale. We continue to invest in improvements in our billing systems, [flow to cash] [ph] and other cross functional areas that have been prioritized across the company to better enable our employees. We understand the ambiguity that exists in the world today as a result of COVID-19. But we are highly confident in the ROI these investments will generate for the long-term.
Additionally, with more than 1.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet, we feel we are in a position of strength to manage the business through this pandemic, and come out stronger on the other side.
A few other items to discuss before opening the call to questions. Our SIGNAL conference, originally planned for May is now rescheduled as a virtual event for the week of September 28. We are still working through the details of making this event virtual and the related costs and will provide an update on our Q2 call. Keep in mind we will likely reallocate some of the planned SIGNAL expenses to other marketing related areas. We're also postponing our Investor Day which will also be virtual aligned with SIGNAL and are now targeting Thursday, October 1. Stay tuned for more information from the IR team.
Finally, I wish everyone well and hope you're healthy and safe. Thank you for joining. Operator, please open the line for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Nikolay Beliov from Bank of America. Your line is open. Hi, thanks. Thanks for taking my questions. Nice results here guys. And I hope everybody's safe and healthy. Just wanted to dig into the used cases. When I think about Twilio, I think about three main used cases marketing, operations and customer support. Maybe you can help us give us puts and takes in each of those and how those laid out for you during the quarter, and what trends are you seeing in the used case that what you saw in the month of April? Thank you. That's it for me. Thank you, Nikolay. This is Jeff. Khozema, you want to take it, sorry I have the coordination problem on this call like usual. Does anybody want to get? I think some of the elevated used cases that we've seen so far Nikolay are really in categories I would say. So, we talked about some of the headwinds, for example. But I think on the other side in terms of like some offsetting benefits that we've seen or used cases in education, healthcare, retail, which is more vertical look, relative to some of the areas that you called out. And I think what we're seeing is, is that through the first quarter, it's certainly on the back end of that and then as well, as we begin to start Q2, we've continued to see a slight net increase in usage relative to our expectations in part because of new used cases in some of those areas, and I think all of that just kind of goes to the broad overall strength in the business.
The business is broadly diversified. We have a very resilient model and customer base it spans, geos, industries and in verticals, and so I wouldn't necessarily call out a specific used case, but I think we're seeing elevated activities in some of those areas, obviously, offset by some of the others that we called out. Yes. This is George, I'd add on to that. I agree with Khozema, most of the trends we're seeing are by history. That said, we are seeing six used cases that are opportunistically coming forward for us in under COVID. And the six are remote contact centre, self service, contact list delivery, distance learning, telehealth and mass notifications. And those are some of the emerging use cases that we're seeing under COVID. Certainly not, we saw the core used cases that are going strong, but those are some new ones that we're excited about. Your next question comes from Derrick Wood from Cowen. Your line is open. Great, thanks. And congrats on impressive acceleration in growth and take a big jump into new customer accounts in the quarter.
I wanted to touch on the sales strategy here. Obviously, there's a lot of disruption with how people are communicating. You guys are talking about acceleration and digital transformation. I'm curious, are you seeing sales engagements move out of just the developer and more into the C suite. And I guess, given this opportunity, what are you doing to lean in from a from a sales strategy standpoint? This is George. Yes, I'm really glad that we really made the investments over last few years now to both have the distribution as well as the programs -- the executive engagement programs so that we've built relationships with companies, so that we can be able to take advantage of the situation. And what we're seeing is a growth really, across these industries that I've talked about, we are engaging at a higher level than before, because now what we're seeing is executive decisions coming down to, we've got to transform our contact center in 60 days in some cases, or what have you.
But I would say this is really just much more building on the strategy we've had now for a long time, which is to go into enterprise, sell higher, sell more strategically. And so we're continuing to, I think more execute the playbook that we've been preparing for several years, then fundamentally alter the playbook except for really focusing on these new used cases, which I think I'm very excited about. And we've really done a good job of training and arming our sales force to go prosecute these six new used cases as well. Your next question comes from Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Mr. Turrin, your line is open. Are you on mute? You talked about Flex in terms of the addition of some of the new features here and then the uptick in remote contact center demand also came up. Is there anything else you can add just in terms of how you've been able to react given the contact center market in particular seems to be undergoing a pretty big transformation in terms of what's happening and it certainly seems to us like Flex is well suited to capture some of that. Yes. This is George. So in addition, I think having really a great product and platform in terms of being able to have flexibility and the ability to deploy quickly, which is I think, perfect for this moment, the ability to support work at home agents, remote agents. I mean, I think that this time was really tailor made for the Flex value proposition. We've augmented that by really beefing up some of our capabilities -- our services capabilities and our partner capabilities. So internally, we've created a program that we're calling the Twilio Lightning program, which is a set of services to help Flex customers get deployed very, very quickly. In some cases, we're able to turn around somebody's emergency cases in just a few days on the platform, which is incredibly exciting.
And we're also seeing, our partner ecosystem step up to help us and the Twilio build program is starting to pay off, as we saw in Q1 north of 40% of our Flex deployments involved a partner, which I think is a real testament to the work we've done to build not just the product in the platform and the engagement team on the sales side, but also our partner ecosystem. And we're excited about continuing our progress there. Your next question will come from Matt Stotler from William Blair. Your line is open. Just a couple quick ones for me. So one, obviously strong results in Q1 sounds like usage, as you said is above expectations and so far in Q2, when you look at a guidance for Q2 and think about what you're seeing with customer behaviors, how much of your growth do you see coming from continued increase in usage at existing customers versus the behaviors that you're seeing in terms of continuing to onboard new customers as we move into Q2? Yes. Matt, thanks for the question. I think it's a mix of both honestly. We're certainly seeing additional tailwind from education, from healthcare, from retail and some of the others that that we talked about. I think at some point, those are going to moderate a little bit. But at the same time, I think what is also going to happen is, is that we're going to have some of the other use cases come back that have been down a little bit. And so I think, there are some puts and takes in the mix. But, as we said in our earlier remarks, like, what we've overall seen is that there's sort of been a tailwind here. I think in terms of the back half of the year, we're still cautiously optimistic about the way that things are going to play out there. We felt it was prudent to withdraw our guidance for that period, just given how dynamic things are, but we do remain cautiously optimistic. And I would say, certainly for the long-term. We're as excited as we've ever been, if not more excited. Right, right. Yes, that's great. And I just want more quickly on SendGrid or email in the quarter, just wondering how that performed in Q1 and what you're seeing there, given the environment and given all the COVID related emails that we're all seeing coming into our inboxes. Yes. We don't break out this SendGrid business anymore, but it did continue to perform well, in Q1. It's specific to COVID-19 email as well experienced similarly, higher usage, relative to what we talked about across the entirety of the business. Also just kind of bear in mind that the email business is predominantly sold as buckets and so the revenue for that product doesn't fluctuate as much based on usage. Next question will come from Pat Walravens from JMP Securities. Your line is open. Hi, this is Mark [indiscernible]. Thank you so much for taking my question. I'm just wondering, in terms of the -- if you guys have any flexible payment, kind of for the SMB and if they request for Flex model payment, what's the policy there? Yes. Let me just make sure that I understood the question. Have there been requests for flexible payment terms? Or have we seen any kind of deviations for SMB customers? Is that right? Correct? Yes. Okay. We've received requests from a small number of customers around changes to payment terms or minimum commitments, and we're evaluating those on a case by case basis. But so far, we've not seen an impact on the business from those requests. And we've not seen a material increase in delinquencies and our good DSO is pretty stable, and there's no change in that really in Q1 relative to where it was at in Q4 '19 or other quarters. And your next question will come from Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Just wanted to dive into the Epic deal kind of the telehealth market. I think Epic, or at least from some news reports have been using a different video solution previously. So just what was it that they were looking for? That kind of made them transition to a Twilio platform and just level of engagement with kind of other telehealth providers would be helpful. Thanks. Hey. This is George. Now, I think that, one of the nice, I think benefits of the tailwind that we've seen is in our video product. It's a product that is I think really tailor-made for this period of time in terms of being able to be a) deployed very quickly, like all of our products, it's consumption base so people can get started and try it without any barriers to entry. And it's also a fantastic product that can scale incredibly well and deliver excellent quality. And so I think that combination plus the fact that Twilio is now HIPAA compliant, supports HIPAA and able to find DDAs, I think the timing worked out incredibly well.
And so, intriguing part of that story, is that, again, they started through the power of our developer community where, a developer at Epic, had a friend who was a huge Twilio enthusiast who actually used Twilio video and recommended us to help address some of their challenges. And they were able to through the power of our platform, get up and running quickly try it for themselves, see the power of it. And that cycle end up being, I think, for us a relatively rapid cycle, because I think of the fundamental power of our business model and the power of this platform model worked hand in hand with the investments we've made an enterprise side with the DDAs.
So I think, again, this deal really speaks to the power of our model, the strength of our strategy of having a multi channel or omni-channel strategy, and the incredible combination of developer motion, plus the enterprise investments we've made, I speak to all those and we're really thrilled to be able to support an amazing organization like Epic during this type of time period. Your next question will come from Siti Panigrahi from Mizuho. Your line is open. Thanks for taking my question. Glad you all are doing well. George just getting into your go-to-market motion given the changes, can talk about how the changes happening and we talked about opportunity mostly in the cloud contact center market. Could you talk, give some color what kind of discussion you're having with customer, I can understand, at this point, some of the opportunity there to supplement the existing contact center. And what are the long-term opportunity you have there and the pipeline look like? Yes. So, great, great question. Look, I would take a step back and say that, overall, as Jeff said, this environment is showing companies that they need to really double down and accelerate on their digital transformation. But they need to be -- we all need to be communicating with our customers and digital channels more than ever. And that could be messaging that could be WhatsApp, that could be video. And that could also be voice and in the contact center. All of these channels are incredibly important this period of time. And the strength that we're seeing is really across multiple products, not just the contact center.
And what's really fantastic about this opportunity for us is that certainly while it's challenging for our sales team, they can't go visit customers. They're having, obviously all of us are having our personal challenge with stay at home, that our sales team is doing an amazing job of engaging our customers, engaging executives. In this age, you're doing video calls with your customers in each other's homes, you're building deeper rapport, I think there's some really interesting opportunities being opened up to build deeper connection with customers during this period of time and our sales force is taking advantage of that.
Now, one of those opportunities absolutely is, is the contact center. And what we're seeing is that, not across the board, but certainly for many companies that this, this current situation is causing them to rethink many aspects of our contact centre, I was talking to, one of our customers who in their contact center, they were using a BPO. And suddenly they had to figure out, okay, how do we make sure that our BPO is socially distance, for their agents and their agents. How do we support work at home agents as part of this, so there's a huge transformation happening in the contact center. And there's no doubt that this is going to accelerate the overall migration of contact centers to the cloud. And, I think that we're benefiting from that, hopefully as much as anyone, because of our business model and because of our technology model. So we're excited about these use cases. We're excited about the transformation happening. And we are engaging and I think that this is definitely an area that admits a lot of challenges in certain industries we're excited about. Your next question comes from Mark Murphy from JPMorgan. Your line is open. This is Pinjalim on behalf of Mark. Congrats on the quarter and thanks for the question. Khozema one question for you is, is there any way to disaggregate the upside versus your guidance between portfolio base and portfolio based SendGrid and the variable portion? Because I mean, just trying to figure out was there any material change in the contribution from variable revenue versus what you had expected before? Yes. We're not disclosing those different buckets. I mean, I would say it this way that to reiterate a point that I made earlier that I think what we saw in Q1 was simply a reflection of a broadly diversified customer base that had a strong performance overall. And, we noted a few of the areas that were more economically challenged and then some of the areas that had tailwind, but we don't break out those segments anymore. Okay, understood. And one quick one for Jeff, if I may, Jeff any thoughts on the Sinch acquiring the digital interconnect business for SAP? How could that shape the competitive environment in messaging going forward, if at all? Yes. As a company, we typically focus on the needs our customers have and building software that helps some of our customers to engage with their customers across a wide variety of touch points. And I think that when you look at our business, the strength of our business as far as the size that we're at, and the pace at which we're growing at our scale, and the diversification of all the different products we offer to our customers, I think that we're in a very good position here in United States as well as globally to serve our customers needs. And that's what really focused on, is following our customers and where they take us. Your next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. I had two questions. I guess, Jeff, the fun would be for you or maybe for George, just what do you think -- how do you think about what we're going through kind of making people even more cognizant of the need for kind of that those omni-channel touch points? And do you have a sense of kind of where you would have pegged penetration of a pure of a real omni-channel strategy before and how much that might be coming up in conversations with people now?
And then the follow up for Khozema is just the ADP impact for the quarter, I think you said was 4 million. And I think you said it went into effect in February. Does that mean we should be expecting a $6 million benefit that's embedded in guidance for the second quarter? Thank you. Let me just take the second piece and I'll let Jeff elaborate on the first piece. The second piece, we didn't specifically call it out for Q2, but you're in the ballpark. Thanks Khozema. So Heather, for the first part of your question, I mean, I think what you see going on right now, is Twilio is becoming even more relevant to businesses in light of COVID. And it takes many shapes based on the type of company that it is for the industry that they're in or where they're at in their digital transformation. But I think one thing is kind of clear that for companies who are engaged in a day transformation that oftentimes these projects were slated for, quarters or years that we're going to undertake, many of us got done in weeks. And so this is going to be seen as a great digital acceleration.
And in many ways, Twilio was built for this moment, we offer the three things that companies need as they are accelerating their digital plans. Yes, that is digital engagement, all the channels, whether it's voice or messaging, or video or chat or WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger, like all these channels, digital engagement, as we've moved, so many, in person face-to-face workloads to digital workloads, we have the digital engagement that costs companies need agility, so the ability to build quickly and to answer to changing conditions. That's obviously then, one of the biggest things that's going on in Q1 and Twilio provides the ability for organizations to be agile, to build iteratively as they as the nature of what they need to build and how they need to address the changing circumstances continues to evolve.
And the third thing we offer is cloud scale. Now, this isn't the moment where you can spend, months planning your capacity requirements and we are racking up the data centre to plan for your peak, you need to build something you need to deploy it. And you need it to work pretty much instantly. And that's true of the cost scale, but also geographically to scale around. And so Twilio brings that to the table as well and so, all-in-all, Twilio was built for this. And whether it's the digital engagement, agility, and cloud scale, these are things that every company is needed, whether, regardless of the type of used case that is top of mind for them right now.
And I believe the investments that companies are making are going to be durable, like the changes that are occurring in our society right now, are going to persist in many ways. I think that many doctors' visits for example, are going to stay as telehealth visits after COVID is over. And I think that many more ecommerce or food delivery or curbside pickup like a lot of these things that are getting normalized right now will start to become even more normal. And so it is the social distancing that is going on right now is changing our behaviors, and I think many of those behaviors will change permanently and we can help companies to address those opportunities. Your next question comes from Alex Zukin from RBC Capital. Your line is open. Two for me, maybe first Jeff, if we step back, you called out a number of growth vectors on this call attaching way more channels acceleration and new customer signups entry into new verticals, what sounds like from George a bunch of new mini Flex like used case categories. So I just want to ask you where is the biggest focus organizationally and which incremental growth sector is most either exciting to you or you most enthusiastic about? First and foremost, actually our focus for the business has been the health and safety of our employees and our customers and our communities. And so I just want to really emphasize that that's been priority number one for us through this crisis. Then as we think through, priority number two is, how do we serve our customers? And how do we help our customers to emerge stronger through this crisis? We see a number of areas to address, whether it is the new verticals that are arising. So, it wasn't actually because of COVID. But it was a really a coincidence that was fortuitous that we announced HIPAA support and the ability to sign DDAs in the first week in February, and that had been worked that we long planned and planned to announce in that time period. And so obviously, the timing was good for us to see a very rapid rise in the number of medical oriented used cases that we could serve during this time.
But, as you as George outlined before, right, we do see really the six used cases that are driving a lot of opportunities right now. And I see it as opportunities for Twilio. And I see it as opportunities to serve our customers, because they are under immense pressure to reconfigure their businesses and their organizations in order to serve their customers and to continue employing their people during this time. And so that opportunity to serve our customers in those six used cases is, is both good business and it's also a good way for us to serve our customers ensuring their success during this time.
And so, think about healthcare, I think about distance learning, I think about automation. But really, our core products have stood up very well as far as messaging, as far as voice, as far as email as the ways in which companies need to engage with their customers during these times and so we continue invest in those and obviously George just talked a bit about Flex and some of the Flex wins that you saw in the quarter which is some of the examples of organizations having to reinvent their contact center to accelerate their plans to move those contact centers into the cloud and into software, in order to allow their people to work from home to open up new channels to scale up, many organizations saw a lot of scale that was unprecedented while at the same time they're having to reconfigure where everybody's working. And so we're able to run all those things to customers. Got it. And then, maybe just a follow up for Khozema, if we think about the overall revenue exposure to industries that may be facing some headwinds versus industries that are seeing some tailwinds? How should we think about that backdrop, if there's any kind of high level percentages of exposure that you can provide? And then, new versus existing bookings trajectory, meaning from new customers versus existing, kind of the way we think about that, and then anything around seasonality for DB&E books for next quarter in the second half, and apologies in advance for the multi-multi part questions. That's okay. Thanks, Alex. I mean, I guess I would start by saying that I think that we're very well diversified across industries. And so that helps to have a business model that's like that. And that's what I think creates the kind of performance that you saw us in Q1. In terms of some of the impacted industries, we called out in our earlier remarks that as it relates specifically to ride share travel and hospitality, which I think have been more significantly impacted than others. They're on a revenue basis, less than 10% of our overall revenue over the last several quarters, actually not just in Q1, and that's excluding email. So I think in terms of that, we feel pretty good about the diversity in the business. And as we also noted, if you look at some of the newer used cases that came on, typically in education, healthcare, retail, even in our .org those have offset and then some of the downside exposure that we saw in some of those impacted areas. And so I think generally we feel pretty good.
And then finally, I would just add, I guess into Q2, I mean, that trend is largely continued, at least to-date. In terms of DB&E, which I think is what you're getting at in terms of like seasonality and stuff like that. We're not really providing any guidance on DB&E that's not been our practice historically. Again, we feel great about the overall diversity in the business and what that was able to drive in terms of DB&E and we'll stay focused there. Your next question will come from Richard Valera from Needham. Your line is open. Hi, guys. This is [indiscernible] for Rich. Thanks for taking our question. And I'll echo [indiscernible] remarks on the strong results in the quarter. So looking specifically at the geographic breakdown, it looks like a reversal in recent trend where domestic grew faster than international in the quarter and really wondering what dynamics are at play maybe from a product perspective, specifically maybe calling out email or SendGrid. If you could provide any color there would be much appreciated. Yes. This is Khozema, I mean, I wouldn't read too much into it. Honestly, it was off about 100 bps relative to prior periods, I would say it's in the ballpark of, what we would have expected it to be. I don't think there was any particular trend relative to any of our categories there, just lots of moving pieces, and that can drive it one way or the other. I think the fact that we saw strong growth in our U.S. businesses on the back of some of the areas that we highlighted, particularly education and healthcare is a good thing and I just wouldn't read much into geographic mix beyond that. Your next question will come from Brent Bracelin from Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Jeff, really encouraging to see the vision laid out at the IPO and the diversity diversification strategy paying off in spades here this quarter. If you'd asked me in 2016, if a large operator via a customer i.e., Comcast, I probably would have said, no. My question for you is given we're seeing kind of this COVID induced acceleration in the digital opportunity. Would you consider accelerating your build by strategy? Why or why not there and then again, one quick follow up for Khozema. Yes. Thank you, Brent. I mean, I think build by the tools together means everything and yes, we are accelerating our build versus buying and we're celebrating the business as you can see. Yes, we're continuing to invest in the long-term and I think it's the right thing to do, because we see a lot of investments that we can make both in terms of product and distribution, as well as building the core systems and processes of the business in order to continue scaling this company for a long period of time.
And so as we think about what's going on right now and the current pandemic environment, but also the long-term, 5, 10 years from now, we see this, essentially as some point a entry point for many even more long-term opportunities, both new kinds of customer relationships, that we're going to build, new markets that we may be able to participate in, but also new products and you need this for all of our customers that are going to emerge. And we are in a position to be able to invest and that investment can be organic or can be inorganic, but with the balance sheet that we have. We see this as an opportunity to invest and to emerge from the COVID pandemic stronger. And then Khozema, just if I got this right, it looked like WhatsApp was 7% of revenue in the quarter. I think it was up -- that's up from 4% in the prior year that would put WhatsApp materially higher year-over-year at $100 million plus run rate. So I guess my question is, what's happening at WhatsApp? What drove the strength there, if that is the right number, and are there some new video used cases driving that? Any color on what drove the outperformance at WhatsApp would be certainly helpful this quarter. Thanks. Yes. So just in terms of the number that you cited, it was 7% of revenue. And that's what we called out in our earlier remarks. It's predominantly one used case around account verification. We have a strong relationship with that company. We work hard at it, obviously every day. I'd have to get back on some of the specific numbers that you cited. They sound directionally right to me, but again, I have to get back to you in terms of specifics. But I think, we just maintained a good relationship with that company. And as I said, we work hard at it every single day.
Just one other thing I would add Jeff's remarks around bill-buy, on the buy side in particular, Jeff mentioned, we have $1.8 billion on our balance sheet, which puts us in a position of strength. We raised that money in part to be opportunistic for a time like this, obviously, we could never have anticipated a global pandemic when we did it, but I think that leaves us in a pretty strong spot to be opportunistic and we've got a lot of optionality going forward. And your final question for today will be from Rishi Jaluria from D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. This is actually Phil Rigby on for Rishi. Thanks for taking the question. Can you just talk about what impacts you're seeing related to political activity in this environment? Just trying to get a sense of how spend there is tracking relative to your expectations. I'll give the high level, I think as anticipated in politics, especially in the United States, messaging is proving to be a pretty effective medium for candidates to engage with likely voters. So, like it was in 2016 and 2018, I think 2020 will be a year of elevated spend, by the political participants. We're not breaking out any predictions around that category of our business. But, I would say it's playing out as we expected quite well this year. There are no further questions. I will turn the call back over to the presenters for closing remarks. All right. Thanks everybody for joining today. And we hope you are all staying safe and healthy and look forward to catching up with you over the next quarter or so. Thank you everyone. This will conclude today's conference call.

With that, I’ll hand it over to you, Jeff. Thank you, Zilli and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining. Before we begin, I'd like to take a knee so to speak. As you all know, the last several months have been very difficult. It started with COVID and the impact that this has had on the world and then we saw the much-needed broader social movement around Black Lives Matter. This year has shown more than ever the important role corporations play in the lives of our employees, our customers and society at large. And we take that role seriously. Racial justice is an area where companies, Twilio included can step up and help drive improvements in multiple areas. It starts by introspecting personally as leaders and people in a position of power and as a company and how we can use our power to instigate change. It begins inside our walls. One of our core values of the Twilio magic is be inclusive and we have a body of work to do in order to truly build the company that's representative of the world around us, where every person knows they belong.
But we are committed to that work and make small strides of progress each day. But we also know the power of coming together as a company to fight systemic injustice as we commit as a company to the principles of anti-racism. And as I've talked with Twilions around the world in the past couple months, I've found that we have a company full of people who support this cause, both the issue of racial injustice facing black Americans and other groups like Latinx and indigenous Americans also similar issues that face communities around the world in EMEA, APJ, LatAm, I found similar desires to engage to do the work and to fight in each one of our communities for the issues of diversity, inclusion and belonging that face every community.
I'm humbled and inspired by all of you especially in a year where people could say, look, we have enough other problems right now. So thank you Twilions for engaging and committing to doing this work. We know our work as individuals, as leaders, as a company is just getting started and we stand in solidarity with the black community and believe equivalently Black Lives Matter. Consider this my taking a knee to begin this earnings call.
Now on to Q2 results. We saw continued broad-based strength in our business in the second quarter as our customers leveraged Twilio to build the future of customer engagement. Over the last several years, we have built a well-diversified customer base across industries, regions and company size that have driven our great results. And now we're seeing the strength of that diversification really play out during COVID, as we've seen new industries, new use cases offset some of the more negatively impacted areas. Companies are adapting quickly to this changing environment. Over the last few months, we've seen years-long digital transformation roadmaps compressed into days and weeks in order to adapt to the new normal as a result of COVID-19.
Our customers in nearly every industry have had to identify new ways to communicate with their customers and stakeholders, from patients to students to shoppers and even employees essentially overnight. In fact, in a recent Twilio global survey of more than 2,500 enterprise decision makers, 97% believe COVID-19 has accelerated their company's digital transformation efforts.
We also found the company's digital communication strategies were accelerated by an average of six years, barriers like lack of clear strategy or getting executive approval or reluctance to replace legacy software and lack of time have broken down and budgets are increasing as companies are seeing new ways of engaging customers. As we remarked on the last call, Twilio was built for this. The things we've always brought to our customers, digital engagement software agility and cloud scale are enabling organizations to innovate now even faster than ever. Messaging, email voice and video are allowing companies to engage with their customers safely while reimagining their digital engagement strategies in ways that will be resilient for years to come. This effort is the focus of every executive team at nearly every company not only are we helping companies’ figure this out now but we are an engagement platform that was built for the future and we believe the solutions being built today will be the standard for digital engagement going forward.
In addition to the traditional use cases we've always powered, we continue to see additional traction in healthcare, education, financial services, retail contactless delivery and e-commerce. In fact, I was recently speaking with the CIO of a major retailer who said they saw their e-commerce adoption experience five years of growth in the second quarter alone. The need to scale every part of the business to meet that demand is substantial and in order to service those customers and meet that surge in demand they turn to Twilio. We're also seeing companies face the same challenge when it comes to their workforces. How do we adapt to this new dynamic of work? Where work and homes are blended and we don't go into the office every day. While it would be nice if we could flip a switch and return to normalcy, I think that the coming years will present a more fluid version of work. Companies who adapt now and prepare to serve the needs of a more agile workforce will be the ones who thrive.
For example, companies must prepare for customer service agents to work from home rather than a crowded call center. Retailers who rely on the expertise of their in-store sales associates will need to create workflows where those employees can still advise customers digitally. Banks will need to replace their traditional in-person branch processes to online services and the tools and services that keep these agile workforces up and running like Twilio will continue to see demand increase. We are just scratching the surface of this huge opportunity as companies around the world reimagine their customer engagement for the digital world. This is what Twilio has always been focused on and now this opportunity has been supercharged as customers continue to use our customer engagement platform for new use cases brought about by the current environment. While there's a lot of uncertainty in the macro environment, we remain cautiously optimistic about our opportunity for the remainder of this year and we're even more excited about what we can do in the long run.
Before I hand it over to George, I want to highlight a couple of other items. I want to welcome Michelle Grover as Twilio's new Chief Information Officer. Michelle joins us from SAP Concur and will be responsible for the technology systems and processes that drive innovation and growth at Twilio. Ultimately empowering the company to better serve customers. We're thrilled to welcome her to the team. I also want to remind everyone that SIGNAL our customer and developer conference is coming soon from expert speaker sessions product deep dives, speaker panels and more SIGNAL delivers powerful and practical sessions to build legendary customer relationships with Twilio. You'll learn how to unlock the power of a single communications platform to engage with your customers anywhere on any channel. It will be a virtual event from September 30th to October 1st and you can register today at twilio.com/signal.
Finally, I want to thank our employees for their dedication to our customers during this unprecedented time and for delivering these great results. I also want to thank all of those who are on the front lines of this pandemic and continue to fight to keep us healthy and safe. Our food supply is continuing and our store is stocked. Thank you for everything you're doing for the rest of us.
With that I'll hand it over to George. Thanks Jeff. Against the backdrop of a very difficult macro environment and the first full quarter of remote work, our team pulled together to deliver great results in the second quarter Our investments in the enterprise expanding internationally and growing our partner ecosystem continue to drive great outcomes as we are helping companies across industries and around the world with their digital acceleration efforts. Our marketing team transitions several events from in-person to virtual hosting multiple engage everywhere events including industry-specific events focused on health care and retail. Our developer relations team drove great results with more than one million unique visitors to our blog during the quarter. We were able to shift our customer hackathons to virtual experiences from multiple companies. These hackathons help companies reimagine their customer engagement strategy using the Twilio platform. And we continue to see digital transformation projects accelerating at companies and organizations of all sizes and across industries. As Jeff mentioned, COVID is accelerating the digital transformation efforts of companies and organizations everywhere because there is no such thing as routine customer engagement anymore. And our opportunity has been supercharged in light of this driving some great new deals in response to COVID.
Few companies have seen as explosive growth as Zoom as a result of COVID and with that growth they needed an email platform that would scale to match their needs. Already a Twilio customer Zoom added email knowing we offered a platform that would consistently deliver email in a timely fashion at scale with a deliverability and speed to support their customers during this massive growth phase. We expanded our relationship with Peloton, the largest interactive fitness platform in the world with more than 2.6 million members. They needed an email infrastructure that would grow with them. Peloton selected Twilio's email platform for all of their marketing emails to optimize deliverability, allow them to iterate quickly and provide the scale they need for the future.
There's also never been a better time to be in the contact center space. We are happy with the momentum we've seen reflect to date. The flexibility of the platform allows for many different use cases outside of traditional customer service. One area we've seen great traction in is contact tracing, where we've worked with several universities and city and state governments to help them prepare to reopen safely and efficiently. In Q2, we signed more than 25 transactions with these organizations including New York City and New Mexico. Flex also allows companies to cut costs by moving from expensive on-premises implementations to the cloud. Red Ventures, a portfolio of digital companies was looking for ways to cut costs while continuing to provide great service. Having used a legacy on-premises vendor for more than 10 years, Red Ventures chose Twilio Flex to provide a cloud-based solution to drive cost savings while delivering a highly customized sales experience.
We also entered into a new relationship with DGL Group, a leading digital distributor of insurance and household financial services to over 10 million customers. DGL's existing legacy solution did not allow for large-scale remote working and requiring staff to stay in the contact center was not acceptable. DGL turned to Twilio Flex to deploy a remote contact center, enabling several hundred agents to be up and running in two weeks and according to the DGL team drove a straightforward decision to change. Our results also show the power of our diversified go-to-market supporting companies of all sizes across multiple industries and geographies. In the enterprise, we expanded our relationship with a Fortune 50 company serving millions of customers a week. They are seeing a spike in usage of their buy-online pickup-in store option and they needed a solution to verify the customer phone number at checkout or at pickup.
This company is shifting from buying 80% of their software to building 80% of their software and selected Twilio to build a solution using Twilio Verify, lookup, SMS voice and email. We entered into a new relationship with a Fortune 50 multinational company that needed a more efficient and effective way to issue escalation alerts and notifications from their service now command center. They will be implementing service now notify powered by Twilio SMS and voice to seamlessly deliver these critical communications to global employees and executives to ensure fast response times for their customers. We entered into a new relationship with CBRE Spain, a division of the world's largest commercial real estate services firm like many companies CBRE Spain was trying to imagine what a return to the office would look like. Their head of digital and technology stepped up and built a solution in less than 24 hours using Twilio Studio. With Twilio Voice IVR SMS and email employees can now book a desk over the phone, receive an SMS to confirm more information about the reservation. And finally receive a personalized email with authorization to return to the office.
Globally, we've also had tremendous success. We entered a new relationship with Tokopedia, an Indonesian technology company with a mission to democratize commerce through technology, with the exponential increase in traffic due to COVID; Tokopedia needed a secure and reliable solution to support their growth and selected Twilio for SMS notifications. We entered a new relationship with E.ON next, a company that provides electricity and gas to more than 5 million people in the UK. E.ON next is delivering and developing a new customer engagement platform in an effort to become the leading residential energy provider. They are leveraging Twilio voice, messaging and email to build this new engagement platform. And we are excited to support them in their effort to deliver the best customer experience in the industry.
We expanded our relationship with car finance 24X7, the UK's number one car finance broker guiding their customers from initial loan application to car purchase. They have been a great customer of ours for years and this quarter added Twilio Flex for their customer support and sales contact center based on the flexibility and scalability of the Flex platform. We're excited to continue to build on this great relationship. Overall, I'm very proud of the entire team for their performance through the first half of this year. Our investments in enterprise go to market; international expansion and our partner ecosystem are paying off and are setting us up for long-term success. We remain focused on supporting our customers through the current environment and helping them build customer engagement solutions for the future. And finally to echo Jeff, I'd encourage everyone to register for SIGNAL to hear all about how you can leverage Twilio for your own customer engagement needs. And with that I'll hand it over to Khozema Thank you, George and good afternoon, everyone. Total revenue for Q2 grew 46% year-over-year to $401 million and dollar based net expansion was 132%. As a reminder, this was the first quarter we fully lapped the SendGrid acquisition, so our reported numbers do not require an organic adjustment. Recall that Q1 organic revenue growth and dollar based net expansion were 48% and 135% respectively after adjusting for the one-month stub period.
During the second quarter, we continue to see a net positive increase in usage during COVID-19 relative to our expectations, while some of the more negatively impacted verticals showed a slight comeback, they are still below their pre-COVID levels. However, use cases within healthcare, education, e-commerce and others continued to offset the headwinds, re-emphasizing Jeff's comments earlier we have a well-diversified and resilient business model. Twilio is built for this and we remain cautiously optimistic about the remainder of the year and as enthusiastic as ever about the long term.
Revenue from our Top 10 active customer accounts represented 15% of revenue which was flat sequentially and up from 13% last year. International revenue was 27% of total revenue in Q2 compared to 28% last quarter and 29% in Q2, 2019. WhatsApp contributed approximately 7% of revenue which was flat sequentially. Verizon's A2P or application to person messaging fee contributed approximately $7 million to revenue. As a reminder, this fee is a direct pass-through to customers and does not impact gross profit dollars.
Second quarter non-GAAP gross margin was 56% and was negatively impacted by 100 basis points from A2P fees. Non-GAAP operating profits came in at $10 million stronger than originally forecasted. There were two primary drivers for this outperformance. One higher revenue than forecasted which was the largest contributor and two, COVID related items including hiring, travel and office expenses among others.
Moving to guidance, we continue to watch the same economic indicators as all of you. And it is clear that the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain. In context, we are only providing Q3 guidance and we expect revenue of $401 million to $406 million including A2P fees for year-over-year growth of 36% to 38%. We expect a third quarter operating loss in the range of $10 million to $15 million. Our focus for investment remains the same continuing to build out an R&D center of excellence in India, hiring and go-to-market and systems infrastructure. Given the inherent difficulties of hiring and infrastructure building, while we are all working from home, we do expect some of these investments to continue next year. We are highly confident in the ROI these investments will produce over the long term and are making them with a strong balance sheet.
One other important note to mention with regards to operating expenses is SIGNAL, our customer and developer conference. SIGNAL will take place virtually September 30th to October 1st incurring expenses in both Q3 and Q4. We originally forecasted SIGNAL expenses to be about $10 million before moving to a virtual event and any cost savings from hosting SIGNAL virtually will be reallocated to other marketing areas. We are still planning to host a Virtual Investor Day on October 1st to coincide with SIGNAL. We are finalizing the logistics and will provide more specifics in the coming weeks.
Finally, I wish everyone well and I hope you are all healthy and safe. Thank you for joining. Operator, please open the line for questions. [Operator Instructions]
Your first question comes from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Great. Thanks maybe a first question just on how is COVID informed where you or how you continue to evolve the platform? Are there areas where it's been highlighted by customers that they would like more investment or more capabilities? And then second just how has it changed how ISB or SI community has their interest level in working with you guys and level of engagement with those communities? Thanks. Thank you, Meta. This is Jeff. I'll take the first part of the question and then maybe I'll have George answer the second part. Well with regard to how we're involved in the platform, yes, I think there's two parts to that answer. First, is one of the neat things about being a platform and being APIs that can be used to build so many different things is that we don't necessarily have to like rebuild our product for new scenarios or new use cases that arise because of COVID. In many ways our platform approach allows us to be adapted very well to changing circumstances. And so that really makes our product very perfectly oriented towards uncertain times like this. I've talked about how the need for software agility is one of the key things that the world has needed during this time to respond to unprecedented events. And so I think our platform is nicely oriented towards helping our customers solve problems that maybe didn't even really exist in the world six months ago.
But as far as how we are adjusting our roadmaps, there are adjustments that have been made for example we are investing quite a bit in our video product to respond to new demand and new use cases that are rising or are accelerating in their demand because of COVID. And so that's an area where we're focusing our energy as well as many of the new use cases that are emerging because of it, because of things like contactless delivery or telehealth or distance learning right. These bring about new use cases or growth of existing use cases that may have existed before but are achieving new levels of interest and scale. And then those things will then help us to adjust a roadmap. But like I said as a platform, I think we're really well positioned already to be able to capture new workloads as they emerge it's not like we have to go reinvent our product or build a brand-new product for these emerging use cases. And that's a pretty good attribute of a platform business like ours. With that let me hand over to George to talk about the ecosystem. Thanks Jeff. I think that what we're seeing the ecosystem mirrors a lot of what you said certainly on the ISD side, we've seen traction with companies that are developing new disruptive business models to try and address COVID scenarios. So we've seen growth in ICS that are focused on changing education through remote proctoring. We've talked about our relationship with EPIC and we're definitely seeing more companies in the telehealth space, ISVS want to work with Twilio and then on the SI side, it's also been a catalyst for us to build relationships with SIs, a good example that would be what we're seeing on the contact tracing side that a lot of these contact tracking use cases with state local government. They're bringing in SI to help them do the work and these SIs are being introduced to Twilio and in some cases deepening their relationship with Twilio because of this and as they learn more about us and see what's going on with our technology, they're more and more excited about it because it's such a great fit for this time and place. So overall, I would say we've definitely seen it as a catalyst for improved growth and relationships in some of these specific areas great. Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with RBC Capital. Your line is open. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter, maybe just two for me. The first maybe just help us understand a little bit around the magnitude of the headwinds and how much they've improved and whether you're seeing some of these new tailwinds as a structural change to the way that your product is even perceived in the marketplace? And then there's a follow-up just to maybe comment on dollar based net expansion expectations for 3Q and anything we should keep in mind of as we model that metric for the rest of the year. Yes. Hey, Alex, this is Khozema. Thanks for the question. Around dollar based net expansion, I mean that's not a metric that we guide to, and so I would say we feel good about the broad-based strength of the business. Generally we feel great about the 132 that we put up in the quarter and we do and we've said this for a long time, we anticipate that that metric over some period of time will fade out. I mean it's just law of large numbers at some point but we feel great about kind of where we're headed right now and the performance of our customers.
In terms of some of the impacted industries, I think that was the first part of the question. The impacted industries that we called out there they're still a little bit down. I will say that we are starting to see some green shoots, we physically called out in the past rideshare, hospitality, travel and we are starting to see a modest rebound. I wouldn't say that they're anywhere near the levels that they've been at historically. But we are starting to see a little bit there. And then I think on the plus side some of the other areas that Jeff had called out previously around education, health care, e-commerce even philanthropy, I think these are now becoming kind of secular tailwinds for us. And so I think we're starting to see structural changes and consumer behavior which are going to drive some ongoing and long-term strength in those industries for us. Perfect and maybe just if I could sneak one more in. Anything you guys can talk about with respect to election related spend and kind of where you've seen that trend either in the first half and what's the right way to think about that in the next quarter? Yes. We're not we're not really breaking it out, Alex, in terms of the revenue impacts of that traffic. What I will say is that in Q2 we did see a healthy amount of political use cases in the quarter and I think as you can probably imagine that with a lot of the events and rallies being canceled staying in touch with constituents via the products that we offer email, messaging, voice becomes really important. But we haven't really changed our assumptions around political traffic for the remainder of the year, but we are starting to see some activity there. Your next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer & Co. Your line is open. Thanks. Hi, guys. Congrats. Fantastic quarter. I guess I wanted to have a couple of questions. First of all, George on the international front. I piloted a few activities there but it seems like the growth over there on a year-over-year basis decelerated quite substantially. So help me understand how much of that was business activity or is there anything unique to the international markets maybe because --maybe there's event effects impact here, would love to get an insight on that and then Khozema, I just want to make sure I understand your comments on the OpEx and I certainly understand the higher revenue as a driver for higher operating margins, but last quarter you've kind of detailed the plan to aggressively higher this year and pull higher from next year into this year. Are you basically saying you're not able to run at the pace that you were planning to do? Why don't I start and then because Khozema can go into the hiring pieces? This is George. So in terms of the international mix certainly it's changed marginally as Khozema talked about in the numbers in terms of our percent of revenue from international, largely we attribute that to relative COVID impact honestly so it's like a slight difference there in terms of what we're seeing in other markets relative to North America. In North America, we've definitely seen, I would say maybe globally there's been similar impact in certain industries but we've definitely seen some of the counter balancing forces and certain industries I've picked up to be a little bit more active in North America. And that's it's probably also a little bit about the fact that our distribution's a little bit more mature in North America. But it's nothing like these are small deltas so we're not concerned about it; it's just something that we think is largely temporal as we all go through this pandemic impact together. I'll turn it over Khozema. Great, Ittai. Part of your question George was also around FX, I wouldn't say that FX was a material impact for us in Q2. Obviously, rates have moved a little bit around and we'll watch that for future quarters. In terms of your question around operating expense, you're right that in part slower hiring was part of the goodness that we saw in Q2. I would say the preponderance of it honestly was driven by our revenue beat. So I just want to kind of put those in proportion to one another, but what we saw in Q2 and it was a little bit of a continuation of what we saw in Q1 is that we continue hiring, we continue making investments in infrastructure we called out a few of the specifics around the R&D center of excellence, our investments in go-to-market systems and infrastructure. The reality is it's just harder to do these things at the rate that we'd anticipated when we started the year and we keep updating that as we go through the year. We're hoping to catch up some of that in Q3 but I think there's going to be a little bit more spend associated with that as we go. Your next question comes from the line of Nikolay Beliov with Bank of America. Your line is open. HI. Thanks for taking my questions and thank you so much to the team for making it easier for all of us to dial into this call. And I'm just curious is that the Twilio interface you're using for the first time this quarter? It is not Twilio interface for this quarter. Okay. Look forward to the new interface in the future. My question is around the Flex, clearly great traction consistent with our field checks and one thing that we heard from your Flex partners which tend to of course sell the small Flex deals is that well Flex is more of a framework rather than actual products. It takes on average one to three months to install Flex. And you guys in your prepared remarks you were talking about the two-week implementation cycle which is amazing. So this still seems to be some lingering perception that Flex is more of a framework rather than an actual product. Is that an issue in your sales cycles and how you guys addressing that, if that's the case? Well, this is George. I mean certainly like the value proposition of Flex is around the word flexibility right. The product can be highly tailored to the needs of a customer which is one of the great selling propositions of the product. Obviously to do that tailoring that customization requires some amount of time and it really depends on the complexity of the use case. So we definitely can get customers up and running for to get started within a couple weeks and get a lot of value out of it. Then usually those customers over time want to do more and more. So I really, I think depends on the nature of the use case just moving agents’ home or setting up an IVR can be relatively quick to do a full rip and replace of a complex contact center is realistically not going to happen in two weeks. I don't care what product in the world you're looking at but Flex definitely is a fantastic product. You're right. It is getting traction in the marketplace, the value proposition is resonating and I think those field checks you're doing are on in terms of the demand and I think as people get more educated about the platform and the value proposition, I think people should realize that this model is actually the future. So we're excited about it and we're seeing excitement in our partner community as well. And a quick follow-up to Khozema, what was the linearity in the quarter April versus May versus June and what trends are you seeing in the month of July? That's it for me. Thank you. Yes. I'm not going to comment on the current quarter. I would say I mean it's been pretty steady. I mean we don't typically break out linearity in terms of our performance, but we're seeing pretty consistent results through the balance of the quarter. Your next question comes from the line of William Power from Baird. Your line is open. Okay. Great. Thanks, yes, a couple of questions. I guess probably first for Khozema as we think about Q3 guidance, the revenues up a bit sequentially but not to the degree that we've seen in past years. So I guess I just wonder if you can comment on the broader trends you're seeing in the business. Are you seeing any kind of meaningful slowdown in traffic and to what degree perhaps is conservatism part of that just given some of the ongoing uncertainties? And then I'd love to come back to Jeff, some of the comments on new use cases. I wonder if you could expand perhaps would you be with some of the more innovative use cases and how you're thinking about the staying power of some of those use cases as we kind of move past this pandemic at some point. Yes. Hey, well this is Khozema. I'll go first and then I'll turn it over to Jeff. I wouldn't call out anything specific in terms of our Q3 guidance. I mean we've delivered great results in Q2 and we continue to see broad-based strength across a very diversified business. As I mentioned on the call, we continue to see all the same economic indicators that you do and I think there are still some questions around the macro environment. So we're definitely cautiously optimistic about Q3 and the second half of the year more broadly. We're extremely optimistic about the longer term, but we're having a kind of a hard time predicting the future in the very near term. And so I think our Q3 guidance putting aside in sequential certainly shows continued strong growth on a year-over-year basis and we're very comfortable with the range we provided today. With that maybe I'll give it over to Jeff. Great. Thanks, Will for the question. Yes, so I think we've seen so much innovation go on in the last say six months in related to COVID and I look at this as acceleration. I think that's how our customers do too. We mentioned that survey that we did which essentially COVID is accelerating plans and things they might have dabbled in or maybe taken their time with have been really accelerated because of the necessity of COVID and so I look at some of these really innovative use cases. Like one of them that I love is the curbside pickup and like I've been a customer of these curbside pickup workflows at retail businesses where you order online and then basically you drive by and it's a very streamlined workflow where they basically throw your bag into the backseat of your car and you keep driving. And it's like if you're going to the store to pick up, I don't know like a bag of marshmallows and like would you want to walk into the store and have to go find the right aisle or do you want to like use a great convenient interface on your phone and then basically drive up text something like I'm here and have them put in your car.
And I think that even after COVID is over these workflows are going to be really powerful way for bricks-and mortar retailers to provide a great customer experience leveraging their online presence as well as their offline and bridge and water presence. What are some of the other use cases that I think are great? I think telemedicine again is a fantastic set of use cases. I'm very happy that we invested in HIPAA compliance across many of our products early starting like 18-months ago. So that we could deliver that functionality earlier this year to our customers because you think about the convenience of a telemedicine visit, for a lot of visits I think doctors are finding that the convenience level for a patient to not have to take half a day off of work and drive sometimes to a whole other city to get to the medical center where they've got the specialist with the expertise but rather just fire up your camera almost like just a meeting that you might have in your calendar for half an hour be able to see a doctor and get the same level of care for a substantial number of the medical visits that go on in our country. That's pretty game changing for people's ability to get care and so I think organizations that do a really good job of delivering video care is going to essentially have an advantage in the market with patients.
Another particularly innovative use case that we've seen with bank branches, many of them closed being able to open accounts all done via video. That's an emerging use case to replace that in person having to fulfill on know your customer be able to have to go into a bank branch open an account that can now be done virtually and then I thought the customer that we talked about on the call actually CBRE in Spain, if you think about that solution like they need people to go back to work but work is going forward is not going to be like work used to be. Like I think a lot of companies are not just going to have liked one desk per person and the big conference rooms that everyone used to have liked the nature of what office environments are going to be like is going to change. And CBRE in the real estate space is kind of ahead of the game here, if you will, in that they are deploying these workflows for like do you want to go in basically essentially submit your desire here you get notified, if you're allowed to go in you get assigned a desk, you get everything digitally reassigned your phone for that day like those are the types of new workflows emerging that will enable offices to be open safely, conveniently and using all this digital technology to manage a workflow that basically didn't exist six months ago. Organizations like CBRE are really on the leading edge and I think that's and again I think a lot of those office environments are going to be changed permanently not just temporarily because of hostelling and people working more remotely that'll probably go on long into the future. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Hey, there. Thanks. Good afternoon, all. Two questions for me. I'll ask both up front, net customer ads the pace there continues to impress, you're now at 200,000 active customers. Is there anything happening there more recently with some of the new use cases that is pulling some potential new customers forward or can that trend persist maybe not at the pace we've seen but given where penetrations are versus the total opportunity? Just would be curious to hear your view there. And then George, I know it's relatively still early in the go-to-market evolution for Twilio, but is there anything you're seeing that could lead to more verticalization of the sales force and a few focus industries like healthcare, financial services or education? Thanks. This is Georgia. Thanks for the question. I'll take a crack at both of those and then certainly anyone else can chime in. In terms of the net, the net customer ads I mean definitely what we've seen consistently across our funnel is a lot more experimentation happening as people trying to figure out how to adapt to changing circumstances. I think that's all part of this digital acceleration trend that just talking about. It's not certainly confined to one use case or one specific subject matter. And what's interesting is as we look at our numbers, we kind of document or classify all of our inbounds by use cases they come in. And it's not like they're all focused on one thing or even as certain early COVID use cases have come back a little bit. They've been replaced by other things. So I think it's a very diversified interest in digital acceleration across different industries and geography. So I think that's what's healing that.
In terms of the verticalization, we, I do think there is an opportunity for that for us to do more of that in the future. We have some great specialist resources right now already in areas like health care and financial services, as well as in the -- we're seeing opportunities in local, state local government for example contact tracing. So we're certainly today still mostly a geo and segment-based distribution organization, but I do see an opportunity for us as kind of the normal course and speed of things over time to do more vertical things. And we're really excited about something we're seeing in healthcare for example after our HIPAA capability announcement earlier this year. It's really, I think open the door for us to be able to have more and more of those conversations which is really, really exciting for us. Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with Cowen. Your line is open. Thanks and congrats on a great quarter. Jeff your survey was pretty astonishing particularly around finding that the average enterprise is pulling forward their communication engagement strategy by six years. And I'm just wondering if you could give us a flavor of how the scope of engagements is changing for you guys particularly with larger enterprises? And I guess I'm looking at -- are companies looking to do bigger overhaul of their communication technologies at once or take on bigger pieces or are you seeing kind of an acceleration of replacing legacy or seeing more executive level involvement? Just would be great to hear how you're seeing the engagements evolve. Yes, absolutely, Derrick. So I think what we're seeing is a like a broad set of use cases at a broad set of companies. And so it's differing a bit by company, obviously, many companies are focused on the short-term needs first right. When you had to send all of your workforce home and they weren't able to do their jobs anymore well that's the top priority for a company. And that's kind of what we were looking at early in COVID and but as like as I would call COVID response version one which was like scramble to get stuff done basically over the course of like a weekend or a few days, as that stabilized a lot of organizations, a lot of industries I think have started to think about okay what does version two of this look like. What do we really want? And I think that's where you're starting to see like our deal with EPIC in the healthcare space, which is hospitals wanting to put in a vertically specific solution for healthcare that will serve them long into the future as opposed to a more horizontal solution that was maybe version one of that solution.
And so I think that's sort of a trend that you're seeing play out which is like first there's the kind of initial response and then playing out where people are building more integrated, more use case or vertically specific answers to how they're building. And I think the other thing is given the urgency of these use cases the importance of solving these digital transformation problems quickly during COVID, well that is accelerating many of the introductions to new businesses that we're seeing. I'm sure George has examples of that as well as just the strategic importance of the work that companies are doing with Twilio. We, our importance as a strategic partner to companies has grown quite a bit this year because in many cases the use cases and the workloads that we're seeing have direct line of sight to CEO visibility and c-suite importance, where maybe before COVID they weren't quite there yet and now they are definitely in the line of sight for key decisions and key strategic initiatives are going on at these companies. I don't know George is there anything you would add? I think that's spot on and I think we've already talked about in our kind of core script some of the logos that we've been able to bring in some new some existing. But I think the common thread is that if you look at all of these customers we talked about, we're talking to and we're selling to a higher level than before. The decision is moving quicker and oftentimes what we're seeing is that these projects are either a phase one to something bigger, so there's more on the plate whereas before maybe it was just an isolated transaction and/ or these are expansions of existing relationships which just shows that we're continuing to go grow in our depth and quality of relationship with customers. And I'm very excited about SIGNAL. I think we're going to have our best showing yet for example for our creator summit which is our executive track. I think every year we see the titles get a little bit higher, the conversation's a little bit more strategic and I certainly anticipate this year at SIGNAL we'll have more of that even as a virtual event. You next question comes from the line of Alex Kurtz with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Thanks. Can you guys hear me, okay? Great, just thanks just back to Flex now that you have more time looking at deals in the pipeline and seeing how customers are interacting with the platform, how would you say it's materializing as far as deal size now that you've gotten a couple more quarters in it, it's just staying roughly the same kind of landing size and the first couple of iterations of how people are using it? Then I guess the sales cycles, it's a little bit different than the core platform and how it's deployed. So I just need a little bit more context as you guys have taken a little bit more time to look at the pipeline and how it's progressed so far. I think it's hard to generalize it because if you just look at like the raw average dollar value per opportunity. I think it'd be misleading in the sense that we are seeing, yes, some large transactions in the pipeline that we're working on but I think a lot of these like what COVID has done is it's really triggered a lot of these shorter term, I shouldn't say shorter term but like initial deployments that people are in a kind of as Jeff called it phase one COVID getting, people getting something to get it done and contact recent is a great example where even if eventually they want to get the thousands of contact tracers, the starting point typically is a much smaller number than that. So if you look at the initial deal size, I think it's kind of misleading.
What we are seeing is faster engagement for certain projects that are more time sensitive and also the beginning of what we hope to be larger and larger projects as some examples I mentioned plus DGL is a good example where we think there's an opportunity to do even more with them over time. So I think some of these initial deal sites are precursor to bigger opportunities for us down the line. And I think that's what we're excited about is we're planting a lot of seeds during this period. And we're getting the word out about Flex and people are really liking what they're seeing which is really great. Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Great. Hi. Most of mine have been answered but I just had two quick ones from Khozema, just on the A2P for the third quarter is it should we be assuming just as a baseline roughly the same as the $7 million you got in this past quarter? And then I had a question, Jeff, just if you go back to January 1st pre-COVID being on anyone's mind. Can you kind of think about what your three-year outlook was for Flex and adoption and you compare it to how you feel now? How would you characterize the difference and how you're feeling about just kind of the trajectory of that business? And that's it. Thanks. Hey, Heather. This is Khozema. I'll take it first and then turn it over to Jeff. In terms of A2P, I would say roughly order of magnitude the same, it's obviously going to vary a little bit with volume, but you're in the ballpark for sure. Jeff? Hey, Heather. This is Jeff. So, yes, as far as Flex goes, I mean I think that the Flex is already off to a fantastic start as a product. I think it's an extraordinarily compelling value proposition for customers to be able to finally move these workloads into the cloud right. And as we've talked about in the past, it's -- we talked to analysts it was something like 85% of contact center was still on prem. Despite the fact that customers wanted to move these workloads into the cloud and Flex was a product that it was allowing them to do that. And I think COVID has only accelerated the adoption of that idea. We talked to customers. There are a lot of customers who had plans to move their contact centers into the cloud and these were multi-year roadmaps and those roadmaps have just been getting compressed. Now we've talked about some of the more extreme examples of like, oh, they got it done in a weekend and those are great examples to talk about. But I think the reality is that the majority of these ones they're not going to get done in a weekend obviously, but those roadmaps have been compressed from years probably down to quarters.
And I'm really excited by the conversations that we're having with a wide range of companies about the long-term plans for their contact centers. And how COVID in some ways has been an accelerant to make decisions, to invest resources and to really modernize how they engage with customers using these digital channels and part of the driver of that as we've talked about the past is work from home agents, the flexibility that the cloud enables for those employees to work from anywhere, which I think is really important given the agile workforce that everybody is planning for now not knowing exactly where those employees are going to reside when they do their work, but also because new channels are enabling new ways to flexibly and at scale be able to communicate with customers things like messaging. And one of the things we hear pretty consistently from customers on Flex is that messaging so SMS or WhatsApp or Facebook messenger using these messaging channels to be able to engage with customers in many ways is game changing. And I think Flex is the best messaging-oriented contact center out there.
And so I think that's another driver that was existing before COVID and now because scaling up these digital channels is getting even more important. Flex is an even more valuable -- value proposition for customers because of it. So I think there are multiple reasons why Flex is a great product for the market before COVID and not because of COVID that's even accelerated. Your next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Yes. Thank you, I'll add my congrats. So, Jeff, we've heard some commentary from your peer group that the increased usage that was driven by COVID-19 peaked back in April and then it has dissipated month over month but it's remained at an elevated level.
Some of that might have related a little more to the video conferencing scenarios. I'm just curious did you sense that to any extent or are your use cases broader to such an extent that it doesn't apply or that it's kind of getting counteracted by the other scenarios that are newly emerging? Well, given that we have an almost entirely usage-based revenue model by the magnitude of our performance, our beats this quarter. I think you would say that usage continued to grow. And when you look at the factors as Khozema talked about in early in the prepared remarks, there are some headwinds to certain industries and we support those customers helping them to build through the crisis, but they have seen decreases in usage for certain of those key travel, hospitality type industries. But that's been more than offset by increases across the board in a number of other industries as so many different kinds of companies in so many different verticals have had to invest in, digital accelerate those digital plans and really build great digital customer engagement to be able to serve their customers during this time. And long beyond because this is clearly the trend that the world's been on and so those plans that have been accelerated per survey companies took their plans and accelerated them by an average six years. And that's a pretty powerful tailwind for us. Your next question comes from the line of Matt Stotler with William Blair. Your line is open. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First one just another question on Flex. There have been some positive headlines around Flex adoption, a lot of interesting use cases and ways it's being leveraged in this current environment. We'd love to touch base on where we are in terms of feature functionality. I know this is a year that you guys have positioned as kind of reaching that critical feature functionality for broader adoption plus an update there and any compelling opportunities that you see to add further capabilities from here. This is George. I'll comment from the field perspective and then maybe if Jeff wants to comment from a product perspective. Certainly, we are executing our plan. So we're definitely seeing the product velocity be on pace and so we are delivering more and more capabilities as you would expect so and we're seeing that play out in terms of our success in the field. So overall, I think we feel good about our product velocity always more to do with the nature of software and this is a critical year for us but overall we're happy with the progress. I don't know Jeff if you want to add more color. Yes, absolutely. There are always more features of functionality to add based on customer need. I think that the key thing that we have done with Flex is get the sort of the bones of the product right. The architecture, the core value proposition, the programmability model that allows customers to go build on top of it. Those are things the industry hadn't seen before and we introduced in a way that enables companies to move really sophisticated workloads to the cloud in a pretty unprecedented way. And so when it -- while there is the feature roadmap that we're always investing in. I think the hard things to get done really that architecture that that core foundation to build upon is so good.
As it relates to the sort of foundational features that we keep building, absolutely. We've been knocking those out, probably the biggest requested one was outbound dialing. We knocked that one out in Q1 and we continue going down the list to finer and finer grained kind of foundational features for our customers. We have re-prioritized some of those in favor of COVID related features of functionality that customers have needed to scale those COVID related workloads in this year. But we feel great about the progress we're making around those features and the customer adoption and customer feedback that we're getting as it relates to both the kind of foundational elements, the architecture and the core value proposition, as well as the roadmap for building out those features that help customers along. Right, got it. That's super helpful. And then just one quick follow-up as somebody watching before I mean the pace of customer adoption has really picked up through the last four quarters, 10,000 plus net ads, but obviously still a lot of revenue coming from existing customers and net dollar retention rate's very positive so what does the land expand motion look like it's been a big part of your business historically. What does that look like in this COVID environment? And are you seeing any trends towards a larger initial contracts or initial usage? Thank you. I would say we haven't seen dramatic trends in that. I would say as I've said before that we're seeing a lot of interest in terms of signups, experimentation. So again I think if you just look at raw count of dollar per new signup or things like that, I don't think that's the story here. I think the story is we are seeing just more interest on top of the funnel and we are seeing some of the use cases drive significant growth for us even as other industries are being impacted. So I think that's been consistent. We are doing very well with our top customers as you alluded to and definitely what we're seeing in the world in general is that this pandemic is creating certain companies that are, it's a headwind for some; it's a tailwind for others. And for the ones who it's a tailwind for we're definitely growing along with them and doing very well.
So I think that's kind of behind some of the numbers and trends we're seeing. Your final question comes from the line of Rishi Jaluria with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Hey, guys. Thank you so much for squeezing me in and nice to see continued strong results in this environment. Just two questions for me. First in the discussion on these new verticals and new use cases. I understand your platform people are going to always find new ways to use the Twilio platform and that's I think a really exciting part of the story. Is there potential that one of these kinds of newer verticals or newer use cases can be smart productized in the same way that you're doing with Flex in the contact center. And then I want to ask talking about gross margins, even if we control for A2P right, it looks like gross margins declined about 70 basis points sequentially at 260 basis points year-over-year. Just any color you can provide on this because I know there are a ton of moving pieces and what drives gross margins. Thanks a lot. Yes. This is Jeff. I'll answer the first part of the question. Then I'll hand it over to Khozema. So as far as the like new use cases that are emerging because of COVID. I think that one of the things I've talked about in the past is the great things about being a platform business is that we deliver these building blocks to the developers of the world and to all of our customers. And they build solutions to the big problems that they have in their business. And by the very fact that customers are taking our building blocks and are building solutions to big unsolved problems like the fact that they're taking their time, their precious developer resources to go build on our platform indicates that there is probably an opportunity. And when we see areas where many customers are going and essentially inventing the same thing, we see that as an opportunity to go and essentially assess whether this is a big broad need by the market. And whether by us building products there we can accelerate all of our customers' ability to adopt that kind of use case and that's exactly what led us to the opportunity with Flex.
And I think we do continue to see opportunities that arise that have been maybe not created because of COVID but accelerated like greater macro trends that have been accelerated because of COVID that our opportunities for us to go address with future products. And with that I'll hand it over to Khozema. Thanks Jeff. Hey, Rishi. There's nothing really specific that I would call out around gross margins. We pointed to the A2P impact and as we've said in the past the gross margins can bounce around a little bit due to a variety of factors. We've in the past talked about customer mix or geographic mix products, FX what have you, there's really no change to our model. We still see gross margins in the mid to high 50s for the foreseeable future. So no real thing to call out there. There are no further questions at this time. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.","we are once again conducting our earnings call from separate locations . our earnings results press release, SEC filings and a replay of today's call can be found on our IR website at investors.twilio.com .",0.0

With that, I'll hand it over to you, Jeff. Thanks, Zilli, and welcome, everyone to this quarter's earnings call. Before turning to earnings, I want to encourage all who are listening, especially here in the United States to please vote, have a plan, find a way, make your voice heard.
At the top of our earnings calls from time to time, I may briefly discuss some elements of social justice, policy or societal issues in the hope that it has some impact, and to show that we at Twilio take these issues seriously.
At our last call, I've referenced the fact the Black Lives Matter. And I want to say it, because it needs to be said, Black Lives still matter. At Twilio, we will continue to advance the dialogue on this and other issues that we care about.
Now, on the earnings. We delivered another quarter of outstanding results. I could not be prouder of what we've accomplished during these trying times. Our success is a testament to the value proposition that Twilio's platform offers businesses, digital engagement, software agility and cloud scale.
Our goal is to build the world's leading customer engagement platform. We're going to achieve this vision by investing in our products, our platform and our people. The demand and excitement for digital customer engagement was evident during a recent customer and developer conference SIGNAL, where we had tens of thousands of people registered for our first ever virtual conference, embracing our builder mentality SIGNAL was run on Twilio's platform, which our internal team developed in a matter of months to great success.
Throughout SINGAL, we heard from leading enterprises like Nike, Delta Airlines, and Ernst and Young about how they are using Twilio's platform to create new ways to engage with their customers over digital channels. And to ensure we continue to meet the needs of our customers, we announced several new products and innovations to help the developers in the world continue to build solutions to solve today's challenges, as they execute on their digital transformation initiatives.
We know our customers are looking to Twilio Flex to take down the largest and most complex contact center workloads out there. But they want to do that while continuing to use the best to breed solutions they've grown to love, such as their workforce management, their CRM.
We announced the Twilio Flex ecosystem, enabling customers to access more than 30 validated solutions from partners including Google, Salesforce, Zendesk, and Calabrio, all built to accelerate contact center projects. Usage of Twilio Video has skyrocketed, and we want to get video in the hands of as many developers as possible. So we announced a free version of Twilio Video for peer to peer use cases called Twilio Video WebRTC Go.
Twilio Frontline is a mobile app that provides a direct messaging-based connection between customer facing employees and consumers, in a way that's safe, secure private and compliance. As non-desk workers far outnumber desk workers, frontline can help drive greater sales, higher customer satisfaction and lower costs through more efficient operations.
And we announced Twilio Microvisor, a complete device connectivity platform that eliminates the complexity of building for IoT. Microvisor runs on the connected device and creates a secure manage one time with the intelligence to connect to different types of networks, including WiFi and of course cellular the [indiscernible].
We also recently announced our intent to acquire Segment, the leading customer data platform. Segment enables developers and companies to unify customer data from every customer touchpoint and every system of record, empowering marketing, sales and service leaders with the insights they need to design and build relevant, data driven customer engagement.
The combination of Segment and Twilio, means that we will be able to help any business make their customer engagement across every channel more personalized, timely and impactful. This is an important step towards our vision of building the world's leading customer engagement platform.
We also wouldn't be able to execute on this vision without the strong culture and inclusive workforce our employees embrace every day. Which is why I'm excited to welcome Lybra Clemons, Twilio’s first Chief Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging Officer. Lybra is responsible for guiding and scaling Twilio’s inclusion strategy and diversity initiatives across the company's global workforce. There has never been a more important time to bring in a Head of Diversity to the C-suite of the company, and I'm excited for where she will lead us.
I again want to thank our employees, for their continued dedication to our customers and for delivering these great results, and a special thanks to the SIGNAL team for delivering such an outstanding virtual event. I also want to thank all of those who are on the frontlines, those who are fighting the fires in California, those who continue to fight this pandemic, and those who will be working the election poll stations, just over a week. Thank you, for everything you're doing for the rest of us. And please remember to get out and vote.
With that, I'll hand it over to George. Thanks, Jeff. The team delivered another quarter of great results in Q3. Our focus on growing our enterprise presence, expanding internationally and growing our partner ecosystem continues to drive great outcomes, as companies turn to Twilio’s customer engagement platform. And our opportunity is expanding as a result.
I'm extremely impressed with our marketing and events team, who created an amazing virtual experience for SIGNAL. In addition to all of the great individual sessions, we hosted our creator summit, when we brought together more than 200 executives from customers and prospects to network here from inspirational speakers and learn about Twilio. We also had more than 800 developer attendees at our super class and delivered 40 hours of content on SIGNAL TV, and our brand experience team built our conference experience from the ground up, incorporating more than 10 Twilio products, including Flex, Video and SMS.
During the quarter, we also announced that Deloitte Digital will be joining the Twilio built partner program as our first premier global systems integrator. Deloitte Digital’s Twilio practice will offer the entire Twilio product suite, including Flex for contact centers, as well as the full set of Twilio communications APIs and platform services, to help clients reinvent their marketing, sales and service and radically transform the customer engagement experience.
This is a great step forward in our partner program, as it significantly expands our reach and ability to leverage Deloitte expertise in our top industries, such as healthcare and financial services, where Twilio has helped institutions of all sizes dramatically transform the customer journey to adapt to these new circumstances.
In healthcare, the innovative solutions that have been built on top of Twilio to address the COVID-19 crisis, provide an opportunity for the industry to advance the use of technology to better deliver outcomes for patients and create tools that fit seamlessly within a physician's workflow. This has always been the vision, but the coronavirus crisis highlighted the urgency, immediacy and magnitude of that need. The team has been hard at work to make many of the Twilio’s most critical products hit the eligible, such as Twilio SMS, chat, conversations, video, voice and SIP and runtime tools.
As of today, Verify Look-Up are also HIPAA eligible for healthcare customers. And this focus on healthcare is paying off, as you can see with couple of deals we signed this quarter. We expanded our relationship with Philips, a leading health technology company focused on improving people's lives and enabling better outcomes across the health continuum.
In response to COVID, Philips build a virtual waiting room using Twilio SMS, to replace the physical waiting space in just six weeks. Health systems like Yale New Haven Health and Boston Medical Center, these solutions that cure viruses like COVID-19 and the flu. With this new solution, the patient texts the hospital when they arrive and hospital text them back when the room is available, so they can go straight to an exam room.
We entered into a new relationship with Banner Health, one of the largest not for profit healthcare systems in the country. After investigating several vendors, Banner Health selected Twilio to power patient notifications across multiple channels, beginning with our voice API. They view Twilio as the leading engagement platform that can power a consistent digital patient experience across Banner Health.
The financial services, another highly regulated industry and a key focus area for Twilio, institutions have long had apps, chatbots and other customer service tools to help them connect with customers. But COVID was the first time that these capabilities were put to the test as the primary way for people to interact with their service providers. With the pandemic hit consumer banks, wealth managers and insurance companies were flooded with inbound calls from customers, while being tasked with developing a richer set of capabilities and tools to enable their employees to safely and effectively work from home.
Now, as providers look to the future, they're implementing a range of new digital solutions that create a better user experience for customers at any time and on any channel. We saw this in the third quarter as we expanded our relationship with a Fortune 50 bank that was forced to close many branches in response to COVID. They were looking for a better way to engage with customers via digital channels. They selected Flex, integrating it with programmable messaging and sales force to power their new omnichannel digital customer engagement strategy, to improve lead conversion and provide better customer service on demand.
We also signed a new Flex deal with Robinhood, a pioneer of commission free trading. As the demand for their platform has accelerated as a result of COVID, Robinhood is continuing to adapt, scale and power elements of its customer support with Flex.
As we discussed, we have a very broad customer base and our platform is used by companies across more than just healthcare or financial services. Some other great deals from the quarter include an expanded relationship with Alaska Airlines, the fifth largest U.S. airline based on passenger traffic. In an effort to reduce direct interaction between employees guests in response to COVID, Alaska is using our programmable SMS connected to their reservation system to allow agents to send a customer's boarding pass via SMS.
We entered a new relationship with Prometric, the global leader in technology-enabled testing and assessment solutions. With the acceleration of digital technology driving new consumer behaviors, as well as an increasing need for remote test proctoring as a result of COVID, Prometric selected Twilio as a video management service for their application, with Flex as the user interface between the proctors, security agents, readiness agents and test takers.
Overall, our team continues to execute on our strategy as our investments in enterprise go-to-market, international expansion and our partner ecosystem are paying off. We are extremely well-positioned as we look to close out the year, and we're excited about the massive opportunity ahead of us in the next several years.
And with that, I'll hand it over to Khozema. Thank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. Total Revenue for Q3 grew 52% year-over-year to $448 million, and dollar-based net expansion was 137% as we continued to see broad based strength across the business.
As we get closer to the election, political traffic is likely to pick up, and we saw that in the third quarter as political traffic contributed approximately $10 million or 2% to revenue. Excluding political traffic in Q3, 2020, revenue grew 48%.
Revenue from our top 10 active customer accounts represented 14% of revenue, compared to 15% last quarter, and 13% last year. International revenue was 27% to total revenue in Q3, compared to 27% last quarter and 28% in Q3, 2019.
WhatsApp contributed approximately 6% of revenue, down from 7% last quarter. Starting in 2021, we will no longer breakout WhatsApp as a percentage of revenue. We continue to have a great relationship with WhatsApp. However, as our businesses scaled, coupled with the strong revenue diversification we discussed at our Investor Day, disclosing the contribution from a single customer is less meaningful.
Verizon's A2P fees contributed approximately $10 million to revenue. As a reminder, this fee is a direct pass through to customers and does not impact gross profit dollars. I did want to note that we expect to stop breaking this out in 2021, as we lap the implementation of the Verizon fees. If and when we experience fees from other carriers, we do expect to provide that information if relevant.
Third quarter, non-GAAP gross margin was approximately 55% and was negatively impacted by 130 basis points from A2P fees. As you'll recall from our recent Analyst Day, we discussed that gross margins would be negatively impacted in the short-term, as the growth of our messaging product has been reaccelerating, a trend that continued in Q3.
To reiterate, this is a trade-off that we will gladly take as it adds gross profit dollars, which we can continue to reinvest, delivering elevated levels of growth. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by about 100 basis points from foreign exchange, primarily from the euro, appreciating relative to the U.S. dollar.
Non-GAAP operating profit came in at approximately $7 million stronger than originally forecasted, driven by higher than forecasted revenue and the timing of hiring within the quarter. While we were able to catch-up on our hiring plans in the third quarter, the timing of some of the hires meant that we didn't fully recognize the expenses we had forecasted.
Moving to guidance. Please note that our guidance today does not include the impact of our announced acquisition of Segment. We expect the acquisition to close during the quarter and we do expect a modest top and bottom line impact in the fourth quarter. As such, on a standalone basis, we expect Q4 revenue of $450 million to $455 million, including A2P fees for year-over-year growth of 36% to 37%, and we expect a fourth quarter operating loss in the range of $10 million to $15 million.
While on the topic of guidance, I'd like to update you on our guidance velocity. Going forward, we plan on only providing quarterly guidance. At our recent Investor Day, we provided medium-term guidance that we expect 30% organic annual revenue growth for the next four years. Also, our medium-term guidance does not incorporate the pending acquisition of Segment. This guidance was provided based on our forecast for Twilio’s existing business. We are managing the business for the long-term, making decisions that benefit all stakeholders and our medium-term revenue guidance reflects this.
As we discussed at our Analyst Day, some of the investments we plan on making this year did not materialize, as we had originally forecasted due to COVID. We're still finalizing our 2021 plan, we intend to continue with our investment plans into 2021, which we anticipate will drive operating losses into next year. Also, with our recent announcement to acquire Segment, there will be certain integration costs will incur to further enhance Twilio’s customer engagement platform. Once the deal closes, we expect to provide more information on our Q4 call.
Lastly, I encourage those of you that may have missed our Investor Day held on October 1, as well as our announcement acquiring Segment to visit Twilio’s Investor Relations website at investors.twilio.com, to view the presentations and webcasts.
I wish everyone well and hope you are healthy and safe. Thank you for joining. Operator, please open the line for questions. [Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Great. Thanks. Maybe first question, just on SIGNAL. Could you give some color or commentary as to what were the most attended sessions? Or where you kind of saw most customer questions around? And was any of that surprising?
And then maybe just Khozema any bounce back worth noting in key verticals like travel and hospitality? That's it for me. Thanks. This is Jeff. Thank you for the question, Meta. So I think SIGNAL was a broad based success across the board, in terms of in sessions for both the technical tracks for the developers and the audience, as well as for the executives with our creator summit.
And so I think one of the key things about SIGNAL as we progressed and built on our engagement cloud strategy and started really building that dialogue with the technical folks, but also now the executives. And that is increasing our strategic positioning and allowing us to sell more broadly into organizations. And actually a not much bigger problem remains inside of those companies, such as the broad based question of customer engagement, as opposed to the more narrower view of the particular communications workflows. And so that's fantastic. We're really pleased by the growth of SIGNAL, 10x the attendance of prior years.
Obviously, a lot of that's driven by the virtual nature of it, and as well the participation by leading enterprises. So this year we have the CEOs of both Nike, Delta Airlines talking about their digital transformations and the acceleration of those digital transformations have gone, because of COVID.
And so, I think those are some of the key highlights of SIGNAL. And I don't know, if Khozema, do you have something about that? I think the second part of the question was around travel and hospitality or the impacted industries, and Meta, we have seen some traffic in the more heavily impacted industries return, but they're still below pre-COVID levels. I would characterize it more as green shoots. Great. Thanks, guys. Your next question comes from the line of Nikolay Beliov from Bank of America. Your line is open. Hi, thanks so much for taking my questions. It's a question for George. George, as you build out this comprehensive customer engagement platform, at what point do you start running into Salesforce, Oracle, Adobe, the legacy if you will, customer engagement vendors? At what point you guys step back and coexist and compliment them? Just philosophically, just wondering your thinking around this topic, please. Thank you. Yes, I mean, it's a great question. And we are very complimentary, I would say that, many of our customers today are customers of these other companies. And we're very complementary. We don't often, like, see them in the sense we don't compete with them because we're coming out of the problem in a very different way. And we're starting with developers and we're working with them on really the communications and customer engagement, which is really our strong point obviously, and not where we see a lot of other companies that you mentioned focus.
So, I’ll say, overall, we're very, very complementary and our customers view it that way. So I think that's going very well for us. And George, as a follow-up, around Flex. When do you think Flex will become a way to wholesale replace legacy call centers versus complimenting them right now? Congratulations on the new wins around Flex. Some of them sounds like complimenting the existing call center solutions versus wholesale replacement. Yes. I think that it's a multi-year journey for us to mature the product. So, we do have companies that do use us as the end-to-end contact center platform. We have many situations we’re complementary. I think it's just I view it as normal enterprise software maturity. So we continue to mature the product. We're very excited about the evolution of the product over time. And we're now several years in and we're seeing that the market recognize that.
And I think you're just going to see normal evolution there. And we're going to be more and more able over time to take on larger and larger workloads on the platform. But nothing, I just think it's a normal evolution. Thanks, so much. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Great, thanks. Good afternoon. I think the biggest takeaway was around the last point that Khozema laid out for many of us from the Investor Day around the ambition of that 30% organic revenue growth target over the next four years. So maybe going back to that, can you expand on what you guys you're seeing in the field today that gives you the confidence in your ability to execute on that multiyear vision, as that would put you in an admittedly verified air and software if you are able to sustain that pace? Well, this is George, since you asked for the field perspective. We're seeing digital acceleration. We're seeing that people are especially in this environment, realizing that there's a greater push than ever to be able to engage consumers and customers on digital channels in new ways and new modalities. And so, our research shows that this digital transformation is being accelerated by up to six years. And in fact, that was just last week on a CXO conference where CIO of a major retailer also said that they're seeing digital acceleration or the other three panelists I was with all talked about digital acceleration.
So, at every level, I think that this is not just a temporal thing, but part of a new way the companies to engage. And so I think it's that macro shift we're seeing in the market, its macro acceleration that gives us confidence that we are where the market is and is going, but this is a huge need, a tremendous need in the marketplace, that there's a need that every company in the world has from small business all the way up to the enterprise.
And so I think that this just really speaks to this generational opportunity we have which makes us believe that we have the market size here to sustain that level of growth, and also that we have really the right platform, the right message at the right time with the right go to market approach and product approach to address that need. And I think you see that in our numbers this quarter.
And we're just also seeing that reflected in the conversations on the field and even these 200 plus executives at our creator summit at Twilio which is an awesome number for us speaks to the fact that even not just developers now, but more and more executives are starting to realize that this is a strategic area for them. And Twilio is a company that they think of in a very different way. It's good color. Just maybe a quick follow-up. On the dollar based net expansion metric that stepped back up to 137%. I think we've all been talking more about SendGrid impacts normalization, but that's the highest organic level we've seen since mid-last year. So anything else you can add around what's allowing you to sustain those levels as you move to even greater scale here. Thank you. Michael, this is Khozema here. I think, what we're seeing across the board is that there's just broad-based strength across the entirety of the business. And so there's no one specific thing that I would highlight as a result of that. I think that there are companies that are continuing to digitally transform as we pointed out a few times. And I think we're seeing a lot of tailwinds based on some of the things that George just described and we're super happy with the 137%. And we do think that will normalize and fade over time, but we're certainly really happy about what happened in the quarter. Thanks. Excellent results. I appreciate it. Thanks. Your next question comes from the line of Matt Stotler from William Blair. Your line is open. Hey, thanks for taking my questions. I guess just to start on IoT. Obviously, a very interesting opportunity for you guys here, especially with the launch of Microvisor. How significant do you see IoT in terms of use cases for Twilio's business today? And how do you think about over time what this could be for you? And kind of how long do you think it will take that business to become a more significant contributor to the overall business there? Thanks, Matt. I will take, this is Jeff. So IoT is the market we're very excited about. I think that of all the talk of IoT that's gone on to the last say five almost 10 years, this is a field that Twilio is still in its infancy. And we're investing to capture a market that we feel is going to grow over the next decade or more.
That said, it's a smaller investments and it's a smaller part of our business than the mainstream of our business, which is customer engagement. But the way I look at it, the great thing about having a developer platform is you can start at the broadest most applicable building blocks there, put them in the hands of developers and say we can't wait to see what you build.
And as the market unfolds, developers show you where the big unsolved challenges are and that allows us to make smarter investments over time. So for example, with IoT, we started with connectivity, because that allowed us to leverage the skill that we had in taking very complex telco oriented relationships and economics and technology, and packaged that up in an easy to use platform for developers that encourages innovation.
And then based on that product, we were able to understand that another big unsolved problem for IoT developers was actually on the chip itself, when how you actually deploy code to those devices and how you make that code updatable, secure, inspectable, et cetera. And that led us to invest in Microvisor.
And so we see the IoT roadmap is a long run and it's a bet that we're making that the IoT market will be one where there is a tremendous amount of innovation in the years to come. And not necessarily innovation in the places where we see it on a day to day basis, a lot of people think about IoT and they think about their home and their thermostat or their watch or whatever.
And actually I think there'll be very big areas of growth, when you start connecting just broad base like hundreds of millions, maybe billions of sensors out there in the fields where crops are grown, or detractors or subsidies and investing in smart cities. Those are the types of use cases that are really just at their infancy.
One of the things we talked about quite a bit internally is one of the drivers of IoT, one of the many drivers of IoT is actually the environment. And how with better connectedness, better information about what's going on in our cities, we can direct resources better, whether it's in our cities or in the fields or in framing and things like that to in order to save energy and make our economy and our society more efficient.
So there's a lot of drivers of IoT that are coming and the technology solutions that are now arising such as narrowband, 5G, smarter chips things like that, as well as the innovations that Twilio bring to the market that are the drivers we believe over the coming decade and more. Got it. Yes. It's very interesting. I think there's one more just for Khozema. The color around the political contributions is helpful, or at least the political use cases and how they contribute to revenue. Maybe just any thoughts on what you've embedded in terms of guidance for that stable up and down to Q4? And then any impact that that had on the dollar base net expansion in the quarter will be helpful? Yes. It's pretty modest in terms of the Q4 impact. I would say it's kind of in the same range. If you recall back to our Investor Day, we kind of called it around this like 1% range, we call it out it's about 2%. Today, we would expect it to increase a little bit but again, I think it'll be pretty modest. Not a hugely significant impact on the elevation of expansion, obviously that's a million dollar contribution will impact it a little bit. But, the elections a week away, and so I don't think we expect a lot more to transpire after that. Alright. Understood. Thanks again. Thanks, Matt. Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood from Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Great. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats a very good quarter. I wanted to ask first question on frontlines, and certainly seems to be an interesting opportunity to help further transform customer engagement initiatives. Two questions. First, do you think this could become a fair revenue driver, as you look over the next one to two years, especially considering you've already got some interesting referenceable customers?
And then second, this really seems like a Greenfield opportunity that doesn't exist in the market. I'm curious where you think, an application like this, where budgets are likely to come from whether it's on customer service, or marketing or even some other operational line? Thanks. Thanks, Derrick. This is Jeff. So, first of all, we see this as a really emerging workload. If you think about it maybe five years ago the need for these frontline workers just saw the quantity of frontline workers changed the number of role and have changed, not just the result of COVID but as a result of the digitization of some of the industries. This role is essentially growing, and the role they play is being directly engaging with customers, as a new role for a lot of these companies.
And so I think this is an emerging workload that we're investing in. So we're excited because when we talk to customers, we see them using our platform for these types of workloads already organically and you see frontlines fighting, their ability to find success in these use cases by instead of having to go build themselves a logic of being able to take something and get it in the hands so they can build more quickly on top of us.
And that allows them to use all these frontline employees, whether they are retail workers, whether they are delivery drivers, whether they are field service technicians, because a lot of different types of workers working through it, allow them to be great omnichannel communicators and great agents of engagements with the end customers of those businesses. And so, I think -- what was the second part of your question? I think the second where the budget would come from. I think where we're in the discussion with in terms of revenue contribution. And I would just say that, frontline still in beta. And so we're not really commenting on the contribution to revenue at this point in time. Obviously, over time, we would expect that it would contribute to revenue, but like a lot of our beta products, it'll kind of bleed into our revenues over time. Got it. Okay, maybe follow-up Khozema. Regarding Q4 guidance, I think it's about flat to up 2% sequentially. And that's much lower than you've historically seen into Q4. Is there something to be aware of that may can't generate seasonal strength this year versus past years? Or is that mostly just keeping a good degree of conservatism? And maybe if you could just speak to how you feel about pipeline going into Q4? Yes. I mean, I think Derrick, we feel good about what we turned in Q3, and we continue to see broad based strength across what we feel is like a really diversified business at this point. There's obviously persistent questions and kind of the macro environment. And we obviously are facing an election here in the next week or so. So we continue to see strength, certainly in Q3, but that macro environment is a little bit uncertain and so I think we're just being prudent.
I think our 4 guidance as published certainly shows continued strong growth. We remain cautiously optimistic about our performance in the near-term. And then, in the medium-term, as you'll note, we provided guidance at the investor day of 30% over the next four years. So we certainly remain confident in our growth prospects in both the near and medium-terms. Thanks. Thanks and congrats. Thanks, Derrick. Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kurtz from KeyBanc. Your line is open. Yes, thanks. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on the quarter. When you think about the investments you're making for next fiscal year, is there any big changes versus what you are run rating through, at the end of the year here? Is there something that you're going to be layering on whether it's Flex, or the hypervisor product or maybe just telemedicine? Any changes this year versus next year? And where the bets are being made? Yes, not really. Alex, I would say it's a bit more steady as she goes. We've commented on investments that we were going to make at the start of the year, and we've kind of commented throughout the year, how it's been a little bit harder to make those than we originally set out. And so just as kind of a refresher, we're continuing to make investments in go to market. We feel great about the traction that George has seen, for example, in enterprise and Flex and international.
We called up previously, a number of investments that we wanted to make in R&D in particular, the center of excellence that that we opened in India, that's off to a good start, we're going to continue investing there. And then, they're just kind of the basics of building and scaling a company. We've talked about some systems and processes that we think are important to us. We called those out again, during the recent Investor Day. And I think, at this point, we're just trying to set up the business to take advantage of our growth and the scale.
And we think, if we can do those things, then we set ourselves up nicely for the medium-term. Thank you. Thanks, Alex. Your next question comes from a line of Rishi Jaluria from D.A. Davidson and Company. Your line is open. Hey, guys, thanks so much for taking my questions. And nice to see some continued strong execution. I just wanted to go a little bit deeper into the international side of the business. Maybe can you give us a little bit color in terms of a, where you're seeing, if there's any particular geographies we're calling out that you're seeing particular strength in.
And alongside that, I mean, going back just want to help recall you gave us at the Analyst Day. Just how we should be thinking about the investments you're making internationally, and the trajectory of getting gross margin expansion, as you continue to grow internationally, both customers and traffic wise? Thanks. It's George. I think the overall story is balanced growth globally. I do think that, if there were any areas that we're seeing some particular strengths, it would be in the Americas, both North America as well as Latin America. We are seeing probably a little bit more strength there. But overall, I would say we're seeing balanced growth.
I'll turn it over to Khozema for the question around margins. Rishi, in terms of margins, really no change from the guidance that we provided at the Investor Day. In the short-term, we're very focused on growing gross profits. And we see a lot of opportunity out there and we talked about some of the dynamics with our accelerating messaging business, for example. We continue to see great paybacks in terms of enterprise reps and Flex and we want to continue onboarding complicated selling experience, for example.
But over time we do anticipate that our gross margins are going to creep above that 60% range, and no real change in terms of our philosophy there. All right, great. Thank you. Thanks, Rishi. Your next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer & Co. Your line is open. Thanks. It's Ittai. Guys, congrats great quarter. Couple of questions for me, first for you Khozema on the OpEx clearly. You're trying to hire a lot. It doesn't seem to be working, though, like, you kind of falling short of plans for a few quarters in a row. What's changing internally that will enable you to do that as you move into next year? It makes a lot of sense for you to hire a lot. It seems a little more difficult than planned. So what's going to change that? And I have a follow-up. Yes. I think there's a couple dynamics there, Ittai. So the first thing is, is that, some of the profit that dropped through is just as a result of increased revenue, right. So there's a little bit of a dynamic there. I think the second thing is, is that in Q3, it was probably the first quarter in the last couple quarters that we were able to catch up our hiring. So you're right, in terms of Q1 and Q2, we did have a little bit of difficulty just in terms of some COVID dynamics.
But I think now, we've certainly appropriately staffed our talent acquisition team. And so I think now we'll be in a position to be able to make investments on the pace that we would like to and a lot of those investments and that being hiring. And I think we'll be in great shape over the next year or so. That's great. And then a follow-up for you, George, on the Deloitte Digital deal. Can you give us a little bit more color on how the ramp is going to go? How do we think about the investment that Deloitte has committed to make on each? And in order to drive Twilio how long before results start showing? And is there any exclusivity here? What are the odds we see other Deloitte Digital deals out there? Thanks. That's a great question. And we're very excited about the Deloitte Digital partnership. And we think that overall, it really speaks to the progress that we're making in both the enterprise as well as with our broader platform story, and also aligning to this broader story of digital acceleration that we've been talking about.
We just kicked off the partnership. So you know, right now, we are ramping them up. We're getting them trained. They're committing a certain number of consultants to basically get educated on the Twilio platform. We're also in progress right now with a couple of lighthouse customers to jumpstart the partnership. So for the first period of partnership, we're going to be focusing on getting these lighthouse customers successful. And then ramping up after that. And I think we mutually have, obviously, big vision of what we can do together. It's not an exclusive partnership, but it's an exciting partnership. And we think that this is just the beginning hopefully, of how we continue to grow and expand our systems integrator program, especially at the GSI level. Very good. Excellent. Congrats, guys. Good luck. Your next question comes from the line of Scott Wilson from RBC. Your line is open. Hey, guys. This is Alex Zukin. Thanks for taking my question. I guess maybe because I'm the first one for you at a high level. If I think about the acceleration in the business terms that you're seeing both at the new customer level at the messaging level at the existing customer level, how important is bidirectional messaging to the business today? What percentage of messages that you send are kind of going in both directions? And how should we think about that over the next three years? And I've got a quick follow-up. Yes. I mean, we don't break it out at that level. Alex, we have you a number of breakouts in terms of our product split at the Investor Day, and I think that’s about the direction that we're planning to go down to in terms of disclosures.
What I'll say is that I think bidirectional is super important to us over the long-term. As you know just based on your own interactions with the consumer the bidirectional nature of messaging is still in its relative infancy. And I think the number of the products that we have, in particular conversations products that we launched and I guess last year, we feel great about the way that that's been adopted. And again, most businesses are still sending it one way. And so we think there's opportunity there over time. Got it. And then maybe another kind of big picture one, which is if you think about you obviously have been executing quite well this year. But there's still likely some headwinds to your business that are going to potentially turn into tailwinds next year, presuming the economy continues to recover. What are those? If you remind us what those headwinds that could become tailwinds next year, would be? And how we should think about that as a growth driver? Yes. I mean, I think in terms of the way that we have guided, we basically said that over the next four or so years that we feel like we can continue delivering 30% revenue growth annually. And I think what we've seen over the last year or so is that there's been pretty consistent and broad-based revenue strength across the entirety of the business.
Now, as we went into COVID, I think the one dynamic that we did see on sort of the negative side was that there were some heavily impacted industries like rideshare, like travel hospitality. And, as we talked about earlier in this call, the traffic in those industries is still lower than pre-COVID volumes and so we would expect some bounce back in that. And now we're not calling exactly when that is obviously, it's kind of hard to say.
The other thing I would just point out, though, is that, some of the acceleration that we've seen, for example, in healthcare and education, e-commerce, but we also think that those use cases are going to be pretty resilient. I don't think they're going to be ephemeral at all. In fact, I think we see a lot more opportunity in some of those industries. And so I think that's going to provide ongoing tailwind over the medium-term as well. Got it. Khozema, if I could sneak one more and just about Segment. A question, I've gotten continuously is what roughly percentage of the revenue stream there is usage based versus subscription? And how is that going to impact the deferred write down? Yes. Alex, we're just not in a position to be able to provide financial information on the Segment transaction right now. We're not closed yet. And I think once we get close, as we disclose our Q4 results, we'll give you a lot more information there. But, we're not going to provide accounting impacts and financials today. Fair enough. Thank you, guys. Congrats again. Thanks, Alex. Your next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin from Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Thank you. Good afternoon. I guess, Jeff, maybe I'll start with you. I know you can't provide a lot of financial detail around segment. But I did see that Peter's keynote at the CDP event last week came your way even more impressed with the opportunity here. I guess my question here could you share any feedback on Segment's set out from a customer and partner perspective in the last week or so? Well, I think what we've heard so far from customers or partners is a lot of excitement, because we're going to be able to accelerate not only SendGrid's or Segment's roadmap and their visions. But really it's what we can do together. And I think that's what a lot of customers are looking for in terms of single customer engagement platform that can take them end to end. Because if you think about it, we started with communications, but that's really a means to an end.
For B2C companies, engaging with your customer really starts with it understanding your customer. And for B2C companies that's really done with data. And all those data is residing in all those different systems, and all the piece of the picture for essentially what you know about the customer. And so, once you are able to assemble a complete picture of your customer, well, then you can engage with them really effectively. And that's communication.
So together, we can build the single platform that power end-to-end customer engagement, that's our goal, by bringing together the understanding of the customer, that's customer data, that's Segment, with actual engaging with them, touching those customers, getting them relevant, timely and impactful communications that actually make them more loyal and happier customers.
And so that’s generally speaking, the gist of how we find it and that is reflective of what customers have told us, the problem that they want solved, and that's why we're building the customer engagement platform in a way that we act. It makes sense, and helpful color. I guess George, we have seen that two fold quarters of this deal acceleration in a post-COVID era. I was hoping you talk about just the enterprise customer journey. Is it evolving? Are you landing with Flex and messaging? But the discussions are much broader. Are the expands accelerating? Just walk us through how that enterprise customer journey is changing, now that you have two fold quarters behind you. Well, while certainly we've been in this pandemic for a couple of quarters now, I think that the digital transformation of which digital acceleration is really a more recent phenomenon, that's been happening for a long time. And for us some of the dynamics have stayed similar, actually and I think will continue to stay similar, which is that we are continuously being brought in by developers, that messaging is a fantastic product for landing within an account as a starting point. So very, I think, easy to understand and fantastic starting point is really globally.
And then, what has changed in the acceleration is that really the speed of the exploration, adoption of new channels, more complex use cases. A great example would be Video. But, there was a previous question on like SIGNAL session attendance. And what really interesting to me was that while I would have expected that messaging would have been by far most attended breakout session. We had almost as many, if not more attendees per voice. There are some alone reflects, even IoT had roughly half the attendees of the messaging section.
So, we're now able to parlay that strength, that landing strength in messaging into much broader conversation. And you saw at SIGNAL that we had two fantastic CEOs from Delta and from Nike speaking. That certainly was not the case a year ago.
So, I think that there's a confluence of a lot of things happening here, both the need for digital acceleration as well as our capability and this investment that we've made both in our technology and our platform, as well as our go-to-market team to be able to now be in the right place at the right time to capture on this, to have these level of discussions and to expand our presence within the company. So what becomes method starts with messaging eventually becomes contact center or program of voice or all sorts of other interesting use cases that are coming out of that.
So, yes, I think it's a really, really exciting time for us, and one that I think validates a lot of the investments that we've made, and led to also the Segment's announcement, which I think just falls right in line with the strategy that we've laid out. Awesome. Thank you. That’s all I had. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy from JP Morgan. Your line is open. Yes, thank you very much. Jeff, interested in how you're thinking about investing in the voice channel relative to the messaging channel. It feels like voice is going to be pretty integral to the future of Flex. But I believe you had told us voice has settled in around 17% of revenue and messaging has just exploded to about 45%.
And if you have younger generations that are gravitating more toward messaging, are you kind of seeing on the margin reasons to shift investments that much more aggressively into messaging? I just think the drivers between the different channels are different. If you think about, like messaging, think about how many times you've actually had them engaging to a messaging conversation with this. It's actually still relatively small, but it's growing.
In fact, just a few years ago, it was novel when you got a text message from a business, and like just telling you your food is arriving or your flight was boarding or whatever, like that was novel. And so messaging is seeing a growth in the number of use cases, and how people are deploying messaging to help grow their businesses.
Whereas voice has been around for a very long time, obviously, that’s a 100 year old technology. But how people use it is actually changing. And I think that the changing nature of how we use voice, and look there's no way around that like people do use voice less than we did, say, 30 years ago. But how we use it is different as well as how the technology works is different.
And so the virtualization of voice moving into the cloud, maybe global by its very nature, as well as embedding it into the many workflows that we have as opposed to it being standalone, just like here's your desktop and our phone. Now voice is becoming an embedded part of many different software workflows, such as those in the contact center where voice is actually embedded in it or other workflows as well.
And so I just think the drivers of adoption and the ways in which these channels get used are different. And therefore we tailor our sales cycles, our paid service like that, is tailored to the drivers of what is driving companies to adopt messaging, oftentimes for the first time to build on use cases versus what's causing them to potentially re-architect, how they do voice, and capture emerging opportunities because of the new more flexible nature of voice in the world of software.
I'll give you an example there, things like being able to understand sentiments or to transcribe voice calls and to use them. And to consider voice callers data, those are sort of net new capabilities of the medium that are driving new ways for a variety of workloads to be considered inside of an ink patch. Very thankful. Great answer, Jeff. Khozema, I just have a quick follow-up. Are you able to approximate the rough dollar amount of systems investments that you were unable to make this year that you think would flow into 2021? Yes. We're just not going to provide guidance on that today, Mark. I think we gave you some revenue guidance for the next several years. We're going to give profit guidance or loss guidance, if you will, over the kind of on a quarter-by-quarter basis. I will say that there's a number of areas that we spelled out. At the beginning of the year, it's kind of the same dynamic in terms of the areas of investment. So I'm just not going to give a number today. Okay. Thank you. Thanks. Your next question comes from the line of William Power from Baird. Your line is open. Okay. Great, thanks. Yes, I think a couple of questions for Khozema. Maybe just coming back to Q3, I think even the largest dollar beat in your history. And I guess I'm sure the answer is probably partly broad based. But anything in particular you call out in terms of sources of outside, whether SMS, video anything else, that really was an upside surprise driver?
And then the second question, looking at the net expansion rate, I'm just trying to kind of dig into the key drivers of that. I mean, how much of that increased usage of existing products versus perhaps greater migration use of the engagement cloud products from existing customers? Any color you provide on that front too. Well, that's a good question. You largely provided the answer in your question, but I'll give you maybe a few additional details. So, you're right that it is kind of broad based strength across the board. We just saw a great performance kind of all-around in terms of a number of our customer segments, geographies, products, what have you.
Two of the things that we have pointed out both at our Investor Day as well today, we are continuing to see a reacceleration, if you will, in our messaging business. And we feel great about the additional growth that we've been able to drive there.
And then I think, the other dynamic is, is that I think at the Investor Day, we're probably about closer to a percent of revenue in terms of political. We said today that we're closer to 2% and about $10 million bucks in terms of what we saw in Q3.
And then I think the other dynamic is in terms of DBNE that was the other part of your question. Again, we're seeing broad based strength. We showed you a kind of a graphic during the Investor Day in terms of how does usage on new products versus existing and engagement cloud and so forth affect the dynamic in DBNE. And I wouldn't really say anything has changed significantly since then. So kind of a continuation of trends that we're seeing. And we feel really good about both DBNE as well as our revenue growth in the quarter. Okay. Thank you. Thanks, Will. And your last question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi from Mizuho. Your line is open. Thanks for taking my question. George, I just want to ask about the Flex adoption of cloud contact center. So, since you talked about recent partnerships with a SIs to build out of the box solution, I'm wondering how should we think about the penetration now into the contact center going forward, having this out of box solution. Well, I certainly think that we've always positioned Flex in differentiation around its programmability. And we believe that the combination of that plus the cloud is a very, very compelling value proposition for the market. And I think that you've seen during this particular situation we're in right now that that's accelerated the overall movement of contact center to the cloud. And certainly, we are beneficiary and we hope also a leader in that movement as well.
In terms of the SI dynamic of that, the SI impact on that, certainly, there are a segment of companies in the market that want the value proposition of the value programmable highly customized solution, but may not have the in-house development resources. I think that's what makes SIs and our platform models such a fantastic natural fit. And I think that's one of the things that Deloitte and other SIs that are in our build program are excited about, and will allow us to meet the needs. You have to allow us to meet the needs of a broader set of companies in the world now that can now tap into these SIs for their solutions of having to build them in-house.
So, I do think it opens our market. I think we’re still very beginning of that. We just announced this partnership, I think it remains to be seen how much of an impact that will have. But I think over time, it definitely will increase our addressable customer side for that I think we're very excited. Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, it appears we have come to the end of our conference. Thank you for participating in today's conference. You may now disconnect.","our earnings results press release, SEC filings and a replay of today's call can be found on our IR website at investors.twilio.com . some of our commentary today will be in non-GAAP terms . if any of these risks materialize, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections .",0.0

My name is Jason, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.
I will now turn the call over to Andrew Zilli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasury. Mr. Zilli, you may begin. Thanks. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us for Twilio's fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings conference call. Our results press release, SEC filings, and a replay of today's call can be found on our IR website at investors.twilio.com. Joining me virtually today are Jeff Lawson, Co-Founder and CEO; George Hu, COO; and Khozema Shipchandler, CFO. We also Peter Reinhardt, CEO of Twilio Segment joining us for Q&A.
As a reminder, some of our commentary today will be in non-GAAP terms. Reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and guidance can be found in our earnings press release.
Additionally, some of our discussion and responses may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. In particular, our plans and timing to close the Segment acquisition, and our expectations around the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations and financial condition, and that of our customers and partners is subject to change.
Should any of these risks materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections or those implied by these forward-looking statements.
A description of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results are included in our SEC filings, including our most recent report on Form 10-K, and subsequent reports on Form 10-Q. And our remarks during today's discussion should be considered to incorporate this information by reference.
Forward-looking statements represent our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call to reflect the events or circumstances after today, or to reflect the new information or the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law.
With that, I'll hand it over to you, Jeff. Thanks Zilli and thanks everybody for joining the call today. I want to begin today's call by recognizing that it's Black History Month here in the United States. Doing the work of overcoming systemic racism is the work of understanding Black history, not just the surface level history or the story of the civil rights movement, but understanding the deep history of oppression and racism that manifest today in less overt, less intentional ways, but is just as impactful on black lives today.
Black history isn't something of the past, it continues through today and there is an acknowledgment that we're writing Black history and American history today. Twilio's commitment to anti-racism is a commitment to write a better future. That's how I'm contextualizing Black History Month in 2021, differently than I've ever thought of it in the past.
Now, on to company earnings. Our fourth quarter continued the strength and momentum we saw throughout the year. Let me quickly touch on a few of the highlights for the full year. We delivered nearly $1.8 billion in total revenue, up 55% over last year; incredible growth at this scale.
We acquired Segment combining the market-leading customer data platform with our leading communications platform. We ended the year with more than 221,000 active customers and more than 10 million developer accounts, and we hosted our first ever virtual SIGNAL with more than 32,000 registrations.
Our 2020 results reinforce the idea that there is a massive generational opportunity in front of us. We have long known that there is a huge shift to more digital experiences and that every company is becoming a software company and that has been fueling our growth for more than a decade.
And what 2020 showed us is just how true it is that companies that embrace building, that embrace software agility, that empower their developers are the companies that are prepared for the unknown. Whether it's a pandemic, more competition in the market or anything else that is threatening to disrupt an industry or business, the companies that embrace software are able to accelerate their ability to respond to the changing conditions in their market.
The pandemic accelerated change overnight. Healthcare had to accelerate the adoption of telemedicine and commerce companies accelerated their e-commerce plans. Companies that hired more developers and upped their digital game during the pandemic are not going back.
The pandemic was a booster and now they're even better at addressing the digital needs of their customers. Digital is here to stay and there are more and more digital businesses in the world that Twilio is powering. That's why we are so excited about the opportunity ahead.
In fact, according to IDC, investments in digital transformation will nearly double by 2023 to $2.3 trillion, representing more than 50% of total IT spending worldwide. And Deloitte recently released a report stating that during the next 18 to 24 months, they expect to see leading companies embrace the bespoke for billions trend by exploring ways to use human-centered design and digital technology to create personalized, digitally-enriched interactions at scale.
Twilio's annual state of customer engagement report, launching next Wednesday, February 24, evidences this change. The study found that digital engagement was critical to survival in 2020 with 96% of business leaders reporting that not digitizing customer engagement would have negatively impacted their business, including making them less competitive, causing a loss of revenue and an inability to meet customer expectations.
And as the world seeks to find a new semblance of normal, businesses are not going back. Given the increased importance of digital engagement to companies' success moving forward, nearly all business leaders surveyed, 95% expect to increase or maintain their organization's investment in customer engagement after the pandemic. This is why we've been building out our customer engagement platform that truly serves the end-to-end lifecycle of all customer engagement in the enterprise.
We acquired Segment, the market-leading customer data platform, to provide a unified customer view to help companies better understand customers and engage more effectively over digital channels. Why? Because companies need to understand who their customers are, what products they are looking for, what products they've bought, and where customers are interacting with their brand across multiple touch points.
And our platform allows the developers of the world to build, to take all of those digital data that are siloed throughout the company, build a cohesive picture of the customer, build a world-class customer service experience, and deliver the right communication over the right channel at the right time.
The end game is to meaningfully improve every interaction; every business has with every customer. That's incredibly valuable to enterprises because it allows them to create differentiated customer experiences and our results validate that this is what the market wants.
Of course, to make all this work, we have to empower developers. We have more than 10 million developers around the world using Twilio to build the future of customer engagement and we're going to continue innovating to provide them the tools they need. Our developer ecosystem is one of the long-term competitive advantages for Twilio and we're going to continue to focus on making them successful.
Before I turn it over to George, I also wanted to highlight that we launched our first ever Impact Report today, which you can find on our website. The report cover several topics, including our focus on helping our neighbors and communities.
In fact, in 2020, non-profit social enterprises and local governments using Twilio helped reach 266 million people. You will also find information on our latest Diversity and Inclusion stack, as well as some new ESG initiatives and disclosures.
We also launched our WePledge movement for employee giving to the world, empowering every individual employee to pledge 1% of their time or income to do good. As Twilions, we volunteered more than 7,800 hours and donated more than $1 million in 2020. And Elysium, Zoom, Okta, and Pledge 1%, all signed on to join the WePledge movement.
There are a couple of recent additions to Twilio I'd like to welcome. In Q4, we hired Jeremiah Brazeau as our CTO to lead our technology, strategy and roadmap. And last month, we added Deval Patrick, former Governor of Massachusetts to our Board of Directors. In addition to his public sector experience, Deval held senior executive roles at Texaco and Coca-Cola and most recently founded the Double Impact Fund at Bain Capital.
Jeremiah and Deval are just the latest additions to our leadership in the last year as we brought on several new senior leaders who will be critical to our success as we continue to grow and scale the company.
And, finally, you may have seen in our press release that our Chief Legal Officer, Karyn Smith, will be leaving the company after six and a half years. Karyn has been a tremendous leader for Twilio and such an important part of our success, from building out our legal team to taking us public and more. I'm extremely grateful for her contributions to the company during her tenure. Karyn is going to stay on for a while, while we find our next General Counsel and ensure a smooth transition in the coming months.
Thank you to all Twilions for helping deliver such outstanding results and doing so much to help our customers, as well as the broader community during such a difficult year. We're extremely excited for 2021 and beyond as we take advantage of this generational opportunity.
With that, I'll hand it over to you, George. Thanks Jeff. I'm so excited about the great performance the team had in Q4, wrapping up an outstanding year in 2020. As you know, in addition to growing our sales capacity, we've been focused on four core areas; developers, enterprise presence, better national expansion, and growing our partner ecosystem. We saw tremendous success in these areas in 2020, but we still believe we are in the early innings and we plan to continue to invest in these four areas for 2021.
On our marketing side, we continue to focus on developers, while also engaging more and more at the executive level. Our team hosted 285 virtual events, including SIGNAL, Engage Everywhere, Superclasses, Twilio Engagement Center sessions, and more, connecting with nearly 40,000 customers and developers to help them build the future of customer engagement using the Twilio platform.
Our developer relations team hosted the largest Superclass event ever during SIGNAL, quadrupled the number of users on Twilio Flex and launched a new developer podcast on YouTube channel to drive further engagement with our expanding developer community.
And, of course, Jeff's new book Ask Your Developer, which, by the way, is a Wall Street Journal business national bestseller, is a great way to engage with enterprises and get them thinking about how they can empower their developers to build solutions for the future of customer engagement.
On the go-to-market side, our investments in the enterprise space are paying off as we become more strategic to the world's largest companies. In fact, in 2020, the number of transactions with Global 2000 customers was up 76% over the last year and the number of seven-figure yields overall was up 93% from 2019. We signed some great enterprise deals in Q4, including one with JPMorgan Chase, the largest bank in the U.S., who chose Twilio to enhance their customer service offering.
We also signed a deal with one of the world's largest retailers. With the surge in traffic during the holiday season, their on-premise email solution couldn't scale to support their volumes. And they knew it was time to move to the cloud. They selected Twilio SendGrid for the deliverability and scale needed to support the billions of emails they expected to send.
We expanded our relationship with a Fortune 500 P&C insurance company that was looking for a partner to support their multi-channel digital engagement journeys. They selected Twilio for SMS, Verify, Email, and WhatsApp to power several new solutions for their customers.
We also expanded our relationship with H&R Block, a leading tax preparation and financial services company and a Fortune 1000 company. In preparation for the upcoming tax season, H&R Block wanted to provide better virtual tax preparation experiences, while leveraging a single platform. We added Twilio Video for online tax appointments and are also using Voice, SMS, and Chat to provide a unified customer experience.
We are extremely excited about the addition of Segment to Twilio and while it is still early, we are seeing great traction as we signed a deal with Camping World, America's leading recreational vehicle and outdoor retailer and a Fortune 1000 company.
Segment will enable Camping World to quickly and easily understand who their most loyal customers are across domain and allow personalized rewarding experience across all of Camping World's digital touch points.
Internationally, we continue to invest to expand our presence in key markets and we're seeing great returns from those investments. We entered into a new relationship with a G2K insurance provider. They were looking to accelerate their efforts to focus on a digital-first engagement strategy and selected Twilio to build multiple solutions including WhatsApp within Flex for agent and sales communication, video solutions for sale reps who wants to talk to the VIP clients, and video solutions for telemedicine appointments.
Our partner ecosystem plays a critical role in expanding our reach around the world and in different industries. In 2020, consulting partners influenced three times as much revenue of 2019. We're involved in 50% of our top select fields and had a four times increase in influence with G2K customers.
And, of course, we welcomed Deloitte Digital as our first premier global systems integrator and we're already seeing great results from that partnership as we closed several joint deals together in the fourth quarter.
Again, I'm extremely pleased with the performance this year. We've made great progress, but we are just getting started in each of our focus areas and that's what makes this opportunity so exciting. We are going to continue to invest in these areas going forward to address the huge opportunity ahead of us. I couldn't be more thrilled for how we are positioned for 2021 and beyond.
With that, I'll pass it over to Khozema. Thanks George and good afternoon everyone. I'll start by echoing Jeff and George's sentiment. I couldn't be prouder of Twilio's execution in 2020. We saw a year's worth of digital acceleration during an unprecedented time and as we enter 2021, there is plenty of opportunity and plenty of work to be done to continue to grow and scale our business.
We have the right leadership and the right products in place to ensure we are successful to take advantage of this enormous opportunity as we continue building the leading customer engagement platform. As I've mentioned on previous calls, we're also very focused on scaling our systems and processes, which will ultimately lead to greater leverage in the future.
Delving in a bit further, we are investing to create an enterprise data architecture internally, including our ERP, business intelligence, quote-to-cash, as well as continuing to improve other core processes that allow us to scale the company. Additionally, we continue to invest in people, both geographically and through the lens of DEI, further diversifying our employee base.
As George mentioned, the early returns from the Segment acquisition are great. And while Segment is running independently today, as we continue our integration planning, we are working on some integration on the G&A side, as well as some exciting organically-evolving innovation synergies on the product side.
As the executive sponsor for the integration work, I'm heavily involved in the process and the integration is off to a terrific start. The cultures and values are incredibly well-aligned which we can sense from a distance, but are seeing confirmed on a daily basis now. We're also starting to see specific opportunities for joint products, which we will talk about in future quarters. I continue to be excited and energized by the tremendous opportunity ahead for Twilio.
Now, on to the numbers. Total revenue for Q4 grew 65% year-over-year to $548 million, including $23 million from Segment, which closed on November 2. Dollar based net expansion rate was 139% as we continued to see broad-based strength across the business. Remember that Segment does not have an impact in DBNE. As expected, political traffic had a strong quarter as a result of the election, contributing $23 million to revenue. Excluding Segment and political traffic in Q4 2020, revenue grew 52%.
For the full year, we delivered $1.76 billion in revenue, up 55% year-over-year and DBNE for the full year was 137%. Revenue from our Top-10 active customer accounts represented 13% of revenue in Q4 compared to 14% in both last quarter and Q4 of last year.
International revenue was 27% of total revenue in Q4 compared to 27% last quarter and 29% in Q4 2019. WhatsApp contributed approximately 5% of revenue in Q4, down from 6% last quarter.
As a reminder, going forward, we will no longer breakout WhatsApp as a percentage of revenue. We continue to have a great relationship with WhatsApp. However, as our business has scaled, coupled with a strong revenue diversification, disclosing the contribution from a single customer is less meaningful.
Verizon's A2P fees contributed approximately $14 million to revenue. As a reminder, this fee is a direct pass-through to customers and does not impact gross profit dollars. As we come up to the anniversary of the implementation of the Verizon fees, we will no longer be breaking out this metric.
However, we do believe another carrier will implement fees in the coming months. And if that happens, we'll provide further information on an upcoming call.
Fourth quarter non-GAAP gross margin was approximately 56% and was negatively impacted by 150 basis points from A2P fees. Twilio's gross margin, ex-Segment, was approximately flat quarter-over-quarter, aided by political traffic in the United States.
As we've discussed recently, organic gross margin continued to mix down as the growth of our messaging product has reaccelerated; a trend that continued in Q4 and a trade-off we'll gladly accept. Non-GAAP operating profit came in at approximately $13 million stronger than originally forecasted, driven by higher than forecasted revenue.
Now, moving on to guidance. Let me quickly highlight a few items as it relates to different aspects of guidance. First, I'd like to remind everyone, we will only be providing quarterly guidance going forward. Second, this guidance does not include any additional A2P fees that may go into effect during the quarter. And finally, we built this guidance off of our fourth quarter results, excluding the political traffic contribution.
So, for Q1, we expect total revenue of $526 million to $536 million, including Segment, for year-over-year growth of 44% to 47%. And we expect our first quarter operating loss in the range of $15 million to $20 million.
With regards to our operating loss guidance for the first quarter, as mentioned on previous calls, some of the investments we planned on making last year did not materialize as we had originally forecast due to COVID. We still intend to make these investments in 2021, primarily centered on people and systems.
To close, we delivered very strong results in 2020 and we are excited about 2021 and the years beyond. We are making the right investments today to scale the company and take advantage of a generational opportunity.
With that, I wish everyone well and thank you for joining. Operator, please open the line for questions. Certainly. [Operator Instructions]
Your first question comes from the line of Derrick Wood from Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Great. Thanks and congratulations to everyone with the fantastic finish to the year. And Jeff, congratulations on the release of your new book. I mean, I wanted to ask a question along those lines.
In the book, you focused a lot on the rise and importance of the developer and we've been hearing about developers getting more budget authority in today's digital era. So, it'd be great to hear what you're seeing in terms of changes in buying behavior, particularly when it comes to developer involvement and how you see these trends helping Twilio gain more wallet share in the years ahead. Thank you, Derrick. Yeah, I think one of the things that Twilio really bet upon when we founded the company was the developers would become even more influential as companies having turned to digital had to become more agile and had to really build for this digital era because developers are the ones who know the tool chain. They know how to get things done.
And when the barriers come down, i.e., instead of having to go spend tens of millions of dollars and sign a contract upfront for some giant's multi-year IT project, but rather get started with little risk, spend a dollar or two building a prototype that the outcome, the benefits of being able to move quickly in that way of building, moving from prototype to a beta to a production rollout which needs a little treatment along the way that, that would just take over. And I think we were very right about in the early days at Twilio along with other companies in this API economy.
And that's why, as the pace of business has accelerated and the importance of digital has grown to nearly every kind of business and every kind of industry, while developers are able to pick up these tools and the new software supply chain that Twilio was a [technical difficulty] the big logo and you also hear about the digital native companies that adopt Twilio.
I mean, now we have over 220,000 companies, but the vast majority of those, we were brought in by a developer, that's how the relationship started and so they bring us in, they build that prototype, they see that really success. And then we follow in with our sales team and we expand the relationship over time to make them successful in the first use case, in the second, in the third.
And that's really the power of the platform business model. It combines a very efficient go-to-market engine. We spend less on sales and marketing than a lot of other companies, especially, when growing at our rate and scale, but then that allows us to not only get in the door, but also expand our presence in that accounts because we've got those technical champions.
And I think that's a trend that's just going to continue as you look at COVID and you look at how the importance of building and staying agile and responding to changing conditions, whether it's something like a pandemic or just the normal competitive concerns that are out there, the developers get even more prominent as time goes on. Great. Thanks for that color. If I could squeeze one in for Khozema. The gross margin definitely trended better than we've seen sequentially in the last few quarters. I know you called out Segment. Anything else to call out in terms of mix shift changes sequentially and how to think about directional thoughts on gross margins for Q1? Not really, Derrick. I mean, the way that we characterize it was that we've had kind of a flat quarter-over-quarter gross margin dynamic that was aided by political fees, as we said in our prepared remarks. We've also talked about, as most recently as the Investor Day, that we've had a re-accelerating messaging business as well.
And so that's created some downward pressure on gross margins, but we like that trade-off, obviously, just given the heft that we've developed in messaging and the gross profits that's kicking off.
Otherwise, I mean, we kind of expect gross margins to sort of be in the mid-to-high 50s as we've said before and I think you should expect that to continue, putting aside like A2P dynamics, obviously. Great. Thanks again. Congrats guys. Your next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Yes, thank you very much and congrats to all the Twilions. Jeff I'm interested in the trend you're seeing in two-way or bidirectional messaging. Could you help us understand or just estimate what portion of messages you're processing today that are two-way and maybe what types of discussions are emerging to use it in the future because we're kind of sensing it's starting to creep into some of our own experiences sporadically once in a while from the auto mechanic or after I buy an appliance? So I'm just wondering if there is any tangible outlook there. Yes. Thank you very much, Mark. I think you're right but it's still very much at its infancy though. It's a relatively small part of our traffic is two-way, but it's been growing in recent years. If you think about it, five, maybe eight years ago, it was sort of novel when a company could text you the status update of a flight or your package shipped or whatever. And we saw a lot of customers building those types of use cases on top of Twilio.
When you got that, it was like, oh, that was delightful, but of course if you replied to it, usually the reply went nowhere. And now you're starting to get the next wave of innovation with messaging, which is actually certain times you can actually reply to it and either a bot or a human being will actually be listening and be able to help you with that engagement.
And I'd say this is still very much emerging. But it's one of these surprising and delightful experiences you have with the brand. It does that. I remember at SIGNAL, in 2019, I talked about some of these companies, the company's experiences.
When you need a service appointment at Tesla and you can text with the service advisors to coordinate that appointments or with one of the earlier actually use cases here was Morgan Stanley who is using Twilio to enable their wealth advisors to text two-way with their clients and a number of other such use cases. And so we continue to see more growth in this area, because it is such a great experience.
And you think about how much companies spend to acquire a customer and to get their phone number and earn the right to communicate with them, only to blast them a message that the consumer can't reply to or if they reply, it's like crickets and how bad of an experience that is.
And that's why we've invested in products like Twilio Conversations that enable those two-way multichannel communications and Flex for the contact center that enable those sophisticated messaging-based conversations as a messaging native solution or even Twilio Autopilot that brings the intelligence of AI conversational engine.
These are all designed to help companies to adopt and build two-way messaging experiences that augment and improve the -- oftentimes, the first use case, which is that outbound notification. Excellent. Thank you very much. Your next question comes from the line of Will Power from Baird. Your line is open. Great. Thanks for taking the question. Yes, I'd love to maybe start on Segment. I'm just trying to get any color we can on the early progress you're seeing there, what their early use cases on a combined basis look like. And I was kind of intrigued with the comment around the contract with Camping World because that seems like one of these perfect examples of the opportunity to use that customer data then to engage with those customers. I'm just trying to understand what does that cross-sell look like to take it to that next engagement level? Hey, Peter here. So, Segment is still operating primarily independently. Just keep in mind that Segment's only been part of Twilio for the last two months of the year. So, still very early, continuing to execute very well, though, had a strong finish to 2020.
In terms of Camping World specifically, currently, Camping World has three brands: Camping World, Good Sam and Gander Outdoors. Each of those have disparate websites and solid customer data.
And so, what Segment is going to do is allow all that customer data to be collected from the three digital properties in a consistent way and allow for Camping World to draw new insights on all their customers and enable increased personalization across web, email and mobile experiences.
So, as we progress on the integration, we can provide more updates on sort of the long-term and potential to address kind of the generational opportunity ahead of us and continuing to work together to build the leading customer engagement platform. Okay, great. I guess, if I could fit in one more quick one, maybe for Khozema. Just looking at the strong Q4 upside and putting aside Segment and the political traffic, anything else you'd call out in terms of significant upside driver? It sounds like SMS was there but between Video, Flex, any other particular surprises? Yes. It was -- well, it was pretty broad-based strength across the business, I would say, in Q4. The messaging products certainly did see a lot of acceleration. That continued certainly in Q4. So that was a driver of upside.
And then I think just generally, I mean, we had really strong net expansion, as you heard in the numbers, and great net new customer growth. And I think what we're finding is that as customers are looking for digital transformation, they're increasingly coming to Twilio. So, just a great around-the-board performance for us. Okay. Thank you. Thanks Will. Your next question comes from the line of Fred Havemeyer from Macquarie. Your line is open. Hi, thank you so much for taking my question and congratulations on such a strong quarter. So, I wanted to ask from the perspective of a developer here because I've built apps on Twilio before. And frankly, the platform just makes sense for developers. The alignment of Segment also seems particularly natural, considering how easy it is for developers to roll that out too.
So, on these lines, I'd like to ask, what do you think could be the benefits in your approach to offering the customer experience platform with a platform-up approach in comparison with some of the other software vendors out there who are approaching customer experience from an application down perspective? Well, thank you, Fred. I think you're right. We believe in the power of developers to influence the technology decisions that companies pick, the vendors they decide to use and actually the strategies of the companies and actually how they go about solving really hard problems for their customers.
And I don't think that's limited to just, say, SMS, Voice or Peter's world, customer data. I think that the infrastructure to build great digital products and great digital experiences spans many categories.
And so, again, as we think about our platform and customer engagements, I think that it is a rich area of opportunity for us to invest in order to unlock developer influence and developers' ability to build the future of these companies, in the same way that we have with communications and customer data, respectively, which is easy-to-adopt APIs, usage-based pricing models, published documentation and things like that, that enable developers to come in, rapidly build solutions to the things that companies need built and then take those prototypes all the way through to production because that's the agile nature of business today.
And I think that there's a lot of opportunity to find more and more areas that we see customers wanting this approach and applying our business model for more and more in the realm of customer engagement. It's very helpful. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Great. Thanks. Maybe as a first question, just as you expand your GSI and ISV network and even your kind of enterprise sales force, how is that informing the roadmap or just the different pain points that your customers might be experiencing?
And then maybe as a second question, just on the net expansion rate kind of picking back up, do you think that, that speaks to the cohort as kind of accelerating in their ramp or is it too early to kind of say that, overall, customers are ramping into their use cases quicker? Thanks. This is George. Certainly, on the GSI and the ISV front, I'm glad you asked the question. We see a mass opportunity. And as I mentioned, we're still really in the early innings. I think that it largely aligns -- their requirements align to what the broader customers want, which is obviously to support the digital transformation of their customers.
And that's fully in line with what we see as this massive opportunity. There are some specific things that we are doing to make the product easier to deploy, to build and things like that for some of our ISV and SI partners. And those are things that we're working on, in just normal course and speed. But the big picture is that it's largely, I think, aligned with what our broader customer base wants.
In terms of the net expansion -- the net expansion side, I think that certainly, a bit of that is, as Khozema talked about, seasonal. But probably, I think we just have a lot of strength in our business.
As we've talked a lot about this digital acceleration. I think that we're seeing that play out. I wouldn't say that we're seeing a noticeable shift in individual customer deployment times.
I just think that we're seeing companies really realizing that they need to move to these new digital channels, new modes of digital engagements. And that is supporting the broad near-term results and more importantly, the long-term opportunity that we're so excited about. Great. Thanks and congrats. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Hey there. Thanks all. Good afternoon. On the Q1 guide for topline, you mentioned that builds on Q4 ex-political. Looks like up just a bit sequentially from there. Anything at all you can add around the Segment contribution and what's assumed?
I know you'll have an extra month, but wondering if there's anything from a seasonal or accounting-related perspective for us to be aware of as we look at the implied run rate you provided and start to extrapolate from there. Hey Michael, this is Khozema. Not per se. I mean, we're obviously guiding $526 million to $536 million in revenue in the quarter. That does include the contribution from Segment.
We're not breaking out the Segment contribution at this time, but we will, of course, provide those results on the Q1 call. But there's nothing idiosyncratic to call out, to answer your question directly. Okay. And then on Flex, obviously, the contact center market seems to have reached a bigger tipping point towards cloud. You called out strong traction with Flex in the press release. Anything you can add as we're heading into the upcoming year around the demand environment? Are there certain use cases or industries you're finding success with that you'd like to highlight here for us? This is George. Look, I think you hit the nail on the head that there is a massive shift going in the contact center market towards cloud. I think that's the story here. And we are both beneficiaries of that and that we believe also helping to propel that forward with this fantastic product that we have, the architecture we have.
It's a real -- it's a really resonant story with companies that are looking to move to the cloud and don't want to use the legacy technologies and also want a new approach, a much more flexible approach, a much more shared-risk approach and an approach that allows them to really deliver exactly what they needed and not more -- and not to buy more than that. So, I think that's the ultimate story here.
In terms of specific areas of strength, we continue, I think, to work really well in that kind of mid-enterprise size contact center that several thousand seats space seems to be our sweet spot. And we have strength, and we've mentioned insurance few times in other industries as well. Similar to that, but those are all, I think, honestly, smaller trends in the context of just this bigger story we're playing in. Impressive close to the year yet again, nice work, all. Thanks. Your next question comes from the line of Matt Stotler from William Blair. Your line is open. Hey guys. Thank you for taking my questions. I guess to start off, maybe just touching on the Deloitte partnership, obviously, very important as the first kind of premier GSI. Last quarter, you talked about the rollout of the partnership being pretty early, some in-house customers, training consultants, etc. It sounds like you started closing big deals. So, are we kind of hitting on all cylinders here? Any other kind of color on early feedback?
And you kind of mentioned that the partnership last quarter isn't necessarily exclusive. So, I'd love to get some commentary around how Twilio is being positioned relative to maybe other solutions in the Deloitte portfolio there. Yes, that's a great question. I would say, overall, we're on track with Deloitte. Things are healthy, strong, going according to plan. I don't think you're going to have radical change in 90 days, but we talked about, as you mentioned, in-house customers, we did get several of those wins. So, I think that if you talk to them, they'd be excited about the partnership; we're excited about the partnership.
And I think that things are going very, very well. And I think we're on track this year to, hopefully, on other SI names to our portfolio as well. So, I think everything is healthy and going well, and we're certainly seeing a lot of energy from partner ecosystem around Flex and all of our products. Great. That's helpful. And then maybe just one for Khozema. Middle of last year, you talked about some investments getting paused or pushed into 2021. Hiring and infrastructure building in places like India.
Since then, some of those investments have been able to move forward, like the opening of the Center of Excellence in India specifically. How are you thinking about any remaining pent-up investments, if you will, and how these kind of layer back into the model as we look forward to 2021? Yes, I mean, as I mentioned, we guided to an operating loss in Q1, and we want to continue investing in several areas. I'd say enterprise is one. International is another partner ecosystem, systems processes. So, kind of the same areas that we talked about last year that we hope to invest in, in a more pronounced fashion. All that got delayed to some degree due to COVID.
Obviously, you've also got Segment, which came in at a loss position. So, I think all of that is going to contribute to our operating losses a little bit throughout the year. We're not providing a guidance for the year, but you can get a sense of it from what we're guiding to in Q1. And again, the investments are anything out of the ordinary, more just a continuation of stuff that we were wanting to work on last year. Understood. Thank you very much. Thanks Matt. Your next question comes from the line of Parker Lane from Stifel. Your line is open. Hi, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to dive in on the video opportunity for a moment. If you think about the explosive demand of that category and just how many different options there are out there for customers, what are you hearing in real time about your own product? What's resonating from a feature standpoint and maybe your approach to video that's helped distancing you from some of the other offerings out there in the market? Absolutely. Thank you, Parker. We're really excited about the video opportunity. And I think this is an area where COVID really invigorated the number of use cases and the need for new types of video solutions. And what we're seeing is a lot of new use cases that have been accelerated because of the events of the past year.
One of them is one we've talked about in the past, which is telehealth and telemedicine. And similar to all of the accounts, giving customers the ability to embed these experiences directly in the other software and create these experiences that are differentiated from just kind of a standalone video platform like we probably use every day in our meetings and allows them to create these amazing experiences.
And so, telemedicine is a great example. Like last year, we announced Epic, the EMR company, embedding video directly into the EMR medical system that doctors use every day, so that the charts and the data and the patient information is all there inside that one solution, including things like scheduling.
We're also seeing strength in areas like proctoring and like administering tests remotely. Some people don't have to go into a physical storefronts to take a test. That's an interesting area. And we talked about Prometric in a prior call and others.
And another one we talked about is H&R Block, right, doing tax prep and giving help, something like that from the convenience of your computer, while not being limited to like I can only call someone or I can only chat with someone, but actually on a face-to-face video call. And this is another interesting area to help in terms of customer care and really creating a high-touch experience for customers.
And so, these are the areas where we're seeing a lot of investment. And if you think about these use cases, right, they require a lot of high availability. They require scale. They require security. They require compliance with things like, yes, if you're dealing with healthcare or tax information, customers want to know that these are secure, that these are compliant, that privacy is of the utmost importance in these use cases and these are areas where we see customers really turning to Twilio and implementing these solutions. Got it. That's really helpful. And then I know it's early and remains in beta, but I'd love to hear just the opportunity you think there is for Twilio Frontline, given the new hybrid environment that we're seeing a lot of companies discuss that are going to implement for their workforces going forward. Yes, absolutely. Thanks for the question. We're really excited about Frontline. Obviously, as you said, it's a new product for us. So, it's still in the early stages of the adoption lifecycle. And as a reminder, when we have ATI products, we have customers who choose to adopt to implement it, bring it out, roll it out to their customers. And so it does take some time for customer rollouts to happen.
But that said, we are really pleased with the early start that Frontline is seeing in the market. And I think that there is certainly a change in how the workforce, especially that frontline workers are actually using digital technologies to engage with their customers.
We saw at SIGNAL this past year, we had John Donahoe from Nike, talk about how their retail sales associates, they had people who used to only work in the store and greet you when you walked in the door are now able to help their customers from -- their e-commerce customers from wherever the customers are solely with their computer or their mobile phone and wherever the athletes are. The athletes are what they call their salespeople. And so they can be working from home and serving customers or working in the back of the store.
And so I think this trend, whether it's delivery drivers, whether it is retail salespeople, whether it is even knowledge desk workers working from a variety of places using omni-channel communications to actually do two-way communications, build relationships and where the company wants to track those communications.
They want a record of it. They wanted to make sure it's compliant and doing it all in a way where they can build some history of that customer. That's the opportunity that we're seeing with Frontline.
And like you said, it's very early days of that product, but we're very happy with the reception we've gotten so far from materially customers, the adoption rollout. And so we're excited for where that's going to go. Thanks again. Congrats on the quarter. Your next question comes from the line of Rich Valera from Needham & Company. Your line is open. Thank you for taking the question. A question on the portion of your business that was adversely impacted by COVID. I think you included kind of ride share, hospitality and travel. Can you remind us kind of what percentage of the business that was coming into COVID and where that cohort is today relative to pre-COVID levels? Yes, this is Khozema. I'll take the question. We hadn't broken out that percentage previously. It's relatively small. I think there was some investor concern around that back in Q1. And I think as the results showed back then, despite those industries being down, the results were still pretty strong.
All that said, I would say that we are seeing some modest rebound in those industries, travel and hospitality in particular, and then ride-sharing is still fairly well below pre-COVID-19. Less than 10% is actually what we said previously. Got it. And then just a quick follow-up on, wondering about SIP Trunking. There's been a lot of talk about providing Voice into the Teams environment by some of the UCaaS vendors. And I know you guys have a SIP Trunking product that can also do that. Just wanted to get your thoughts on the opportunity for SIP Trunking broadly and maybe Microsoft Teams voice more specifically for you guys? Yes, this is Jeff. I'll take the question. Yes, SIP Trunking is an exciting product category for us, where we've got a very flexible product. It works in many countries around the world, beyond one interface and also scales elastically unlike a lot of solutions where you have to pre-buy a fixed amount of capacity.
Our Elastic SIP Trunking product, that's what we call it, we call it that for a reason in that it can scale up and down based on customers' needs in real time. And that works really well in cloud environments, right, as opposed to like a fixed location where there's only a certain number of desks, let's say, in a cloud environment, you may need that first capacity rushed up and down.
And that's where we've seen a lot of traction with our SIP Trunking product, especially with ISVs who are building cloud-based software products, also with enterprises who need to power in a very flexible way their workforce, whether they're -- it's a work from home environment. They need to re-route that stuff or whether it's offices, but they need a lot of flexibility and elasticity to those deployments. That's where we see customers adopting SIP Trunking.
And so SIP Trunking is a really nice business for us, and particularly because it gives us also a nice foot in the door for customers who aren't yet in the cloud, to upsell them something that they do already consume for their on-prem installations and then can often lead to them becoming interested in more Twilio's products, for example, maybe it leads to a contact center conversation down the line.
And so that's what we think about the opportunity. And because of SIP Trunking is based on SIP standards, customers can plug our SIP Trunking product into a wide variety of deployments, whether it's the cloud deployment, whether it's something on-prem, the SIP standards mean that we can interact with a wide variety of hardware or software and cloud-based solutions that customers are buying. Great. Thank you for that and congrats on the great results. Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Koontz from Rosenblatt Securities. Your line is open. Hi, thanks for the question. What if we could spotlight your international go-to-market efforts, from my kind of limited perspective, I think you'd be hiring local feet on the ground or behind the screen with local contacts, targeting developers that are in country or are you using more like a channel approach where these are channel partners that have developers on staff to go after local companies or are you using some of the bigger ISPs? I wonder if you can help us kind of understand a little bit. Thank you. Sure. Well, I think that the point on developers is spot on. Everything we do at Twilio starts with developers. It is really the source of our efficient go-to-market. It's the source of our entry point into customers. And so when we think about going into any market, whether it's domestic or international, we start with developers.
And so our developer team is a global team. We have events all around the world, whether they're some of the engagements, this past year being virtual, of course. But if you follow our developer event list, you'll see them not only physically in certain -- in all these geographies, but also in all the digital channels that are relevant for developers all around the world, and we certainly see our developers active and producing content and trying to reach developers in multiple places and languages. And I think also, we could do even a much better job of that. So, I think there's a huge greenfield opportunity for us to do even more with developers out there.
Behind that -- those efforts, we followed up with our account teams that work with our strategic customers, as well as emerging customers in these markets. We've hired some fantastic leadership, both prior to and as well as within 2020 and that's helping the broader nature of the other regions, whether that be EMEA or Asia-Pacific or Latin America. We just see immense opportunity in all of them.
And so that is the playbook for now. And then when you add in the partners, which is, I would say, even more nascent, probably internationally, but still a strategy that we're investing in and following up on, I think that is a winning formula. And certainly, that, of course, does leave room in the future for channel as well, but that's our starting point. Great. Really helpful, George. Thank you. And is there a different competitive environment in these different regions you go into, or is it fairly homogenous? Well, I think that certainly, every market is a little bit different, frankly, and the dynamics are a little bit different. But the thing that's consistent is the need for digital transformation, the energy and focus on the developer, and that plays well in all markets. And so that's where we're, I think, the point of consistency for us. Cool. Thanks a lot, guys, congrats on the quarter. Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kurtz from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Jeff, if we were to look at your international business and the opportunity there to be a multiyear growth driver, what's the biggest one or two levers that you could pull, whether it's investments this year for next year or maybe there's something happening right now with your developer ecosystem that could really accelerate it because, obviously, it's a go-to-market model that can reach every country, every region. So, would love to hear you frame that out. Yes. Absolutely. Thank you for the question, Alex. So, I think there's a lot of levers that we can pull, and we have been pulling. I think number one is the go-to-market investments that George and team have been making to grow our presence abroad, including hiring great leaders for the theaters, which we have. And so very proud of the progress we've been making on the go-to-market front.
The second thing I would say is product and continuing to grow our product presence in all these places. And obviously, we serve customers all around the world. We need to talk to their customers all around the world, so we have a very naturally global product just out of the gate.
But then continuing to invest in those products to make them even better for the local audience is something that we've continued to do for many years, including things like adopting other channels like our investment in WhatsApp as a channel that enables customers to communicate with their end users over WhatsApp instead of, say, SMS. That's a great unlocker of global market as well, and we're very pleased with the progress we've been making with WhatsApp as a channel, as a lever, to grow our international presence. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Walravens from JMP Securities. Your line is open. Great. Thank you. And Jeff, let me add my congratulations to Karyn Smith. Was my boss when I started out as a lawyer and was the most confident organized boss I'd ever had? But here's my question for you. Most companies slow down as they get bigger, but that really doesn't seem to be the case with Twilio, like if you just look at your Dollar based net expansion rate. So, what's your secret? How are you maintaining that level of energy and drive as the company keeps getting bigger? Well, thank you for the question. Sorry, I missed that. Were you saying Karen was your first boss? She was, yes, at Cooley Godward. She was my boss. How funny is that? No way, that's hilarious. All right. I dig that. That's a hilarious anecdote. So, your question about maintaining momentum at scale. Well, I mean, I think, first of all, thank you for the question and I'm honored and flattered. But like it's really about the team that we're building and it's not the market we're serving.
So, the team that we're building, obviously, having great leaders throughout the company and organizing ourselves into small teams. And each small team feels itself like a start-up that's pursuing an opportunity to serve our customers.
And I think that small team structure enables us to innovate and to continue to drive new products for our customers and to truly keep our ear to the ground to keep our teams close to customers.
And the second thing I would say is it's great to operate in a very large market because in a large market, there's so many opportunities to serve customers and so many directions you can take.
And that's closely related to our platform business model, which is, in a platform business model, we provide building blocks that customers can use to build a wide variety of things in their customer engagement journey.
And then based on their activity and what we hear customers coming to us and what they're building, they often show us unsolved business problems that they need solved because of the very nature of the fact that they're building on our APIs.
And so that provides us some tremendous visibility into the big unsolved problems that our customers need solved, which then drive our roadmap further. And you get things like Frontline and Flex and a number of the other products that we've built in recent years.
And so all in all, I think those things all come together to build what we call this generational opportunity. And it's like, like that -- those things when we get to the platform business model, the team, the structure and the ability for us to innovate and get those products out to customers. It's like if you got a quiet belly, you want to gallop. So, that's what we're doing. Great. Thank you. Your final question this afternoon comes from the line of Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Thanks. Made it. Couple of questions. George, I wanted to dig in a little bit about the sales capacity. Clearly, you've expanded it quite substantially last year. Maybe you could talk about two things. First of all, how the productivity of the ramp is? And how consistent is it across the hired base?
And then second, from a customer standpoint, when you focus on the G2K, how is the starting point with them changing? Meaning, how many of them are still starting with one product versus thinking about you right from the bat as a platform and think about you as a multiple use case right as a starting point? Great questions. On the first one, I just think it really speaks to the size of our opportunities and the size of the market movement that we've seen very, very strong productivity, even as we've invested in our sales capacity. And certainly, we've made the normal where you maybe even outsized investments in things like sales enablement and all those kind of things that you do as you try to scale sales force.
But I largely attribute it to, A, a great team; and also B, just a fantastic market that we're playing in. So, I couldn't be more thrilled with how our sales team is performing. It's just -- it's a real fantastic result.
In terms of the G2K adoption, I would say that we're making more progress in G2K. You've seen in the numbers. We're still starting with a lot of them through the developer. And I think that it's unlikely we're going to abandon that hastily. I mean that is just the heart of what we do. And so a lot of times developers come in and they want to start with one product. They want to start with one use case.
And honestly, we don't see a negative in that. We think that, that is, frankly, our competitive advantage, and it leaves just a huge untapped opportunity for us going forward. Are there more enterprises that are -- we're meeting with and saying, hey, we want to kind of talk to you at a more strategic level, day one? Absolutely.
I've had multiple of those conversations recently. But I don't want to state that as like the new go-to-market core motion for us because I think that the developer motion is so fruitful and so universal as some of the other people in the call have mentioned. Got it. Makes sense. Maybe a follow-up for you, Khozema, on the hiring side. You seem to be chasing a tail here, and you're not able to catch up. Needless to say, I mean, for a business growing so fast, I understand. But I guess the question is, what is it that needs to be done internally to remove whatever bottleneck exists to finally catching up with your plans? And what is the risk that you not being able to catch up with your plans at some point catches up with your growth trajectory? Yes, I don't think there's an internal issue, and I don't think there's actually a lot that we have to do internally to necessarily solve it. I mean, obviously, we had a concern with the global pandemic last year, right? So, that was hard and just in terms of navigating the dynamics around hiring and stuff like that.
So, I think we'll catch it up more or less through the first three quarters of this year, and then I think we'll be back on track. So, I'm not particularly worried about it, Ittai. Very good. Again, congrats, guys, great quarter and keep it up. Thanks. Thank you. That concludes Q&A today and also concludes today's conference call. Thank you everybody for joining.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions].
I would now like to hand the conference over to Andrew Zilli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasury. Sir, please go ahead. Thanks Lee. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us for Twilio's first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. In an effort to make our call more efficient, we are using a new approach today by posting our prepared remarks on our IR website and using today's call for Q&A only. In addition to our prepared remarks, our earnings press release, SEC filings and a replay of today's call can be found on our IR website at investors.twilio.com.
Joining me today for Q&A are Jeff Lawson, Co-Founder and CEO; George Hu, COO; and Khozema Shipchandler, CFO.
As a reminder, some of our commentary today may be in non-GAAP terms. Reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and guidance can be found in our earnings press release.
Additionally, some of our discussion and responses may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. In particular, our expected business benefits and financial impacts from the Segment and ValueFirst acquisition, and the Syniverse partnership, including the associated transactions, our expectations around the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations and financial condition and that of our customers and partners is subject to change, and our ability to manage changes in network service provider fees that we pay in connection with the delivery of communications on our platform and the impact of those fees on our gross margin are subject to change.
Should any of these risks materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections or those implied by these forward-looking statements.
A description of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results are included in our SEC filings, including our most recent report on Form 10-K, and subsequent reports on Form 10-Q.

With that, I'll hand it over to Jeff for a brief statement and then we’ll open the call for Q&A. Thank you, Zilli. Before going into Q&A I wanted to acknowledge that over the past year fighting COVID-19, each country and region has had good times and bad times. While many places are trending well and we feel like we hope we can see the light at the end of the tunnel, the response to COVID-19 is of course not over and the tragedy of this pandemic remains an evolving situation even on a global level.
So I wanted to take a moment to share my heartfelt sorrow and support for our colleagues, friends and families in India who we know are fighting a tremendous outbreak. Along with our colleagues, friends and family in Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and to remind you that this pandemic is not over, and will not be over until every country, every city, every community in the world is [through it] (ph). We are truly in this pandemic together as a global community.
Twilio has created several programs to help communities in the hardest hit regions providing additional matching funds to organizations such as Aid India COVID-19 release program, Give2Asia and Direct Relief. It is more important than ever to help every country combat this pandemic and we hope that these efforts will help provide funds towards that cause and I invite everybody listening today to pitch in your support as you can. Thank you.
Now, let's open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Great. Thanks for the question and congrats on the quarter. Maybe a higher level question. I wanted to get a sense of what your customer conversations are like. I imagine a year ago it was help me get through the next two weeks, to maybe six months ago it was like help me get through COVID, to now people are really starting to embrace digital transformation and think longer term. But just you know, is that something that we just hypothesized or you're actually seeing in customer conversations and how does Segment change that conversation? Thanks. Hi. This is George. Why don’t I start? We absolutely are continuing to see the conversations around digital transformation, digital acceleration, you know what we've talked to, what I've talked to a lot of customers about is now that they see kind of end of the pandemic in sight, they are not foreseeing that digital is going away for them. That they’ve seen a lot of the transitions that have happened to digital, whether it’s telemedicine or you know digital relationships and financial services are going to continue. And so they are looking for us to be strategic partners to help them move to the New World and with technologies like conversations and flex and other things that we've been working on.
In terms of Segment, the people are very excited about it. I've had to come up in probably you know more than two-thirds of the calls that I’ve been on with customer in the last 90 days, we’ve talked about Segment and the opportunity there. I think people are very excited about the idea of delivering much more personalized engagement and the idea of Segment as a foundational component to that is very interesting to all customers. So we're excited about that and the opportunity for us going forward on that front as well. Great. Thanks. Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Samad Samana from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Great, thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the strong quarter. Maybe the first on the enterprise sales hiring side. You know I saw in the prepared remarks that the company has caught up, but maybe how should we think about the hiring from here and how the productivity ramp looks for the new direct – those enterprise sales rep hires? Yeah, we are absolutely on track with our sales hiring. We continue to invest in capacity to match the – frankly the incredible opportunity that we see in front of us. And in terms of the productivity that has continued to be strong and the ramp times are consistent. So we haven't really seen a significant shift as we added capacity, which is – I think this really speaks to the demand out there and the size of the opportunity. Great. And then maybe just a follow up on the decision to split the R&D organization that was discussed and how we should think about that impacting the innovation cycle going forward? Yeah, thanks for the question Samad. This is Jeff, I'll take that one. So we’ve got a very broad set of products and very broad customer base all around the world. And so we thought the way to best serve the broad set of customers and the broad set of products was to break it up into three units; so our Twilio Core Communications Platform, our Data Platform and our Core Platform.
And we've got great leaders for a lot of these things and you could see a lot of synergies between like all the things we are doing in communications, which is the core business, a lot of things we are doing with data and people from Segment to lead the data team. And on a core platform it’s sort of how we build internally and all the platforms that support the growth of all our engineering units.
And so by dividing and conquering, we think we can actually tackle more to continue our track record and innovation, and continue to serve our customers at scale. So I'm really appreciative of Chee and everything he’s brought to the company and looking forward to building the next great set of products with the great set of leaders we have, and the ones we are going to hire. Great. And just as an aside, we love the new reporting structure. It allows us to spend more quality time with the management team rather than listen to you guys read the script to us. So I really appreciate that, and appreciate the additional time with you all. Fantastic. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Fred Havemeyer from Macquarie. Your line is now open. Thank you very much for the time here. You know I'm interested in some of the acquisitions and investments that you previously have been making, including Syniverse and ValueFirst. Can you help us understand how these acquisitions, investments and partnerships could help your overall cost structure, both domestically and internationally?
And secondly on this topic, can you tell us about how these investments could benefit your customers across areas such as pricing and also reliability of services. That’s a good question. This is Khozema. I’ll start. So I think from a cost structure perspective, obviously having a local presence in markets and being able to do some consolidation within our supply chain is always going to yield some cost synergies and so we definitely have an eye on that in terms of some of the ways that we're looking at it.
I think beyond that, if you look at some of the more recent things, like whether it's in Mexico or whether it's in India that also gives us an enhanced geographic footprint. So it allows us you know to better see consumer demands in some of those markets as well. And then from a pricing perspective, I mean I wouldn't say there's a big change in pricing relative to M&A. You know M&A obviously remains a competitive pricing landscape, but I think we feel good about the way that we're positioned and I think this allows us to continue to geographically expand. Great. Thank you. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin from Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. Thank you and I’ll echo comments appreciating you on your new format. It’s super-efficient and super helpful. Maybe Jeff, I'll start with you. We are six months now into the Twilio Segment kind of combination here. My question for you, what are you most excited about and most pleased with during the first six months of the integration here and then I know it's early, but we're seeing some interesting personalized messages come out, some interesting Flex Segment integrations.
And then secondly, what are you most excited about, now that you know what you own here, looking out over the next couple years? Yeah, thank you for the question. Well, first of all the nuts and bolts of integration are hard, but they are going really well. Been really pleased by just the great cultural [indiscernible] we can really weld together and the teams can see the opportunity and see the way we approach customers in the market that we serve in, like see those things really well aligned. And so super happy with Peter, the leadership team at Segment and all the folks who joined Twilio with that acquisition.
But talking about the opportunity ahead, look, I think we are seeing this come up in so many conversations with customers that you know maybe in the past before we had Segment as part of our portfolio, we wouldn't have organically come up, but now that Segment is here, we’re really seeing that become a major part of the conversation we're having with customers, because every company that I talk to seems to be struggling with like, how do I build this one picture of my customer based on data that is spread across all these different, not just systems they have and they have that problem, they’ve got a separate system for marketing and a separate system for the contact center and a separate system for commerce, but also across business units.
Like in an acquisition here we got to integrate their view of the customer, and we've got these different structures inside the company and they all use different systems. And so this question of how do you actually build that profile of your customer, how do you understand your customer.
The story that is being told by all the data that customers are giving up, like how they use your website, how they use your mobile apps, what things they bought, what things they’ve returned, etc., that story is resonating with customers because they all see that problem but then not just how do you make sense of that data, how do you act on, and that’s where Twilio comes in.
How do you actually build really engaging communications, whether it’s marketing, during your sales process, during your support or in product, how do you tailor and make all that stuff dynamically personalized to every single customer to optimize their chances of becoming a repeat buyer, becoming a loyal customer of yours, and that's something we see so many companies wanting to do, struggling to do and looking to us to help them to do. And so when I look forward to what we're going to build with Segment, I see a tremendous surface area across pretty much every industry to help them solve this problem. Interesting, big problem, but certainly the opportunity. Khozema one quick one for you; AT&T and T-Mobile joined the price increase party that I think Verizon kicked off last year. How should we kind of think about the framework around what type of growth rate that could have an influence here on Q2? It looks like the guide did not include any sort of impact on that price increase. You have two carriers, instead of one raising prices. So just trying to think through how should we think about that impact in Q2 or should we just wait a quarter and wait until we see actually what happens. Just curious to hear your thoughts and guidance here on that price increase. Yeah, I mean we left it out of the guide on purpose, just so that it wouldn’t be that confusing and we wouldn’t have to deal with all the kind of puts and takes. So you should look at the guide as being clean and excluding those impacts. I would say, you should largely expect them to be kind of in the ballpark is what we saw previously with Verizon, but we’ll provide a lot more detail on that when we do the Q2 call and we’ll give you the exact numbers at that time. Got it. Makes sense, thank you. Thank. Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin from Wolfe. Your line is now open. Yeah, [inaudible] I’m going to – you know instead of asking my typical dollar-based net expansion question to Khozema I'll do just two very big-picture product questions. Jeff, maybe just for you first. If we take a step back and just zoom out and we look at the components of your business, you're now getting into a point where you're able to do – you know potentially intelligent messaging solutions where you can effectively have a customer send a message when a certain action takes place like a cart is left abandoned. And that, the value added component of that message for that customer is a lot higher than potentially some others. So I guess the question is, are you able to now start thinking about different pricing or different unit economics, depending on the type of message that you're helping a customer deliver? Thanks Alex. You know I think there is like two ways of thinking about that. One is our role as a platform, and as a platform you support many different use cases. And even within things like messaging, you know there's different use cases for messaging and in fact different messages may have different performance characteristics.
Some customers might value speed of delivery, while others might value things like bulk deliveries. And so this way of thinking about have your Segment in the product itself at the platform there. And then there is ways of saying, okay, but in order to actually do a specific use case, you often have software that's powering a use case or integration. To use the example, you had integration into shopping carts, and the business logic of that integration and the business logic of that intelligence is in many ways a different value proposition from the platform itself. And so as you see what we're doing with for example, Flex, that's what we're building. We're building that – you know the value proposition of a contact center on top of the [indiscernible] and you see that with our marketing campaigns product as well.
And so I think when you think about our core communications platform, you get the sense of the economics are tied to the underlying capabilities of the platform. And then when you look at the engagement platform that sits above it, the economics are more closely tied to the value proposition that we're creating with the software.
But I also think that part of Twilio's unique value proposition is to build a product and a go-to-market that really closely aligns how our customers use our products with what they have, and I think that's a key competitive differentiation, which is a little different than traditional solution selling, which is you're trying to extract full value. I think as a platform play you still need white space for customers to go paint in to make it theirs and that's what they value.
They want to build on top of their platform. And as a result of that, we give them that flexibility and that enables them to get outcomes that they can't get with any other vendor. That also enables developers to continue to be our biggest champions inside of these accounts and I think those are important things for us to continue to consider. That makes perfect sense. And then another again kind of big picture question, if you think about the rise of IDFA, the demise of – potential demise of third party cookies, it's our thesis that we're entering the world where the notion of CDP for first-party data is going to rapidly accelerate in strategic performance.
You guys mentioned – I think George you mentioned that Segment is now in two thirds or was in two thirds of your customer conversations. I guess a couple of angles around this question. Is this something – is this future world something you contemplated when making that acquisition? Are you, you know just now reaping even greater amount of strategic benefit? Just talk to us about how you think about segments in this new world, both integrated with the rest of your solutions as part of the platform, but also on a stand-alone basis with respect to Strategic impact to all these things. This is Jeff. I'll answer, unless George, you want to? Go ahead, Jeff. I'll chime in. Well, I'll give my point of view and I'll let George give his point of view. You know collaboration is the answer and is harder in this virtual world.
My point of view is yes, you know we did think about the importance of first party data and how every company is having to become great digital marketers and great digital executors, and you can't necessarily rely on some of the, let's say, sloppier ways of acquiring and re-engaging your customers when you've got a lot of third party data floating around that. So we did believe – we do believe that the CDP market in and of itself as a standalone becomes ever more important to companies, not just because of the plurality of systems you have to figure out how to make sense of, but also because outside their walls it's getting more complex to actually target and reach your own customers.
So it becomes even more important that once you meet a customer, so there's your marketing and they buy something or whatever it is, you do a really good job of continually engaging them, because going back out to kind of reacquire that customer is getting harder and harder and harder. And so companies have to treat their existing customers incredibly well, and those relationships are getting even more valuable. And then you add in all the value of – and then integrating that and creating that journey that's going to achieve that using Twilio's customer engagement cloud, that is the next level of benefit on top of the core CDP. Yeah, I think you know Jeff said it really, really well. And I would say we're having you know certainly a lot of these conversations that I'm talking about are largely customers. A lot of customers are learning about more acquisition, interested in our strategy and we’re having the broad conversation. But you know we're definitely seeing interest on both fronts of both the stand-alone CDP conversation, as well as the potential for intelligent engagement that's built when you have the customer data and all the engagement channels together. So I think there is potential both stand alone and integrated and I think that's one of the things that we're excited to continue to build on going forward. Alright. Congrats. Just amazing execution as always. Thank you. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood from Cowen. Your line is now open. Hi. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on a great quarter. We get a lot of questions from investors on how to think about consumption growth trends across various use cases as the economy opens up.
So Jeff, is it great to hear what you're seeing you know from the COVID impact of use cases and travel hospitality, ride-sharing and then get a sense of you know with the opening of the economy, you know how that impacts some of the use cases that got catalyzed from COVID. So really just trying to get an understanding of how those net out as we navigate through the opening of the economy and maybe put that in context with you know how you guys guided for Q2, which assumes flat at $10 million in sequential revenue. Absolutely. Okay, I'll answer that. So the – what I would say is, like you got this usage pattern and so you’ve got two categories, like roll the clock back to a year ago. We have a category of digitization of lots of interactions. That was really the path that society was on and every industry was on because of the digital transformation, like the big secular trend and those got accelerated.
And so a lot of the things we're seeing like you know what's going on in the workforce between ordering online and picking up in the store and things like that are getting far more use now that they would have before or telemedicine. You know I saw a huge acceleration of adoption of telemedicine and those workflows have provided consumers in a lot of cases like a much more convenient path and we did things with these organizations whether it was you know healthcare, then telemedicine or retailers doing really good online order pickup type work flows.
You know these are things that were on their path, anyway just got accelerated. Because I think what we're seeing is a re-training like of consumers to expect new types of experiences and those are going to continue with the competitive dynamics of keeping those features and making them better or making them more easier. I think those are going to continue.
Then we've got the category of industries that were negatively impacted by COVID, so travel, hospitality, things like that and those obviously saw a decline in the usage in 2020 and now I think we're starting to see the signs of the recovery of those industries and we find all the headlines you know talking about people returning to travel, they are getting vaccinated and how hard it is to get a rental car and how airplanes are not full and so as we see the return of those industries, you know I think that we will continue to see you know the bulk of the churn of volume and usage, but also the use cases, because many of those industries have to now go build trust with their consumers and say, “Hey, you know it’s safe to do these things again” and “Hey, trust us as the brand you're going to return to” as you start doing things like travel and even out whatever it is”
So we're seeing not just the return of the old use cases, but I think also new engagement strategies that these companies have in order to build trust and loyalty in their customer basis that in many ways they have to kind of reengage with a reacquire. Yeah, I guess maybe that’s right to present on the revenue guidance. I’ve gotten some questions on you know just if you look at the sequentials, it's flat to slightly up. Historically, you've seen some good sequential seasonality in Q2. I know you may have conservatism in there, but any other puts and takes to call out for Q2. Yeah, I mean let me just add to what Jeff said and then I'll directly take your question. So I would say, in general what our guidance contemplates is sort of a world without COVID in a way, I mean not withstanding what Jeff said at the outset of the call. I mean obviously there's a lot going on globally and I certainly don't want to take anything away from that and the impact that that's having on people.
But generally speaking, the way that we're looking at things is as if COVID is starting to wane and we see durability and some of the positive impact to the industry as we see recovery in some of the negatively impact to the industries and so in general, I think you know as we start to think about a world post-COVID, we just see a lot of general strength in the business very kind of broadly diversified across industries and GOs and company shapes and sizes.
As it relates to Q2 specifically, I mean we feel good about the guide. I mean obviously we're still up in the quarter based on the guide 47% to 50%. The world is a very, very complicated place right now. You know there's a lot of moving pieces and so I think we'll wait and see how things exactly play out, but we feel good about you know the way that we guided, the way that things are positioned and we feel great about the long term prospects for the business and you know certainly in the short and medium term. Right, yes 50% growth, pretty amazing. So congrats again and thanks a lot. Thanks Derrick. Thank you. Moving on, your next question comes from Ryan MacWilliams. Your line is now open. Thank you. I’d like to ask the question and I think you [inaudible] cloud based expansion questions, but knowing that this metric can fluctuate, especially with the things that will compare year-over-year, but anything to comment on here with the things in the quarter and maybe any read-throughs in the following quarters as well. Thanks. Yeah, you certainly hit one of the nails on the head. I mean I would say in general, like 133%, like DBNE is still really, really strong. So whether you look at it on a year-over-year basis or you look at it on a sequential basis, maybe I'll start with the latter.
So on a sequential basis you obviously don't have like the political dynamic, right. We’re in non-election year and so that's going to direct it down a little bit. And then we've also locked the right to carrier fees and so one year away from that, you know that's going to have a little bit of impact as well. And then really the third dynamic is what you said a moment ago in terms of same grid.
So I would say on kind of a normalized basis, you know you might think about 130’s, but I mean we feel great about the printed number, 133% and we’re really, really happy with the way that our expansion rates been going. Thanks and just from my perspective, it’s great to see how Twilio helps supports global vaccine distribution. But you know from a financial perceptive, I’ve just been wondering, could vaccine distribution delivery materially impact results along the quarter. I wouldn't say it impacted our financials materially. You know as I said a moment ago, like I think we're really looking at the world both in terms of our Q1 print, as well as the way that we guided into Q2 based on a world in which you know COVID is sort of a thing that's starting to wane a little bit and we just see broad based things across the business and any one use case is relatively diminished. I appreciate your time. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you. We have a follow-up question. Your next question comes from Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Hey there. Thanks everyone, I appreciate you taking the questions. George at the Deloitte Hackathon you mentioned in the materials stood out as interesting. I’m wondering if you could talk more about what events like that could maybe open up and how they can help with the push of the targeted verticals, specifically healthcare seems interesting there, but anything you can add around context is helpful. Yeah, thanks for the question. We’ve had a hackathon program now that we've used successfully in the enterprise area directly with customers and now we're just trying to do that with our partners. You know obviously when you're building momentum with a large systems integrator, a lot of what you need to do is first of all get people internally just aware. You know these are not simple entities or complex entities and lots of groups and it's just kind of evangelizing internally you know the power of Twilio and the Twilio message is really important.
So bringing these hackathons we find is generally speaking a really good way to extend our reach, especially among the developers and the thought leaders within an organization, whether it's a customer or as I like at Deloitte, so we're excited about that.
But also you know a lot of the time these hackathons also yield really interesting IP or the beginnings of interesting IP and whether it’s on the customer side or on a partner side and with an entity like Deloitte the opportunity to create vertical IP I think is very, very interesting, especially around such round flex, which is a big focal point for a lot of our SI discussions.
So you know well, it remains to be seen obviously how all these things play out. There's usually a pretty significant path between a hackathon and obviously real IP, but you know we’re excited about the opportunity, whether it's with Deloitte or with others to go down this path, repeat path, continue to evangelize, get the fly wheel going and continues to do more work with them. I’ve been really, really excited about the potential of this partnership. We're seeing some traction already and this is just another – you know kind of another brick on the path to – on the path to building a really successful long term enterprise playbook. Yeah, makes a lot of sense. Just quick for Khozema. Can we go back to ValueFirst for just a moment? I'd just be curious if there's more you can add on what that adds internationally. I know that's been one of a few focus areas. And then anything you can add on any contribution? I don't know what the timing specifically looks like, but any contribution you saw or expect to see is helpful. Yeah, just to take the latter part of the question first, very de minimis contribution in the current quarter, and it'll be relatively a de minimis contribution going forward as well. So we're not necessarily calling it out.
I mean I would say ValueFirst kind of fits into one of the questions that was asked earlier in terms of just broader trends that we're seeing in supply chain. I mean when we see a unique asset that we think on the one hand gives us a particularly interesting entry into a GO and it's not limited to India obviously, although India is obviously a huge consumer market, but I'd throw Mexico into the same category, which is why we did the deal there, too. But India, Mexico, large consumer markets, opportunity for some cost capabilities, and then you know with these acquisitions we always get awesome local teams. And so it's really just a combination of those things.
But from a financial perspective, I think this is like an add to the portfolio but nothing that you should really think about in terms of having an outsized impact on our financials at all. Helpful. Keep up the pace. Thanks. Thanks everyone. Thanks. Thank you. Your next question is from Mark Murphy from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Oh hey. This is Pinjalim on behalf of Mark. Congrats on the quarter guys. Jeff, a high level question again for you. So on the product strategy point of view, how do you think about kind of accelerating the usage of Twilio core communications by developers, just the usage of that? Do you think like serverless or function, is an important strategy to drive speed to market for developers or maybe the studio's way to go to democratize the usage beyond developers or now that you have Segment, maybe you can actually tap into a broader and good customer engagement solution? Would love to hear your thoughts around that? Absolutely. So first of all I'll say, we're really pleased with the adoption of Twilio and all of our products by developers and I think that's going very well. Developers continue to pull us into the wide variety of opportunities at every kind of company that you see us posting up as new customers.
As far as smoothing out, I don't necessarily draw a straight line between like low-code/no-code and like getting more developers or more accounts on the platform. I think low-code/no-code are tools and when the problem we have fits well into [Audio Gap] Hey, guys it seems like – this is George. Seems like there might be a problem with Jeff's line. So obviously I can't completely anticipate his train of thought there. But certainly you know… Can you hear me? Can you hear me now? Oh, you're back. Perfect. Thanks. Yeah. Zilli says my phone is connected to my car and that is exactly what happened because someone just thought to go pick up my kids and turned on the car, so fantastic. Good to know that that's a way earnings calls can fail.
So back to what I was saying, I don't know where I lost you, but essentially low-code/no-code is a tool that if that tool allows you to build your use case faster, more reliably because it's hosted for you and you have to position on infrastructure, then developers will use it as do [Inaudible] called system developers, but it's the right tool for the right job.
I mean we've seen a lot of uptake of Studio for certain types of workflows and other things that are more client side and more deeply embedded, may not be the right tool, but we are definitely committed to this road map of using low-code/no-code and what I call yellow code, each for the right thing that enables the developers and the various participants of the company to do the task that they need to do.
And by the way that includes taking things like Flex, which really accelerate our customers time to deploy these solutions, but then still give them the flexibility to go invoke functions or use Studio to build that IVR or build that chatbot flow and plug it into this right spot. And so I would say, I think we're using low-code/no-code effectively today. And we've got a matching road map for how we can continue to unlock more and more use cases and more and more customers to be using that, but we are very happy with the adoption that the developers are already doing on Twilio across those solutions, including a lot of them who aren't using no-code because they are writing code the old way. Understood. Thank you. Great. And that will do it for today's call. So I really appreciate everybody joining today and look forward to catching up with you throughout the rest of the quarter.

With that, I'll hand it over to Jeff for a brief statement, and then we'll open the call for Q&A. Thanks, Zilli. Before we get started answering your questions today, I wanted to touch on Twilio's commitment to helping 1 billion people get vaccinated equitably and globally. For many, it started to feel like life was returning to normal, with vaccines readily available, at least here in the United States. Yet the Delta variant, which originated in a part of the world without the same level of access to vaccines, has now rippled through the entire world, infecting both vaccinated and unvaccinated people at higher rates than we've ever seen before.
To me, this underscores the importance of vaccinating the world, and I'm particularly proud of the role that Twilio has chosen to play using our product, our time, our people and our money to help ensure equitable vaccine -- vaccination globally. In March, we committed to the goal of helping reach 1 billion people with the aim of educating people and helping them get vaccinated. We partnered with 450 organizations and in just 3 short months, I'm proud to say our product has been used to help 297 million people get critical vaccine education, appointments or reminders.
In June, we also committed $10 million to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, in support of COVAX, which is the largest global initiative to vaccinate lower-income countries against COVID-19. We're supporting the program's goal to purchase and distribute 1.8 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses to more than 90 low and middle-income countries, and we expect to have greater influence on how the coalition uses technology to effectively distribute the vaccines.
I was honored and surprised to find that we were the second largest private company to contribute to Gavi's global vaccination program and the largest company in the tech sector. As a shareholder, you're part of the good work that Twilio is doing. To all of the Twilions out there, the work you do to build our product, to build this company are having an impact, so thank you. It's times like these when I see the impact that we can have, and I'm humbled and proud to lead you. And we will continue towards our goal of supporting 1 billion vaccinations worldwide. Now I'd like to open it up for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Securities. I wanted to start off with Segment. You mentioned in the prepared remarks the pull forward there in co-selling. It seems like it's maybe 6 months ahead of what you're expecting. Are there any points of feedback or interest you can share to start? And maybe in tandem with that, the sequential growth, I know we have a limited set of data. It was maybe a little lighter than we would have expected given just strong product synergies that we see between the 2? Is it fair to assume this shift towards co-selling can maybe just change the shape of that trajectory as you work through that going forward? This is George. I'll take the first half of that question on the co-selling and then maybe Khozema can talk about the growth piece. Certainly, as I mentioned in our previous call, we are seeing interest in Segment from our customers, I think, across a broad segment of our customer base. And we believe that by opening up Segment to our entire sales force and letting the combined power, both sales forces really educate the market as well as sell the product, we think we can really bring Segment to as many customers as possible and maximize the opportunity.
We're very, very excited about this opportunity and I know our sales forces as well. Michael, this is Khozema. In terms of the guide, I mean, I guess what I would say is I think you're maybe you're reading a little too much into it. I think in terms of what we see for the third quarter guidance, it's a really strong growth rate of 50% to 52%. And I think on top of which we remain really optimistic about our performance in the near term as well. And we provided guidance previously, for example, of 30% plus growth over the next 4 years and feel really, really good about that over the medium term. And I think Segment will just continue to enhance where we're going over the long term. Yes, and my comment was more just reflective of the -- just the sequential, I think it's 4% increase on segment Q2 to Q1. It's just -- I think my thought was more -- it just seems like as you work towards co-selling, there's a reason to believe maybe the sequential growth rates could pick up there over time.
The other observation and then I'll hop off, is just international picked up quite significantly as well. Is that a result of some of the on the ground-focused investments you've been talking about, Khozema, or were there specific regions to call out as contributors that drove the uptick in mix there as well? Yes. So okay. So two things there. So let me hit international first. I'd say on international, the uptick that we saw there is a benefit of our continued global expansion. As you'll recall, Michael, we've talked in the past about that's one of our focused areas of investment. On top of that, there's a small impact from ValueFirst. We did that acquisition. It was a very small contribution in late March, but obviously, we got a full quarter in Q2, and that's 100% international revenue based on the way that we classify it there.
Just back to your -- the first part of what you said. I mean the co-sell, certainly, we're very excited about it in the way that George described. It won't show up in our financials for some period of time. And we haven't even started, right? I mean we basically just started a few weeks ago, and it will just take some time for it to bleed into our financials. Your next question comes from Derrick Wood with Cowen. Nice to see a reacceleration in organic growth. Just to get a pulse, what would you say the strongest outperformance areas were in the quarter maybe on a product basis? And then it sounds like you guys are seeing a lot more momentum with SI Partners. Can you talk about what kind of use cases these partners should open up new doors for you? Is it predominantly in the contact center? Or what other kind of solution areas do you see them becoming more instrumental? Derrick, it's Khozema. I'll take the first part, and then I'll hand it off to George on the partner side of it. Just in terms of the quarter overall, I think as with several of our prior quarters, we experienced broad-based strength across a number of facets of the business. And one that I particularly point out is that our messaging product continues to deliver really outstanding results. And I think Segment as well had a really, really great quarter.
On top of that, we had really strong net expansion. We had good new customer growth. And I think for us, we've been talking for a while now about this significant secular shift that's taking place and how that's really driving customers towards Twilio and our customer engagement platform. And there's just so many things that we can do to accelerate the digital transformation. I think we're seeing a continuation of that. This is George. On the SI front, we've always believed that Twilio is a great fit as a builder platform for SI that builds custom software. Really Flex on the contact center opportunity, I think, has really been the engine that's powered a lot of our discussions with customers with SIs. And as you see in the kind of prepared remarks, and I think that's going to continue to be true.
But this kind of production SIs through the contact center building these relationships is also opening us up to other types of customer engagement opportunities where Twilio is a part of a broader solution, whether it's around a marketing solution or other types of customer engagement solutions. And George, if I could squeeze one more. I mean, your headcount was up almost double year-on-year. Of course, there's some acquisitions that contribute to that. But I'm just curious to get a sense for how much growth you've built in the sales capacity roles and if you're planning to continue to be pretty aggressive in hiring in the second half. Well, at a macro level, obviously, we don't comment on our specific sales capacity or the numbers. But we do continue to invest in it. I think that you see our overall growth is -- our investment in people is really broad-based and distribution is part of that. So we are excited about the opportunity. I think we continue to invest into it, and we believe that there is still a large untapped opportunity in customer engagement out there in the market today. Your next question comes from Taylor McGinnis with UBS. So when you think about the uptick that you guys saw in dollar-based net expansion rate, I'd be curious if you're seeing any interesting mix shift trends yet of different products maybe driving up beyond just messaging. And then secondly on that, since messaging growth was so strong last year, can you speak to what you're seeing and hearing from customers, I guess, on the potential for the messaging business growth levels to be more sustainable in the back half of this year relative to what we've seen so far in the first half this year? Yes. I'll take the first part of the question, Taylor. This is Khozema, and then I'll hand it over to George for the second part. So in terms of the first part of the question, you're right. I mean we have seen really fantastic growth on the messaging side of the house. I mean we've been really excited about the progress in that product and the way that we've been able to grow it. And in fact, that product has been reaccelerating over many of the prior periods. And so that's been super exciting to see. And we think that leads to some of the additional growth opportunities in other channels.
I think the one area that we're equally excited about is that our application services revenues, so those that are not associated with a telephony-based cost structure, those continue to grow at accelerated levels and certainly above and beyond what we see in any other products. And so for example, that will include Flex or that will include Segment.
And I think over time, those products are going to continue contributing in a more meaningful way. We just have this sort of really good problem, is how I would characterize it, in that our core business is growing at such a fast rate. You're just -- it's going to take some time for the other pieces to start showing up in our financial statements. But on balance, I'd take that problem all day long. George? I don't think that my answer would be very confident with -- like Khozema said. Certainly, messaging, even at its size and scale, continues to be a strong performer for us. I think that when we talk to customers, there's still a ton of customers out there and companies out there looking for and finding new ways and use cases use messaging, whether it's for reaching customers, operations, customer service, security. So I think globally, messaging is going to continue to grow as a market and an opportunity for us. Your next question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. I wanted to take a second to just ask about M&A strategy. For the past couple of years, it's been more around platform extensions. And then since the beginning of the year, has kind of included more kind of service improvements or continuity acquisitions or investments. And so just how are you viewing and balancing those strategic imperatives and what you can do organically and inorganically? And I have one follow-up. Meta, this is Jeff. I'll answer the question. So I think the way we look at it is we know what our customers -- where our customers want us to go in terms of our product road map. And sometimes that manifests in capabilities that we're going to go build, and sometimes it manifests in like geographies where we're going to deepen our presence.
And when we look at those, if there is a company that has built what we have on our road map and if buying them would accelerate our ability to serve our customers, our time to market, then that's something that we consider. And we're always running an active game board just to see what options are out there as we evaluate our road map and look at our options.
And I think it's -- the smart thing to do is to say, hey, our customers are pulling us a road map to go here and these are on a road map, and if there's something that actually accelerates us with a great team, great technology that can be additive, then those are the type of opportunities that we pursue. Great. And I mean maybe for -- it could be for anybody, but just as people are embarking on digital transformation initiatives, clearly, you're kind of still seeing a DB&E that's fairly similar. Just trying to get a sense of are you seeing any changes to the cohort analysis kind of where customers are making bigger investments upfront? Or is it still, I want to try out one product and then build from there? Just getting a sense of how digital transformation initiatives by corporations have kind of changed the initial purchase or initial experimentation with Twilio. This is George. I think that Twilio has always really thrived off of a land-and-expand type strategy given that we work with builders. These builders start with one use case and then they expand the other use cases. I think certainly during the height of the pandemic last year, we saw a different set of use cases emerge and maybe a little bit more urgency around some particular use cases, but it didn't really change the fundamental shape of how we work within our customer accounts.
Twilio typically is a product that developers learn, they love, they build and then they introduce to other developers and expand from there. I think that's really the magic of the platform and something that we're going to continue to build on in the future. Your next question comes from Rishi Jaluria with RBC. I just wanted to ask two related questions on Zipwhip. I guess first, I appreciate the color in the prepared remarks. Can you maybe give us a little bit more detail on the plans with the asset? And there's always a general question of why buy versus build or I guess in this case, partnering. So that would be helpful.
And then in terms of the guidance, I understand the puts and takes of deferred revenue write-down. But can you just maybe give us a general sense for what the unaffected size and growth rates look like so we can be a little bit more accurate in our models? Rishi, this is Jeff. I'll give you the first part of that answer and then I'll hand it to Kho for the second part. So essentially, why did we decide to acquire Zipwhip? Well, look, we're really excited. They are a real innovator in toll-free messaging, which they brought to market with the great relationships that they have with the carriers. And in particular, the CEO, John Lauer, has a great track record of helping carriers to productize things like toll-free messaging.
And it's noteworthy that they are the sole channel for toll-free messaging in North America. And so it points to the strength of the relationships they have, the fact that they are the only way to get into toll-free messaging in North America. And so we just closed the transaction a couple of weeks ago. So now we're starting to get sort of making our joint plans of how we're going to integrate and what that looks like.
And I think there's a lot that we can do together, especially in the world of trusted communications. When we think about where communications is going, calls, the messages as well, making every call, every text message coming from a trusted identity, not just some phone number, but a business name and with a padlock. It's like a web browser, where you know that it's trusted that when they say that they are the pharmacy or your kid's school, you trust that that's true. That's the world we're building towards. That's a next big innovation.
And it's with great partnerships in the entire ecosystem and with the carriers that we can execute on these big, bold ideas. And I think Zipwhip will be a big part about how we continue to evolve the ecosystem in order to make the experience of actually texting and calling with each other and with businesses to be much better.
Nowadays, you can get a text message, and like you don't know if it's authentic, and that's scary. It's like, is this person calling -- is this my friend or is this Kaiser's Jose? Who knows who this is? And we see a world where every text, every call is validated and has that secure padlock. And I think that Zipwhip can be a big part about us spending about this world of trusted communications. And I'm going to hand it over to Kho for the second part. Rishi, we're not disclosing any anticipated financial impacts right now. It's very consistent with how we've operated with prior acquisitions. As Jeff alluded to, we're still working through the integration plan, there's the purchase accounting impacts that we'll have to deal with as we consolidate. And so we just locked that out of our guidance to keep it clean, and we'll obviously provide an update when we report on Q3. Your next question comes from Matt Stotler with William Blair. I guess, first, would just love to touch on -- you mentioned Segment Journeys. Obviously, it looks like a really interesting development. Obviously, kind of building consumer journeys from marketing applications, things like that. But it seems like if you think about the way that we interact with brands for services and products even on a daily basis, I mean, the breadth of the opportunity here seems to be pretty substantial, right? So I mean would love to get some kind of early feedback on interest that you're seeing and what people are looking to build with this and how you expect that opportunity to develop going forward. Thanks, Matt. This is Jeff. I think you're right to look at Segment Journeys as an exciting addition to our platform. And interestingly, it's not a very big step from where Segment was, which is helping companies take all the information that they see about their customers. How are they browsing the website? How are they using the mobile app? What products have they bought? How would they engage with the company. And using that to improve the customer engagement model across all the different touch points.
And if you think about it, one of the interesting tailwinds that's going on right now is how privacy and the moves that are going out in the world to increase the amount of privacy that consumers have, which is a very positive thing, makes it so that every company can't rely on shady cookies and third-party data and all this stuff that as consumers, we're like -- we're saying we don't want. And governance, and I would say, yes, we're not allowing it. And the major platforms, whether it's the browsers or iOS, are actually cracking down on some of these tactics from yesteryear.
And that is forcing every company to have to get better at looking at their first-party data and to understand their customer. And Segment, for a long time, have taken a hard stance to say, we will only deal in first-party data. We are not going to dive into that sketchy realm of weird data brokers, all those kind of stuff.
And so they have a great track record focusing on privacy-enabled great customer engagement, helping companies look at all their first-party data and then build a better customer journey. So what are all the things we know about this customer that if we use that knowledge to engage with them in their customer journey, we can help them succeed and in doing so, help the company better serve its customers.
So that's why I keep harping on this idea that the task of building a customer relationship is really 2 things. Number one, it's understand your customer. Pay attention. What are all the things that they're doing when they're on your website, browsing for men's T-shirts? Don't send them a marketing e-mail with -- for women's hats. That doesn't make any sense. That just shows you're not paying attention and you don't care.
And then second, guide them through that customer journey. And the way we've seen some of the leading companies think about this is, at every step of the way, if you use the knowledge that you have about your customer to help make them a better customer, help move them towards that ideal customer that every company thinks about, then that is the intelligent -- that, that's what intelligent customer engagement looks like, and that's what we're helping companies build.
And so I think Segment Journeys is a natural step in that direction. It allows companies to take all that information. They already used Personas to build a 360-degree view of the customer and then take where the customer's at in that journey and layer them into segments that then you can use to drive what's the next step in that journey. And that's what the Journeys product is doing. It's a fantastic product. It was very much conceived of in cooperation with customers and brought to market with customers at every step of the way showing us what they need. Right. Got it, got it. And then maybe just one more to follow up. Going to the -- last quarter, you talked about the changes in the R&D org structure of the company and kind of split the 3 separate kind of organizations, if you will. Any commentary on the progress there, how the teams are working together and then early feedback on that change? Absolutely. Thanks for the question. Overall, the reorganization is going well. We believe the changes that we made -- a reminder for folks, we're consolidating many business units under 3 discrete leaders that report to me. We believe that this change will better align the business to help Twilio continue to grow in scale. And we're also finding that it's enabling a greater amount of engagement in the company, visibility at the executive level with what's happening and driving alignment and clarity and road maps more efficiently than before.
And so all in all, I think the change has been going well and our teams are getting greater clarity, insight alignment as a result. And when you're growing a company as fast as you are, you can't just keep doing the same thing. There's always points in time when you need to consider the org chart and consider how the organization has changed. That's just one of these moments and I'd say that the reorganization has been well received and the teams are executing well. Your next question comes from Samad Samana with Jefferies. Congrats on another great quarter. Maybe one on Zipwhip. I was wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit more about the strategic value of having that direct carrier connection. And I know you're not guiding for a revenue perspective, but anything you can give us around what maybe Zipwhip's growth looks like. Would be helpful just as we think about contextualizing the acquisition. Well, I can speak to the value of having direct connections. I don't think we're disclosing any particular growth rate numbers or anything like that. But look, in general, the more direct relationships you have, the better situated you are to cooperate with the carriers and build great products together. And I think that when -- in places like North America where there's 3 carriers now and there's a lot of opportunity, having those direct relationships is tremendously valuable. We've been watching and seeing how the Zipwhip team and John and the team have done a great job of building those relationships and bringing products to market with the carriers. And so I just think that, that's an important part of building up the ecosystem. Simple as that. Understood. And then maybe just if we kind of take a simplistic approach and just think about net expansion, it implies revenue from new customers or kind of new business is really strong in the quarter. I think even stronger than last quarter. So I was wondering maybe if you could just give us some context around what -- if there's a specific area of strength in terms of revenue from new customers. Was it more on the traditional messaging side? Are you seeing kind of a step-up in other products? Just maybe help us think about the new revenue from new customers in the quarter. Yes. I mean I think the way to kind of think about it, this is a little bit crude, but basically, if you take the DBNE number and then look at that number and the difference between that and our organic growth rate, that will give you a sense of how new customers contributed. And then obviously, on top of that, you've got the inorganic stuff.
In general, I mean, I would say that it's broad-based strength across the board. I mean what we're finding is, is that the messaging product has really, really done well during the last year or so. And the reacceleration of that product is something that we're incredibly proud of as a company, no doubt.
On top of which, as I mentioned earlier, we're seeing great traction as well in the application services areas of the business. We've talked a lot about Segment, but even in some of the other categories, inclusive of Flex and SendGrid as well, our e-mail product, we're doing really, really well. And so I wouldn't point to any one thing other than to say that the messaging product, in particular, has been delivering great results. Segment had a great quarter. But across the board, across industries, verticals, whatever, we're just seeing broad-based strength. Your next question comes from Fred Havemeyer with Macquarie. I think I first wanted to just ask about your IoT business. It's something I don't think that we've necessarily been talking about much, but it's also quite interesting here. So I'd like to ask, can you just give us a general overview of where your IoT business stands and perhaps some initial customer perceptions around Super SIM? And generally, also, do you think that Segment is going to play a role in how businesses consider data collection utilization in the IoT space? Absolutely. This is Jeff. And I'll start by saying we're really happy with the IoT business. We actually just hired a new leader, Andrew Cohen, who came from Samsung, who is a fantastic leader. And I think what we're seeing is opportunity is that especially as the world is moving to 5G, there are so many more areas that have yet to be digitally enabled in terms of physical objects in the industrial sense, in the smart city sense. I think we as consumers think of IoT is like our smart devices in the home, like our watches and thermostats. And that is just -- like that is version 0.1 of what IoT is really going to be about.
So this is an early stage of, I think, a long game that's going to be a big outcome. And so we're excited by what we can bring. And what's really cool about the Super SIM -- and again, customers led us to the observations, the problem that Super SIM solves, is that as you deploy a device globally, you don't want to have to have a different vendor or a different set of chips, a different set of SIM cards and carriers behind the scenes based on where that device ends up in the world. You really want to manufacture a device once, put the same hardware, software and connectivity into that device and ship it out to a global supply chain. And that drastically reduces the complexity, but also it means that in the field, that device can get better every day. That's the power of software.
And so that's what we're seeing the Super SIM and a really powerful opportunity to make it so -- once devices leave the factory, they continue their connectivity stories. The performance of that connectivity, the cost of that connectivity is getting better all the time because it's expensive to manufacture. So imagine you've got an IoT humidifier or truck or garbage dumpster or trombone, you don't want to have to remanufacture that thing every time you get better connectivity technology. You want to be able to continually silently upgrade it in the background. That's what Super SIM enables companies to do because their connectivity is not something that is set into the device, and it's something that they can continually evolve in the cloud.
And so we took that whole layer of connectivity and really moved it to a software value proposition that runs in the cloud. I will say, I think the IoT world is a little challenged right now because of manufacturing and global supply chain issues that we've seen in every industry has set back some of these IoT use cases as they've struggled to get supply chains and things like that set up. And that's something I think we've seen across the industry of IoT, especially industrial lines and things like that. But I expect that, that's not a durable trend and that will -- that in the long scheme of things, the 5G rollout and the narrowband implementation that use far less energy and that are far more oriented towards a wide breadth of devices at a much lower price point will actually enable a whole slew of innovation in years to come. And gentlemen, another question. Can you give us an update on how your relationship with Syniverse is progressing? Are you at a point where you're materially routing A2P messages for Syniverse with your wholesale agreement? I'll take that. So just for background, we've worked with Syniverse for a long time. So they've been a partner of ours for many years. And so there hasn't been -- we didn't need to like make a material change to our business as a part where really that fuels about cementing our relationship. But the other thing I'll point out is we haven't closed the partnership yet, but still pending. And so a lot of that work still is a forthcoming as we close that partnership that we produce in house. Your next question comes from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. I've got two sort of metrics focused ones. I think it would be pretty helpful. Just going back to Michael's original question about Segment, if we normalize in Q4 for Segment, the sequential growth from Q4 to Q1, something in the high teens, maybe 20%, and it stepped down to 4.5%. Could we just get a better understanding for what -- is there a heightened seasonality with this business later in the year? Because it would help us not get ahead of ourselves to just understand the seasonal kind of patterns of that business. And then I've got a quick follow-up. Is the follow-up on Segment? Do you want to ask that question now as well? No, no. The follow-up is on A2P. Okay. Well, let me take the Segment question first, Alex. So I would say, in general, there's not like per se a seasonal dynamic that I would necessarily point to. I think in general, I mean, we feel great about the way that the acquisition is performing as we've noted several times during the course of this call. We feel quite good about the way that, that business is progressing, some of the products that they've announced.
I think anything that you're seeing in terms of the sequential is just a little bit of noise, ups and downs from quarter-to-quarter, all of which I would just expect to normalize going forward. Again, we feel very optimistic about the way that, that acquisition is headed and some of the things that we can do with that business. So I really wouldn't read too much into anything that you're seeing sequentially. Okay. And then on A2P piece, we appreciate, I think, that you guys talked about the AT&T contribution. But is it possible to just get a better understanding for the Verizon A2P fees maybe this quarter or last quarter so we can -- because if we do the math, it does look like the underlying growth organically ex A2P is accelerating Q1 to Q2, but I'd love to just understand a little bit better if that's actually the case. I mean I think in general, that's the case. I think we're not really breaking Verizon out anymore. I mean it's kind of in the base rate and as we look at comparisons from last year to this year, it's apples-to-apples, which is why we've broken out the AT&T and T-Mobile aspect only. And we've obviously given you a number there as well. But yes, if you were to take all of that stuff out, what you would see is that we're growing very nicely organically with or without the fees and that there is a reacceleration there. Your next question comes from Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. A question for George or Jeff on demand for 2-way messaging via Twilio Conversations versus traditional one-way SMS messaging API. I know in the new wins this quarter, you highlighted a couple of conversation use cases. What is the benefit to the model as customers move from SMS to Conversations? Is it primarily higher volumes? Or does it also include higher pricing? And really just trying to understand how fast could the industry move.
There's personally nothing more frustrating to me as a consumer than to get a text from a brand without the ability to actually reply back. And so certainly encouraged to see Conversations being brought up more, but love to get any color on adoption and how that would kind of change the messaging volumes for Twilio as well. Yes. That's a great question, Brent. This is Jeff. I'll answer it. If you think about the strategy of how companies have gone about adding messaging to their product experiences, natural first step was to add notification because it's easy and it's high value. But then, of course, consumers expect that to be a 2-way dialogue and they reply. What do you usually get back? You get back sometimes nothing. Sometimes you get back a text and data rates may apply, call this phone number. But really, the customer experience that companies are expecting is to be able to reach a person or a system that answers their question.
And that's why we've been focusing on products like Conversations that can turn those one-way messages into 2-way conversation. And then on top of Conversations, we've built Flex for the contact center and Frontline for their workers, so it's a front line of serving customers. And so to create all the vehicles for a company to have 2-way conversations, the door is often open to be able to have that conversation with the company by that first outgoing alert notification, the thing that kind of opens the door for you.
And I think for us, what we see is the more value we can add into the channel. A, customers get more value on it because their customers are happier. But b, it allows us to build great software products that enable those companies to actually be successful in 2-way messaging because it's nontrivial to build those types of experience. And so whether it's with the contact center, whether it's a frontline worker, someone out in the field, someone doing a delivery or what we're seeing a lot of it is for sales use cases, having salespeople with a open messaging channel open to their customers. These are valuable places where companies can now turn a message, that over the fullness of time, turn it into a relationship.
Because if you think about you and your friends or family in that phone, that history of all your messages, that is a good summary of your relationship. That is how we are actually building relationships now digitally as consumers. And companies want to be a part of those conversations, too. They want to be a part of that relationship. And that relationship is not transactional, and it's not just a bunch of alerts, it's actually a 2-way dialogue.
And I think that we're going to look back and we're going to see that history of conversation that you have with a company, that starts to become the new customer relationship. It's right there in that thread. And that's what we're helping companies create. In fact, I was talking to a major financial services company recently, and they really saw that vision of that's how we're going to build the relationship. And so I think that's a common conversation that I'm having with executives of many companies who really see that future coming. And we're helping them deliver it with Flex, with Frontline, with Conversations and all the things that we're working on. Your next question comes from Will Power with Baird. I guess maybe two questions. First, I think probably for Jeff. I guess, first, thanks for all the company's vaccination efforts, obviously great to see. I wanted to ask about Twilio Live. It was mentioned in the prepared remarks. I just want to better understand the market that's trying to address. Any kind of early use cases you could point to and really just kind of how you're thinking about the opportunity for that product? Absolutely. Thanks, Will. If you think about what is happening, the first use cases for live media on the Internet were largely one-to-one or one-to-few, And now we're seeing the number of use cases for broadcast scale, live experiences really grow. A lot of that is because of COVID. But you also look at interesting use cases where like you can have a large-scale audio experience. And many companies are looking at, hey, how can I have thousands of people involved in a live audio conversation. Or how can I do a webinar and have live interactive video with many, many, many people.
And so Twilio Live is the answer to this emerging market of live interactive video experiences. You're starting to see things like commerce opportunities happen online with live video. You've got the whole audio market. So one of our launch customers for that was Reddit Talk. So Reddit wanted to add a voice talk feature into their communities. And so they used Twilio Live to do that. And so those are -- that was one of the reference customers at the time of launch.
And we're just seeing -- I think there's -- we're at the very beginning of a lot of new experimentation into, okay, live media on the Internet. Not just 1 to 2, 1 to 3, 1 to 5, but actually at scale, like broadcast scale, but interactive is actually starting to become a reality. And I think COVID accelerated a lot of the experimentation into what's possible. And so we're looking forward to powering many of those new ideas, including, for example, Reddit. Okay. That's great. And then I guess maybe just for Khozema. Any thoughts around how to frame the gross margin outlook as we head into Q3? I guess you have a full quarter impact of the A2P fees. But aside from that, any other puts and takes to be thinking about to help us kind of model that moving forward? Not really. Well, I mean, I wouldn't say there's any real change in our long-term framework around gross margins. I mean we're still targeting 60% to 65%. We've not really ever been focused on it per se in the short term and there's some noise in here. Obviously, there's our messaging product, which we feel great about the fact that it's had such a strong performance but mixes us down a little bit. Obviously, international, an increase there from 29% to 32% and then the fees clipped us a little bit. But I wouldn't say that there's anything really kind of in the -- different in the long-term outlook and the way that we're thinking about it. Your next question comes from Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho. I just want to dig into the Flex adoption in contact center. And also I'm wondering, how are you looking at the cloud contact center opportunity now given that UCaaS vendors and there's kind of convergence of UCaaS and CCaaS vendor with recent consolidation? How are you looking at the opportunity there? Absolutely. This is Jeff. So first of all, with Flex, thanks for the question. We're really happy with how Flex is going. I know we don't break it out separately, but if you looked at Flex independently, I think you'd look at its momentum and say it's one of the fastest-growing SaaS products on the market. And I'm particularly proud of the fact that we've got the wide berth of customer adoption that we have from the digital disruptors that we saw early in the adoption cycle, Shopify, Lyft, Robinhood, through the Fortune 500 incumbents in the market who are adopting Flex as well, like the major bank that we mentioned, I think, back in Q4 or Allianz or today's announcement of a major retailer or the Philippine Airlines, right? And so we're seeing broad adoption by a wide set of companies. We're really happy with it.
Now for the second part of your question about the greater trends that are going out, look, I was guessing someone went in, asked that question. First, I'd say the market is still in the early stages of moving to the cloud. It's only around 15% or so of the market that's in the cloud. And so 85% of the market, give or take, is still on-prem, on legacy solutions. And so that's what I think we're looking at as the big opportunity.
But I also think the combination of like UCaaS and contact centers is an interesting one because I see the market changing a little bit. I think that UCaaS is typically thought of as a call center, it's like the desk firm. And what we're seeing the contact center become as much more of a customer experience, customer engagement point. Creating great customer experiences is a driver of top line and it's becoming closer to the revenue side of the business. How do we serve customers as opposed to the call center? How do we save money?
And so it used to be that IT and the call center side of the business was like the desk phones in the contact center. But I actually think that when you start looking at digital channels and serving customers over the digital channels, the nature of the contact center is changing from that IT cost center to something that's much closer to the revenue and the Chief Digital Officer and the thing that is going to drive happy customers, repeat customers and more business. And so I think that's a trend that we're well situated to attach to, given the hardware products, given where we sit and who we sell to inside the companies. Your next question comes from Ryan Koontz with Needham. I want to circle back to your international revenue strength and characterize the adoption of digital customer engagement across these different customer sets. How do you view the international markets relative to the U.S. in terms of adoption there? Do you see some of them more advanced in the U.S.? Or are they all playing kind of catch up? This is George. I think it really depends on the technology, I would say, for any of our technologies like SMS and e-mail. Certainly, North America is at parity or ahead of any other place, I would argue. But some of other platforms like WhatsApp, we definitely have seen more advanced adoption in some of our international markets. So I think it just really depends on part of the portfolio. Your last question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. I'll add my congrats on a strong quarter. Jeff, I wanted to ask you about the Frontline product. We've been intrigued by the potential for a new kind of an app that would connect frontline workers with consumers. And we understand there are more non-desk workers in the world than desk workers. So understanding it's still early, how do you see that product progressing? And do you feel like you've been able to build some pretty good pipeline in that area? Yes. Thanks, Mark. I think -- so that is one of the observations that we launched the product with, which is that there are more non-desk workers than there are desk workers. And I think an interesting thing that we've also observed about the market is that there are -- there's 2 types of humans basically who interact with customers in most businesses. One are people who sit usually in a place and all they do is interact with customers. That's usually what you call a call center or a contact center. Maybe they're in a building with cubicles and maybe now they're sitting at home, but basically, they take call after call after call or chat after chat or whatever, right?
And what we're seeing in Frontline is there's another large category of workers who -- that isn't their full-time job. They've got many things that they're doing, yet when a customer needs help, they need to basically drop what they're doing and help that customer. And that's, I think, where Frontline is also finding a really interesting set of use cases.
And as I mentioned before, there's a lot of areas where the sales is a really interesting area where salespeople who often are busy doing many things, but need to communicate, need to engage with the customer, now are doing that with a tool like Frontline. And it's on the go, it's in their pocket, it's a mobile app. It's easy to use, it feels as native as their phone. And when you do that well, you can embed the CRM information right in that experience to power that person with all the information about that customer and the company gets to track and ensure compliance of all those communications that are going through that experience as opposed to if someone just used their mobile phone and their native personal phone number to actually communicate with the customer.
So we're seeing a lot of interesting areas, use cases and types of companies. Very excited with the company that we're able to talk about today, the health care company that was using Frontline for sales communications. And I think there -- the product isn't even GA yet, but to have a major Fortune 500 health care company already starting to deploy Frontline, I think, indicates that there are a broad set of use cases that we're seeing from not just them, but other companies as well that will -- where these frontline workers need to be empowered with great customer engagement tools, less -- they just do it less effectively in an uncompliant way using their personal phone. And I think there, we're just scratching the surface and excited to bring that product to GA. And quick one for Khozema on the A2P fees. Did you think the carriers who have increased those fees are sort of one and done with the increases or is there a chance that there'll be some kind of some ongoing lift there in the future? And just, I guess, I'm inferring from the strength of results that it's pretty comfortable in terms of customers absorbing that cost just because the ROI remains so high. Is that a fair way to think about it? Yes. I mean I think the ROI is incredibly high when you think about the things that we're doing with customers to be able to enable their use cases. It's hard for me to say one way or the other as to whether or not it's one and done. I mean, I think certainly, based on what we know and see today, we don't see anything in the future, but it certainly doesn't preclude them doing something else. But all of our financial modeling is not based on any additional fees at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speakers presentation, there will be question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is also being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Without a further ado, I would like to welcome one of your speakers for today, Mr. Andrew Zilli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasury. Sir, the floor is yours. Thanks, [Carol] (ph). Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Twilio's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Our prepared remarks, earnings press release, investor presentation, SEC filings, and a replay of today's call can be found on our IR website at investors.twilio.com. Joining me today for Q&A are Jeff Lawson, Co-Founder and CEO, George Hu, our outgoing COO, Marc Boroditsky, CRO, and Khozema Shipchandler, CFO. As a reminder, some of our commentary today maybe a non-GAAP term. Reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and further information related to guidance can be found in our earnings press release. Additionally, some of our discussion and responses may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions
In particular, our expected business benefits and financial impacts from our acquisitions, particularly Segment and Zipwhip, and our partnerships and investments, including the associated transactions, the impact of recent and future pricing changes on certain third-party platforms on us and our customers, our outlook for the quarter ending December 31, 2021, our ability to achieve our targets for non-GAAP gross margin over time, an annual growth rate over the next 3 years, and our ability to manage changes in network service provider fees that we pay in connection with the delivery of our communication on our platform, and the impact of those fees on our gross margin, are subject to change. Should any of these risks materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections or those implied by these forward-looking statements
A description of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, and other factors that could affect our financial results are included in our SEC filings, including our most recent report on Form 10-K and subsequent reports on Form 10-Q.

We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call, to reflect events or circumstances after today, or to reflect new information, or the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law. With that, I'll hand it over to Jeff for a brief statement, and then we'll open the call for Q&A. Thanks, Zilli. Before we begin Q&A today, I want to take a moment to thank our COO George Hu for the amazing contributions he's made to Twilio over the past 5 years. With George's leadership, we really figured out a developer-first go-to-market, which is an incredibly challenging feat given nearly no other companies has a go-to market that's as unique or as efficient as ours. George has set us up on a new trajectory in building a tremendous team. Starting with his direct reports all the way down the go-to-market recommendation, and I can't wait to see what you build next, George. I am also incredibly excited for Marc Boroditsky to be taking the [charge] (ph) and continue driving our forward progress. Marc has built the Twilio sales teams from [literally] (ph) zero, to the powerhouse of challenge it is today, kept up the admiration and respect to the teams, and a vision for how to continually evolve and grow our go-to-market with developers, enterprises, partners, and digital leaders. I'm excited for the next chapter, Marc. Now, on to the questions. Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley. Please ask your question. Great. I appreciate the question and congratulations on the quarter. Understanding you had a couple of 100 basis point headwind from political traffic that contributed to the deceleration in organic revenue growth we saw in Q3, but what do you think is the biggest contributor to the slowdown in organic growth, and what kind gives you that continued confidence that you can grow 30% the next three years, a number we kind of understood to be an organic number? Thanks. Yeah. Hey Meta, this is Khozema. I would say, first of all, I mean at 38% organic, we feel great about our overall growth performance in the quarter. Obviously, we're at about 65% on an inorganic basis. If you just look at the rest of the growth across industries, across used cases, , across geographies, and across customers, we have a lot of confidence in the go-forward capabilities of the business. I would also add that we are really strong quarter performance for Segment and so when we put all those different pieces together, we definitely see our ability to continue growing at elevated levels for the foreseeable future and we feel really confident in our beliefs to deliver the 30% plus organic growth that we talked about last year, over the next 3 years. Great. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Fred Havemeyer from Macquarie. You may ask your question. Thank you very much. Could you talk about your overall M&A philosophy? How do you approach that build versus buy versus partner debate at Twilio. And then, generally, when you're looking across the landscape, the market landscape, how do you think M&A appetite to progressing in the CPaaS market and in the customer engagement market? I think, this is Jeff. I'll take the question. So first on your question on the M&A philosophy which is really remained unchanged in the history of the Company, which is what we've got our insights about the market, if [Indiscernible] going, and what our customers need from us. And as a result, we’ve a roadmap for the things that we want to accomplish our customers to unlock this vision of being the leading customer engagement platform, which I see as the greatest enterprise software opportunity of our time. When we look at the things that we're going to go build, whether it's the teams, we have to go higher or technology yet to build, if we see a team out there which is amazing or we see a product out there and that's really exactly what we might go do ourselves, then we might say, hey, we can achieve this vision faster by bringing that team or that product onboard and accelerating our ability to unlock [Indiscernible] and that's really how we've always looked at it, which is does it accelerate our ability to achieve our vision of becoming the leading customer engagement platform. And I think there is a second question? Yeah, the second question there is just generally, how do you see the overall M&A appetite for Twilio in this market and generally across an entire CPaaS market? Certainly there's been quite a bit of M&A from other CPaaS vendors out there. Hey, Fred, this is Khozema. I would say that -- we obviously have a really strong balance sheet and a lot of cash on it. I think the way that we look at it is exactly the way that Jeff described, which means we'll be opportunistic if an opportunity presents itself. I think we obviously have been acquisitive over the last several years. We did Segment, of course, last year, around this time and then we've done some assets in more of the messaging space since then. But it's not like we see something in front of us that we necessarily have to do. We want to be selective about the opportunities we obviously certainly see where valuations are today as well. But I think more than anything, we just feel great about technology stack that we've already got, we're really confident, especially coming off of a really strong SIGNAL conference. Okay. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Rishi Jaluria from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Hey, guys. This is Rishi Jaluria from RBC. Thanks so much for taking my question. It has always been great to work with you and then all the best to the next chapter and Khozema, congrats on the promotion or -- and new responsibilities. Just wanted to ask one question which is, from a macro perspective, seems like a really strong demand environment. But how should we think about the puts and takes of maybe some of the benefits that we saw from lockdowns last year potentially fading and maybe the return of travel and specifically business travel, especially given that most industries seem to still be having that put on hold. Just how are you thinking about stuff like that coming back? Thank you. Hey, Rishi, this is Jeff. I'll answer. First of all, I agree with you. This is a strong environment for companies who are undergoing digital transformation and those transformations have been accelerated by the pandemic. And something that I think it's really important to understand here is that this is not like a restaurant or the digital interactions that got put in say over the course of the past year or two was not a deviation from the future [Indiscernible]. It was just an acceleration. We're bringing forward a lot of the innovation that were happening. Think about telemedicine. You thought telemedicine might take a decade [Indiscernible] adaption. And that is going to continue, I believe, to be the trend when I look at do you want to drive across town for every doctor's visit? No. Like you can see a doctor in 15 minutes on a video call may go back to work, that's a better experience. Same thing with like, for instance like curbside pickup around my ordering, and all these sort of things. This has been an acceleration of the natural digital transformation of the world. It's just going faster. When you see that environment exists, businesses are going to continue to drive those roadmaps because the competitive environment today, that customers get accustomed to these efficiencies and these experiences, and that creates even more demand for digital. So I think it's a flywheel for how customers are now differentiating themselves digitally in those markets, and our customer engagement platform now enables this.
When you think about it, like I had talked last week at SIGNAL our big customer conference about how [Indiscernible] pandemic has accelerated, like so many companies, I think probably we talked to 250,000 customers in the digital acceleration, the topic of accelerating their digital presence, like these digital roadmaps I guess, [Indiscernible] big digital giants Amazon, Netflix, Facebook, Google, etc. and so, while those companies out there [Indiscernible] accelerated, so did the giant digital companies, and that has been increasingly raised the stakes for every Company to execute at a first-class level in the digital world, and the platform that we're building, the [Indiscernible] customer engagement platform, is designed to give all of those other companies, the ability to listen to their customers, understand their customers, [first-party] (ph) data, and use that data to build a great understanding of the customer; personalize the journey to make it relevant, and therefore, [Indiscernible] their customer's hearts, minds and wallets. And you can think about it. When I talk to customers, everybody out there says, you know what I want to do? I want to acquire a customer one. I want to delight them with an amazing product and experience, and make them a loyal repeat customer for life. That's what Twilio enables companies to do, and that has been I think accelerated because of the pandemic, which is all part of this digital acceleration that we're experiencing. So, yes. There's a strong environment out there, and I think that that is going to continue. I don't think this is an aberration. I think it's an acceleration. Got it. Thank you. Your next question is from the line of Samad Samana of Jefferies. Please ask your question. Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. Jeff, maybe one to kick off for you, and as you mentioned, the SIGNAL conference, the Company rolled out Engage, and you've rolled out the Frontline long before that. I'm just wondering if you're starting to see as you've rolled out more of these solutions on top of the core platform, if you're seeing any difference in the adoption on day 1 from customers, or if you're seeing going more bundling of the solutions upfront and how that's actually driving volume inside of the business as well? And that's a great question for Marc, our Chief Revenue Officer to take. Thank you Jeff and thank you Samad for the question. Definitely affecting the adoption that we have seen in the recent quarter. As an example, Flex has inspired our partners to consider building the next-generation of their offering for contact center on the Flex solution. Likewise, with the announcement of Engage, last week at SIGNAL I had a number of conversations with IFD that are looking at, again, changing their offering overall. Probably the one that aligns the most to your question, Samad, is the successively seen with our partner Waterfield who has built a plug-in for Flex and made it possible for us to sell into more of the market. And this past quarter, we saw small company that needed a full solution on day 1 as docking Flex as their first solutions from Twilio, which gives us great confidence about the potential that Flex represents from SMB all the way to [Indiscernible]. Okay, that's helpful. Khozema, I don't want to put you on the spot with a math question, but I appreciate it. I still have a follow-up. If I adjust for political revenue in the low 40s organic growth, one, I just want to see if that's correct. And then the guide implies, again, low 30s if you take out political revenue., How should we maybe contextualize that with that go-forward 30% plus growth as well as you look forward? Thanks for the question, Samad, believe it or not, I actually tend to do a little bit of math on the fly. I think the setup that you gave is about right. I think we continue to see elevated growth across the businesses as we talked about earlier. The reality is that we gave 65% inorganic, 38% organic. I think if you do the math that you just implied, you're at about the ballpark that you just described. The guidance that we put out for Q4, we feel really good about -- we see a nice setup certainly for Q4. And as we look out based on the a lot of things that Marc just referenced a moment ago as well as some of the things that Jeff talked about relative to SIGNAL, I mean, we see a tremendous amount of opportunity in front of us and have a really, really strong conviction that we can deliver 30% plus over the next three years. So I think we just feel really, really good about broad-based strength across the business. Great, I appreciate you all taking my questions. Thank you. Sure. Thanks, Samad. The next question is coming from the line of Derrick Wood of Cowen. You may now ask your question. Thanks for taking my question. George, good luck in your next endeavor. Khozema, I know it's probably early, but anything you want to share in terms of what your early priorities will be as you move into the COO role? And then I -- you've had a new CRO for a year, Marc, I know you're on the call. Should we assume, from a direct sales, go-to-market standpoint we shouldn't anticipate too much change or should we be thinking about taking the time to make bigger tweaks to the model? Maybe I'll go first, Derrick, and it's Khozema, and then I'll turn it over to Marc. So I think from my standpoint, in large part, the role is an expansion of additional [responsibility](ph). I see it more as a continuation of things that we've already been doing. I think in general, we want -- or I want to in the role to really help the operating team win as much as possible, as efficiently as possible, as fast as possible, integrate the infrastructure and support [Indiscernible] inside the Company so that all of our great teams inside the go-to market and engineering teams can innovate and then obviously distribute all the great products and services that we've got. So I don't think there is like really a sea change in the context of my role. I mean, I'm obviously super excited to take it on. Even more so, I'm humbled and privileged to be able to [Indiscernible]. I want to continue to help Jeff and manage [the team win] (ph). Marc? Thanks Khozema and thank you, Derrick, for the question. A little background. I've been in Twilio now for seven years since the acquisition of [Indiscernible] and as Jeff referenced in his preamble, it was just a handful of sales reps at the time here at Twilio. And George joined five-years ago I had a great privilege to build out the go-to-market [Indiscernible] that he's been executing on since and as you identified Derrick, we're expecting to continue forward with the strategy that we have today. We've got a fantastic team in place. We're well-positioned to continue to execute against the already successful execution that we have with developers. We're continuing to progress our success in the enterprise, and we're expanding our overall international footprint. As I mentioned earlier as well, in the example that I gave, we're making great progress of our partner communities, engaging them to build out the business together. That's helpful. If could follow up on the financial question back you, Khozema. Your gross margins have certainly been topical with investors, interesting slide you gave on the bridge to the A2P fees, but you can just take a second to really unpack that and what's been causing the pressure, how we should be thinking about gross margin in the next few quarters and what it's going to take to get to that 60% long-term target? Thanks. Yes, thanks for the question, Derrick. I mean, I think the bridge with respect to the A2P fee dynamic at least is self-explanatory. If you can see that it [Indiscernible] almost [Indiscernible] relative to what we would otherwise have reported, were it not for those fees. I think more broadly, what we seen is honestly a fantastic problem, which is that our messaging business has been growing at really accelerated rates and we gave you some information last year, for example, during our Investor Day that basically illustrated the relative gross margins of our different products and services. So as the messaging business grows at this accelerated rate, it makes the margin rate down a little bit, which honestly is a trade that we're more than willing to take, given the fact that we are focused on gross profit dollar expansion so that we continue to invest in the business.
In terms of the latter part of your question, and 60% plus, I mean, we still have a lot of conviction in that 60% plus longer term framework. And I think where that's going to come from is the accelerated growth that we're seeing in our application services category. And I think Segment is obviously the most recent example of that. I think the promise of engaging what we described it at a single conference last week, as well as the best that segment had a fantastic quarters sequentially coming off of Q2 into Q3. Just as a lot of confidence that that businesses performed well and continue to underpin a lot of different things that we want to do with the rest of the business. Obviously we're very excited about the progress of Flex 2. And so I think it's a combination of those things that need to continue to believe in that 50% for a long-term target. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Hey, there. Thanks. Good afternoon. I appreciate you taking the questions. George, I certainly wish you the best. I know from just a number of these calls, you've been instrumental in things like instrumenting the go-to-market and the partner initiatives there. Can you just maybe broadly as a team talk more about continuity just on the go-to-market side, given we're heading into the year-end? We can appreciate that Marc has been with you for some time, but maybe just adding additional context for investors and that evolution and just the confidence in sustaining the tremendous pace that the business has been able to perform at for a number of years now. Thank you Michael. This is George. Thank you for the kind words. And then certainly, it seems difficult to be [Indiscernible] I'm so incredibly excited about Twilio and its future, I think especially coming off of an amazing signal here. I talk to so many customers that are just excited about this customer engaging platform vision and Segment. But what gives me confidence is, tremendously we should be up here. I've been working with Marc now for a number of years, 4 years. Marc, [Indiscernible] really felt this entire sales machines and the limited numbers quarter-after-quarter was an incredible year was higher, all re-challenge having the sales even. And I know that you could [Indiscernible] job going forward, I think there's going to be a continuity, and I think that Marc is also going to evolve the organization and forget to the next level also. I also, far less -- Marc [Indiscernible] I also want to really gradually and acknowledged Khozema who's going to be an amazing COO of Twilio. He's been an amazing partner to me, he's one of the smartest people I've ever worked with, a great leader and he's going to do phenomenal, phenomenal things for the next chapter in Twilio. Thank you, George. And Michael thank you for your question. Right now, the expectations are very solid around the team and how we're going to be progressing into -- how we're going to be progressing with the plan that we got in place. This plan has not -- the set plan is -- developed over the last 5 years with George and I in [Indiscernible]. When George joined, he brought expertise that is very familiar to me from my previous enterprise experience and he supported us in building out a plan that allows us to reach to the enterprise from the models [Indiscernible] developed to self-serve and helped us to build out the overall global footprints and ultimately our partner initiative. All things that are implied at great stages of success. I am very confident for the team that's in place that we will continue that trajectory. That's all very helpful. If I could just ask a follow-on to gross margins were actually -- I know you've gotten a couple of questions here, Khozema. They're actually slightly up. I think many investors are expecting that we might see just continued headwinds given the international business is now a third of overall. Are we at a point where for things like segment as if we're first starting to provide the counterbalance or anything else you'd call out and you also added a slide on just gross profit growth. So is that a metric maybe just to highlight in terms of just the conversations around these dynamics? I would say the inclusion of the gross profit slide is a necessarily indication of anything new. We've been saying for a while now, Michael, that we've been focused on gross profit dollar expansion, obviously gives us lot of fuels to reinvest back in the business. We just thought it would be helpful in terms of fighting, position, color. Same thing goes for gross margin slide which is -- [Indiscernible] behind a story other than obviously the A2P [Indiscernible] closed on a little bit, and you could see that in the bridges that we provided. I think generally speaking, as I said earlier, like people grade about, ""Problem that we have"" that can -- We have this incredibly fast growth messaging business, which has make the overall gross margin of the Company down. But to your point, whether it's some of the newer acquisitions for Flex or Segment, we do have a number of things that can provide fuel for a gross margin up less over time. We're not just getting into that today per se, but we do have a lot of confidence in our long-term framework 60% plus over time. Thank you. Thanks, Michael. The next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer & Co. Please ask your question. Thanks. Jeff, I'd like to start with you on Twilio engaged. Super excited for that announcement. I guess, help me think about the ramp here. I know when Flex came out conservative, but it clearly did very good out of the gate. You have already an established customer base here with Segment. Is there an opportunity for this business to ramp faster than one would think? And is there a -- do you need to make any adjustments on the go-to-market approach in pushing this product? [Indiscernible] Jeff. So let me give you some forward-looking projections about the -- just kidding. You asked talking about the ramp up. They might -- obviously, I can't tell you specifically about the product. There are no -- I know where the ramp is [Indiscernible]. But what I can say is that a few things. Number 1, I think there's a lot of demand in the market for this tough play. Digital growth and digital personalization or how businesses are building their businesses is a tremendous opportunity. And that opportunity is actually accelerated by the [Indiscernible] changes, like on the world of IDFA tags and third-party cookies, and all those things getting change because companies here rely on what's just honestly shenanigans
Like in the changes that have been going on, whether cookies or IDFA tags, these privacy changes are on the right side of history. And so, what Twilio's providing is the antidote to all those changes, which is a personalization and marketing system that starts with first-party data, that starts with a Company understanding, making sense of the first party signal they get from their customer, and the data of approach to then use that signal, use that first party data to then go personalized and build great relationships with their customer across all these touch points, whether it's marketing, contact center, sales, you name it, or whether it is a [Indiscernible] channel. Via messaging voice email, in an app, on the web, etc.
That's the [Indiscernible] of how companies are going to win the hearts and minds, and [Indiscernible] of their customers. And the changes in privacy providing really nice tailwind, I think in the macro sense of what companies need to do in order to continue growing their relationships with their customers and gets you to growing their customers. So that's the first thing. And the second thing I want to point out, I think it's a very natural synergy with not one but two go-to-market. That's we have [Indiscernible] , is a natural up-sell from our messaging products. Because it makes our messaging even more powerful. And it's a natural up-sell from Segment, which allows you to do something [Indiscernible] which is actually [Indiscernible] and so I'm really looking forward if that product rolls out GA in 2022. I'm really looking forward [Indiscernible] bring that to customers [Indiscernible] product. Very good. Maybe a follow-up for you, Khozema, on the retention rates. Maybe you can -- sorry, the net expansion. Maybe you can walk us through a little bit, perhaps of the puts and takes of that metric going forward. I know you still have the political activity, which, I guess, would weigh on that number next quarter. But I think you also are going to celebrate the anniversary of Segment, which will include. And I don't remember if Segment was above or below average on that standpoint. Can you help us think about what would be the right way to think about how net expansion rate is going to change over the next, call it, three, four quarters? There are a couple of things there Ittai. Thanks for the question. First of all, we feel great about 131% expansion rate. The business is growing at really elevated levels and just given the sides that we are at our run rate and feel great about it and 131 is in the range of where we've been over the last several quarters, so really good progress seeing across the business. And we don't guide on expansion rate as you know and so, I think it will be a little bit premature for me to talk about where I anticipate that end up being in Q4 and beyond. But I will say is that, we do intend to be disclosed in our remarks earlier that Segment and we'll include as part of Q1 being the first full quarter close the anniversary of the acquisition and with all those results include Segment at that time. But we'll have to wait and see for that to work. Very good. Good luck. Thank you, Ittai. Our next question -- sorry. Our next question comes from the line of Parker Lane of Stifel. Please ask your question. Thanks for taking my question. Jeff, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the stickiness of the incumbent platforms in the CRM markets. And when you look at the B2C component there, how much appetite do you think there is for disruption of those legacy platforms, particularly as some of your competitors out there in the newer markets are launching their own CDP offerings? Thanks. Yeah. Thanks, Parker. This is Jeff. So we're really excited about Segment which is obviously, the number one CDP in the market. We're really excited [Indiscernible] built on top of it. And interesting, when I look at the market, I just see a huge hole in the market for a platform that is helping B2C companies really understand their customers and execute on that understanding by personalizing every part of the journey empowering their employees with [Indiscernible]. And the [Indiscernible] market is a great one, but that's really about B2B
It's not configured to do this. B2B CRN really start to us salespeople and ready notice which is to say completely different starting point, than what B2C companies [Indiscernible] and so the opportunity that we're going after, and what our customers are looking for is how do B2C customers with volumes of data allocate that data, understand it and act on it across all the different applications and all the touch points that they have. And that's a fundamentally different market that nobody has really cracked and that's the opportunity for Twilio's customer engagement platform and that's the opportunity that customers are pulling us towards because they [Indiscernible] and so that's what we see as the market is going on. The next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy from JPMorgan. You may now ask your question. Yes. Thank you very much. Jeff, question on Twilio Engage. What do you see as the differentiation or the line of demarcation there? If we compare it to some of your partners who provide cross-channel experiences where, they're using push and in-app and SMS and e-mail event. I believe some of them then send their messaging traffic to you if you could just help us maybe a little compare and contrast. Thanks Mark. [Indiscernible] is a really [Indiscernible] landscape and we have as many companies out there doing all sorts of interesting things. And what we're seeing is that customers are really asking for a data approach to their growth [Indiscernible]. An approach that starts with data and then move out from that data into understanding customer, building [Indiscernible] and then building action from the data. And that's where Segment has always played and that's where Segment strengthened. So ultimately, we're serving an unmet need when customers come to us saying, hey, can Segment be used to build these journeys and then ultimately run this campaign? And that's the thing about Segment, is that not only we allow marketers to create these big segmentations and you heard it at SIGNAL about how into it when they went to like 30 -- or sorry, they went from 3 Segments that they can go whole customer base has come to 3 Segments to now 450, a net increase in engagement in our customer base from 20% to 50%
We know it's a story of [Indiscernible] at SIGNAL last week, which is amazing. And for the Segment also allows the marketers to use all the data points to see the measure of the effective [Indiscernible] campaigns, which I think is another interesting point of engage. So instead of measuring a bunch of emails when they deliver, when they open, when they click on, Segment [Indiscernible] marketers to optimize for what actually drives revenue that result in people buying things, which, of course, is the ultimate goal. So what we're hearing from our customers is that the data first approach, which starts with having great data by your customers, that unlocks all sorts of new ways for smart growth marketers to do their job, and hopefully one that the market has against helpful. I think I understand, yeah, so the CDP is the basis there. I had a quick follow-up, maybe for Khozema or Jeff. I think the sequential organic growth in revenue was a bit less than some of the prior quarters, although interestingly, I think the same thing happened a couple of quarters after you acquired SendGrid in Q3, so I guess we've seen that. Could you just touch on that, is that voice or video or something else? And just given you're reaffirming this 30% plus growth for 3 years, the -- can we presume that you have visibility into some better sequential build into Q4 or in early next year? Yeah, Marc, it's Khozema. I'll take your question. I wouldn't read too much into product mix dynamics. I think we feel really good, and honestly about the sequential growth and just the overall growth of the Company at our scale and based off of our product set. And I think as we talked about, I think earlier in this call, you look at some of the things. We announced SIGNAL and the tools that's going to provide us going forward. We feel fantastic about the overall growth prospects of the business. So in terms of the setup on the 30% plus, I mean, we provided guidance obviously for Q4, and we feel really good about that. And we see continued strong growth into the future. And that 30% plus that we provided last year, we certainly see that on an organic basis over the next three years. The next question comes from the line of Matt Stotlar of William Blair. You may now ask your questions. Hey, guys. Thank you for taking me [Indiscernible] the questions here. I guess. One, just looking at the revenue growth performance in the quarter. So if you look at the relationship between dollar-based and expansion, which, to your point, it's been incredibly consistent in this range on a multiyear stack. When you look at the different between that and your organic growth that you guys reported, the relationship between those two essentially gives you some sense of the incremental revenue that you're generating from new customers in any given quarter. This quarter, that contribution seem to be the primary source of the step-down in organic growth. Sequentially, they go from 50 to 38. Can you just talk about anything that you're seeing in terms of what might be driving that lower contribution from revenue from new customers on organic basis this quarter or anything you're seeing in the market that can help us to make some sense of that? Yeah. This is Khozema, Matt. I can talk about it from a financial perspective, and then maybe Marc can talk about it in terms of customer adoption perspective. I'd say there's nothing specifically that I haven't necessarily unpacked in terms of new customer growth. As you saw, in the quarter, we had very strong adds in terms of new customers. We had a great expansion rate in the quarter. We had strong overall revenue growth both on inorganic and organic basis. I think the math that you're trying to do is kind of directionally accurate, but there is a certain amount to unpack there, which is potentially offline. But I think in general, I would say we feel great about the overall prospects of the business. We feel great about the set up for Q4 and a lot of conviction in our 30% plus organic revenue growth over the next 3 years. Marc, you want to add maybe from a customer adoption perspective? Certainly Khozema. Matt, thank you for your question. Some of the adoption standpoint we added Q3 across all aspects to business. And as you know we have a very diversified business that is relevant, and is a variety of economic conditions that's allowed us that we delivered these strong results. With even more encouraging, especially on the heels of signal, is the reaction that we're getting to the messages that we shared here today. And as Jeff elaborated on around the customer engagement platform, the value of that. Absolutely [Indiscernible] fully engaged in the progress are experiencing with Flex and [Indiscernible] this excitement around the data first models, everybody's looking for ways to deal with the new challenges that they're facing the market around first party data and results. We've heard really solid excitement that gives us confidence around the business as it is. That's helpful. And then maybe just one more on -- just a quick one on the gross margin front. So what you gave is very helpful, right? I kind of taken out the A2P fees and understanding that was very helpful. You also signed a new commercial agreement with Syniverse early this year, which seemed like it would provide maybe a little bit of tailwind to gross margin. Is that something that was embedded in the results this quarter or is that something you can talk about in terms of how to [Indiscernible] going forward? Thank you. Yeah, [Indiscernible] Syniverse, there's nothing really to talk about yet. We do expect that investment to take place before the conclusion of the year, but it's [Indiscernible] results yet, Matt. Got it. Thanks again. The next question comes from the line of Catharine Trebnick of Colliers Securities. Your line is open. Hi, thank you for taking my question. Can you break down who you think your biggest competitors are at this point with the newly announced Twilio Engage? Thanks. Hey, Catharine, this is Jeff. I'll take the question. So really our competitive sense has always been very diverse. No, there's typically not one competitor that we see in a whole lot of different situations and a lot of that is because of our unique developer first approach. Our developers bring Twilio in to such a wide variety of companies to solve such a wide variety of [Indiscernible] and that leads us into the Company in a way that sounds like a traditional like [Indiscernible]. So many of our deals are like that. So that's the historical of Twilio, and going forward, I'm looking at the new products, our customer engagement platform, which is really a new category
There are products that are needing to be in the market and that's why we're building. And so when I look at what we're building [Indiscernible] Twilio Engage or whether it's the Segment CDP, like the normal and CDP in the market. On top of that, there will be a product that customers have been asking for, which is data first approach to market. And so, I just don't see it as a direct head-to-head, I think we're building something new, both in terms of each of the individual products. I think Flex is different than what's out there in the market, we're solving the problems that customers say they have and that's why we built Flex, same thing with Engage, same thing with Frontline, and these are the pillars really of our customer engagement platform, which as a whole is certainly solving a really unsolved problems for B2C companies. How do I understand my customers and engage with them? And there is a way to solve that problem at a platform level. All right, thanks, I'll ask more on the next call. Appreciate it. The next person to ask the question is Pat Walravens of JMP. You may now ask your questions. Great. Thank you. Hey, Jeff, as we're looking into 2022 and hopefully it's pretty different than 2021 was. I am curious what you think your top two or three strategic imperatives are? Thanks, Pat. So I know I can say we've been really progressing the Twilio engagement platform, our customer engagement platform. And so one of our first priorities this year was making sure that we brought to market Twilio Engage, and [Indiscernible] is a great [Indiscernible] introduction which we gave last week at SIGNAL. I'm also going to really prioritizing the Company, our teams, because we're obviously at the second year of the pandemic. These are difficult times for every team out there. It's really prioritizing those [Indiscernible], the productivity, and the growth of our team
And our team has grown tremendously to push to pandemic. And then of course, our customers, and the customers is evolving under this time, and really spending many new customer challenges. Like sending those customers in our direction to help solve those challenges. So there's the pandemic, [Indiscernible] and the IDFA changes, and Company changes, and just the many things that companies are having to deal with that the world is rapidly evolving. And those companies have to become builders and have to build those relationships with customers, and keep on to be evolving landscape. Those are things that are pushing customers towards us. Giving us a lot of insights about we are dealing with a certain brand. And I've been very focused on that as well. So those are the three big areas, which is our products, our teams, our customers, which is why I think the right things for CEO to focus on. Great, thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Taylor McGinnis of UBS. Please ask your question. Hi, thanks for taking my question. With gross margins flat this quarter relative to last and given all the A2Ps you guys have this quarter, how much of that was potentially driven by a mix shift from slowdown in messaging versus maybe more durable factors and efficiencies that you guys might be seeing? Was that just all mix shift related or is there something else driving that? Hey, Taylor, this is Khozema. I'll take the question. I wouldn't say there's necessarily any one factor. I mean, I think what we're seeing is continued strength in the messaging business. And so there's not really like an underlying story relative to that product set. We continue to feel great about the growth prospects there as they've been over the last first half of the year and certainly in Q3 as well. I think equally we feel very excited about the performance of Segment and we continue to see higher growth in our application services category. Any given quarter means any one of the product mix dynamics or international, or even customers to some degree, are going to influence what the gross margin rate is in the particular quarter. So for now, we're really concentrated on gross profit dollar expansion. And obviously, over time, we do intend to work that gross margin number off [Indiscernible] come from, and mix shift in those [Indiscernible] services and certainly standby our longer-term target of 60% plus gross margins. Great, thanks. Very well. Thanks everybody for joining today. That will end the call for us. I look forward to chatting with you throughout the rest of the quarter. Thank you again for participating.

With all that out of the way, I'll hand it over to Jeff for some opening remarks, and we'll open the call for Q&A. Thank you, Zilli. I am very happy with our 2021 results built on some great outcomes for customers that continue to generate the best-in-class growth for investors that you see today. I've never been more excited about the future of the company than I am sitting here right now. We have an awesome leadership team, a combination of our leading cloud communications platform with Twilio Segment's #1 customer data platform gives Twilio an unparalleled view into the customer journey, setting us up as the company that can truly deliver on the customer engagement platform vision.
We intend to become the software player that digitally connects every business to their customers to introduce true personalized engagement and relationships in the next chapter of the cloud. We're builders. So our work is never done, and I'm incredibly eager to continue building the company in 2022 and beyond.
With that, let's open the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Samad Samana with Jefferies. Congrats on the strong finish to the year. It's great to see the organic growth. Maybe, Jeff, first for you. And just in reading over the prepared remarks, I think the company really did a good job of expressing, moving from just the infrastructure side to as more of the solution layer. I'm curious if you could maybe help us understand how the adoption is going for the more solution-based products that the company is rolling out. And how we should think about maybe the traction changing? I know you guys called that IDFA, in particular, as a driver. Like are we at an inflection where that's accelerating? Or how should we think about the shape of that adoption? Yes. Thank you, Samad. So I think there's 2 parts to that question, which is essentially, first of all, really pleased with how the introduction of our software layer is going. If you think about -- look at some of the customers that we're talking about in our earnings calls, not just this time, but really every quarter, right? We've got great companies. We're adopting Flex, Segment. Like I love the Vertu Motors example that we talked about today, then bringing Flex and Segment together to make a contact center better. If you look at Stripe adopting Flex for their contact center needs. And Flex expanding in Global 2000 financial services company and a Global 2000 automaker and Nubank, many others. And the Invisalign putting Flex for their process.
I mean we can come up with so many customer stories. But really, the answer is that our approach that’s in and up strategy is a great one because Twilio is used by so many companies around the world. Every industry, every shape and size, every continent, I mean, this really is the need for things like e-mail and messaging is so ubiquitous and developers see there’s so little friction. We're able to use those initial wins and that initial traction that we get to move up the value chain, move up work chart and move up the software staff to then go address the things that our customers are trying to solve, whether it's in the contact center, whether it's their sales process, their marketing, inside their products. And that is really what the in and up strategy that we're talking about is all about, leveraging the ubiquity of Twilio across all the different kinds of companies into building this customer engagement platform. From our conversations with customers, they all need because they all have to go build great relationships with their customers. The way to do that is by understanding the customer and then engaging with them. And that's why Twilio is having the leading CDP to understand customers and the leading communications platform, they go engage with them. And this is definitely such a powerful combination.
The second part of your question about IDFA and the tailwind provided by privacy. Look, I think the society is on the right track, right, investing in privacy, testing regulation and laws and things like deprecating tracking tokens that if most consumers knew what had happened on the Internet, they'd be pretty [indiscernible] actually. So we are on the right track. And what this is doing is forcing customers to our customers’ businesses to focus on the fundamental of this -- the fundamental of business. I think about my grandfather, we sold paint at our hardware store in Detroit. And what he has to do is to know your customer and then talk about their business and my money is going to help them, but that's the fundamental of the business, understand the customer and talk to them.
And so by investing in privacy, the companies have to actually use the first-party data there to how people use their product, how people use their website, their mobile app, what they buy, what they return, et cetera, and use all that as signal for how they can digitally engage with their customers and make that experience more personalized and compelling. And so I believe that is a journey. That is a big trend. It’s a whole direct-to-consumer market that’s going, which again it's like 2 sides of the same coin if you will. That means the companies have to build their customer base and then engage them and turn them into repeat happy loyal buyers instead of just turning to customers and acquiring more by buying more ads. This is a big change they’re putting on ecosystem that tells that we and Segment and the CDP and then with the rest of our products helping them follow us. Great. That's very helpful. Maybe just a quick follow-up for Khozema. First, appreciate the additional disclosures and the numbers around organic growth. That was very helpful by you and the IR team. Maybe if I just -- the outlook for getting to profitability in 2023, I know we're still a ways out from that. But can you maybe help us understand what the assumptions are around -- is that going to come on the gross margin line? Or is that mainly because of OpEx leverage or revenue mix? How should we think about what allows the company get to that profitability and what you're assuming in that? Yes. Thanks, Samad. Thanks for the question. Appreciate you asking. So I think it's actually a combination of things, some that will play out in the short term and then others that will kind of play out in the medium to long term. So the way to think about it, I think, at least for the short term is that the improvements are really going to come from operating expenses. And one of the things that I mentioned in my prepared remarks and as we talked about in the past is that we haven't been investing in a number of areas over the last several years.
In particular, what we've been calling out historically has been Flex, enterprise go-to-market, international go-to-market and the core infrastructure. And we expect that rate of cost growth in those areas just starts to moderate basically in the second half of the year. And I think a good example of that is our ERP project, which goes live in the middle of the year. And it's not to say that we're not going to invest in the other areas, we will. But I think the lower -- the rate of growth in those investments there will be a little bit lower than what we've seen historically.
And I would add that up to this point, we really prioritize growth in scaling the company. And I think growth certainly remains the priority for the company, and we actively made that trade-off historically. But I think we're at the point now where we've got enough scale that we can actually start reaping the benefits of that scale and just become more efficient in our cloud operations. And so we see a real efficiency opportunity as we move it out, and we're really confident in our ability for non-GAAP profitability in 2023.
I think over the time, in medium to long term, we do expect improvements in our gross margin line as well. Obviously, that number has bounced around from period to period in the short term, not the trade-off, but would be also actively make because we like the fact that we're onboarding customers and have an opportunity to grow with them. But very consistent with what Jeff said a moment ago, as we onboard those customers and really leverage this in and up strategy and bring them into higher levels of the software stack, I think we have a real opportunity to provide value to customers, and I think that will provide margin improvement for us as a company. And that's why we stand by our 60% plus over time in the gross margin line. Your next question comes from Derrick Wood with Cowen. Nice to see a strong quarter. Congrats. Jeff or Marc, I mean, you guys have been on this journey to build out this kind of CRM suite of applications. You referenced this, in and up motion, and the product portfolio has certainly matured quite a bit. So from a go-to-market perspective, looking in 2022, how are you planning to be more aggressive in this up stack, the up part of the motion? And what would you like to see kick into a new gear in 2022? Derrick. Thanks. Great questions. This is Marc Boroditsky. It is front and center in the way that we are going to market in 2022. We are in the final days of our sales kickoff this week, and the primary objectives that we're enabling the team on are in and up strategy. So leveraging our installed base and access to customers efficiently through e-mail and messaging to sell them more broadly on the vision of the customer engagement platform.
You may remember, we announced the customer engagement platform with SIGNAL this past quarter. It's resonating with customers of all sizes, driven by their desire to take more control over their digital engagement customers. And we are hearing interest across the entire arc, their end consumer engagement, on top of funnel all the way through the long-term loyalty. And so the training we are doing now as we're looking out to 2022, it's supporting our sales team to ensure that they are ready and able to approach the opportunity that we see as significant in the market today. Great. Great to hear. One for Khozema. Could you double-click on the change in your guidance philosophy? How has your approach changed versus what it was before? And I guess what kinds of new insights have you gained or are more comfortable with in order to better predict consumption behavior here? Yes. Great question, Derrick. So as you know, I mean, if we have run a usage case business model. For the most part, we have a little bit of staff in there as well. And I'd say with each passing year, we just had a lot more insight as to the way that customers end up using our platform. And we're just able to better predict usage patterns over time. And so what we end up doing with our FP&A team is basically fine-tuning that forecasting model every year. And as we could collect additional information, we're able to be more granular about the way in which we can do that.
So for Q1, we are refining our earning philosophy basically to provide guidance that is ultimately more consistent not just with actuals, but also to give investors a better approximation of our expected performance. And as you saw in our Q1 guide, we're showing continued growth of 45% to 47% on a reported and then also 32% to 34% organically. I think it was important for us to call that out. That obviously does include Segment now. And we have a lot of confidence that we'll be able to deliver on our 30% plus growth target over the next several years.
And just lastly, I would say, Derrick, that we obviously do get a lot of good feedback from our investors and from our analysts and we take that into account, too. And I think it just provides for a more consistent setup over time. Our next question comes from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Security. Maybe my least here a question to ask on the call but feels worth asking is on gross margin. Clearly the growth is outstanding. The gross margins are stepping back here. It's clear international messaging strength is gearing forward. But how should we think about the tradeoffs and when those can help flatten that trajectory? And maybe secondarily, we saw the Syniverse transaction ended this morning. Is there still a chance you can partner there or comment to improve the core gross margins? Or is that no longer the right way to think about that relatnioship? Yes. This is a great question, Michael. Let me take the second one first, and then I'll answer the gross margin question more fully in a moment. So first of all, with respect to Syniverse, I know there is some press that they're suggesting that we might buy Syniverse. We’re technically not doing that. What you probably did see in some of the press announcement this morning is that the merger agreement between M3 and Syniverse come to a termination as a result of the mutual agreement between those parties. That largely reflects market conditions as they stand today.
The way that, that agreement worked was it did also provide for an alternative path, which is a minority investment in Syniverse. And so that's now the path that we are going to be assuming. The commercial wholesale agreement that we also referenced historically, that’s very much in place. We have a great relationship with Syniverse. It's been very longstanding, and we intend to continue that. And frankly, that partnership gives us a great product for us to be able to leverage in the United States. So I don't really see a significant impact in the near or medium term as a result of any of that, and I just want to provide you a little bit more clarity in some of what has been rewarded in in and up.
With respect to gross margins more broadly, for us, and we've had conversations with you and a number of others in the past, obviously, we have this really, really high-growth messaging business. And we feel great about the way in which that business has been performing. And the way that it played out in Q4 was that our international volumes really took off.
And I mean you're right, that part of the business carries a sort of lower gross margin structurally, certainly relative to some of the other products that Marc and Jeff alluded to. But the messaging business also cranks out really significant gross profits that we like and that we want to reinvest. I think most importantly, as Marc alluded to you is create an installed base which is sort at the door for us to execute are in and up strategy. As you saw on the last page of the disclosures, while all of that is going on, our application services are actually growing at a faster rate. Kind of a good problem that we have is that our messaging business organically also grew 52% last year. And so that's just kind of trade-offs that we want to make. As long as we continue to generate high gross profit, as long as we can generate growth off of application services in Segment, we feel confident that over time we will be able to grow into that 60%-plus range that I talked about earlier, and we have a lot of confidence in that. But in the short term, you will see a bounce around a little bit up and down. And again, in our disclosures, we probably -- we tried to give you some sense of how the A2P fees and stuff like that impact as well. Our next question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Khozema, I'm wondering if you can shed any light on any specific products that are growing materially above or materially below this organic growth level of about 39%. I would imagine Flex, Video, Segment are outpacing. I'm less certain about voice, e-mail, Authy, some of these products. Just curious if you're able to comment on any of the major outliers there? Yes. Mark, appreciate you asking the question. I mean I'm not going to go through every single product and give the breakdown here, but here's what I will say and answer your question. Again, just referencing the last page of our disclosures. If you look at our growth rate over the course of the prior year, we grew our messaging business at incredibly high rates, 52% organically, which, on any basis, it's really super performance. And in spite of the fact that, that part of the business is growing really fast, our application services category, which includes number of those products that you just described a moment ago basically pre-Segment, pre-SendGrid, non-telephony-based cost products, that's growing at a faster rate. The good problem that we have is that, that messaging business as you again can see on that page in terms of its revenue contribution, it's just really big. And so it's going to take some time for that in and up to play out in our financial statements, even though it is playing out very much in the life of our customer base.
Beyond that, you also saw in the prior quarter, Segment has had a fantastic quarter, really significant growth sequentially. Year-over-year obviously, we don't break that out because it was inorganic in the prior period but you can see the sequential was really, really strong. And now that it's in our numbers, we still have a tremendous amount of confidence in that 30% plus over the next 3 years, which, quite frankly, is off a much higher base to be in that since the time that we announced that we can do that. That's very helpful. And as a quick follow-up for Jeff, you had mentioned the in and up strategy. I'm just wondering how rapidly perhaps your R&D investment is shifting toward products that might be sold more to a marketer rather than a developer. For instance, the customer journey insights, the Engage product and kind of the orchestration of messages rather than the delivery of messages. Yes. Thanks, Mark. I mean you can see we've got investments in, obviously, our fortifications products in Segment, the core customer data platform as well as new products we are building above those 2 layers. And the way I think about this which is developers are assisting the sale and for the communications APIs, products like developers can pick up a long way, maybe all the way there but for a marketer or a contact center buyer you're going to have a line of business that’s going to make private purchase. But with Twilio, they get the support of their internal technical teams on the purchase. Meaning the developer, the technical people, they are at the table, telling that this is decision to make like. Yes, that thing that we want to do, we believe we can do it with Twilio. In fact, we've already built the prototype. And that's important to tell. If you [indiscernible] to tell.
As opposed to we're like -- I talked to a lot of our sales leaders and like the yesteryear careers like power companies, they would be selling your line business owner and the line business owner would say, oh, this is great. Can we do this? They turn to their IT team. And the IT team sold it, now for another word, can do it. And so you've got contractors on the technical team.
And I think the magical thing about Twilio is that we can have proponents of Twilio both on the technical side and now with more investment in the sort of application area also in the line of business owners. I think it's a powerful combination and that’s why we are focused so much on winning hearts and minds of developers, bring them into the company and then making them some of our biggest champions as we make our way through in and up chart, point up the value stack of software.
And so we are announcing obviously in both and I also think of the application products that we're building are also very developer-centric in terms of customizability, flexibility, using, really build what companies need is for to those products. We're not trying to provide just a turnkey and like you can't customize the type solution. We are trying to build products that while they do the things you want them to do out of the box, give you ample footprint to go in and turn them into the solution of the company needs for long period of time. You don't get state of the art with something that’s serving your need as markets evolve, as customers demand new things, et cetera.
And I think our approach is as proven by the adoption, by a wide variety of customers, whether they're the young digital disruptors or whether they are Global 2000, Fortune 500 companies, I think we see across the spectrum, this approach is working. Our next question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Congrats. A couple of questions. One, you noted disclosure of having about 36% of the Global 2000. And just wanted to get a sense of is some of your confidence about the 30% growth rate for the next couple of years driven by room that there is within kind of this core customer set or is it by the opportunity to win some of the more of the Global 2000. Just trying to get sense of how much you feel like you've already landed that gives you confidence of that 30% growth rate?
Second question, maybe building on what you just said, Jeff. You've made a compelling argument at SIGNAL about why Twilio is best enabled to help customers on their customer journey versus kind of some of the competitors out there. I guess are you finding with customers that you're even having to do some of this evangelism about why you versus others? Or it's still kind of in its infancy where they're just happy to have a solution that you can provide and give them? Yes. So thanks for the question. Let me take the first part of the 30% plus dynamic, and then I'll have Marc add to that, and then I'll turn it over to Jeff. So in terms of 30% plus, I mean, the reason we have such confidence in our ability to do that over multiple years, it's not just because we have relatively low concentration in G2K. But at the same time, we were able to do a ton of business that's really creative and innovative with digital disruptors as well.
And if you look at the way that the company has evolved over basically since the IPO, like a couple of dynamics have played out, which I think are really interesting and give us the level of confidence that we have in that number. The first is that if you look at the distribution and concentration of our customers, it used to be relatively high. And since then, we've taken on more business in our top 10 while that overall number has consistently shrunk over a number of different years. And so certainly, you have some large companies in that bucket. You also have some digital disruptors in that bucket who were really taking off.
But the real point is that, that rest of customer that we serve is massively wide, which means that we're not overly concentrated in any one customer. We're not overly concentrated in any one industry, and that allows us to grow the scale now.
I'd say the second thing is, is that we've talked a lot about in the call already like our messaging business. But in addition to our messaging business, we sell a lot more other products that we're able to sell into these customers. And so our ability to now kind of go up back with our application services, with Segment, with e-mail, I think, allows for another interesting kind of upsell, cross-sell opportunity that we're able to do as well.
And then I would say the third thing, and we've called this out in the past, is that we obviously have been making an investment in our international go-to-market efforts. We're starting to see that really pay off. You obviously saw a lot of kick-off velocity in the most recent quarter with respect to that investment. And so I would expect to see that continue over time. And obviously, there are a lot of customers out there in the world that we are really eager to serve.
Marc, do you want to add anything to that? Yes. Absolutely. Great question, Meta. Picking up where Khozema left off, the opportunity for us is still very massive beyond our existing footprint. Primarily landing new logos remains an important part of our in and up execution. So landing with SMS or e-mail and then being able to build a trustworthy relationship with the customer, as we've referenced a couple of times. That's a true situation across all of the market segments. And as you pointed out, we still have a majority of the G2K out there where we have opportunity to build that initial relationship.
The second dimension is expanding our footprint for reaching after the full white space of the account. And across our entire base, we have that opportunity to go back to those customers and continue to build our relationship and expand the commercial results that we're generating.
And then lastly, we're recognizing that there are many enablers that are making a difference for us in the market. Like as an example, we power [indiscernible] ISVs. They're selling packaged solutions against product requirements. We have partners. We're helping them to get into more of the base like we are also pursuing with SIs and resellers that are projecting this into other kinds of opportunities like what we shared in our disclosures, in our prewritten statements, we are seeing traction with organizations like BPOs.
We shared with you on the last earnings announcement this relationship with HGS. We recently announced a relationship with our partners and HGS has had significant progress with over 20 of their customers moving over to Flex. Now these are accounts that are relying on a channel strategy, if you will, for us to become adopters of our platform. So we're going to be pursuing growth in all those dimensions. And I think largely, the opportunity is still in front of us. Meta, this is Jeff. I'll answer the last part of your question about to what extent are we evangelizing to our customers. I mean the way I look at it is customers have what they need to accomplish, right? Like they've got their challenges. They've got their market dynamics, their competitive pressures. And what’s leading most companies do is realizing that they need to have these direct relationships with their customers.
When I talk to executives that every kind of company you can imagine, understanding our customer, building that complete picture of the customer and then acting on it to improve the outcome of their business, to spend less on marketing, to spend less on advertising, in particular, to increase their retention rates, to increase their -- or decrease their customer acquisition costs and increase the lifetime value, I mean, these are the metrics that drive executives at pretty much every kind of company.
And I think in oftentimes what happens is the people, the more bottom-up motion that we would have. So the people on the front lines will have to solve these problems and everyone that recognize that Twilio can solve these problems. They bring Twilio in.
And then we follow up with some more top-down education around the market, a new approach. And I think that's working very well with both a bottom-up and a top-down approach to our customers.
I'll share a quick story with you, which is -- which I felt was sort of illustrative of this, which is interesting. We're talking to the CEO of one of our customers, a pretty large company in education space, and they've been using our products, telling them about our engagement platform, and I'll tell you about Flex and Frontline and Engage and all these new products we've been bringing to market over the last several years. And the CEO of [indiscernible] and shared the screen, shared the screen, I'm doing, saying, I just got the report here that says the old way of doing it was monolithic apps and the new way is controllable APIs, Jeff, you're not getting rid of APIs, are you? We're talking like, no, of course not. We're building all this with our own APIs. We're making it so that you can actually go build on top of these platforms and unlock the things that you're trying to unlock by integrating these experiences together and hiring developers, building for your customers. And he's like, okay, okay, I'm glad to hear that.
And it was so interesting to me to hear the CEO of like an education company evangelizing to me the value of APIs, the value of composability that it was more the a lot of these ideas are now widespread, right? Think about the fastest-growing companies in the software and technology space, companies like AWS, like Twilio, like Stripe, I mean these are APIs. These are the building blocks that allow companies to go build the future and innovate with our customers, increase the agility of their company. That is what customers want, and we are able to provide it to them.
And there's always some degree of evangelizing when you are kind of moving the technologies all forward. It's not like we're just selling guacamole and everyone knows what that is. It's just a question of whether you want it for lunch or not. Really, this is technology and how technology is enabling them to build their business, which does take more time and education than just selling guacamole, but I like the business that we're in. Our next question comes from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. I want to ask you maybe 2 questions. First one on -- and I don't know if maybe somebody has already asked this, but I'll try it a different way. When you think about the major differences in the demand drivers between Q3 and Q4, obviously, it was just 2 very different quarters. And Khozema, you mentioned it's a consumption-based business and inherent in that is some volatility. But just help us understand, if you can or if you would, what were kind of the biggest differences? Like what made Q4 just such a great quarter relative to Q3?
And then the follow-up is just how to think about now, particularly with Segment going into the organic bucket, what's the right way for us to think about a model dollar-based net expansion going forward? I know you're not -- that's not a metric you guide to, but any help there would, I think, at least help set the right model framework going forward to better understand the various components. Yes. Alex, those are good questions. Appreciate you asking. I would say in the demand driver space, I mean, there's nothing materially that’s really changed from one period to the next. I mean we talked a lot about the fact that this is a usage-based business. And in being that kind of the business, you're always going to see like a whole bit of an up and down period to period, you are going to see certain customers take off, in certain periods you're going to see a little bit of domestic versus international there.
I say in the most recent period international really took off. And so that was something that, that we feel really good about, obviously, because that's an investment that we've made over a number of different years. But it's not like we're trying to necessarily -- but through the business -- international picked up one period and domestic there's a different way or that one process goes one way or the other. I would just really kind of point to broad based strength across the totality of business. And we feel like the business was really good in Q3, we thought it was really good in Q4 and we really like the set up coming into 2022 and multiple years beyond. So, it's hard for me to really point to like that one thing, I think is really your question, there really isn't one other than we had broad based strength across the business and feel good about the performance.
I think with respect to the way that you should think about Segment getting layered in, we actually have provided separate disclosures for Segment on a year-over-year basis, we have kind of broken out that [indiscernible]. I don't think I'm going to dive into that here today. But I will tell you is that we feel really good about the growth prospects of that business. You can probably get into it and the fact that it was 10% sequentially that we really like the growth trajectory of where it's headed. And I think you probably can take from Marc and Jeff comments that we're seeing tremendous traction with customers there, not just in terms of what we can do and combining it with messaging, but also with respect to combining with Stripe which is really, really exciting. And we think that this sets really, really strong growth prospects going forward. Our next question comes from Will Power with Baird. Yes. A couple of questions. First one perhaps for Khozema. You pointed this out, but international growth clearly accelerated it looks like quite a bit. It sounds like messaging was a big piece of that. I love if there's just any other color as to what the drivers behind that kind of surge in international messaging might have been and what else you might have seen internationally that drove some of that acceleration? Yes. Thanks for the question Will. I’d say there are two dynamics. I think the first is that, [indiscernible] obviously, and we talk a lot about our international market investments. And Marc builds a really great team internationally. And we're really starting to see the fruits of that investment. And you've seen that I think over multiple quarters now, with our ability to grow in international markets. I think the second dynamic is, is that there was one customer in particular, whose volumes really, really took off in Q4 which we felt pretty good about as well, that happens from time to time, too and obviously the gross margin dynamic and all that as well, but feel great about the way the international lends and we continue to stretch over longer period of time. Okay, great. And then maybe for Jeff, just building on some of the other commentary, just looking at your growing strategic position around first party data, the in and up strategy that you've referenced. What are the pieces that you think could bolster that further? I mean, it doesn't necessarily mean anything, but are there natural, tangential areas that further solidify that? And I guess more broadly, maybe, how do we think about kind of the M&A pipeline and appetite here? Yes, appreciate the question. First of all, just sort of like what are the pieces that bolster it? It’s your continued execution. We've got products that create revenue scale, continue to expand very nicely. So when I think about, how are we continuing to make sure our messaging promises best-in-class or email promises best-in-class? Segment, I think is fantastic from bringing customer in. So we've got a lot of best in class products, we've got a lot of pieces. And we're in the process of bringing them together. And so when I think about what is ahead, it’s like we're bringing these pieces together, we've got really three pillars of our engagement platform, we've got engaged with the marketer, which is still very early in the cycle by the way, just announced it in Q4. We've got Frontline which can be used by frontline workers and sales teams and things like that. And then we've got the Flex for the contact center. So clearly, there's a lot of buyers there, there's a lot of TAM there already. And we're continuing to bring those together, bring those products to more and more and more customers.
As far as M&A pipeline, I will give you the answer that I always give because it's true, we always going to have the game board. Because obviously there are acquisitions out there that accelerate our roadmap, we should be willing to do them. But we also of course see a high bar of great companies, great cultures, great products and other things that rich them but we don’t have any particular strategic goal, or we're going after. But of course, like any company of our size, and our balance sheet, we're aware of what's out there. Hey Will I will just add one comment in there which is obviously in current market there may be some attractive opportunities, and we'll be on the lookout. But the reality is we're very, very focused on our organic growth rates right now and want to continue growing the business that we've got. We don't see it necessary to do anything. [indiscernible] bringing on the message earlier. There's speculation that we might, we’re certainly not going to do that. Our next question comes from Ryan MacWilliams with Barclays. Looks like Twilio’s presence in Global 2000 customers doubled since the end of 2020. So congrats. Jeff, I know it's still early, but love to hear about the strategy and expectations behind Engage. And how customers so far, so to come around the idea of using Twilio as their like unified customer engagement platform? Absolutely. I will start with Engage. I mean, the way we see the market is that historically, marketing automation products just focused on running a campaign, right? Gets trained in there, send buttons and you get [indiscernible] open the campaign. And like that's the way they were designed 15, 20 years ago, and they're still a product that most companies use today. But actually, more modern marketing staff is one that is driven not by campaigns but by data, especially driven by a rich set of data about every customer and who they are and serve what message is going to actually resonate most with them.
And looking for, is it just as they open an email, it's like do they make a purchase, do they increase the lifetime value, are they actually more valuable customer? And these are the things like complex type of campaigns, multivariate analysis, like great marketers today are using data in incredibly interesting ways that the legacy marketing software just clearly doesn’t setup to accommodate and that's still an opportunity we're going after. And we're going after a very data-centric approach to marketing. And I believe that many marketers are already there, and we're going to get there. And I think it's already proven out by the traction that the Segment CDP that’s in the market, because the CDP is actually how [indiscernible], into actionable insights to the marketer. The last step is just trying to, it's actually new campaign and that's we're adding on with Engage. But the hard part of that whole equation is the data part. And we already do that or needed diversity of that. So adding actually the marketing execution side onto it, it's actually relatively [indiscernible]. We're excited by the feedback we're getting from the customers, we think that we've got a really novel and attractive approach.
And ultimately at the end of the day, what it is the big budget, we're going after, the legacy part we enjoy today, because that's the marketers budget. But I think that it's where the market is going, and I think we're going to have a unique product at the marker gainer. And we already see traction in the market going on. Your second question Ryan, was it guidance…? No. Just my second one for Khozema. Just pleased to hear about non-GAAP operating profitability for fiscal '23. Just getting some questions here on gross margin. Like I can totally understand how it can vary from quarter-to-quarter. But as we think about the path forward from here, can we think about gross margin being higher on a yearly basis going forward, given the elevated growth in the higher margin application services business? Ryan, this is totally fair question. We're not going to guide on a year to year basis per se on gross margins. But I will say, though, is that we feel very, very good about the progress that we're making an application services, that’s kind of the non [indiscernible] based cross products ex Segment and SendGrid. As you saw our disclosure in the prior years that grew at a much faster rate than our very fast growing messaging business.
So as that trajectory continues, we feel very good about the prospects to get our 60% plus target. To which, I would add, we feel really, really good about the way this segment is going. We feel very, very optimistic about how Engage has already started. And so the combination of those factors I think gives us very high confidence in 60% plus over time. In the meantime, as long as the messaging business that we put on is generating high gross profits, we are comfortable from period to period with that gross margin number about a little bit up and down. But over time, we still feel very good about 60% plus and I think a great track record with investors of delivering what we say we'll do and I think over time we will get to that 60% plus as well. Our next question comes from Fred Havemeyer with Macquarie. Jeff, Twilio's products and platforms certainly expanded a lot since, I think its heritage as a platform and channel to be able to recall people back in 2008. And I wanted to ask, from your perspective as Founder, whenever you put on your coding gloves, and you're thinking about what's exciting on Twilio's platform and what are the products that are disruptive or interesting, or that you would use to build the next iteration of startups and growth businesses, what gets you most excited about what is happening with Twilio here? Well. That's a fantastic question. When I think about it, it really goes back to the mission of our company. If you notice, we updated our mission last year, we talked about it a little bit last year and we will talk about it more in some upcoming venues. But I think our mission really reflects the reason why I and so many at Twilio get out of bed in the morning to unlock imagination of the world developers. And what's so exciting about that mission is that people are, the world that we see today is pretty [indiscernible]. And they're built for thousands and thousands of years. And what you see now happening in the world of software, and the Internet, is people building in a field that was previously unimaginable. A developer or a startup or a company can build a product. And if it builds the right thing, millions or billions of people can become the customers practically over it. And that is a scale of execution. And an idea that I think is underappreciated in the world. That software and the Internet and the distribution mechanisms of the Internet providers, anybody can do. Anybody can unlock a new idea. And that goes for developers, that goes for a wide variety of builders inside of companies, goes to the companies themselves. And I love seeing, when a startup enters the market, it comes out with some great new big ideas. And then the incumbent follow suits, and actually data coming up with big news related. I got a lot of watching news on in the EV market, for example. It's like a Ford, done a great job bringing out whole new EV process, and like [indiscernible]. That is more importantly how the markets evolve and software ultimately becomes this vehicle, no fun intended for companies and people to [indiscernible]. And so it gets me tremendously excited about the products that Twilio builds, is that we get a marked imagination of the builders.
And for so long, companies that they sold, they bought a bunch of apps to power their businesses, an app for this and app for that. So then they had this idea that like, oh, we want to go -- or our customers want this, let’s do that. And once to me you told [indiscernible] we can't do and what I love is giving our customers the path to yes. This idea that we have for how we're going to better serve our customers or help innovate our competition, the answers with Twilio, yes. And that's where APIs that's our platform approach, that's Flex, that's Frontline, that's Engage. That is Segment. This is unlocking the imagination of the world's developers and like the various hands of like marketing and contact centers and messaging. If you take a step back and think about the addressable market of people who build like that the story of humanity and that's where data [indiscernible]. Our next question comes from Matt VanVliet with BTIG. You've kind of touched on parts of this but wanted to maybe bring it together in one cohesive question. When you look at Segment and the rate of adoption across the enterprise, it seems like the idea maybe at the very high end, Jeff to your point of talking to a CEO, it's a great idea. Everyone realizes that they need more data to be smarter and more individualistic in terms of their outreach. But in reality, how many of these companies that you're talking to are ready to implement Segment? How much of sort of a customer education and maturity level is broadly out in the market? And maybe the follow-up to that is, is there potential that you can see this pretty dramatically accelerate over the next couple of years, as companies get a little smarter, maybe our technology a little more up to date across other parts of the organization to really leverage Segment? Marc Boroditsky, great question and I’d say added lens to the earlier question regarding the opportunity just in front of us. The opportunity is to cut across the entire market. We see the interest that comes from small customers all the way to largest customers. And your employees ask, are they ready to adopt? We see requirements started the use case, where literally, you need to be able to connect a couple of detailed real time data sources to be able to have an understanding of the customer, and then provide whatever interaction that's going to take place to progress customer relationship.
So imagine if you will connecting to a CRM, connecting to monitor system, connecting to whatever the app that the company runs the business pm. To be will get to that understanding and then be able to respond in the channel that customer's choice in order to have that, for how to interact. And that has it can be across entire parts of the customer relationship. What we see happen is that we can move from that use case orientation to strategically more and more of their customer requirements. And be able to address a greater set of commercial requirements that position CDP as a strategic part of the way that they think about building expanded relationship.
So, as an example, we shared today, the Vertu Motors example, where they have implemented Segment in order to understand the caller calling in, there is look up and see that there are in fact and the customer that bought from them in the past, because what car they bought and what the digital value is, then prepare the agent to be able to have the right conversation with that customer to be able to more than likely to sell them another car. We're seeing that kind of opportunity for new change, expanded, strategic, full customer lifecycle requirements. And then, I guess on the Flex side of the business. Are you still traditionally going in and replacing or sort of augmenting and building on top of legacy on-prem solutions that have just maybe run their course of functionality? Or are you increasingly seeing opportunities where customers rushed to get anything that was supposedly cloud or hosted at the beginning of the pandemic but now realize that it's, they can't configure it? They can't do actually what they wanted or what they thought it could and are now looking at what Flex and Twilio more holistically can mean as a 5, 10, 15-year partner from a technology perspective? In smaller customers, so I think of this as like getting interests up to a big mark type account. And we do have a fairly healthy portion of the business but it's first real implementation of a contact center type solution, [indiscernible] contact center by the way graduating, they call it their support agent or their customer engagement solution. And as you move up in a larger organization, more legacy implementations are to see a lot more installed base.
We have a fairly healthy augmentation, as we called that in our remarks that people are adding new channels and new capabilities in parallel with their legacy implementation. But we're also winning more and more replacement of legacy implementation. The example that we shared in our prepared remarks regarding Align, which is a great customer example, a very digital oriented business that has a legacy supplier that’s actually facing challenges and the customer was able to rapidly spin up a replacement implementation on Twilio that is now their standard for their requirements going forward.
Now, that's not the way that you're necessarily going to win the business, overall, we're not going to wait for people to fail. We're showing up and helping customers recognize that the next generation of engagement has been satisfied with the legacy player in the way [indiscernible]. And we have many examples that range from Fortune 100 banks to Fortune 100 -- Global 2000 automotive manufacturers that successfully led to meet the full requirements. Matt. This is Jeff and I just try to add one thing, which I thought was interesting, when I was first getting to know Segment, so we hit the acquisition, I was really strong by their penetration into the enterprise. And we had a number of great enterprise customers, speaking about their limitations of Flex. At SIGNAL we have Procter and Gamble a great customer. We had Intuit, the feature of Intuit into a couple of stage talking about their use of Segment across all their properties. We have a Fortune 100 financial services company that announced this quarter that we signed in Q4, banking customer. So we’ve got great enterprise customers who are using Segment already. And so I was struck by how early the need the enterprises have been apparently. When we think about the more complex businesses, more subsidiaries that are, the more brands they run, the more systems that implement, the more the need is for a customer data platform help to make sense of all of it. So I've been really surprised by the traction of acquisition that's already out in the market, that’s interesting. Great, we are out of time. I know there's a lot of folks that still have questions in the queue. We will catch up with you this afternoon. So otherwise, thank you everybody for joining and for the catching up over the rest of the quarter. This concludes today's conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Twilio First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.
Bryan Vaniman, SVP, Corporate Development and Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Thanks, Emma. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Twilio’s First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Our prepared remarks, earnings press release, investor presentation, SEC filings and a replay of today’s call will be found on our IR website at investors.twilio.com.

And with that, I’ll hand it over to Jeff for some opening remarks. Then we’ll open the call for Q&A. Thanks, Bryan. We delivered another strong quarter of results and continue to execute against our long-term strategy to build the world’s leading customer engagement platform. We remain confident in our ability to deliver 30% plus annual organic revenue growth through 2024, and we’re committed to delivering annual non-GAAP operating profitability starting in 2023.
To achieve this goal, we’ll continue to make the necessary investments in 2022, which will put us on a solid trajectory to deliver against our growth and profitability targets over the coming years.
And as you likely saw in our prepared remarks and press release, we are really excited to welcome former Twilio Board member, Elena Donio, as our President of Revenue. Elena is a remarkable executive and a leader with deep knowledge of the Twilio business, our market, our value proposition and our culture having served on our Board since 2016.
Elena has extensive experience leading massive growth and scaling go-to-market activity as the former CEO of Axiom and the former President of SAP Concur. Elena will help Twilio to its next phase of growth, and I’m thrilled to officially welcome her to the team. And of course, I want to thank Marc Boroditsky for his partnership and contributions to Twilio over the last 7 years. And lastly, May the Fourth be with you all.
With that, let me open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Perfect. Just maybe starting on the CRO transition. Could you just give a little bit more background of what the thinking behind that was? And just given kind of recent management changes, any continuity kind of efforts or considerations that you had in making that change? Maybe as a first question, and then I have a follow-up. Absolutely, Meta. So look, I’ve had continuing and ongoing conversations with Elena throughout the years as she was considering her next operating role and about the opportunity to get her more actively involved in Twilio’s leadership team. And we’re incredibly fortunate that with Marc’s intended departure, we have the perfect person to step into the role and a perfect role for her given her experience. And she was already tremendously familiar with the organization, the team, the people involved, the opportunity, our customers, et cetera.
And look, I always believe when you have an opportunity to bring on a world-class leader of Elena’s caliber, like you jump at the chance to do so. In addition to her tremendous insights into our company, the culture and products from her time on the Board, she obviously brings a wealth of direct experience in software, in SaaS, in go-to-market, in products and scaling organizations while managing costs through a period of rapid growth. And those are all the things that we’re focused on doing.
So I’m extremely excited to have Elena to join the company as President of Revenue and in the latest forward in our go-to-market efforts. And by the way, I’m incredibly grateful to Marc for his enormous contributions in Twilio over the years. Got it. Appreciate that. And as a follow-up, I mean, clearly, you guys have noted in the past that there would be quarter-on-quarter kind of volatility in the organic growth rate in that, that growth may not be 30% in any given quarter. But just any trends, Khozema, that you think are worth noting in just the Q2 guidance that may be caused the sequential downtick in growth or in a sequential growth rate? Meta, not really. I mean I think the big thing to keep in mind here is that the 30% organic target is obviously on an annual basis, and we’ve been pretty consistent about communicating that. And then last year, in Q2 ‘21 that we had a really, really strong organic growth quarter at 50% year-over-year. So as we look at the second quarter at 36% to 38% reported and then 27% to 29% organically, we feel pretty good about Q2. And then as we look out for the balance of the year, we see a more favorable set of comparisons as we go through the second half. And so we do feel good about 30% for the year, and we also feel pretty good about 30% for 2023 and 2024, as we’ve communicated previously. Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Jeff, I'm curious if you could give us some thoughts on the broader environment. Obviously, there's been a lot of volatility in rates and customers' propensity to deploy tech or maybe that has not changed. Give us your state-of-the-union perspective on how customers are prioritizing investments in Twilio. And also secondly, it's laudable to see the company gear more towards operating leverage, et cetera. What are the things operationally that Twilio has determined that will provide sources of operating leverage in the future? That's it for me. Yes. So Kash, this is Khozema. There's a couple of things in there. Why don't I start? And then if Jeff has anything to add, you can comment as well. So just in terms of the macro, I think that's where you started. I think, obviously, if like the economy were to dip into like some sort of significant recession, we're not necessarily immune from that. But what we see based on both our internal studies, and we alluded to the customer engagement report as well as a number of external studies, is that digital transformation remains a top boardroom priority. That obviously benefits Twilio as a variety of companies look to invest in their engagement strategies going forward.
And we're not -- it's not like we don't see the macro environment, whether it's economic or geopolitical, but we just think this business is extremely well positioned to capitalize on ongoing company's digital transformation efforts. And despite impacts that we see that are inflationary, whether it be supply chain, which we talked about in the past, or labor inflation more recently or interest rates, as you mentioned, we've built those impacts into our models. We also have the benefit of having a really strong balance sheet, which obviously helps in these environments.
And as I said in the prior question, we feel good about our guidance at 30% plus revenue growth through 2024, and again, about non-GAAP annual profitability -- or operating profitability in 2023.
More to your question on the profitability because I think that's where you ended. What we've been saying really over 3 years is there are a number of investments that we felt were very important to make. And these were planned investments. And in general, they were in Flex, our go-to-market capabilities, obviously, more recently, with Segment as we see that as a crucial piece of our customer engagement stack. And we're kind of coming to the peak periods of growth in those investments. And it's not like we're not going to invest going forward, but the rate of cost growth in those investments is going to be lower than where we've been historically. And so slowing that cost growth, I think, will be the way that we end up getting there into the non-GAAP profitability for next year. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo. Gross margin saw a meaningful improvement sequentially. The prepared remarks still referenced just some near-term fluctuation potential. Just in sort of adding some more context around that. I guess the question is just why wouldn't that be at least somewhat bottoming if we're looking at sort of a point in time where U.S. growth is moderating? Some of these 10DLC impacts are playing through. Are you at all comfortable that gross margin can at least remain around a similar ZIP code regardless of our messaging mix plays through? Or anything else you could just provide to help us think through normalization of what these fluctuations can look like? Yes. That's a good question. I mean I think with respect to the gross margins in Q1, we are obviously happy with them improving to 53%. I think, Michael, the thing I'd encourage you to keep in mind is that just the size and scale of our messaging business is what tends to drive it. And so that's why we're kind of signaling some level of fluctuation in gross margins in the near term. I think it'll be in the ZIP code. I mean I'm not going to be prepared to call the bottom or anything like that. But I'd also remind you that we like the messaging business a lot. And while it does carry that lower gross margin, it also generates a lot of gross profits that we reinvest back into the business.
And we've spent some time over the last few quarters talking about this in and up strategy, and messaging still serves as that important foot in the door with our customers so that we can execute on that in and up. And obviously, on those deals, we evaluate everyone on those opportunities, looking at whether or not they're going to drive lower gross margins and making sure that there's real strategic value there.
I think the flip of all of this is that our emerging software business continues to grow at elevated rates and obviously does carry significantly higher gross margins. And as we think about like our long-term targets around 60% plus over time, we continue to see a lot of tailwind there, and we continue to like the software businesses quite a lot. And we just have to continue executing on that up strategy that we've been talking about sort of for the last several quarters. Yes. That's all really useful. And then I think great to see Elena coming off the board onto the field. Can we just go back to just how you keep continuity in making that change midyear? Are there any near-term changes we should expect? Or how should we assess the transition there? It looked like sales and marketing spend maybe ticked down a touch sequentially. So if you can just kind of hit on those, I think that's also useful. I will answer a few of the lens of maybe go-to-market results. And then I'd love for Elena to maybe just introduce yourself and provide some of her own comments. But I think in short, we don't really expect the transition to have much of an impact certainly on the short term. And I think in the long term, we certainly anticipated that Elena is going to have a very positive impact on the business.
Right now, look, we've got a great team in place. That go-to-market leadership team is very strong. We have a clear plan for execution. The results that we've already seen in Q1 are a good setup for the rest of the year. And as I said, I mean, I think with Elena coming on board, I'm very excited personally, and I think she's going to have a really positive impact. I think her track record speaks for itself and -- to bring a person of her caliber on to the management team is really lucky on our part.
But let me maybe just turn it over to her for a moment, and she can tell you a little bit more about how should be thinking about things. Thanks, Kho. Michael, nice to meet you. Having served on the Board for the past 6 years, which was just really the ride of a lifetime, I have become really familiar with the company. But with all that as a backdrop and knowing our products, our sales motion, our customers, our team from the Board lens is quite different from knowing it from an operating lens. And so I look forward to bringing my own background, skill set and lessons learned to the team but also doing a ton of listening and learning, particularly in the early days. I've spent my whole career driving operations and hopefully, delivering operational excellence, growth and scale. I see a huge opportunity to bring that capability into the company. We start with a fantastic team. I'm really, really proud of everything they've done in the past and the Board role in that, but I think the road ahead is perhaps even more exciting.
I'll also say I'm actively engaged with many of our team members, customers, even investors. And so I feel like I have a pretty good perch to sit from, but I'm also really excited about continuing to learn from here, to meet the rest of the team, to congratulate them on all of their accomplishments historically, but also to jump on the ride with them from here and envision a great future as the leader in customer engagement. Your next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JP Morgan. And forgive me, I joined a minute or 2 late, if in case it's redundant. But last quarter, you had mentioned some domestic friction on the ADP registration side. Could you just describe that a little? And I'm trying to understand if the friction is kind of solely related to the onboarding process versus anything about the fees themselves? And then was there a deadline for customers to get that done during March? And I have a quick follow-up. Yes. Mark, this is Khozema. Good to hear from you. So the growth slowdown just kind of domestically generally and the friction associated with 10DLC was really to do with the onboarding process for both new and existing customers. And it does create some friction in the short term, but over time, creates a lot more trust on our platform. And as a result of some of the friction that we saw, we have built a number of features to make that registration process more seamless for our customers. And the majority of our traffic has now been able to get through that registration process. And so we believe that that's behind us.
With respect to your question about a deadline, there was a deadline, and that was March 1. And I think now with that behind us and the majority of our traffic, also having completed that initial process, we do expect domestic messaging to normalize through the balance of the year. And then just a quick one for Jeff on the topic of 2-way messaging. In the past, I believe you said that it's still early days. And so now you've got another quarter under your belt. You've got the conversation with API and the front-line product developing. Do you see any more activity? Or is there any kind of a backlog building perhaps in terms of 2-way messaging? Yes. Thanks, Mark. I think that there's a tremendous opportunity as I've long said in Twilio messaging. And first of all, the interesting thing is that the one-way messaging where like the world and the market has been for the last decade or so, it's actually a great place to be opening the door for 2 ways. So it's a great lead in to all those customers who are using messaging for alerts and notifications and all that kind of stuff. Like it just invites you to apply. And then the question of the company has is, okay, when you want to talk to us? What are we going to do about it?
And increasingly, companies are saying, look, our customers want to talk to us? Are we actually trying to ignore them? Are we actually going to say a customer that wants to talk to us. We're just going to give radio silence or given some automated apply that says call us? Or are we going to listen and pay attention to our customers? In fact, customers wanting to be out to us, like, how on others in the business, we pay advertisers to get customers who want to talk to us. And then over here, we're ignoring them. And so it just makes a ton of sense that you would open the door for these 2-way conversations.
And we're seeing it like in certain markets like financial services, right? You saw the large fine lobbied against one of the major banks because they were doing noncompliant 2-way messaging. Okay, that whole industry has now taken attention to this matter. Other ones like retail, clienteling -- and we've got a lot of customers that we've planned to over the history of using us for that, whether it's companies like Nike who use Flex to allow their salespeople, they call math leads in the stores. They will talk to customers who are in the app or on the website, saying, hey, I want an expert advice. And you see a lot of opportunities there. And that's why we're investing in the product road map that we are because we are hearing from companies that, yes, like engaging you're not 2-way conversation is really the future of how they're going to build a real relationship with their customers.
And so you're right, conversations is -- the API layer is the substrate to connect the dots between multiple conversations, whether they're multiple parties in the conversation, where they're occurring over different channels like SMS and WhatsApp and Facebook and even voice and things like that, combine them all together. And then we express conversations through our products in Flex, in Frontline and elsewhere so that companies could start to see the true line of all of these different points of contact in the company with their customer as one long-running conversation.
At the end of the day, by the way, that's what we see it as a consumer. When you're on the other end of it, you see it as one conversation with this company. Yes, they might see it as well. I got 20 departments and 50 people, and everyone -- they're like, well, that's your customers care about that. They actually just care number 1. If they try to talk to you, are you there listening? And number two, is it a coherent conversation? Or is it completely destroyed across a bunch of different phone numbers and shortcuts, all sort of software or does it make sense? And that is the really big opportunity, and we've been investing in that for a while.
And I think we see increasingly more and more companies are adopting. Actually, I'll give you a customer example that I experienced just a couple of weeks ago. And I can't tell you who it is, but it's a company that sells a musical gear. And I placed an order at this company, and they're a Twilio customer, a really cool company. And when that could shift, I got a text message from my salesperson. They said, hey, Jeff, I just wanted you to see that your package shipped. It was really cool. And I was showing actually somebody this example. I was like, is this new. And somebody said, what happens if you reply? I don't know, it seems like it's from a person. Let's find out. Started replying with like some question. I feel bad I was wasting his time. But I look see, I asked him a question and sure enough, turn around right got back to me. Oh yeah, I can help you with that, sent me some links, some blog posts about how to setup this and that. I'm like, look at that. It's amazing, amazing customer experience.
And now I've got a person I can talk to at this company, and I'm telling everybody, including everybody listening to this call now, about the amazing customer experience company has. So yes, I think the 2-way messaging is fantastic, whether you're buying a mortgage, a banking product, a musical instrument or a snorkel. Maybe you can play us some music some time. You don't want that. You'd rather go snorkel -- Your next question today comes from the line of Derrick Wood with Cowen. Jeff, I guess for you, first. You guys have seen a lot of leadership change over the last year. It sounds like there is a little bit of increased attrition in the quarter in Q1. We've seen this certainly from many companies that have scaled so quickly and have to evolve into a much larger organization. But just curious, have all these changes been -- had any disruption kind of looking backwards or looking near-term forward? And then as you just look at adding kind of headcount and backfilling some of the attrition in Q1, what are the plans in terms of investments for the rest of the year? Thanks, Derrick. I'll answer the question about the executive. And I think it's a fair question. you never like to see executive turnover for sure. And attrition is elevated across the market aside of this Twilio. It's not just tech. It's actually the entire economy, basically, and you see it probably, and especially true in companies that are growing as quickly as Twilio is. And so in some ways, it's the reality we're all living in every company, but it's also a reality for any fast growth company.
But what I really look at is that we have been consistently able to attract incredible leaders to Twilio with highly relevant expertise necessary to take the company to the next level. And that's what we are always doing as we grow the company and very appreciative of the leaders that have gotten us to where we are, but also looking forward to leaders who are going to take us where we go. And you can do both those things at the same time.
And Elena brings a tremendous wealth of direct experience in software, in SaaS, in building go-to-market and in product and in scaling organizations while managing costs through rapid growth. And like, look, these are all the things that we are doing right now and that we are going to be doing for the coming years.
And so look, I'm incredibly excited to have her driving our go-to-market efforts going forward. And look, I always -- it's always bittersweet, right, when you say go by to an executive. You've been in the trenches. You work with faults, but you also then really look forward to the people coming in or here to bring you where you're going. And I've been running Twilio for 14 years. So like, yes, I've seen groups of executives come in, help me build the company to where we are today, a $3.5 billion revenue company, growing very quickly. And it's just sort of part of what happens when you grow a company incredibly quickly. No doubt, you've had incredible growth. That makes a lot of sense. Real quick, Khozema, for you. I know we're not getting specific numbers on application services, but anything to share in terms of how growth trended or how that performed against expectations? And anything to share around the efforts and training -- the broader sales force around Segment? Yes. I mean, I'd say, in general, it's kind of a repeat of what we've talked about in the past, which is we feel really, really good about the Segment product. We feel great about the performance of it. And certainly, that team has been really, really additive to the long-term success of Twilio.
More specific to your question, that software category more generally has been growing at elevated rates. And obviously, based on the margin profile, we clearly like that a lot. And that certainly underscores our faith that we can get to our long-term gross margin targets of 60% plus. And I think having as many people trained up on the product as we possibly can, obviously, should accelerate its growth over time. So feel really good about where we are with Segment, and it's going to be really important to us as we build out our customer engagement leadership. Your next question comes from the line of Samad Samana with Jefferies. I guess first one for you, Khozema. When I think about the disclosure on 4Q, the international versus U.S., and I go and put that mix back in, I'm just curious how we should think about the gross margins. I don't want to re-litigate 4Q necessarily, but usually, the U.S. domestic higher gross margins than international. So I'm just curious if it was not mix, maybe was there something else that we should think about for the 4Q gross margin pressure? And then I have a follow-up for Jeff. Yes. It's -- Samad, it's a fair question. So maybe first off, just to kind of own what happened, there was a discrepancy in the mix of that domestic versus international revenue, and it should have been caught in Q4. Luckily, it was caught as we ran the closing process in Q1, and we noticed the discrepancy then. We have put in place some additional analytics as well as some additional controls to make sure something like that, that doesn't transpire. But I did want to own it before answering your question.
In terms of that split, the way that we provide the disclosure, that split is based on the IP address or the mailing address of a customer at the time that they register with Twilio. And so effectively, it's something that we used for reporting purposes, but it's not actually how we manage the business day to day.
And I mean, Samad, you know the business pretty well. Like where we focus tends to be on where those messages actually terminate, and we continue to see very strong growth in messages that terminate outside of the U.S. And if you go back a couple of years SIGNAL, when we did the Investor Day, we showed them that, that split is about 50-50, and it's continued to grow from there. And that tends to be the much more significant impact on gross margin. Obviously, there is some correlation between destination messaging as well as what the customer origin is, and it can deviate obviously from period to period. But that's the gist of why that commentary from Q4 remains true today. That's really helpful. And I definitely appreciate the additional clarity there. I think that clears a lot of it up. And Jeff, I want to follow up with something that Khozema touched on, which is the knowing the business and look -- at the end of the day, the growth is still very strong and on big numbers. So I guess when I think about the company and the growth going forward, what are the maybe go-to-market changes that you think are going to happen? Or are there go-to-market changes that are anticipated in kind of reiterating that 30%-plus guidance or higher? How should we just think about it based on the changes in the management team? Thank you, Samad. Why don't I have Elena answer that question? Thank you. So first of all, I'd say a lot is going well. Like we really like our long-term growth trajectory, and I tend to continue along that trajectory. And so when I think about how I spent my first couple of months, first and foremost, it's obviously about getting to know the team and customers more deeply so that I can internalize their aspirations and really get to know them as we have our plans. But I would say there's a couple of really important short-term priorities that go along with that.
Number one is accelerating software growth, especially Segment and Engage once launched. Number two is calibrating our resource model explicitly towards the greatest efficacy possible. And so that means nurturing our product-led growth engine that we've built over time in messaging, but also amping up our direct and channel sales capabilities and software. And lastly, doing both of those things while driving additional operating leverage and go-to-market overall so that we're ultimately paying off the investments we've made over the past number of years. Your next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Maybe, Jeff, I'll start with you on Twilio Engage. Can you be, first, perhaps a little bit more specific on timing? When is that finally going to be available? And any color you can share with regards to the trial activity with customers? How should we think about traction and adoption here once it's out? Thanks, Ittai. So first of all, timing, we're looking at GA and Engage in the second half of the year, and second is on the -- what are we learning from our early customers. And as you know, you bring a new product into a market. You do it as a beta format, and you bring on your handful of early customers. And they help you guide the road map, and they tell you where to be focusing. And so we have great feedback from the early customers of Engage, and we actually have more customers requesting data access and we can accept. And that's always a good sign. But we've been receiving great feedback from those pilot customers and are taking the steps -- responding to feedback, really understanding the problems they want to solve with Engage and making sure we're building the product, the list them solve their problems uniquely.
And look, I think Engage is filling a hole in the market with a platform that is built to help B2C companies, in particular, first of all, really understand their customers in terms of data and then execute on that understanding by personalizing every part of the journey and like empowering the employees with these Engage apps we're building.
And so when I think about what Engage is doing, it is taking a data-first approach to marketing. And that is the modern way companies are marketing, especially in this whole privacy-forward world where you don't have -- you can't do the lazy thing with third-party anonymous cookies and IDFA and just kind of turning through customers that you bought on an advertising platform. Really, modern marketers are saying, I need to understand my customer. I need to personalize the journey that, that customer is on and pay really good attention to them so that they become loyal, happy repeat customers. And so those are the types of companies that we are seeing early on in our pilot who are resting access because they're saying, look, here's the tools out there to do this are not what we need. And so Twilio's filling this gap.
And look, in the fullness of time, I think all marketing is going to go this way. I think every marketer is going to, first of all, be spending money on having the best data, which is where all of the starts, and then going to me to have a platform that really is about activating data as opposed to like blindly sending campaigns and just measuring, well, how many people want to subscribe. I think those days are over.
And the other neat thing about using data as the basis for the marketing tool is that you can optimize for the outcome of the business care spot because Segment sees the flow of data from a variety of systems. We can tell the marketer not just, like this campaign, you got this many opens and there's many clicks. Nobody gets -- companies don't make money with opens and clicks. They make money by big sales. And Segment sees that, too. So they can say, hey, this campaign resulted in this amount of dollars of sales. This campaign is working. This one is not. That's amazing. And so you think about the value proposition you'd be able to give to a company and to the marketer who now can justify the spend on that tool because they're saying, look, we're making money on it. So I think it's a really great value proposition. But obviously, still early in the life cycle of that product, but we anticipate bringing it to GA in the second half of the year. Okay. That's great. And then a follow-up for you, Khozema. Just on the gross margin again. Great to see the progress. I'm just trying to tie that to the registration date, March 1, where I think you talked about you expect messaging to normalize. I assume that, that means that around that date, messaging was somewhat depressed because some customers were not registered – and so is that stick into the second half of the year political activities part of your adjusted gross margin, and that clearly is going to come at a higher volume in the second half of the year. And you also have normalization around the messaging volumes in the second half of the year. So should we not expect any incremental perhaps gross margin improvements between now and year-end just because messaging, some -- these 2 elements are going to inflate messaging volumes in the second half of the year? Is that the right way to think about things? Yes, Ittai. I think if all of that broke our way, it's possible, but it's certainly not something that we're necessarily forecasting. As you know, I mean, we don't guide on gross margins. I would say the factors that are really going to drive it more than anything are going to be just the way that the messaging business kind of fluctuates up and down. I mean it's just -- it's so big, and the scale of it is such that it really tends to be the principal driver.
And based on what I said in the prior question, the way that those messages end up terminating and who drives that traffic and how that all plays out, I mean, it's a fairly complex mix of things. And so I think it's going to be in the ZIP code, but it's not something that we're guiding to today. Your next question comes from the line of Joe Goodwin with JMP. Great. I think that might be me, Pat. Elena, I have a question for you. Just I would love to hear any sort of learnings that you have from your time at Concur or some of the other boards you're on or other companies that you think might be relevant and might be things you can apply at Twilio. Yes. Thanks for the question very much. I hope there's a lot of learnings. I started at Concur when my Bellevue startup was acquired in 1998. And so saw some amazing years from the early 2000s of the dot-com boom and bust through to 2008 and all of the products and kind of market transitions that went along with that. So moving the company from on-premise, shipping CDs to a SaaS company from a company focused on sort of a Web front end to mobile, from a company that sold one product that's reporting to one that sold travel invoice management and a whole host of others and ultimately became a platform company while growing overseas, growing into the U.S. federal government, growing downmarket.
So certainly have seen a lot of different transitions and take a lot of lessons away from that, including moving into the President role when we were acquired by SAP in 2014, and all of it came with a period of intense change for our people. And so maybe those are some of the things that I think I pride myself on the most is sort of navigating a period of fantastic growth, but equally embracing our people, making sure we're thinking about careers and growth and the human side of leadership. So I'm excited to bring as much of that as I can to the process.
In terms of other boards, Twilio was a great learning ride for me over the last 6 years, and I think it's given me an interesting unique lens into the business. But that lens will shift as I move into this new operating role.
Lastly, I'd say I think board work in general, I do still sit on a number of other private boards, and I think that board work in general just keeps me in the mix, hearing from other boards, other investors, other leadership teams, building other products that I think are both interesting as opportunities to learn from. And so I’m excited about that. I'm excited to continue to do that work and bring the best that set of learning into the sort of house to Twilio, but also vice versa, I hope still be a mouthpiece in the industry as I learned here from all the wonderful talent that will be around me here in this building virtually. Your next question comes from the line of Frank Havemeyer with Macquarie. Close. Fred Havemeyer. So I wanted to firstly ask -- we've discussed a couple of the executive changes that have happened within Twilio recently. And I noticed that recently, you made a couple of actually 2 prominent privacy and trust-related hires. So I just wanted to ask, what is the importance of both privacy and trust to Twilio as you're expanding globally and also perhaps as you are navigating the inherently trust-based environment of 10DLC policies? Yes. Go ahead, Jeff. Fred, this is Jeff. I'll answer it. Look, I mean, with privacy and trust, I mean, this is the just some of the most important concepts of our era, right, for companies to be investing in privacy and, obviously, trust with their customers. And it's -- as I think about privacy in particular -- we talked a lot about privacy and how it's changing the way companies acquire and serve and build relationships with our customers. And the privacy landscape is really changing the nature of like advertising companies and like where the revenue is coming from. I think you see some of that coming through in earnings. I think that you see the way companies go about building their customer bases. I think about it every time I go to a website, and you agreed with that dialogue. It's like do you want to sell your personal information or not? Can you click no? And then you've got like 3 layers of like, yes, please don't sell my not private information, you’re like, [indiscernible]. And like this is really the world we have. This is getting in a way in that we wins growth is the fact that the privacy landscape and the way companies have to navigate it to do it their testers lot, not just the government, is incredibly complex. So not only is Twilio obviously doing that for our own customers and our own employees and everything like -- the things that every company is doing to comply with privacy, but we're also building products that are helping our customers through this like Segment.
Think about what Segment does. They help companies understand their customers better so that they don't have to rely on third-party shenanigans and cookies and all this kind of stuff and navigate the IDFA changes that Apple has brought about because, a, the platforms are dictating it and, b, consumers want a world where the privacy is respected. People are going to be tracked across the Internet. And so this is one of the largest shifts that's gone on since the Internet became out a vehicle for business, honestly.
And so helping not only Twilio navigate that, but helping us help our customers navigate that is incredibly important. So Amy is going to lead the team responsible for navigating this complex -- compliance program and the privacy regulations and the shift of this utterly enormous changes on the Internet works. And now I suppose it'd be the analysts asked the M&A question, but you have a solid positioning on your balance sheet. Just wanted to ask with the valuations having compressed in this market, generally, how is Twilio thinking about its M&A appetite? And then as a kind of related question, could you give any update on where or how the Syniverse relationship is progressing? Fred, this is Khozema. Let me take the second part first. In terms of Syniverse, I think subject to the closing conditions of the agreement, we do anticipate closing that transaction by the end of May. I think that's probably what you're getting at. And the relationship with that organization remains great, and we think that will be an important part of how we go forward certainly in the messaging business.
Relative to M&A more broadly, I mean, you're right that we do have a very strong balance sheet. We're certainly going to remain opportunistic. And we look and evaluate different opportunities all the time and maintain a game board.
I think if something comes along and we feel like it's a good fit, and we'll certainly take a look, but there's nothing necessarily imminent planned at this time. And that's really all about that I can say about it. Your next question comes from the line of Matt Stotler with William Blair. I guess just one. Kind of looking at your application services, but specifically Flex and Segment, so I mean, just kind of looking at the overall trends in the market and what we're seeing and kind of spending intentions and what's happening with customers and partners, I mean, it seems like we're setting up for a pretty interesting year for Flex in terms of opportunities, right? Obviously, it's been growing quickly. But it seems like we're in a particular advantageous position right now. So I'd like to maybe just get some color or just expand thoughts on how that pipeline is developing. Any thoughts on kind of the year for that? Obviously, I'm not asking for product guidance, but more qualitative.
And then in terms of how it relates to the CDP, what kind of interest you're seeing in bundling there? And if the addition of Segment is kind of having a pull-through effect as you're looking at the ramp of Flex over the course of this year. Yes. Thanks, Matt. This is Jeff. I'll answer the question. Look, we're really excited with the progress we're continuing to make with Flex. And we continue to see really great traction with customers, and in particular, pay attention to the customers that we call out on our earnings calls. You see a really nice selection of companies in different verticals, different sizes, everything from like the digital disruptors all the way up to like enormous Fortune 500, Fortune 100 legacy, legacy gen companies. And so you see a really great set of customers who are the adopters of Flex.
And we consistently hear from companies that -- and the thing is the legacy solutions really just can't provide the flexibility or the channels that they need to address customers in the digital world today. And this is why we remain so excited about the traction of we’ve seen with Flex and the opportunity ahead of us.
I mean we're seeing customers take Flex on like for the first time like Compass was the one we talked about in the prepared remarks today, but we also see companies expanding their use cases like a Global 2000 financial services company, a Global 2000 automaker, I mean, these are companies we've referenced on prior earnings calls. And so overall, our traction is strong.
We're just scratching the surface of what's possible also with our partner ecosystem. And we've talked about the partners we brought on Board to help accelerate our go-to-market to actually take it into verticals and take it into different types of segments of the market. So we're really excited about the market we're addressing here. We think it's an amazing opportunity for the partner ecosystem that we're building, for the direct customers we're serving.
And I love the fact that we're seeing -- look, you've got your digital disruptors. You've got your enterprises. You've got everything between all around the world also, if you notice, using Twilio and -- or using Flex in particular. And so I think those are the [trends] I have seen, which is you're hitting a broad market need, and you see a great set of customers helping you that way and proving out your hypothesis. That's what we see. Your next question comes from the line of Taylor McGinnis with UBS. Another one on gross margin. But when we think about -- or when we look at the 1Q sequential increase, is there any color you can provide on how much of that would have been driven by maybe a recovery in domestic growth versus Segment and some of the other high-margin businesses becoming a bigger portion of the mix? And I guess, too, as we look ahead, based on what you're seeing today, any thoughts on the mix of messaging versus customer engagement in the revenue line and how that could evolve just given the tough comp that there is in 2Q and then easier compares as we get throughout the year and how that might just be influencing your view that gross margins could stay in the ZIP code? Yes. Taylor, this is Khozema. So a couple of questions in there, so let me just try to unpack it a bit. So in terms of just the comp set for Q2 and then the second half of the year, I mean, I was really alluding to the business in total there, not any specific pieces, Q2 relative to last year. Last year was a 50% organic growth quarter. And so therefore, that's why we guide the way that we did for Q2 this year, whereas the second half next year provides a more favorable setup for the back half of this year. And that's why we continue to feel great about our 30% plus guidance for the year.
In terms of the margins themselves that are kind of underneath that, looking at sequential Q4 to Q1, I mean, I think, obviously, we're happy with what inspired. But in our business, just given the relative size of messaging, most things are driven by various fluctuations in the way that various accounts are behaving in that part of the business what are they terminating, what their margin rates are, what have you. And so the mix of messaging tends to drive kind of the mix of Twilio more broadly.
And as I alluded to earlier, we were comfortable with the gross margins of that business. We love the gross profit that it throws off. We reinvest those profits. And probably most importantly is that messaging provides a very interesting entry point for us into customers. And we just make sure that those deals hurdle in a meaningful way that the margins that they provide are not just accretive, but also strategic relationships.
In terms of the software components of the business, as I said, we still feel really, really good about Segment. You heard Jeff's comments a moment ago about Flex and the energy that we have around that product. And that part of the business and other application services, too, continue to grow at elevated rates that do carry higher gross margins, as you said.
And I think as we go over time, we feel great about our longer-term gross margin guidance of 60% plus. And it'll take some time given the size of messaging, but we do anticipate that, that mix shift happens over time. And we gave you some indication of that in our disclosures in the prior quarter. Your next question comes from the line of Ryan MacWilliams with Barclays. So we heard from some customers that there could be a price increase this month on Twilio U.S. SMS. If this is the case, like this looks like the first price increase in recent memory in the U.S. So how should we think about maybe the thought process behind that, if that's true? And maybe what this can mean for U.S. rev growth? I didn't hear the last part of your question, Ryan. What could it mean for what? U.S. rev growth? U.S. revenue growth, is that what you said? Yes, yes. So yes, it is true. We did update SMS pricing in both the U.S. and Canada to reflect our underlying costs as well as continuous improvements to our infrastructure and software and to provide trusted and reliable global messaging. The price changes that we put through; they'll take effect on the 11th of May. And it doesn't affect our customers who were locked into a fixed price, and we don't necessarily expect a material impact on our results in the short term. And we're still evaluating whether or not additional price increases make sense in other products. But we obviously are in an inflationary environment. And so it felt like it made sense to us given the value that we offer to customers, the technology and just given the current environment. I just follow up really quickly. Just on the first quarter rev line. The $10 million beat to the high end of your guidance revenue, is this kind of in line with your commentary on what you were thinking last quarter about like a new guidance philosophy going forward around guidance? Yes, pretty much. I mean, as we mentioned, we did refine our guidance approach. We wanted to provide guidance more consistent to actual to just give investors a better approximation of where things are headed, and that's basically the way that Q1 played out. Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. I want to follow up on pricing first. So if we think about it, was this driven more by kind of the inflationary environment? And if you think about it, is there an opportunity to do this globally? Is there a way to tie this to a more strategic interaction with the customer around the application services? Just walk through is pricing a strategic lever here or was this more of a onetime kind of adjustment that you haven't really exercised over the course of the company's life. Yes. I mean I think it's a lever. I wouldn't say that we have necessarily Grandios plans to roll it out globally or across every single one of our products. I think we're still evaluating stuff like that. But just maybe to take a step back, I mean, we have done price increases in the past, not necessarily -- it's been a while in SMS, but we have done them, for example, in the e-mail business. We've done them a few times actually even under our ownership. They've also been done in other parts of the business, most notably in Segment. And so it's not like it's something that's not planned or something that hasn't happened before in Twilio. So I don't want to leave you with that impression.
I think for us, we're seeing enough inflation in the environment, both based on our variable cost line as well as the labor inflation that we felt like it was appropriate to pass through price increase, like I said. While those changes take effect on the 11, there are a lot of customers that are still on fixed price contracts. And I don't think it's going to be material in the short term, but it's something that we'll evaluate as we go through the balance of the year, and we'll see how things play out. Perfect. And then, I guess, with respect to the second half, you called out the more favorable comparables from the prior year. This maybe goes back to Kash's question about just the macro environment. Like is there any adjustment or anything you're doing in your models at all to take into account any impacts from Europe or revenue in Russia and Ukraine? And then separately, as we are coming out of the pandemic, hopefully, are there any verticals that you're starting to see where use cases bouncing back stronger than others? Okay. There's a lot there. So let me take them one at a time. So on Russia, Ukraine, I wouldn't say there's been really much of an impact at all. Volume in that region is a pretty small piece of our global traffic, and we haven't seen a material impact in our business to date.
What I can tell you is that for any new business in Russia, we've suspended doing any. And to the extent that we had any traffic with state-owned customers, we've terminated that. And then we've seen a little bit around the fringes with some isolated customers who might pause their traffic to Russia. But it's a pretty de minimis impact to our business. And yes, we have modeled it to the extent that it would even impact us.
In terms of broader macro, I mean, we're watching all the same factors that you all do. I think what I would go back to is that what we're finding both based in our conversations on the ground with customers, what we're seeing in our revenue line, what we're seeing in some of the research that we've done and what others have done is that digital transformation continues to remain a top boardroom priority. And so we see that as a very secular trend, not one that's cyclical. And so as that continues to happen over a long period of time, we feel like there's a lot of tailwind here for Twilio.
And I mean, of course, there are economic factors, geopolitics, supply chain, labor, et cetera, but all that stuff is largely built into our models. And so our 30% plus growth confidence as well as being profitable next year has a lot of those impacts baked in, and we obviously have a strong balance sheet as well.
I'd say there's one other part of your question Alex, I can't remember that. The verticals that are coming back are stronger than others? Yes. I mean what we saw kind of transpiring going into the pandemic, I mean, obviously, ride share, travel, hospitality were pretty significantly impacted to the bad. And based on some of the reports you've even seen recently, like those industries are coming back pretty nicely. And obviously, that drives some additional volume to us. I think the thing to bear in mind there is that we're very, very diversified now in terms of our customer base. And so no one industry necessarily drives an outsized impact on our revenue line.
I think the things that we saw during the course of the pandemic that we expect to be quite durable are, for example, e-commerce, health care, financial services. A lot of the use cases in those categories became elevated. But I think what we're hearing from our customers in those verticals is that now that they've gone down the path of digital transformation and they've seen such significant ROI, they want to keep going. And so we've just gotten started with those verticals, and I think there's a lot more that now Elena and her team are going to be able to do in helping customers solve their different problems in those areas, and we stand ready to do that with them.
So I'd say a bit of tailwind in some of those industries and then a bit of tailwind in those that I referenced earlier that were down on the early part of COVID.
Operator, I think with that, we're going to wrap it up as far as questions and answers. Thank you, everybody, who joined the call. Certainly, the IR team is available subsequently, and we welcome your questions afterwards.

Before we dive into questions, I'm pleased to announce that Twilio's customer and developer conference, SIGNAL, will be held virtually November 2 and 3, 2022, in the North American and EMEA region; and November 3 and 4, 2022, in APAC. SIGNAL is our flagship customer developer conference. We explore the intersection of technology, innovation and, of course, customer engagement, and we've got a really exciting lineup planned. The main event will be held virtually, and we will host 2 in-person customer events, our Creator Summit and our new CDP Summit dedicated to our marketing and segment customer audience. Our virtual Investor Day will also take place in alignment with SIGNAL, and more to come about that Investor Day soon. So with that, let's open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Derrick Wood with Cowen. Great. Elena, maybe I'll start with you. You've been there for a few months. I just wanted to kind of hear what sort of tweaks you're looking to make in the go-to-market and things around like account structure and product focus and kind of what things you have in mind as you build through the year, and particularly how you're trying to design that to help kind of move more up stack with both the sales force and the partner ecosystem. Thanks, Derrick. Really appreciate the question. It's been an exciting, eventful few months here. And I'm super excited about the opportunity I had. Listen, there's a few opportunities we've identified to drive our focus and time toward the highest value outcomes in the business. We're at different stages of executing across each of those.
First and foremost, I feel like the organization, our processes, our systems, our tools are really ready to work harder for us. And I think what that means is that we should be working much more toward applying human touch to the moment the customer journey that really require it and to the solutions -- and solution-selling moments that really required as well. So we're looking for efficiency there. We're also finding efficiencies in marketing and ensuring our pricing is reflective of the value that we're providing, in exploring new and novel ways to tap into that vibrant partner ecosystem that you mentioned.
All of that is leading to an opportunity for us to shift to more of our selling capacity to software, while also making sure that we're leveraging more self-service capability for customers that don't actually require hand-to-hand account coverage. I think the opportunity we have is massive in those areas. I feel like we have tremendous assets to work with, both in our client relationships, but also in our team, and I actually had our products. It's about as well. So I'm excited to begin to push on those levers more aggressively and to just watch our software-selling motion to take off from here. Great. And I'm sure investors certainly would like to see that. And I guess for Khozema, the direction of gross margin coming back down in the quarter, I guess a little surprising given you guys raising pricing in the quarter, the thought that you'd see a higher mix of domestic messaging post the 10DLC registration stuff. And even if I look at international mix at 35% of revenue was flat sequentially. So I know it sounds like you're calling out international mix, but are there other components that play perhaps within international where costs are going higher? Can you just give a little bit more color on the puts and takes on gross margin and perhaps how to think about it directionally in Q3? Yes. I mean, by and large, the way that you characterized it is right that the decline in gross margin is largely driven by our strength in international messaging. I think one thing that you do have to bear in mind, as you think about the 35% sequentially quarter-to-quarter, that's based on where the customer's address is or where traffic originates, not necessarily where that traffic ends up terminating. And so as we have both U.S. customers as well as customers that reside internationally, that continue to send messages internationally, you're going to have a slightly lower gross margin just as a result of the fact that international messaging margins are structurally lower, and that's kind of what's been the drag on our business.
What I would say is that, in general, while that has kind of a margin rate effect, we do feel good about the growth in overall messaging, and it's still a major entry point for us with customers and it opens a lot of opportunities related to what Elena talked about a moment ago. And so we still feel good about our 60% plus gross margin target longer term. But in the shorter term, we are taking on some business. Some of that, in large part, is international. And as long as it's profitable business and drives gross profits back into the business, we like that business, and we're happy to take it on as long as it pulls through Flex segment over time. Next, we'll go to Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Great. In the prepared remarks, you guys mentioned that you would not be immune from macro factors. And just wanted to get a sense of how those are manifesting thus far, and how you're being proactive with customers where you can help them optimize that spend. It's Elena here. We're -- we feel like, in general, companies are continuing to prioritize investments that are responsible for driving revenue and efficiency. We're super fortunate and that we have products in all of those spaces. We haven't yet seen any kind of significant degradation in demand. But we do have some exposure areas that I think are worth mentioning. I think we had them in our prepared remarks as well, but in areas like SMBs and consumer and digital natives that we know could be impacted by a prolonged downturn. But as that -- with that said, we also have some spaces that we think will operate and continue to perform quite well.
We've seen a couple of recent isolated areas of softness, more specifically in areas like crypto, consumer on-demand, social. But again, that impact's nonmaterial. We don't think we're immune, but we also think our products fit in kind of a perfect space for continued investment. And so we're continuing to watch it really, really closely, and we're continuing to watch top of funnel, cycling and things like that, and we'll continue to be really sort of diligent in our analysis and certainly as well in our response to the extent we see additional softness come to fruition. Yes. Meta, I'll just add to what Elena said that as she mentioned, the business has been resilient. And while we've seen some isolated pockets, we haven't really seen anything material yet. That said, we're certainly not naive about the way that our -- many of our peers are talking the way that the macro environment appears to be playing out. And so we are readying ourselves for a variety of scenarios. And you probably noted that we've taken some actions with respect to slowing down hiring except for some key areas. We're taking -- we guided based on having a real estate charge, which I think reflects our kind of remote-first approach to the way that we're going to work going forward. And I think both of those things will drive profitability into next year. And I think irrespective of the macro environment, we're intending to be profitable next year no matter whether it has an impact on growth or not. Got it. And then just was there any FX impact that are worth calling out? Not really. We have a hedging program. And I think in general, that kind of blunts the impact of any FX. And so it tends not to be a material impact to our business. Next, we'll go to Will Power with Baird. Okay. Great. I want to ask about the 8-figure Flex win you announced in the quarter. That seemed like a really nice win for you. I'd love to just kind of hear more about the processes that are ripped and replaced? Is it 1 segment of the business or maybe thoughts on who you were competing with there? Just kind of any learnings from that because it seems like a nice potential witness test for -- and maybe a nice reference account going forward. Got it. Will, we're really excited to have signed this largest Flex deal ever in Q2. I think it's a great sign of continued momentum that we are seeing at Flex. And broadly with our Customer Engagement solutions, the Fortune 100 retailer that we mentioned was already a customer of our communications APIs. So this also demonstrates the traction that we're making with our strategy of establishing relationships and then moving them up from our core APIs into more broad customer engagement solutions.
So this multinational -- the connection between the brick-and-mortar stores and the virtual stores using Twilio Flex, video, chat and messaging. And so it's really a solution that hits a lot of different channels. And their data-driven cross-channel needs here are going to create a single view of the customer across their organization to provide a seamless, personalized and just really a great number of customer experience that starts with their marketing through their sales and through their customer service. And so they really reimagining the customer life cycle in this sort of high-touch way, from physical stores to virtual stores across all these channels.
And when you kind of think about like how many solutions are out there that can really, really help power these new and emerging and novel customer engagement like full life cycle solutions, there really aren't that many out there. So we were in the competitive landscape with a bunch of other known players, as you can imagine. But I think this is what reflects really shines in terms of being able to take a bunch of really interesting new and emerging requirements from a customer who's really looking to reinvent how they engage with the customer, not just when we need support, but really across that full customer life cycle. And they do it in multiple different channels, across multiple different venues that they have. This is -- this is where Flex really shines. So we're really excited about this new customer. I think it's a fantastic win for the platform, and look forward to continued customer success takeout. That's great. I appreciate that. And maybe just to follow-on real quickly on the macro front. Anything you can call out with respect to linearity kind of across the quarter? Did you start to see more relative weakness late in the quarter? And how has that maybe trended past that? Anything you call out just with respect to geographies? Europe versus elsewhere? Will, this is Khozema. Not really. I mean, I think globally, we had a pretty good performance across the board. I think, we called out a couple of sectors where we did feel it. We called out some sectors where we saw some ups as well. And so I think so far, at least, as we've said, it's been pretty balanced for us. And we haven't really seen any signs of anything material yet. We're obviously watching it closely. And as I said a moment ago, we're certainly paying attention to what our peers are saying and what's happening in the macro environment more broadly. But I wouldn't call out anything beyond what we did, certainly not geographically. Next, we'll go to Samad Samana with Jefferies. Maybe first just on the shifting of the selling capacity on the software side and looking to leverage more self-service capability for customers that don't need direct account coverage. Maybe, Elena, could you help us understand better? Is that even for the application layer like Engage and Flex that you're trying to do that as well and Segment? Or is that more for the traditional messaging side? Just help us understand who that's directed at in your base and what that customer looks like and how we should think about that going forward. Yes. Great question, Matt. Thanks. I think that, that motion can apply to all of our solutions, but I think it's most effective in our more transactional messaging deals. And so you'll see us push on it harder there, but we really believe that there's a motion across all of our solutions, where they're discoverable by developers, where developers have a moment where they can experience the solution, they can play with it, they can build around it. And then that can lead to bigger and bigger deals and engagements with clients.
That said, we also know that with these solutions, there are -- there's pipelines being built and deals going down in the market every day, and we want to make sure that we're meeting customers where their sales cycle is taking them and with what their process looks like. And so we'll have enterprise selling motion across all of that as well. But we believe that there's really sort of exciting opportunity for us to push harder on self-service and messaging. But that doesn't mean that we won't also have those motions working really well across Segment and Engage as well as Flex. Great. And then maybe -- can I have a follow-up question for you, just on the guidance. Does the 3Q guidance include political messaging revenue contribution? Or is that going to be excluded as you think about organic growth? Just trying to make sure that we kind of keep all of our ducks in a row on the organic guidance and what's included in that. Yes. It will be included. We're not excluding political from the organic guide, but I would say that it tends not to have much of an effect or as much of an effect in Q3. It tends to be more of a Q4 phenomenon. So I wouldn't expect much of an uplift relative to political in the overall guidance. Next, we'll go to Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Securities. Okay. Great. I mean look, there are clearly a number of moving pieces in the model and the macro currently. We've been fielding a number of investor questions just around the 30% organic revenue growth level. And even with all the moving pieces, you did come in above that this quarter. The guidance suggests fairly close to or above those levels next quarter. Can you -- we just spend some time on the organic profile of the business, the puts and takes of what's playing through currently? And if some of the urgency and adoption patterns you were seeing normalizes, are there points of focus for the sales team just to kind of drive towards or lean into in the current backdrop? Yes. Let me start. This is Khozema, and then I'll hand it over to Elena to talk through in a bit more detail from a sales perspective in particular. So I'd say, just to start off with, as we mentioned, that so far, at least, like we're not really seeing any material impacts in our business relative to kind of the macro picture. And obviously, we're watching that macro picture quite closely. We monitor our business very closely. It's usage based and so we're getting signals day-to-day about that. But as I said, so far, we're not really feeling anything material.
In terms of Q2, like we feel really good about the way that Q2 and frankly, the first half played out, and we feel quite good about the setup in the second half as well. We're guiding, obviously, to 30 to 32 on a reported and then 29 to 30 organically despite kind of a bleaker macro picture perhaps than where we were 6 months ago. And I'd attribute that largely to the business remaining resilient. And while we have seen some pockets of softness, we're just not seeing that in kind of a broader brush yet.
In Elena's prepared remarks, what she alluded to was that we are seeing some longer sales cycles, but that's being offset, in part, by volume gains in some other areas. And so I think sitting here today, based on what we know, what we see, we feel pretty good about certainly our first half results and the setup for Q3 as well. That said, there's a lot more work for us to do given the magnitude of the opportunity in front of us. And so given that, let me turn it over to Elena to talk through that. Yes. I mean I think for us, like our focus is still very much on making sure that we are harnessing the demand that's out there and just making sure we're introducing the best of everything we have to operate into the market. As I mentioned earlier, we are kind of continuing to kind of move our focus up stack, make sure that we're investing in those areas to drive long-term growth with a high, high focus on profitability.
I think Kho said it well, like we're not seeing any significant degradation of demand. We've seen cycle length just in a couple of very, very small pockets, push out a little bit. We're not hugely concerned in that it hasn't become a pattern. It's just something that we're watching really closely. But I feel good about the setup going forward. I feel good about how the team is focused and moving in the right direction, and we'll continue to watch it and make sure that we're responding accordingly and adjusting our message, too, out to the market accordingly.
Again, we think that our solutions are really well suited to this point in time. And so even if budgets get, for a short period of time, scrutinized or held as people are sort of holding their breath waiting for additional economic data, we also feel really comfortable that when the exhale happens, we're there waiting and that we present a really phenomenal opportunity particularly in our solutions that allow people to know, engage, sell to, sell through their own customer base that we stand to benefit from that in the end. Okay. All right. We'll go to our next question. Next, we'll go to Nick Altman with Scotia Bank. Great. Yes. Good to hear that you reaffirmed your commitment to profitability in 2023. But just given there's a handful of onetime costs related to the office closures and the sabbatical program that are sort of pressuring 3Q, how should we be thinking about EBIT margins as we sort of exit this year and then kind of going into 2023? Yes. That's a fair question. So thanks for asking it. I think the way that we're thinking about it is, is that irrespective of kind of the macro environment that we intend to be profitable in 2023. And we've thought through a number of different scenarios that could play out that even if there were growth impacts, we still intend to be profitable in the coming year. And in addition to that, we continue to see this massive opportunity, as Elena has been talking about, with respect to the software aspects of our business, in particular Segment and Flex.
In terms of the 2 dynamics that we called out in our prepared remarks, so one of them being the real estate. The real estate charge, that's a onetime. It's noncash. It will start to show up in our operating results next year. And then in terms of the second one, that's also a noncash charge, and then there'll be some kind of carryover period to period that it will be relatively de minimis in the scheme of things. What we're guiding to for the time being is profitability into the next year. We're not guiding to a margin rate associated with that EBIT number. But what we're committed to doing is delivering profitability into the next year. Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then it just sounds like there's sort of a greater pivot to Segment, Engage and Flex. And I'm just curious sort of what's driving that? Is there something you're seeing in the end market where maybe the end market for those products is becoming a little bit more attractive or sales productivity selling those products is ticking up a bit? Or is it more sort of you guys are pivoting to selling those products with a higher gross margin profile than the overall business? So I'll say a couple of things. And then Jeff may want to weigh in as well on that one since it's such a sort of large sort of strategic question. But I would say a couple of things. First, messaging and communication end up sort of being the last mile of the things that originate up in the marketing space, in the customer care space, et cetera. So we think it's a very, very natural progression that where we started with a fantastic business in communications, that we then help customers make sure that those communications are the right communications, at the right time, through the right channels, to the right individuals to make the whole flywheel turn better and faster.
And so it happens to have the characteristics of helping us create a better economic profile from a margin perspective for the business long term. But we also think it's just a really, really natural move from a customer perspective. Jeff, I don't know if you have anything you'd like to add to that? Well, thanks, Elena. I think you said it really well. Maybe I'll just add 2 bits of color to your answer. First is customers come to us, whether they want voice or messaging or e-mail. I mean they're coming to us for our communications channels because they have some business goal they're trying to achieve, right. And typically, it's they're trying to do better marketing. They're trying to improve their sales process. They're trying to make their products more engaging. They're trying to provide better service and support, right? They're trying to -- one of these areas in the customer journey is where they are focused. And so they're using communications to achieve that goal.
When we talk to customers and we learn what it is they're trying to do, we always see these opportunities to say, well, how can I help you achieve that goal faster, better and doing a bunch of the heavy lifting that customers may be trying to do on their own. And so when we see these trends emerge, lots of customers coming to us for better contact center, or a lot of customers coming to us for identity verification, or coming test for better marketing across channels. These are all opportunities for us to help our customers and get our customers to success faster and to bring them a higher value product. And so that's a win-win.
And so when you think about what we've been doing, we started with the sort of bottom most layers of like the channel APIs. And as we learn about customer needs and broad-based customer problems, we can then go into solving those problems for our customers. And everybody wins. And as Elena mentioned, obviously, that increases our gross margin profile to be solving software problems, but also accelerates our customers' time to value and their success.
The second thing I'll say, from a strategic standpoint is, as we grow our business and we grow our revenue, we want to make money because we help our customers craft and send and engage with better communications with their customers, not just more communications. I think we all would look at our phone and our inbox and all that and say, we've got a lot of messages. We've got a lot of email. But really what businesses want is more engaging communications, more engaging customer journeys. And so we see that as a really big opportunity to really get at what our customers truly want with their real aim is have more engaged customers, not just more communications.
So I think it really hits our strategic goals. I think it achieves our customers' strategic goals. And I think it's what end users want as well. And so I think everybody wins as we continue to drive into more software solutions, to drive smaller outcomes and better customer relationships for our customers. Next, we'll go to Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. I am curious, maybe for you, Khozema, how would you assess the response to the SMS pricing increase? I'm wondering if customers view it as reasonable and to be expected in an inflationary environment? Or do you think that volume growth would degrade slightly as you roll that price increase through? And I have a quick follow-up. Yes. Mark, we haven't really seen much of a detrimental impact to the business. I think volume is broadly held up. We haven't seen a lot of resistance to it. I think it's pretty reasonable in an inflationary environment. And as we've talked about in the past, we feel really, really good about our technology, and we do feel like it deserves a premium relative to the competition. Okay. And then as a quick follow-up, could you describe the trend on the video portion of the business? I think you -- Jeff, you've had several innovations there, included an application for hosting conferences and virtual events. I think you've had embeddable video. Could you help us understand what kind of experimentation are you seeing? And maybe any help on just the trajectory or the prioritization of video? Yes, absolutely, Mark. So we've got our video platform started off. The first several use cases were small group conferences and the big group conferences. Then last year, we launched Twilio Live, which provides for live streaming experiences, interacting streaming experiences. I think this is still an area for us of experimentation, to be honest. I think the video market is still sorting out. I think there was sort of the market that existed and then COVID came along and there was a flow year of activity. And there's been some experimentation by entrepreneurs, by bigger companies. But it's really small for us in the grand scheme of things. And I think it's a really interesting investment area because I do think that video is ripe for some more disruption, more interesting applications, whether it's live shopping, whether it's live interactive conferences, et cetera. But it's just small for us in the grand scheme of things, and it's one of those long bets that we have. Next, we'll go to Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. I appreciate you haven't really seen any sort of kind of macro headwinds to the business, but we are absolutely seeing churn pop-up in other customers, particularly customers, vendors that have exposure to kind of that SMB smaller customer cohort. I know your software is free, right? So you only pay for what you consume. But as you think about the environment shifting here, have you seen any sort of change in the consumption patterns and messaging patterns, in the smaller customer set? Obviously, the return to travel is something that is real. Lots of people are traveling, and so there's got to be some offsets. But I'm just wondering, as you think about maybe the smaller customer cohort, are you starting to see any sort of change in volume or messaging patterns that might be maybe offset by larger customers? Yes. It's a good question. This is Khozema. Let me start and then I'll let Elena comment as well. So maybe just to take a step back, I think one of the things that we've been doing quite actively is analyzing the business among -- along the line of a number of dimensions, as we alluded to in our kind of prepared remarks. And we have been looking at it based on customer size. That's one of them. We've been looking at verticals. We've been looking at use cases. And at least so far, we're just not seeing much of an impact based on those cuts.
Now we did call out a couple of pockets of softness in Elena's section of the prepared remarks, where we commented that, for example, in crypto or social or on-demand related activities that we're seeing a little bit of slowdown. But on the flip, we are seeing some strength as well in financial services and IT-related spending. That said, as you alluded to in your question, we do have a usage-based business where we get paid based effectively on the basis of every event. And we are looking at it very closely, and we're certainly planning for a variety of different scenarios that could unfold. We just haven't seen them in our business just yet. And irrespective of how those things play out, we're still planning to be profitable into the next year, and that's kind of how we're running the business today. But let me let Elena comment more on SMBs because I think that was kind of the basis of your question. Elena? Yes. So I don't have a ton to add. I would just say it's very natural to sort of assume that as economic difficulty sort of creates this kind of a moment that the investments that SMBs are making those down, so may not be around over the next number of quarters or years. But we're also excited about the fact that it's also a window for new innovation to take back up and new company starts to get involved and to send messages and utilize software. So we're definitely watching it.
But I will tell you, and we don't break this out, I would say in my organization, we call the group that looks after SMB is our growth team. We're pretty pleased with their performance thus far. So I -- that's I guess the only thing I'll add is that definitely still watching, excited about the progress that team is making. But really sort of where we've seen softness has been much more sort of use case or vertical oriented in the areas that you'd expect and that we talked about in our prepared comments. That's it. Next, we'll go to Ryan Koontz with Needham & Company. I want to reflect on Zipwhip, if we could. And I really appreciate it's an innovative and unique product. Can you tell me, is it fully integrated to the company now? And how do you see it performing, that are the A2P fees? And what are your expectations for the business going forward in terms of any synergies with that? Yes. I mean we're not breaking it out, per se, but I think we feel great about the Zipwhip product. I think we feel even better about the Zipwhip team. I think they've integrated really nicely into the business. I think a number of different thought leaders that came with that team as well that are helping us innovate. The business performance, as I said, is going really, really well. Obviously, there's an A2P fee component there, too, which we break out for you all. But I really have nothing but very positive things to say about how Zipwhip has been performing. Next, we'll go to Ryan MacWilliams with Barclays. I know that the Syniverse agreement has gone into effect. Would you expect any material benefit to gross margins in the next quarter? And do you think there might be any better visibility into gross margins going forward after this agreement? Yes. I mean, as you pointed out, that we concluded the Syniverse transaction, and we feel good about having them as 1 of our partners. We did business with them for a long time, and strengthening that relationship through an active investment felt like a great next step for us. We have a commercial agreement alongside the investment that we took, and that provides some benefits to the business.
We're not guiding the gross margins into the out quarter. We're committed to our long-term model, up 60% plus over time. But I think rather than not necessarily happening just through a price increase for the Syniverse arrangement, it's largely going to come through the growth in our software business, which is, in part, one of the reasons that we're so excited about it. So Syniverse is definitely accretive and will be helpful over time. But I wouldn't read too much into it having an impact in the next quarter or so. And there's quarterly fluctuations in deferred revenue might not be the best indicator of segment momentum. But is there any color you can give around how Segment is doing at this point? And also maybe any update where we are in regards to the Engage rollout? The first -- I missed the first part of the question. Did you say deferred? I was just saying like deferred might not be the best metric to gauge Segment momentum. But like is there any color you can give around how Segment is doing at this point? Yes. The Segment is going really well, and it's been performing well for a long time for us. I mean, we're really, really excited about the addition of that product and that team as well into the company. Obviously, it comes with a nice software attach. I think it's very additive to what we're trying to do and have been doing for some time with our communication stack. And I think we bring that all together with Engage.
And Engage is still planned for a later in year launch, as we've been saying for some time. And we're super excited about the way that, that beta program has been going. I think we've been oversubscribed there for a while. Elena will probably know better than I, but I think we feel good about that momentum. We feel great about the way the Segment has been performing. Obviously, that business is integrated fully. And yes, we're excited to launch Engage soon. Okay. Next, we'll go to Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho. This is Abhinav on for Siti. I guess the first kind of question would be just with Google delaying recently their application of third-party cookies now, again, from 2023 to 2024, have you seen or do you expect this to change the demand environment a little bit around CDP's customer engagement more broadly and maybe that transition away from third party? And do you see some of the urgency kind of diminish for some of your customers that are coming in? We're talking over each other. We're in different places, if you haven't figured that out yet. Thanks for the question. Yes, I think what we see is the -- it's taking a little bit of pressure off of companies. I mean, if you think about it, like 2023 is not that far away. So in some ways, it's actually pretty reasonable to give a little more time for such a big change in the Internet ecosystem to roll through.
That said, I mean we did a survey, and it was like -- I think it was 70%, some number like that, of companies were not ready for this change. Now that creates demand for our products. But you also can't imagine that, that number of companies are going to magically like put the switch and completely flip their technology stack in just a month's time. And so I think it's giving a little bit of pressure release now.
But it still is a great environment for the CDP given that customers actually do have a lot more time to actually make these thoughtful changes, and we are already seeing some fantastic stories from the customer base emerge that really is giving our customers confidence that this first-party data approach is not just going to be tenable, like it's a big change for folks. But actually, it's going to be tremendously beneficial.
A couple of the stories that we've shared publicly is Allergan using Segment was able to get a 41% reduction in their cost of customer acquisition, which is -- those are amazing numbers. Another great customer story is from Domino's, who in Mexico was using Segment to build smarter customer audiences. And as a result of that, doing better ad buying, and they saw their return on ad spend increased 700%, 700%. That's pretty amazing.
And especially in a macro environment like this where every marketer doesn't have like the CMO wheeling over a wheel barrel of cash to go spend on ads, like people have to be incredibly efficient and provide ROI on all of their ad spend. So these types of stats even ahead of having to make these change. Companies who are getting ahead of the curve are already showing these amazing returns, not just in getting back to parity with where they were before a lot of these privacy changes went in place, but actually accelerating and going beyond and showing tremendous increases in the efficiency of their ad buys.
I think that is going to drive a lot of the demand, in addition to the kind of forcing function of the tail end, which is Google saying, come on, guys, you got to get off this thing. So the forcing function isn't bad, but I actually think even better driving force is just the high ROI customers see when they use our CDP to understand their customers, create better profiles of their customers and use those profiles to build better, smarter, more accurate audiences to go then place more effective ads on the likes of Google and Facebook. And so I think there's a variety of factors that are driving it. It's not just a cookie thing. Cookies certainly helps, don't get me wrong. But I think that especially in an environment like this where ROI is the name of the game that Segment has a fantastic story. Yes, definitely. That makes a lot of sense. And I appreciate the color there. And maybe just one quick follow-up on kind of the political messaging of volumes this year. Have you seen any indication about how it's trending versus historically? Whether you'll see more volume this year based on maybe kind of just the political environment in general or maybe kind of just waiting to see how that trends into Q3 or Q4? Yes, this is Khozema. I think it's kind of a wait and see. I mean we haven't seen anything idiosyncratic yet. I mean we've modeled some for Q3, and it tends to pick up a little bit more in Q4, but nothing that I would call out. Next, we'll go to Patrick Walravens with JMP Securities. So Jeff, going back to Engage, the October '21 press release said it would be GA in Q1 and now it's [indiscernible] Q4. So you guys obviously said to expect time. I'd love to hear why.
And then just secondly, on the Engage topic. With that, you're going to be competing more, at least that's the perspective from some investors against some of your great customers like a brace or like a deal. How do you manage that? Patrick, yes, happy to answer those questions. So first of all, GA launch is still expected for the second half of this year. We've got great customers on board with the beta. And as I think Kho said earlier, too many customers wanting into that data, which is a good problem to have. And as often happens in the beta, you learn about which of the most valuable parts of the product, which are the parts that are most differentiated, and it directs our road map. And that's exactly what's happening here. We're learning great things from our customers. And I think our customers are telling us that we are on a great path, and it shows that there's real latent demand for the solution that Engage is providing.
The second of your question is how are we managing the partner ecosystem. And it's a great question because it's not a direct competitor necessarily to those other solutions. And there could be some areas of overlap for sure. But there's a lot of different ways to approach building omnichannel marketing. And our approach is to really start with the data. And our point of view is that the hardest part for a marketer to get right is actually having the right data and best profiles to drive what they're wanting to do. There are other solutions that are more focused on, say, the campaign or analytics and those are gears to focus on. But our starts with the data and then activating that data.
And what's interesting is that we've seen actually in some of our early beta customers that what they want to do is use Twilio to drive building that data and then activate it. They may activate it with a campaign of their own that they build on Engage. That's maybe an email campaign or a text campaign, but they may also want to trigger campaigns that are in other marketing tools.
And so we've seen opportunities to actually deepen our partnerships because like, look, we're here to help power our customers' tech stack. And I think that bringing data in and activating that data is frankly really a net new area of the tech stack. And so that's an area of investment. I think marketers are going to increasingly spend money on having the best data and the speed of that data, having real-time event level data for all their customers.
But then the things they do with it, sometimes they'll be activating those on Twilio directly, sometimes they'll be activating them on internal tools. We've seen customers wanting to trigger like internal alerts or internal chat applications. We've also seen customers want to trigger activations in all their third-party tools. And that's part of the ecosystem that we're building with Engage. And Engage is a really, really flexible engine to take customer data and in real time as that data is changing, activate that data to trigger flows. And so there's a real partner opportunity there, too, that we continue to work with our partners to bring to life as we're bringing a product to GI. There are no further questions. This concludes today's conference call.

I’m Bryan Vaniman, Twilio’s SVP of Investor Relations and Corporate Development. Thanks for joining us virtually today. We’re hosting our Investor Day in conjunction with SIGNAL, our annual customer and developer conference.
Hopefully, you’ve had a chance to tune into some of the broader SIGNAL programming, including yesterday’s keynote where the team talked about some of the great examples of how companies are using Twilio products to better engage with their customers, drive higher lifetime value and reduce acquisition costs. We held our last Investor Day during our 2020 SIGNAL and a lot has changed since then. So we’re excited to have you join us today to get an update on our business and the opportunity ahead.
Before we begin, as a reminder, all financial measures are presented on a non-GAAP basis except for revenue, which is a GAAP measure unless otherwise specified. Reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and further information related to guidance can be found at the end of this investor presentation.
The information provided and discussed today also will include forward-looking statements, including statements about our future outlook and goals. However, reconciliation of non-GAAP forward-looking information to this corresponding GAAP measures cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts due to the challenging quantifying various items.
These forward-looking statements are only projections and expectations regarding future performance involving risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that are described in more detail in our most recent periodic reports filed with the SEC, including our most recent report on Form 10-K and subsequent reports on Form 10-Q, and any amendments to any of the foregoing, and are available on our website and at sec.gov.

Now, in terms of agenda, Jeff is going to get us started with the introduction and vision, followed by Eyal Manor, our Chief Product Officer who will go deeper on our innovation and product strategy. We’ll then have Elena Donio, our President of Revenue provide more details on our go-to-market strategy and Khozema Shipchandler, our COO will close out the presentation with a financial overview of the business in a discussion of key metrics.
After the presentation, we’ll take a short break and then we’ll come back for an executive Q&A session with today’s presenters covering the Investor Day session as well as our Q3 earnings, which we released this afternoon after market close. Throughout the webcast, you’ll be able to submit questions using the built-in Q&A feature. So if you have questions at any time, please submit them there. I’ll be moderating the Q&A. So we will aggregate the questions submitted and during the Q&A session I will announce who submitted the question and then I’ll read the question for the group. And finally, we will be posting today’s presentation on our Investor Relations website following the conclusion of today’s event.
Now, with all that out of the way, let me hand it over to Jeff Lawson to kick things off. Thanks, Bryan. Hello, everybody, and welcome to Twilio’s 2022 Investor Day. I’m Jeff Lawson Twilio’s Co-Founder and CEO. And look, I’m going to get straight down to business because I know there’s a lot of discussion among the investor community around Twilio. I’m accustomed to Twilio being hard to classify because we don’t fit cleanly into one box or another. But this is also part of what’s given Twilio a unique opportunity in the market.
Here are some of those dynamics. I mean we’re a developer led an API first company. We have both a usage based pricing model and a more traditional SaaS based pricing model with our software products. We have a platform approach versus a solution approach. We have both a product led and enterprise go-to-market motion and our messaging products have a markedly different gross margin profile than many of our other products.
So as you can see, we have a number of unique elements to our business that don’t easily map to any single comparable. So I hope today’s presentation will help to shed more light on our business, our opportunity and our path forward. So let’s get to it.
There are really four things that I want to focus on today. First, I want to discuss our messaging product. It’s strong and can become even more efficient as it grows and I want to show you how we intend to do that. Second, we see an even bigger opportunity with customer engagement even though, it’s early for us, but I want to give you visibility into our path here.
Third, I want to talk about why these two things communications and data are better together as a customer engagement platform and why we’re going to win. And last I want to outline our focus on operating leverage and profitability as a key priority for myself and the company.
Okay. First, messaging. I know there’s a lot of discussion about gross margins and look, I get it. I acknowledge that historically we’ve guided to a 60%-plus gross margin in aggregate for Twilio and that we’d achieve that level by mixing more and more software into our revenue mix. But the telecommunications ecosystem and our business has changed since we set that goal. So I want to shed some light on what’s driving our recent decline in gross margins and why as a business we’re more focused on driving gross profit dollars.
Messaging is the biggest and fastest growing portion of our communications portfolio and has been the key contributor to our recent gross margin decline. Carriers charge a fee to access their customers and we pass that fee along both in the U.S. and internationally. And internationally, it’s generally higher. Those fees have gone up over time as this space has matured and taken off over the years.
The international market has operated this way for several years and more recently in the U.S. those fees we call 10DLC fees were recently introduced because we passed these through to customers at no additional margin, our gross margin percentage has dropped. Furthermore, our international messaging traffic has seen strong growth, which has put further pressure on our gross margin percentage.
We’ve outlined these dynamics in our recent earnings calls, but here’s the important part. Our gross profit per message has actually increased over the last few years and we believe that’s what really matters. Khozema will walk through this in more detail in his section. So net-net, we believe that gross profit per message is a more meaningful signal for Twilio, even more so than gross margin percentage. So we’re going to give you that visibility today.
Now with that principle in mind, I want us to go grab as much messaging volume in the world as we can with a stable gross profit per message. And when we do that for you all to say, hey, that was the right decision, but we can be far more efficient in generating that gross profit. So off of those aggregate gross profit dollars, we intend to continue driving leverage, which means that more and more of those dollars will drop to the bottom line over time and then drive the whole business with positive and increasing operating profit.
As Khozema will tell you, we expect to drive incremental non-GAAP operating profits year-over-year starting in 2023 and beyond. These are the goals that we’re orienting around top line market capture and bottom line profitability. The gross margin percentage in the middle is really not what we’re managing the business for. And then we can use our growing leverage in communications and the large customer base more than 280,000 customers as the launching point for Twilio’s act two in customer engagement. So that’s what I want to talk about next.
Okay. Second, the opportunity in customer engagement, so until recently, brands never knew who their customers were. Think about it. They shipped products to the store that sat on the shelves and nobody knew who bought the product or if whoever bought it even liked it. But the Internet enabled companies to build a direct relationship with their customers to know who they are, what they want, and to cross-sell more products and even subscriptions, creating loyal fans. So now every company can connect with their customers from the website or on their cell phones, via text, chat or e-mail directly.
There have never been more digital interactions between companies and their customers than there are right now. But when those interactions aren’t relevant to us, what do we do? We tune them out, we unsubscribe, we don’t visit the site again, we delete the app. Therefore, companies who want to take advantage of this direct relationship have to remain relevant. Now, compare this to the digital companies like Amazon, Netflix or Google who know us and are able to tailor every interaction to us.
They take every data point and turn it into a better product experience, which in turn builds a better digital relationship. Think about it. Your and my Amazon homepage is look completely different. Your and my Google Search results for the exact same phrase generate completely different results.
In fact, the more you use these products, the better they get for us. This is what’s possible in the digital economy. And look, the stakes are high. If Amazon and Google become our one stop shops than every other company has to buy through them. Companies can’t afford to be disintermediated and pay a big percentage of revenues to continually reacquire their own customers for every purchase.
If I’m selling shoes, then my biggest competition is my customers typing in google.com when they want to new pair of shoes or opening up their Amazon app. No, I want them typing in my site name or opening my app, and that’s what’s fueling the whole direct to consumer trend. But there’s technology that’s promised to enable these kinds of customer relationships, right?
It’s called CRM, but the reality is that CRM systems SaaS are bought by a bunch of different departmental leaders. The head of sales buys a sales cloud, marketing buys a marketing cloud, service buys a service cloud, et cetera. And these solutions are very siloed. They don’t integrate well with each other even if you’ve bought them from the same vendor, but they also weren’t built for B2C.
CRM comes from the B2B world where notes from salespeople are the source of truth about a customer account, but in B2C there often is no salesperson. Think about it. When I go to amazon.com, there’s no salesperson creating an opportunity that I might buy a Spatula today. Now in B2C, it’s all about volumes of data collected in real time that tell an actionable story about me as the customer.
The software industry has sold a solution that’s not working. $69 billion was spent worldwide in 2020 on CRM, yet only 13% of consumers in the U.S. rate their customer experiences as excellent. SaaS is optimized for the buyers of the technology, not for the customer outcomes. It’s interesting to me that the best companies at this aren’t using these apps at all. They’re built on internal customer platforms that start with the great use and activation of customer data.
So the big question is how do companies turn a one-time transaction into a long-term customer relationship? And the answer to the question of how do I turn transactions into relationships is data, which brings me to my third point, why communications and data are better together. This is why we acquired Segment. To build strong digital relationships, you need to understand your customers and to use that understanding to engage better than the competition.
I mean, when I talk to customers, they often observe that this is the flywheel they’re trying to create. The better they understand their customers through data, the better more personalized each interaction can be. And when that’s true, their customers are more likely to engage, browse the site, open the app, read the e-mail, click the ad, all of which creates more data.
This is a virtuous cycle that companies are seeking. When these parts of the technology stack and the customer lifecycle are integrated, the cycle breaks, buying from different vendors, having to manually integrate, these things are the impediments and the customer feels disconnected as a result. They get bad marketing, frustrating customer service calls, lack of context and personalization. That’s what so many companies are fighting and it’s the secret to the digital giant’s success. This is exactly what a customer engagement platform provides, and the reason why we’re so excited about the general availability of Twilio Engage.
Engage is our first software application that natively brings segments leading customer data platform and Twilio’s world class communications APIs together into a single integrated platform. We believe this native integration is what differentiates Twilio from anyone else in the market. Eyal and Elena will walk you through Engage in more detail in their parts of the presentation.
But beyond just engage, it’s important to understand why data and communications, the two key parts of customer engagement are better together. Companies have had to choose historically between best of breed SaaS that didn’t work together or to build a ton of workarounds. The platform approach solves that and this is why I think we’ll win. We’ve been building a platform to solve customer engagement pain points since day one of Twilio.
Our first platform was cloud communications across voice, messaging, e-mail and more. Our second platform was for the contact center with Twilio Flex. Our third platform is via the communications app for frontline sales reps, Twilio Frontline. Our fourth platform is for customer data with Twilio Segment and now our most recent platform for growth automation for marketers with Twilio Engage.
We started with communications, and we added the data layer, which informs the communications. So the more consumers our customers bring in, the more interactions they have and the more data they have, the more data our customers have, the more personalized the interactions get and so on.
We’re leveraging data as a platform and not just a database. It’s used to inform every single customer interaction across the customer journey, not just in one silo, but across marketing, sales, service, inside the product and more. This is what the digital giants have built and this is what we are enabling for every other company to build.
Now this is the opportunity that we’re building for. However, it’s not yet growing as quickly as we’d like due to some internal missteps. Elena will talk about some of the recent go-to-market changes we’ve made to improve our execution there, but from my perspective, these are unfortunate but common acquisition integration challenges.
Despite that, we’re uniquely positioned to win. We’re cloud first, data first, developer first, platform first. We’re a leader in CPaaS, a leader in CDP and a leader in customer engagement platforms. We have the foundation to win, now we just need to execute.
Finally, my fourth point, our focus on operating profit and driving leverage. In the past, we’d oriented the company primarily towards revenue growth with an eye on OpEx. That’s what we’ve said multiple times at our IPO and earnings calls, et cetera. And we’ve delivered great growth over the last several years. But we’ve also heard from you, our investors that growth is not the only thing that matters, especially as we’ve reached this scale and we agree, which is why earlier this year, we committed to delivering full year non-GAAP operating profitability starting in 2023.
When I look at our communications products and messaging in particular, I see a really good portfolio, but one that can be a lot more efficient in how we grow. So that’s what we’re focused on. We’re focused on gaining leverage in our communications portfolio, while we are investing more aggressively in our customer engagement software and data software. We aren’t immune to macroeconomic effects and we’re seeing short-term choppiness as the uncertainty as the economy continues.
But despite headwinds, we are very much focused on non-GAAP operating profit in 2023 with increasing leverage in the years to come. I see a lot that we can do internally to find that efficiency. And as CEO, I and my team are fully committed to our operating profitability. Khozema is going to show you our company operating profit goals and our annual targets for operating leverage increases. Elena will also discuss some of the changes we’ve made to our go-to-market motions to drive more leverage across her team and continue to build momentum around our software sales. And Eyal will show you that innovation continues.
So in closing, we and many other businesses around the world are facing short-term macro headwinds and resulting choppiness, but despite that, we are committed to non-GAAP profitability starting in 2023 because we see ample internal opportunities to drive operating leverage and efficiency.
And despite all the macro that’s going on, I’ve never been more excited about the opportunity ahead. As we continue our journey to build the world’s leading customer engagement platform, our mission is to unlock the imagination of builders. And when the world changes as rapidly as it has for the past few years, the world and our customers have more challenges than ever and therefore, we have more opportunities to help them solve those challenges.
I’m excited to partner with our amazing customers as they continue to build their customer engagement strategies to become more efficient themselves and to build relationships with their customers. We have the right team and the right roadmap in place to capture this market and execute on our plan.
And lastly, I’m also excited to gain alignment with all of you, our investors, on the nature of the messaging business and how we’re investing in the customer engagement opportunity. Thank you all for attending today, but also for being vocal supporters of Twilio and even constructive critics at times as we build this incredible business together.
With that, I want to pass it along to Eyal who will go deeper on our product strategy. Eyal? Hi, I’m Eyal Manor, the Chief Product Officer at Twilio. I’ve joined Twilio exactly one year ago. Before that, I spent 14 years at Google driving innovative products to scale. I first helped build the ads business to reach phenomenal growth. Then I led the large portfolio of Google Cloud platform products from inception to a scale of $19 billion in revenue.
Since joining Twilio, I’ve hired senior product and engineering leaders the best in the business from companies like Salesforce, Meta and Microsoft, all extremely experienced at scale with background in data and API. I joined Twilio because of its focus on innovation. Twilio has fundamentally changed the way businesses communicate directly with customers.
It is Twilio’s builder mentality and track record of delivering exceptional products that attracted me and I’m honored to be a part of its leadership team. Today, we’re going to talk about Twilio’s customer engagement platform and its strong foundation in both communications and data, which is the way of the future.
Our ability to bring together the leading CPaaS solution and the leading customer data platform in market share for IDC is what will allow us not only transform the customer engagement space, but to win it. Importantly, you’ll hear how we’re going to deliver it for our customers and investors, and that’s by focusing our investment on the highest impact product areas for the future, where we know Twilio can add differentiated value, positioning us to win in the market.
Since its founding, Twilio has been at the forefront of innovation and has repeatedly capitalized on secular trends. Twilio virtualized the complexity of telcos and democratized communications for every developer. With Twilio, businesses could finally text consumers or make calls at scale easily. With the explosions of online services, companies had to respond rapidly to changing customer expectations. Some customers prefer texting or chat while other preferred e-mail or voice. So introduced Flex, a programmable contact center build for this new world of tailored experiences and omni-channel communication.
More recently, we’ve seen customers expecting personalized experiences. This is where data comes into play to create a unique profile of each customer data must be unified across the customer journey for personalizations at scale. So Twilio acquired Segment, the industry-leading customer data platform. This brings us to our most recent launch Engage, Twilio Engage brings together the unified profiles and the communication layer for marketers to build data driven customer experiences. And this is just the beginning.
While all of these solutions create immense value on their own right together the makeup Twilio’s future for customer engagement platform. The combinations of communications and data make Twilio’s greater than the sum of its parts. Our customer engagement platform is how all of our industry-leading products come together with one single unified platform, we’re able to maximize the value unlocked for our customers.
Our platform combines the deliverability and reach of Twilio’s CPaaS offering with a data first foundation of our CDP to create a differentiated offering. This provides businesses with the power to build one-on-one relationship at scale through real time context and intelligence, low-code orchestration, easy to use APIs and extensible software products like Engage and Flex that give business users the power to meaningfully connect with customers on any channel.
I talk to our customers every week and I hear that these are the critical elements a business needs to create ideal experiences with their customers. This innovation is redefining how the industry views data driven customer engagement. One reason Twilio’s customer engagement platform is so powerful is because it already integrated into Twilio CPaaS portfolio. It harnesses the throughput, deliverability and reach of our communication APIs. We enable businesses to communicate with consumer at an enormous scale globally.
We power 144 billion messages and host 54 billion voice minutes annually, and we send over 127 billion e-mails monthly reaching consumers in over 180 countries. To make it easy, we also provide advanced compliance management to ensure companies can connect with their customers without needing to sort through the complexity of the evolving regulations on their own. Who are able to achieve those wins because of Twilio’s builder mentality, we provide differentiated experience with easy to use APIs that developers love making product led growth, a core tenant of our product strategy in an area we will continue to invest in.
We tightly integrated the strength of our CPaaS with our CDP, the second pillar of our customer engagement platform. With Segment, we have the world’s leading customer data platform, which empowers businesses to gain deep understanding of their customers. Our CDP collects contextualizes and activates first party data, eliminating silos across the customer engagement stack through our ability to make real time customer profiles accessible to all business teams in any tool of their choice.
Segment collects first party data across touch points, data generated from websites, applications, and even data warehouse. The privacy and security feature we’ve built help our customers comply with privacy laws like GDPR. This data is then synthesized into one unified customer profile that can be activated in real time.
With over 400 integrations, open architecture and easy to use APIs, companies are able to use that data to build a customer experience that connects to any other system they use. For example, Domino’s, Mexico used Segment to collect customer data and create eight distinct customer cohorts. They created a customer journey that was unique and personalized based on each group’s behavior and triggered ad campaigns in Google and Facebook with targeted messages at the right time.
This data driven approach drove 23% increase in Facebook conversions and a 700% ROI increase on Google Ad spend. The data in Segment help Domino’s understand their customers more deeply. It seems simple, but it’s not. The quality and accessibility of real time unified data is crucial to get this right and our CDP solves for all of that.
Customer data inform personalized engagement and the engagement with each message builds a better understanding of consumers, creating a flywheel that makes each part of our solution stronger together. Delivering on our vision requires ruthless prioritization and focus as we continue to derive innovation, we’re also working toward non-GAAP operating profitability in 2023. We’ve taken a hard look at the work we’re doing in R&D and whether it’s fully aligned with our vision for the customer engagement platform.
We are investing strategically into our core CPaaS products to improve margins and maintain our market leadership position. To reduce costs, we’re adding additional self-service capabilities and modernizing our infrastructure. We are focusing on speeding up development in Segment, Flex and Engage where we can deliver differentiated solutions by combining our data foundation and communication channels.
This includes fully integrated CDP data into our engagement software. And all of this will generate increased value for Twilio and for our customers. The market opportunity for our customer engagement software exists because we help businesses solve real problems. Businesses need to be able to measure the ROI of every interaction they take, and this has become even more critical in the current challenging macroeconomic environment.
Today, they face three main challenges in accomplishing this. First, even as the privacy landscape has shifted over 81% of businesses still rely on third-party data. In fact, the number of businesses relying exclusively on first party data to part personalization has increased 6 points year-over-year. In order to craft personalized messaging or targeting, companies will need to shift to first party data and deprecate third-party cookies.
Second. Today, we understand more than ever that personalization is tied to revenue growth with over 60% of consumers saying that there will likely be a repeat buyer after a personalized shopping experience. However, to drive that personalization companies need a unified profile of their customers. Legacy software stacks, including CRM, keep this data siloed. That means that customer data available to business teams is often out of date, especially when it comes to customer intent. This creates barrier to delivery, tailored experiences in real time.
Finally, consumers want to make a decision of how business engages with them. They want to be able to communicate with businesses directly on channels they use every day. We see that 70% of companies that invest in engagement tools see an increase in revenue. When I speak to customers, I hear over and over that Twilio’s customer engagement platform solves these challenges for them.
Twilio Flex is Twilio’s contact and service center platform is a great example of the value delivered by Twilio’s customer engagement platform. To deliver tailored experiences, we saw our customers start to build alternative contact centers using our APIs. They wanted to drive revenue and customer satisfaction scores and create loyal customers and not just improve operational efficiency. So we created Flex, software that allows companies to create a unique differentiated experience for their customers that could be customized to their own specific workflows without having to build from scratch.
Flex can adapt to individual business needs and integrate with their CX stack, including with partners like Google Cloud, Call Center AI. Our approach also allows companies to provide agents with all the context and customer data they need to personalize their responses and drive better customer outcomes much faster.
So when Nubank, one of the world’s largest digital banking platforms wanted customer service to set them apart from traditional banks, they chose Flex to serve their 54 million customers saving 113 million hours of wait time and achieving an NPS score of over 90. With Twilio powering communication, Flex customers like HubSpot and Bosch have the ability to reliably scale to serve millions of their customers globally.
This is the strengths of Twilio software. This is why we’re excited for our future and the opportunity that lies ahead. As Jeff mentioned, the combination of CPaaS and CDP, it’s even more powerful when offering differentiated marketing experience, which is why we’re so excited that Engage is now generally available in market.
While Flex was originally designed to re-imagine the contact center, Engage brings marketing into the digital first era. With Engage marketers no longer need to rely on the entire data team to target the right group of customers or personal life content. Engage removes data silos because it’s built on top of the segment CDP. Engage enables marketers to create customer journeys built on real time data, triggering personalized messages at critical moments like abandoned shopping cart reminders or an onboarding message that helps the customer pick up right where they left off.
You’ll hear more about how customers are using this new product for our President of Revenue, Elena, in just a moment. But with Engage and with Flex, we are creating high margin avenues for future growth for Twilio by solving real business problems for our customers. As we look forward, we are committed to continue and help businesses deliver exceptional customer experiences. This means continuing to build one unified reliable platform with global reach, a platform that is built on modern infrastructure and accelerated by Twilio’s foundation in product led growth and self-service.
Our unified platform allows Twilio to act as a strategic business partner to businesses, advising them on their end-to-end customer engagement strategy, because we have the unique ability to provide solutions across the entire customer journey. The customer engagement platform unifies the customer and communication data, customer profile that include communication history can drive more relevant engagement, deeper relationship, and improve ROI for our customers, and that is Twilio’s sustainable competitive advantage.
Last but not least, our software will bring intelligence to the customer engagement stack. Using AI, Twilio will make recommendations on how business should act on their customer data and the journeys those customers should take, whether that means predicting the right next step for a customer or generating a lookalike audience.
So as you’ve heard, we are extremely excited for the future of Twilio’s products and for what our teams will continue to build on these pillars. And more personally, I’m honored to charge forward and execute against the opportunity ahead with a team of incredible product leaders.
Next up, Elena will share with you our plans for getting all of these great products into the hands of our customers. Thanks, Eyal. I joined Twilio six months ago into the President of Revenue role, but I’m not brand new to Twilio. Prior to taking this role, I was a member of the Board for just over six years. So I’ve had some cycles on the journey with our customers, our products, and with our team.
I change seeds because I love the business and the opportunity ahead and because I have a huge appetite for this particular stage of evolution and associated type of work, leaning into the transformative software solutions that are still in their early days while delivering more efficient scale for our communication solutions.
And that’s what’s really top of mind for me right now. What excites me most is the massive opportunity we have in our market. Our software solutions are unlocking new value for our customers, providing them with the data and insights they need to truly know and engage their customers. And combined with our communications products, they allow our customers to deliver the right message or e-mail at the right time informed by those insights.
We know that our software solutions require solution oriented selling and deep customer relationship building, and we’re now being much more deliberate about developing those skills, those customer relationships, leveraging the trust and reputation we’ve built while solving new and broader problems for our customers.
And finally, we’ve made some recent changes to our go-to-market model to continue to grow our messaging products much more efficiently, relying more on digital self-service capabilities, automation and better calibration of our talent to the work to be done. Despite the short-term headwinds that Jeff mentioned, I feel extremely confident about our long-term opportunity and I’m excited to talk through the details of how I think we’ll get there.
One of the most powerful leverage points we have at Twilio is our vast and growing customer base. Historically, we’ve excelled at reaching our developer audiences, but we’ve also reached into enterprises. As we now have more than 280,000 active customer accounts around the world with approximately two-thirds of our revenue coming from the large enterprise and mid-market categories.
As I’ve spoken to customers over the past few months, I consistently walk away excited by their excitement, they’re loyal, consistently trying new things and looking forward to seeing what we’ll do next that they can build on. We have an opportunity to introduce those customers to new value via our high margin software solutions. We need to be able to cross-sell while also effectively hunting for new customers.
We have the scale and breadth to do just that. We’re investing in our strategic solutions selling capabilities so that we can expand within our existing accounts and acquire new logos with a highly skilled team and tailored sales motion catered to enterprise decision makers. We’ve also identified many areas where we can build greater self-service capabilities and let customers discover and deploy our solutions on their own with help from us only when they need it.
Finally, we have one of the largest messaging e-mail and voice platforms in the world, as well as the leading customer data platform upon which to build customer engagement solutions for multiple parts of the enterprise as Eyal talked about. So I’m really exciting about the key levers we have here, a large customer base to bring more value to our scaled team and the strategic selling capabilities we’re building, as well as opportunities to drive much greater efficiencies through automation.
And we have this incredible product portfolio to leverage to place and to connect, creating wins for customers that are super hard to replicate. Communications and conversations are so often about engagement. This drives the exciting synergies between our products and the cross-sell opportunity we’re pursuing. Adding Segment provides deep insights about a customers’ journey and preferences to better use our messaging products or Flex when engaging with users.
If you look at just our messaging customer base, the use cases fall into roughly three categories, marketing, verification, and conversational sales support. In the marketing use case, a customer might use Twilio’s messaging products to promote special offers to existing customers, but without the right data to build their target profiles and map their customer journeys, our customer can’t consistently deliver the right message to their customer on the right channel at the right times.
That’s where Segment comes in. And if the customer adds Engage on top of Segment, they can not only trigger the right interactions in real time, but they also know when not to engage with a customer. For example, if that customer just purchased a product that’s being currently promoted, other customers use Twilio messaging products for conversational sales support, which gives us another opportunity to cross-sell. By adding Flex, our customers can engage and interact with their prospects at the moment of consideration by immediately connecting them with the right sales rep or expert in one click.
A great example of this is our customer HubSpot. Their reps used to use their own personal devices to manage customer relationships on WhatsApp, but Twilio was able to enable a complete WhatsApp integration in just a few weeks. Then the company added the chat on WhatsApp option to their talk to sales pages, which connected them directly to a rep in one click, which drove a 4% increase in people clicking through to talk to sales.
Over time, as customers add Segment to Flex, they can see the right target profile, what we call the golden profile, which gives them crucial insights about their customer and the data they need to optimize the experience for that customer. Finally, even in our most basic messaging use case where we’re doing simple verification, there’s an opportunity to cross-sell additional Twilio products such as silent network authentication, which gives users a seamless onboarding experience by validating them in the background with the carriers.
These use cases can create the connection to incremental customer value through additional solutions. And they also demonstrate how we’re expanding our target audience, giving us multiple land and expand paths within companies. We’ve historically sold to product builders and developers with our messaging products being a typical land. We now have a large global customer based across all our software solutions too, all across the enterprise.
More recently, we’re also targeting and actively landing software deals with new expanded personas. We’re landing enterprise data teams and marketing teams with Segment CDP. TravelPerk is a great example where the marketing team wanted to build customer lifecycle campaigns to keep users engaged.
Segment gave their data analytics team clean customer data to build an attribution model to find out what specifically attracted customers to their website. With Flex, in addition to cloud contact centers, we’re beginning to sell inbound sales support scenarios where a digital contact center solution like Flex can provide key capabilities with a future opportunity to amplify value with Segment, CDP and Frontline.
Marketing teams overall are projected to spend over $20 billion in MarTech in the U.S. in 2022. These organizations are used to running countless tasks and living with opaque results. We can do better for marketers and Twilio has an important role to play in this large and developing market.
Our expansive partner ecosystem is another lever we’ll continue to use to efficiently capture new business and grow within existing customer relationships, but we’re prioritizing a few key partner motions that we think will support greater long-term leverage for go-to-market. We’ll continue to focus on consulting and reseller partners so that we can deploy our solutions quickly and support customer implementations.
We’ll also continue to invest in our technology partners as they strengthen our industry offering and drive broader platform solutions. ISVs have been a critical path to our indirect product growth and we believe BPOs can also contribute to that as well, so we will continue to build on those partnerships to increase our go-to-market efficiency and distribution.
Our customers are validating the compounding value they can achieve by consuming more products with us over time. We’re addressing real problems and delivering the right solutions one step at a time. We’ve already closed some very strategic deals with large Fortune 100 companies in the U.S. who chose Twilio as their technology partner to reinvent how they engage with their customers and we’ll give them the data they need to efficiently drive customer loyalty through real time engaging interactions. And the momentums building just in the last few quarters, we’ve successfully cross sold Flex, Segment or both into over 300 CPaaS customers.
A great example of this is a Fortune 500 financial services company whose journey with us began with our messaging API some years ago. They then added voice and e-mail. They added Segment last year to drive more personalization for customer retention and cross-sell opportunities. And then recently they built a mobile app leveraging Twilio messaging and they’re now implementing Flex to directly connect their contact center via the mobile app.
In 2013, our annual revenue with this customer was about $350,000. Today, we expect this customer to generate approximately $8 million in annual revenue. These solutions are enabling this customer to collect all of the unique signals generated by their financial products, develop a more trusted and comprehensive view of their customers and personalize the engagement experience to drive greater adoption of their products.
Another example is a large Fortune 100 retailer in the U.S. They started as a voice customer with some messaging in 2016 and then began a pilot of Flex starting in 2021. After completion of the pilot, the customer decided to replace all of their contact centers with Flex. Before we expanded this customer relationship with Flex, our expected annual revenue was approximately $700,000 a year. After the full implementation of Flex is done at the end of 2023, our annual revenue is projected to be over $7 million a year, and now we’re learning how to replicate these successes over and over again.
Twilio Engage is where the value we provide compounds yet again. When we first started talking to potential customers about Engage, a key conversation point was around the ability to deliver individualized interactions with all their customers on any channel from a single platform. As we moved into our early beta phase with customers, it became clear that engages most powerful capability was the ability to act on customer data from our CDP in real time.
So we’re working hard to upgrade existing CDP customers to take advantage of Engage as well as pitching the power of what Engage can do for marketing teams across the world. One of our beta customers, a large Canadian retailer just went into production and is a great example of the value Engage is delivering.
The marketing and analytics data team historically spent weeks batching up data, going into multiple databases and struggling trying to find the right tables. By the time they synthesized the data for the marketing team, the insights were likely already outdated, but then the marketing team would develop at their outreach campaign over the course of additional days and weeks, making the data even more outdated by the time the campaign finally launched.
Deploying outdated campaigns based on outdated data wasn’t working for them, so they implemented Engage to drive real time action powered by the segment CDP. Now, their marketing analytics team can instantly get all the data they need in one source. They can update their campaigns in real time to match the customer’s activity and utilize trigger events like abandoned cart to reengage them at the right moment.
Businesses have always wanted to know their customers to engage them personally one-on-one, but it hasn’t been possible at scale until now. With Engage now generally available, we expect to see and cultivate strong demand for this, especially as budgets tighten and companies must continue to do more with less.
Investing in our software sales growth will unlock more customer value while changing the economic profile of Twilio. Those software solutions will also fuel more messaging growth and as we drive more efficient placement of messaging and servicing of messaging customers, our operating margin grows.
These principles drove the changes that we implemented as part of our restructuring that we announced at September. We believe this will set up our go-to-market team for long-term selling success. One of the key things I did when I joined Twilio was to dig deep into the lessons learned from the initial integration of Segment into Twilio, and while I don’t think that the end goal was off-base, our approach for integration of the sales force and sales process were overly aggressive.
We didn’t properly enable Twilio field sales. We also made some decisions that led to significantly elevated attrition across the sellers that were most knowledgeable of the Segment product. Selling communications, APIs and software is different from selling a customer data platform from methodology to buying persona and behaviors. We needed to develop strong sales plays that would be relevant to Twilio customers and take the time to fully enable the right segment of our sales team to drive success before integrating the entire team into our existing Twilio sales team.
We’ve learned a number of lessons from these missteps. We’ve now hired the capacity we need and we’re onboarding new segment and engaged focused talent, while we also enable our enterprise sellers to originate segment and engage business. As such, we’ve stabilized the team. We anticipate new segment lands to reaccelerate in the coming quarters.
We’re also shifting to a self-service sales model at the lower end of the customer base to maximize efficiency, so I’m excited by these changes and the strengths I see in capability and capacity as we head into 2023. At the end of the day, our goal with the go-to market organization is to operationalize a very different sales model.
One where our small accounts can drive profitable growth on their own through self-service motions and only targeted engagement from our team and where our product AEs and strategic global AEs are focused on driving high value revenue growth across the top segments of our go-to-market model.
In summary, it comes down to driving efficiency, where we’ve been overweight and investing for profitable growth where we see the potential to create enormous client value in a large and growing market. The go-to-market transformation journey has begun and we’ve kicked off multiple initiatives to support it.
First, we’re amplifying our self-service capability and ensuring more automated acquisition and support of our smaller customers and developers. Our product-led growth capabilities will be critical to profitably growing the volume customer base and retaining them with innovations and features that create more value and drive more consumption.
By cross-selling our software solutions into messaging customer base, we can grow the overall share of wallet that’s at the top end of our customer base. This is both a go-to-market motion and work our products can do for us. In addition, we’ve invested heavily in building out our Segment and Flex sales teams to ensure coverage and capacity for cross-selling and new logo growth.
And finally, longer term partners will be a key leverage factor for us to efficiently scale sales and implementation. These actions will begin to move the needle in the coming quarters and drive a fundamental shift of our go-to-market model across the next two to three years. While the current macro environment is leading to some delays and purchase decisions and slightly longer sales cycles, we continue to have strong demand and we’re going to play through it. The market is there. We have a fantastic product portfolio and I’m excited about the opportunity ahead.
And now I’ll turn it over to Khozema, who will walk us through the financial overview and key metrics. Thanks, Elena, and thanks to all of you for joining us here today. My name is Khozema Shipchandler and I’m Twilio’s Chief Operating Officer. Before getting to the meat of the discussion, I wanted to quickly reflect on a few key things that are top of mind for me as COO, which you’ll hear reiterated throughout my presentation.
First, as a company, we are laser focused on driving disciplined organic growth. Over the past few years, we’ve oriented the company more towards growth at the expense of profitability, in an effort to execute against the significant market opportunity ahead of us, which allowed us to capture share. While we continue to be focused on driving attractive levels of growth going forward. We will do so in a balanced fashion. As we tune the dials more towards profitability and begin to recognize economies of scale. In addition, we maintain a strong balance sheet, which provides a significant flexibility as we continue to evaluate our broader capital allocation strategy and the trade-offs between organic investment, strategic M&A and potential capital returns to investors. However, our predominant focus in the immediate term is continuing to accelerate organic growth in our software portfolio.
Second, we are committed to delivering non-GAAP operating profitability starting in 2023 and to meaningfully growing our operating margins each year thereafter. While I know there have been a lot of recent questions regarding our gross margin trajectory, as Jeff highlighted, our plan has us delivering non-GAAP operating profit in 2023 irrespective of the short-term gross margin volatility. I’ll explain why this is the case later in the presentation.
Finally, as a business, we’re focused on delivering consistency and repeatability in performance and metrics. We began this effort earlier this year by tightening our guidance policy to give investors a better sense of where we expect our results to come in. And we’ll continue by giving more consistent metric disclosures for the areas that matter. Now, let’s dive in. I’d like to remind investors that the financial references are to non-GAAP measures except for revenue or unless I specify otherwise.
This afternoon, we announced another solid quarter of results for Q3 delivering $983 million of revenue, representing 33% total year-over-year growth and 32% growth on an organic basis. Our operating loss came in at $35 million on a reported basis or $6 million if you exclude the $29 million non-cash accrual for the implementation of our new sabbatical program for tenured employees. And we continue to see strong expansion from our customers with DBNE at 122%.
For Q4, we’ve guided to revenue of $995 million to $1,005 million and an operating loss of $15 million to $5 million. This implies total 2022 revenue of approximately $3.8 billion and an operating loss of $23 million to $13 million, excluding the non-cash accrual for the sabbatical program in Q3. Based on this guidance, our total year-over-year growth is expected to be 34% or 29% on an organic basis, which is below the 30% annual revenue growth target that we established at our 2020 Investor Day.
Up until now, we have consistently over delivered on the 30% organic revenue growth target. That said, I think the question that’s on most investor’s minds is how we think about this commitment moving forward. As I mentioned in our prepared remarks for our Q3 earnings, while we had a strong third quarter, there are some short-term macro headwinds that were going to have to navigate over the coming months.
Like many of our software peers, we are starting to see impacts from the slowing macro environment, including some delays in purchasing decisions in instances of longer sales cycles. In our Q2 earnings, we mentioned pockets of softness in certain verticals including crypto, consumer on demand and social. These trends persisted in Q3 and have also extended to the retail and e-commerce verticals. As such, we think it’s prudent to pull the 30% guidance today, because of the rapidly evolving external environment.
We’ll continue guiding on a quarter-to-quarter basis and while we believe we’ll still deliver attractive levels of growth moving forward. Our focus is on building a great business, not just a big business. And we’re orienting the company driving meaningful levels of non-GAAP operating profitability moving forward.
We’re going to emerge a materially better company out of 2022 and an even better company out of 2023. As you’ve heard from Jeff, Eyal and Elena, we have the right products, the right team, and a massive market opportunity to execute against and we continue to feel very confident about the future for Twilio.
Today, I’m going to walk you through a detailed financial overview of our business. I’ll unpack our communications and software products to provide you more visibility on how these are performing. I’ll also provide a double click on our messaging product, some of the key metrics that we track and ultimately how messaging continues to contribute attractive gross profit dollars at scale, despite pressuring our overall consolidated gross margins. I’ll then discuss how we’re continuing to drive leverage as we scale, before closing things out with a few thoughts on what all of this means moving forward.
Let’s start with a look at where our overall business stands today. Today is our third Investor Day and it’s exciting to see the progress that we’ve made in such a short period of time. Since our first Investor Day in late 2017, we’ve grown our quarterly revenue by over 8x and based on our Q4 guidance, we’re expecting to deliver approximately $1 billion of revenue this quarter. For context, in 2019, we generated $1.1 billion of revenue for the entire year. Not only have we driven impressive growth, but we’ve done this while maintaining incredibly strong dollar based net expansion.
In fact, our DBNE in Q3 was 122% nearly the same level that it was in Q4 2017, despite the massive increase in revenue. This is a testament to the continued value we’re creating for our customers. And while revenue has grown by over 8x, our active customer accounts have grown by over 5x, evidence that we continue to deliver meaningfully more revenue per active customer account. And we’ve started to drive more efficiencies across our business, reducing non-GAAP OpEx as a percent of revenue from approximately 57% in Q4 2017 to approximately 51% in Q3 2022, excluding the $29 million non-cash accrual for our employee sabbatical program that was recently introduced.
At our last Investor Day in October of 2020, we acknowledged that we had experienced some modest tailwinds from COVID and there were some questions in terms of how resilient that growth would be. At the time, we said that we believed a lot of the acceleration sparked by COVID was sustainable, as it ultimately created new expectations from customers in terms of how they wanted to engage with brands.
The continued growth that we’ve seen since then is validation that digital transformation and a focus on more personalized customer engagement is here to stay. And we believe Twilio is incredibly well positioned to continue to win in this market. And it’s an attractive market to be in, through a combination of organic and inorganic growth, we’ve been able to significantly expand our addressable market since our IPO. And we define our TAM as the combination of the following three categories. One, core messaging, two, other communications products, and three, customer engagement software, which includes CDP, marketing campaigns, and CCaaS solutions. Based on industry analyst estimates and internal Twilio analysis, the combined TAM of these three markets is $80 billion in 2022, growing to $116 billion in 2025, representing a 13% overall CAGR with the customer engagement software portion of the TAM being the fastest growing.
Our overall market opportunity is massive. As we continue to execute against our customer engagement platform strategy, we believe we will continue to drive attractive levels of growth across this TAM moving forward. As we’ve executed against this TAM, we have delivered consistently strong revenue growth at scale. Since 2017, we’ve driven a 57% revenue CAGR and increased annual revenue more than ninefold based on our 2022 estimated revenues. We’ve added scale and expanded into new strategic adjacencies through some of our larger acquisitions including SendGrid and Segment. While organic growth has remained comfortably above our 30% target. We’re currently approaching a $4 billion revenue run rate and we continue to benefit from a number of key tailwinds that will help drive that growth moving forward. We are proud of this achievement, but know that we still have more to do and we are now facing a more difficult macro environment.
We continue to believe will be in a position to deliver attractive growth going forward, but we’re taking a more disciplined approach and orienting the business more towards growth combined with profitability. In addition to delivering strong revenue growth, we’ve consistently grown our gross profit dollars at attractive rates, ending Q3 at a 56% five-year CAGR. This is a key metric for us as we’re focused on driving meaningful levels of gross profit dollars that we can then reinvest back into other parts of the business, namely software to drive future growth, as well as providing a substantial base upon which to drive operating profit leverage.
While I know there has been a lot of commentary over the past several quarters on our gross margin trajectory, given the elevated growth of our international messaging product in particular, we’re most focused on the unit economics of our products and ensuring that all new business generates attractive levels of gross profit dollars. And as Jeff mentioned, we believe gross profit per message is more meaningful for Twilio and I’ll share some data with you today to help unpack how we think about messaging and its impact on our business.
We continue to add more strategic value to our customers, given the majority of our revenue is usage based. We ultimately succeed when our customers succeed. And as you can see from this chart, we’ve made significant progress in growing our larger customer accounts. In just two years, we’ve more than doubled the number of customers who paid us more than a $100,000 and increased customers who are paying us more than $1 million per year by almost 3x.
In our larger enterprise accounts, we’ve grown the number of customers who pay us more than $5 million and who pay us more than $10 million per year, both by almost 4x since our last Investor Day. And speaking of enterprise, we’ve previously discussed how this has been an important area of investment for us over the past few years. We continue to make solid traction here and we exited Q3 with 1,028 GDK customers, when $216 million of revenue from those customers for the quarter or over 20% of our total revenue for Q3.
While we’re just over 50% penetration of the GDK, we are still early in product adoption with many of them. And we believe we have the ability to move many of these to seven and eight figure customers over time. We also believe these accounts will continue to be sticky, particularly as they begin to adopt more of our software products. As mentioned earlier, we have an impressive DBNE and this attractive expansion is seen across all of our cohorts of customers.
New customers adopt a product and we then get to see the benefits as they expand their usage, add new use cases, and add new products over time. This is one reason we continue to be excited by our messaging product. Given its high ROI and broad range of use cases, it tends to be an easy land for new customers. This offers an initial foot in the door, enables us to build a relationship and ultimately provides an opportunity to then cross sell our other higher margin communications and software products.
We are well diversified across our business. In addition to a diverse range of products and use cases, we benefit from our revenue mix being largely balanced across enterprise, mid-market and growth companies. We also service a broad range of industries and we are not overly exposed to any specific sectors.
Twilio’s foundation is in communications. And over the last 14 years, we’ve built a comprehensive omnichannel communications platform, enabling developers and businesses to easily integrate capabilities like messaging, voice, email, video, and account security features into their apps using a set of powerful yet simple APIs. These products are predominantly usage based and generate $3.1 billion in last 12-month revenue as of Q3 2022. Messaging continues to deliver elevated growth, but it has a lower overall gross margin profile relative to the rest of Twilio’s business. Our other communications products maintain a range of different growth profiles, but all offer higher gross margins to messaging.
As Jeff, Eyal and Elena have all highlighted, we’re leveraging our strength and communications and first party data to move up stack and accelerate our momentum in software, which we define as Segment, Flex, Frontline, Engage and Marketing Campaigns. These tend to be subscription based products, generating high revenue growth and maintaining more traditional SaaS like gross margins.
Note, we have retired the use of the definition application services and will no longer be using that terminology going forward. Our communications products and in particular messaging make up the vast majority of our revenue today, 84% over the last 12 months. From a gross profit perspective, messaging is again the vast majority, but software with its higher gross margin profile makes up 17% of the total gross profit mix versus 11% of total revenue.
Although, we’re still relatively early days in software, we’re incredibly excited by the opportunity ahead for Segment, Flex and Engage. We will continue to prioritize our investments in these products as we believe they’ll generate highly attractive levels of future growth and returns over the next several years. As they continue to grow, we expect the product contribution mix to evolve and that software will become a larger portion of our revenue and gross profit.
I’ll spend the next few minutes discussing our communications products, and in particular, unpacking some of the current trends we’re seeing in messaging. As previously highlighted, our communications products currently represent the majority of our revenues. At an aggregate, grow at a strong rate, largely driven by the solid growth we’ve seen in messaging over the past several years. Since Q3 2017, we’ve delivered a five-year CAGR of 54% in communications revenue and we’re currently at a $3.3 billion annual run rate. We have a number of API-centric products in our communications portfolio, with messaging, email and voice being the largest and most established. These three products alone contributed approximately 90% of the overall communications revenue over the last 12 months, with messaging delivering 64% of the total.
As mentioned previously, messaging continues to grow at elevated rates relative to our corporate average, but carries a structurally lower gross margin profile, particularly for our higher growth international messaging revenues. The majority of non-messaging related communications revenue is high gross margin. Account security, which includes our verify product is a high growth area that we’re excited about and benefits from these high overall gross margins. The balance of our other communications products carry more moderate growth rates, but is previously stated deliver very attractive gross margins.
The scale of our messaging product is significant. Over the last 12 months, we’ve delivered over 144 billion messages on behalf of our customers, serving over 180 countries around the world. It’s an incredibly effective channel with a high ROI for our customers. And we continue to see strong demand for a wide variety of use cases. For Twilio, messaging often serves as a highly effective initial land with new customers. This provides a foot in the door, allows us to establish a new relationship and over time gives us the opportunity to cross sell our other products, all of which are higher margin.
That being said, as we’ve discussed in the past, messaging carries structurally lower gross margins relative to our other products, given the fees set by various telco networks around the world. Furthermore, our messaging gross margin has been pressured over the last several quarters as we’ve seen an increase in international growth and its domestic carriers have introduced new a2p fees, which we recognize as revenue but are pass-through to our customers at zero margin.
Given carriers have a lot of latitude to set the fees to reach their subscribers and we pass those through to customers, we do not believe that gross margin percent is the right way to evaluate the health of this business. Rather, looking at the gross profit dollars created and ensuring that the gross profit dollars are stable or growing and that these gross profit dollars are able to be efficiently turned into operating profit.
Through this lens, we continue to believe messaging is a solid product. It delivers elevated levels of growth and benefits from attractive unit economics, which can be used to drive operating profit. I’ll explain more in the coming slides. As you can see from the chart on the left, our total messaging portfolio has experienced accelerated growth over the last two years. With last 12 months Q3 2022 revenues growing to $2.0 billion. International has been a key contributor to this growth, driven both by new international messaging customers as well as an increased volume of messages sent from our domestic customers that terminate internationally.
This dynamic has shifted the mix of our messaging revenues from 51% terminating outside the U.S. in 2020 to 60% over the last 12 months. Given the lower gross margin profile of international messaging, this has contributed to a reduction in our blended messaging gross margin rate, which declined from 41% in 2020 to 33% over last 12 months Q3 2022. While the overall blended gross margin rate for messaging has declined as the mix has shifted to more international revenue, it’s worth unpacking the U.S. and international markets separately.
Looking at the U.S., as you can see from the chart on the left, our gross margin excluding fees has actually seen a slight increase since 2020 on an organic basis with a further increase attributable to M&A. However, with AT&T and T-Mobile’s introduction of 10DLC fees in 2021, following Verizon’s introduction of similar fees in 2020, you’ll see from the chart in the middle that this has had a material impact on U.S. gross margins.
When looking at these two charts in conjunction with one another, you can see that the fee pressure has significantly increased and what was an almost 6% point margin delta without fees in 2020 has turned into an almost 17 percentage point margin delta in 2022 year-to-date excluding M&A. Ultimately, these fees are recognized as revenue, but are pass-through to our customer at zero margin. They have no impact on our gross profit dollars, but they created drag on overall domestic gross margins.
Internationally, as you can see from the chart on the right, we’ve seen some variability in the overall gross margins since 2020 with a slight improvement in 2022 gross margins relative to last year. As we’ve mentioned previously, the gross margin profile for international messaging has markedly lower than the U.S. and varies country by country. As a result, we’ll tend to see more variability in our blended international messaging margin depending on the specific country revenue mix each quarter.
Our messaging product has attractive gross profit unit economics across both the U.S. and international. Looking at our gross profit per message over the past couple of years, we’ve seen stability in the U.S. at an increase in the gross profit we receive per message internationally. In fact, even though our international gross margins are lower, we actually generate more gross profit per message internationally than in the U.S. With over 144 billion messages being sent annually, we’re able to generate increasing levels of gross profit that we can use to reinvest strategically back into the business.
As highlighted, the drivers behind the reset reduction in messaging gross margins have been twofold. First, our strong growth internationally has shifted the mix of our revenues, which has reduced gross margins by 470 bps since Q2 2020. Second, the introduction of 10DLC fees by the U.S. carriers has reduced our messaging gross margins by further 280 bps as these fees are passed onto our customers at no margin.
Given the size and scale of our messaging product, the reduction in our messaging gross margin has also had a meaningful impact on our consolidated gross margins, reducing margins from 55.9% in Q2 2020 to 50.8% in our most recent quarter. However, if you adjust the 10DLC fees in the most recent quarter, our Q3 gross margins would’ve been 54.1%.
To summarize, the drivers behind the recent reduction in messaging gross margins have been fees and mix, not a pricing nor competitive dynamic, put simply, we make gross profit on messaging. In fact, we make even more gross profit per each message internationally that gross profit has been steady and even increased a little over the past two years. While the gross margin percent has decreased over that period of time, we see no reason to slow down this product, as it generates attractive unit economics.
So our intention is to continue growing it. While that may mean our gross margin percent has continued variability, we think generating significant gross profit dollars that we can reinvest back into our software portfolio, as well as growing our customer base to whom we can upsell over time makes a ton of strategic sense. Doing that, while driving operating leverage is our plan. We believe there are opportunities to operate and sell our messaging products more efficiently. And as Elena mentioned, we’ve started to take action within our go-to-market approach to drive these efficiencies going forward.
Now, let’s turn to our software products, which we expect to drive high growth with high margins over the next several years. While Twilio started as a communications platform, we’ve expanded both organically and inorganically to include a strong portfolio of software products. We define software products as Flex, Segment, Marketing Campaigns, Frontline and our newest product Engage. The shift to software was driven by customer demand. It started with Flex as we consistently heard feedback from customers that they needed a customizable contact center platform.
Then, data started to become the main topic of conversation, as companies were looking for ways to leverage their existing customer data to provide even better experiences in the digital age. That led us to acquire Segment, the leading customer data platform. And now, we’ve announced the general availability of Engage, our omnichannel journey orchestration product built natively on top of Twilio segment.
This combination of data and how it is activated provides real time engagement over whichever channel a customer prefers. As you heard from Elena, this does require a different sales motion. And in many cases, we are working with different buyers that our core CPaaS offerings. Software requires an experienced sales team who know how to sell to sophisticated buyers, and we’ve been investing in our sales capacity around that skill set.
We’re already seeing some great results from those investments and from the sales portfolio overall. Twilio Segment is processing more than 1 trillion events each month, enabling companies to leverage the first party data they have on their customers for better engagement. Flex continues to deliver great results as well. In fact, Flex crossed the $100 million revenue run rate mark in the third quarter, just four years after launching the product. This is a great milestone for Flex, but we’re just getting started.
Looking a bit closer at our software products, you can see that Segment is our largest software product today, followed by Flex and Marketing Campaigns. We’ve also included Frontline and Engage in our software portfolio. However, with both of them being relatively new, they’re not driving material revenue today, but they represent important pieces of the customer engagement platform. Importantly, when you look at the right side of this page, you’ll see that in addition to our customers telling us how important these products are for them, these products also have great financial profiles.
This portfolio generally delivers high growth with 75% plus gross margin, meaning as this portfolio of products continues to grow and becomes a bigger portion of our total revenue, we’ll see an uplift to our consolidated gross margins. Again, we have work to do here, but as Elena mentioned, we’re reorienting our sales organization to put the full power of Twilio behind our software portfolio, and we’re confident that over time we’ll continue to grow and scale these products as customers embrace our customer engagement platform vision.
Speaking of Flex, I wanted to provide a little bit of a closer look at what the revenue ramp looks like for Flex customers. While a majority of our CPaaS products are usage based, our software products are primarily subscription based, meaning they have a bit of a different revenue ramp that takes a little longer. This is true for Flex as it’s extremely rare for a company to change their entire contact center footprint at one time. These two reasons are why despite our progress with Flex, you don’t see an immediate impact on our financials. This chart shows the average quarterly revenue since the start of last year from our top 10 Flex customers as of the end of Q3 2022.
You’ll see that since the start of last year, our top 10 customers have more than doubled their spend on Flex as they continue to find value in the platform and expand their usage across multiple teams and organizations. Again, when customers are rolling Flex out to thousands of agents, this is typically done over several quarters or even years. This is a great sign for what’s to come with Flex as our unique and flexible platform allows our customers to truly customize Flex to support their customer support and customer experience.
We see a similar growth trend with Segment. This chart shows the average ARR expansion for the top five Twilio Segment customers from when they first signed a contract through the next three years. Again, this shows a great growth trajectory, but you can see that it doesn’t happen overnight. This is why there may sometimes be a disconnect between our excitement for the traction we’re seeing in software and what you’re seeing flow through to the financials early on.
Our software portfolio is much earlier in its life cycle compared to our communications products, but we’re happy with the progress we’ve made thus far and the feedback from customers has been very positive. And with Twilio Engage, officially GA, we’re adding yet another growth factor to our software portfolio. We have more work to do from continuing to innovate and adding new features and functionality to continuing to hire and enable additional experienced software solutions salespeople. But we’re on the right track and we believe that the combination of our leading communications products combined with our software portfolio is a unique differentiator that will help us win this market.
Now that we’ve discussed several of the growth aspects of the business, let’s turn to discuss how we will strike the balance between growth and profitability and how we plan to drive operating leverage going forward. For the last several years, we’ve been clear that our focus has been investing in growth. And we’ve seen the payoff from those investments in our top line results. However, even with our focus on growth, we have driven improvements and our total OpEx since 2019, while also absorbing several acquisitions over that same time period. We’ve made focused efforts to shift our hiring to locations outside of the Bay Area and we’ve started to see the benefits of scale and automation in areas like G&A.
As you can see, sales and marketing has stayed relatively flat over this time period as we’ve invested in building out our software, enterprise and international sales teams, which are producing strong results. But while we’ve made some progress in reducing our overall OpEx, given the need to drive further prioritization across the organization combined with the dynamic macro environment, it became clear that we needed to make more significant actions to right size our expenses and put ourselves in the path for delivering consistent non-GAAP operating income starting in 2023 and driving annual improvements that thereafter.
First, as you’re likely aware, we announced a restructuring in September, resulting in an 11% reduction in our workforce. I’ll talk more about the details in a moment, but that action removed approximately $200 million of annual costs from the business. Second, as we discussed on our second quarter earnings call, we have slowed the pace of new hires in a majority of the business. While we continue to focus our hiring efforts on high priority strategic areas like Segment, Engage and Flex, we are limiting the number of new hires and backfills in the other areas of the business. This is expected to save approximately $100 million of annual costs.
And finally, we also announced our decision to become a remote first company and made a significant reduction in our real estate footprint, which has driven approximately $30 million of annual savings. We’ll continue to closely monitor the returns on our investments, make adjustments as needed, and evaluate opportunities to increase efficiency and improve profitability as we scale our business.
Let me take a moment to provide a bit more detail in the restructuring actions. As you can imagine, this was not an easy decision, but ultimately we felt like this was the right decision for the long-term health of the business. The restructuring was largely focused on our sales and marketing organization. We made changes to shift more of our sales focus to support our software portfolio, while promoting more self-service in areas where a high touch model isn’t necessary such as messaging. We also reduce the size of our support teams and consolidated teams who are duplicating efforts. And as I discussed earlier, we are continuing to shift hiring away from high cost locations as we scale the organization.
In R&D, we move from a general manager led model to a functional model, allowing us to fully align our product, engineering, onboarding and other teams to avoid duplicative work, breakdown silos and allow us to move more quickly. We also implemented more consistent span of control guidelines to help us reduce unnecessary layers of management. In G&A, we move transactional roles to lower cost regions and as a result of the changes in go-to-market, we also reduce size of our team supporting go-to-market within the G&A organization.
And finally, given the current hiring freeze and limited backfills, we also scale down our recruiting organization. Again, this was an extremely difficult decision. Twilio has always been a growth company, but we grew our headcount too quickly in the last couple of years and we needed to refocus and align our investments more squarely with our corporate priorities. With our focus on profitability, I wanted to give you a quick look at how to think about our OpEx as we move forward. In the medium term, which we think of being three to five years out, you should expect sales and marketing to come down by 300 to 600 basis points and both R&D and G&A to gain some modest efficiencies.
We expect that we’ll be able to drive these results through a combination of taking advantage of our scale, more automation and leveraging more hiring and lower cost regions. When we look out longer term, we expect that we’ll be able to deliver the most additional leverage in our sales and marketing line item while R&D and G&A will continue to decline at a bit of a slower rate, but still improve as the business further scales.
Ultimately, it’s important to understand that we are increasingly focused on driving operating leverage throughout the business as we scale, and that even if we see continued pressure and gross margin, we will deliver incremental profitability through this additional leverage. Another important area of focus as we build leverage throughout the company is stock-based compensation, which averaged approximately 22% of revenue in Q3 year-to-date. As we look at 2023, we do expect SBC to show some increase as we continue to absorb the impact of the high levels of headcount growth we’ve seen the last couple years.
However, we do have a target to reduce SBC in the medium term to 15% to 20% of revenue, and we’ve been proactively taking steps to achieve this leverage over time, including the recent restructuring and slowing of headcount growth, diversifying the locations where we hire employees and targeting lower cost geographies and tying annual equity awards to performance. We’ve heard your feedback and while this is not a number we can decrease immediately, we’re confident that the actions we’re taking will drive this number down over the next several years.
Now, let’s take a few minutes to discuss what this all means moving forward. As we’ve discussed throughout this presentation, our three main priorities are to, one, grow our messaging business more efficiently, two, accelerate momentum in our software business, and three, drive operating leverage across the business to deliver non-GAAP operating profit beginning in 2023. We have been taking proactive actions to ensure we can effectively execute as a company and we’re committed to delivering against all of these moving forward.
We also remain committed to our 20% plus long-term non-GAAP operating margin target, which remains unchanged from our last Investor Day. We’ve developed a financial framework to highlight our key areas of focus in the short to medium-term that are aligned to these priorities. The goal is to have a short list of metrics that provide more clarity and targets, which can then be used to assess our overall performance. These targets exclude the impact of any potential future M&A.
Starting with the top line, we’re going to continue driving attractive levels of organic growth and really focus our efforts on accelerating software. Given the current macro headwinds and our recent go-to-market shift towards software, we’re going to continue to guide quarter-to-quarter for 2023 and over the medium-term, which we define as being three to five years out, we’re targeting our organic revenue growth to be in the 15% to 25% range per year and we’ll be targeting 30% plus for our software products.
Given the majority of our revenues continue to be usage based today together with the current volatility we’re seeing from the macro environment, we’ve provided a wider range for organic revenue growth that reflects the fact that usage based revenues are harder to forecast over the longer term. However, as our software products grow at more elevated rates relative to the rest of the business and as the macro headwinds subside, we expect that we’ll be able to tighten this range over time, given software revenue tends to be more predictable than usage based revenue.
As previously discussed, we’ll continue to grow our messaging business assuming the unit economics remain attractive. And therefore, we anticipate that our gross margins will see continued variability throughout 2023. In the medium-term, we do see stabilization and ultimately gross margin appreciation as software continues to become a bigger portion of revenues. We’re committed to delivering non-GAAP operating profits starting next year and we expect this to grow each year thereafter. We’re targeting annual non-GAAP operating margin improvements of 100 to 300 basis points in 2024 and through the medium-term.
Finally, we’ll continue to actively track our stock-based compensation and take steps to reduce this in the medium-term. As previously mentioned, we expect SBC to increase modestly in 2023 as we continue to absorb the impact of the high levels of headcount growth we’ve seen in the last couple of years. However, in the medium-term, we’re targeting to bring down SBC to 15% to 20% of revenue.
Netting everything out, here are the key takeaways in terms of how to think about the financial framework moving forward. We anticipate that the current macro headwinds will have an adverse impact on our growth rate in the short term. This is why we’ve moved away from the 30% annual organic growth target. While we believe we’ll still be able to deliver attractive levels of growth moving forward, we acknowledge that there could be some choppiness in the short-term.
As Elena discussed, we’ve made a number of changes in our go-to-market organization to optimize for more effective selling of software. We believe these will begin to move the needle in the coming quarters as reps continue to ramp to capacity. It will ultimately take some time to move from bookings to revenue and software, but we’re confident we can deliver against the 30% plus annual revenue growth target in the medium-term.
We’re committed to delivering non-GAAP operating profit next year and to drive meaningful operating margin increases each year thereafter. Excluding any impacts from potential future M&A. We expect SBC to moderate over time and our plan is to deliver free cash flow in the near to medium-term. We’ll continue to actively assess our capital allocation strategy. We have a strong balance sheet, which provides us significant flexibility in terms of how we best optimize capital allocation between organic investments, strategic M&A and potential returns to share owners.
And with that, let me turn it back over to Jeff to provide some closing remarks. Thanks, Khozema. We provided you all with a lot of information today between myself, Eyal, Elena and Khozema. Before we take Q&A, I wanted to go back to where I started with a summary of our plan. First, messaging is a good business. We provided a lot of disclosures to unpack unit economics and mix, but at its core, we generate a lot of gross profit dollars in messaging. We’re using product led growth to get much more efficient in how we run and distribute the product. So long as we continue doing this at increasingly profitable rates, we will continue to grow this business as fast as we can.
Second, our customer engagement software products Segment, Engage and Flex are the next act for Twilio. Segment in particular, because data is at the core of every B2C company’s execution and we have a world class and leading CDP that they need. And for Twilio, data unlocks so many other ways to add value to companies by infusing context into every interaction, insights into every campaign and intelligence through machine learning and more. We know how to sell Segment. And we have rebuilt sales team with the goal of growing this business at high rates over a long period of time.
Third, we will bring together our leading CPaaS and leading CDP products to unlock more value in our software applications layer. We believe our products together are uniquely positioned to deliver exceptional value through integrating these products such as in Twilio Engage and via upselling and cross-selling as Elena articulated. This is still early and thoughtful integrations take time, but this is our plan.
Fourth, we are laser focused I’m generating near-term profitability and will continue to drive operating leverage in successive periods afterwards. We’ve already made some difficult decisions to put us on this path. But our plan is simple, drive more leverage from our scaled communications business through product led growth and more efficient distribution while putting more and more of those go-to-market resources on selling our software products over time. We have the right team in place to ensure we will gain this leverage over a long period of time.
Finally, we’ve provided you with a financial framework, which we think is the best way to think about and run our business going forward. We will use this as a means to assess and report on our performance every quarter. Four of the five metrics you can already see in our reported financials and software growth called out as the fifth metric in our financial framework we will begin disclosing quarterly, top line growth, gross profit growth, and bottom line growth are ultimately what matter. That’s where we are focused.
And lastly, not only are we focused on profitability, you should expect to see ongoing leverage in each of our cost categories with special emphasis on sales and marketing and G&A going forward. As I’ve said many times, it’s day one for Twilio. We have the products we need, we have an amazing customer base, we have the financial framework, and we have the team and we just need to keep executing.
Thank you for your time today and for coming with us on this journey. And with that, we’ll take a short break before opening things up for Q&A. Questions by the built in Q&A feature in the webcast and we will read them aloud during the session. See you soon.
[Break] All right. Welcome back to the Q&A portion of our Investor Day event. This is Bryan Vaniman, Twilio’s SVP of Investor Relations and Corporate Development, and I’m joined with today’s presenters, Jeff Lawson, Eyal Manor, Elena Donio and Khozema Shipchandler. Thanks to those who have submitted questions thus far. I’ll be moderating the Q&A session. So if anyone has further questions throughout the discussion, please submit them through the built-in Q&A feature in the webcast. And with that, let’s get started.
The first question is from Derrick Wood of Cowen. Jeff, in your letter around the restructuring announcement, you talked about wanting the company to be doing fewer things better and that you found that some investments no longer make sense. What areas of the business are you doing to dial down and how should we think about the impact to revenue and margins? Yes, thank you for the question, Derrick. Really it’s about simplifying. We’re focused on growing messaging profitability. We’re focused on growing segment and engage. We’re focused on growing Flex. And for each of these three areas, we have our areas of focus that are making them better. For messaging, it’s investing in product like growth. For Segment, it’s really a focus on our go-to-market enablement and growing our sales team. For Flex, it’s about our platform scale and being able to sign deals like we did this quarter for more than 20,000 seats. Internally, we’re also undertaking to simplify. We’re replatforming our data and our compute platforms to both save money, but also to get more consistency. So if you think about it, many of our products, which historically have had their own go-to-market motions.
Our aligning – we’re aligning them more efficiently behind the primary go-to-market motions of those three products and helping them to contribute to their success. There is only so many land products that a company can do well, so this is where focus I think really helps. For example, voice works best when it’s sold in the context of a contact center buyer, which Flex is attracting. So we’re kind of looking at it and saying if other activities that we’re doing aren’t relevant to the success of messaging’s profit generation segment or Flex’s customer growth, then we’re really looking for that relevancy and alignment ASAP. That’s kind of where I take it. Excellent. Next question is Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley and also Derrick Wood from Cowen had the same question. How much of the Q4 slow down is a direct result of the restructuring effort and changes in compensation structure versus a slowdown in the macro environment? And we’ll have Khozema answer that. Great. Thank you, Derrick. Thank you, Meta. But there’s not actually a near term impact to revenue from the restructuring. In fact, one way to think about it is, is that if we actually had the same number of salespeople today, there would actually not be a difference in our revenue guide. And really what it is, is that the business is still growing, it’s growing nicely, but it’s just growing at a rate that’s a little bit lower than what we would have expected a few quarters back just because of the macro headwinds that we talked a lot about during the course of the presentation. And as you can see from, for example, our cohort chart as well as our expansion rate, we’re still driving growth certainly with our existing customers in a lot of different industries, but we do have some exposure to customers that are in macro sensitive industries and that’s causing us to see some slower instances of growth going forward, which is why we got it the way that we did. All right, next question from Rishi Jaluria from RBC. How should we think about political contribution in the fourth quarter given the strong midterm advertising spending environment? And we’ll have Jeff answer that. Yes, thanks, Bryan and thanks Rishi for the good question. Now, unlike prior years, our Q3 and Q4 this year largely exclude a political spike in traffic and revenue because we made the decision to off board a lot of that traffic from our platform after the 2020 election. And the reason why is that traffic was from customers who did not intend to honor our acceptable use policy with regards to consumer opt-ins, and therefore we decided to refuse their business in this election cycle. I presume they went to other providers, but to us the short-term revenue benefit in the election cycle is not – it’s just not worth the friction with consumers who get really annoyed by this traffic or with carriers who’ve raised repeated concerns about this traffic. And when those campaigns really refuse to get opt-in, and I’m sure as consumers we all feel that, I think that creates a lot of problems. All right. Next question is from Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. Is there no way to offload international messaging traffic to a third party to avoid the margin pressure? Is there no low bar margin wise in chasing international messaging traffic? Khozema? Great, thanks for the question, Ittai. As we showed you in the presentation, we actually generate very attractive gross profit unit economics internationally even more so than domestically. And we wanted to provide that disclosure so that you have visibility to the way that we think about running that part of the business. And as long as it’s the case that we generate continued strong gross profit unit economics, we’re going to continue investing in growing our international messaging business because it obviously provides gross profits that we can reinvest back into the business and as also previously discussed messaging serves as an effective land with new customers. And so as we grow internationally, we believe that this enables us to establish relationships with new customers and then we can obviously ultimately up-sell our portfolio of higher margin software and other communications products. What I would add as well is, is that obviously the gross profit unit economics are quite good based upon the charts that we showed you, but ultimately we want those sales to be up profit accretive and that’s what we’re really laser focused on. All right, next question is from Matt VanVliet from BTIG. With so many customers and SI partners, viewing the connection of CRM systems and customer data and thus CDPs as inseparable. How can segment break down this mindset and outsell Salesforce and Adobe on the CDP front? What else needs to be sold with segment to clearly change your customer’s perceptions? And we’ll give that to Elena. Hi, Matt. Thanks for your question. First Segment is the market leader and we’re strategically focused on distributing that product more and more efficiently. I’m super confident that we have the right team and strategy to grow and scale our software business overall. We’ve got a good starting point with Segment and now we’ve got and just go continue to execute. It is not lost on us that they are both big formidable competitors as well as some small ones along the way as well. But they don’t have our same product capabilities and they don’t have our strong synergies across other Twilio products. We’re currently at SIGNAL at the moment, our annual customer conference. It’s been really fun to talk to existing customers as well as prospects while we’re here. I had a chance this morning to sit down with a large segment customer and they described their large and complex ecosystem of sales and marketing systems inside their four walls.
Their data is siloed. It’s disconnected. It’s really slow to propagate. And the implications to what they can do for their customers and prospects is really profound. It means multiple messages are going to customers for multiple products in an uncoordinated and sometimes even conflicting manner with no ability to draw cross product correlations within that construct. So Segment and Engage, especially when they’re coupled together, can bring this all to a head and bring it all together regardless of what’s already in place behind the scenes. So net as we see our capability separate from the incumbent CRM or MarTech stack, but as an API first real time and straightforward to integrate set of solutions, it’s an actual benefit, not a hurdle to overcome, especially as we build the right relationships with our buyers. Great. We’ll move to Mike Walkley from Canaccord Genuity. With pulling the 30% revenue growth target, where are the key leverage points in the model to achieve operating margin targets and that’ll be for Khozema? Great. Thank you, Mike. As I walk through in the presentation, we actually expect leverage on all the OpEx line items, and we think there is actually further opportunity in S&M, R&D and G&A. On the sales and marketing side, one of the things that Jeff talked explicitly about is that we’re actually shifting more of our resources to software and then also moving to product like growth in self-service and in messaging and Elena spent a lot of her presentation articulating how we would do that as well. On R&D and G&A, we’ll continue to shift to lower cost GOs, for example, and leverage automation, which we think drives a lot of leverage. And ultimately it’s important to understand that we’ll continue to drive operating leverage throughout the business actually as we scale. And that even if we see continued pressure on gross margins, we will deliver incremental profitability through this additional leverage. Great. And we have another question from Rishi Jaluria from RBC. A little surprised to see Flex is only at $100 million ARR. Could you walk through your plan to turnaround the business and get it to a similar scale to other CCaaS vendors? Khozema, do you want to take that? Sure. Hi, Rishi. Thanks for the question. I wouldn’t say that it’s really a turnaround. We’re actually quite pleased with the performance of Flex and we’re excited to see that we’ve actually crossed the $100 million dollar run rate just four years actually after the product became GA. And as we mentioned in the last couple quarters, we’ve signed our two largest deals and that’s a good sign of the momentum that we’re seeing and that revenue is obviously not yet in the business, given that we just signed those customers. The other thing is, as we mentioned in our presentation, for every dollar of Flex software revenue that we recognize, we also receive over $0.70 of additional revenue through pull through of our communications products. And that amounted to about $62 million of additional communications revenue over the last 12 months.
And for us, Flex has largely performed in line with our expectations since the launch. Though, as we previously have said, the messaging around Flex probably got a little bit ahead of the product in the early days, but we’ve made great progress. We’ve built a great go to market organization and we’re really excited about the opportunity ahead. And I think we’ve also learned a lot from the launch of Flex, and we’ve applied a lot of those learnings to how we approached the GA for Engage in terms of making sure that the product was really ready to meet the expectations of the market. All right. We’ve got another follow up question for Khozema, this is also from Rishi at RBC. Can you talk about your plan to ran in SBC over time? Sorry, Rishi who? Rishi Jaluria. Rishi Jaluria. Thank you, Rishi. Fundamentally, I mean, we do need to slow the growth of our headcount relative to the growth of our revenue. And it will slow down, right, relative to our expense growth. And that will lead to some leverage on that line relative to the revenue line. As you know we committed to slowing our headcount growth given some of the recent actions that we took with respect to the restructuring.
And as we showed them presentation, we’ve also aligned stock-based compensation with employee performance, and we’re also planning to make additional changes, as I referenced in the prior question from a geo perspective. And in particular, we’ve heard from some candidates, especially in international markets, that stock is just like a very different dynamic relative to cash. And so we’ll make some changes there as well. And we’ll continue evaluating our SBC practices, of course, going forward. We do recognize it’s an important metric for our investors as it relates to GAAP profitability over time. And so we are quite focused on it. Next question is from Meta Marshall, from Morgan Stanley. When did you start to identify some of the growth issues at Segment? And was Elena’s hiring the beginning of identifying and acting on those changes? I think we’ll give that to Jeff. Thanks, Bryan. Yes, we launched our new combined sales model at the very beginning of this year and we gave this new motion some time to succeed, but it gradually became clear that a more dedicated selling effort for Segment would set us up better for success. Elena joined us around the time of this transition and we’re thrilled to have her leadership not just on this, but on every aspect of our go-to-market strategy. But as we saw it beginning to not work the way we intended it to, we took very quick action to identify the root cause and to start setting up the solution. Great. Next question is from Derrick Wood at Cowen. This one is Eyal. Eyal you mentioned that in order to reduce CPaaS costs, you are adding self-service capabilities and modernizing infrastructure. Can you double click on how this may lower COGs or OpEx of the messaging business into what magnitude this can move the needle of messaging profitability? Yes, thank you, Derrick. As one of the earliest companies to realize the benefits of product-lead growth, it is part of Twilio’s DNA to build products that are easy to implement, easy to understand and accessible to test the value of the product. With our API today, a builder can send a message or make a call in just minutes. When we think about improving self-service, we’re working to simplify the complexity of not just our products, but the telecom ecosystem. As an example, our 10DLC registration process makes compliance with telecom regulations easy through our APIs. We’re also planning on things like simplifying our product skews, so it will be easier for customers to understand which products they should buy, what is their use case without the need to talk to a salesperson. Delivering a streamlined billing process across all of our products and removing identified point of friction that will block the builder from realizing maximum value as they get into our products. Great. Next question is from Siti Panigrahi from Mizuho. It’s good to see focus on Engage in CDP and first-party data, however, Google has pushed its third-party cookie deprecation to the second half of 2024. How would that impact the demand for Engage platform in Twilio growth in 2023? I think we’ll give that to Elena. Thanks, Siti. I don’t think that this will impact the demand for segment nor Engage. Customer privacy is just top of mind for companies. They want to make sure that they’re really on the right side of what consumers are demanding today, and they want to know those consumers well from a first-party perspective. So there is more value in this than sort of just how the rules are changing on people. It’s something customers are already wrestling with, given all kinds of other dynamics in the market. And it’s why we continue to be so excited about segment. Segment CDP capabilities are critical in this context as our customers seek ways to leverage their own first-party data to optimize the dollars that they are putting against those customers and against those outcomes. So they are looking to build deeper relationships, and the only way to do that is through first-party data and through capabilities of a solution like Segment. I’d argue it’s more critical in the current environment with the economy in the state that it’s in. Each one of those dollars really counts and being close to the customer is just the best way to spend those dollars. All right. Next question from Rishi Jaluria from RBC. Can you walk us through how increased mix in non-SMS channels, especially WhatsApp, impact your messaging gross margins? Math would suggest WhatsApp is less than 30% gross margin. We’ll do Khozema. Thanks again for the question, Rishi. So just to be clear, in the slides that we reviewed today, WhatsApp is not actually included in the messaging data as what we do is classify that separately under our advanced communications or ACP, which is in the other bucket on that slide in the communications revenue chart that we shared earlier today.
That said, the WhatsApp channel it grows fast, but it’s a relatively small revenue contributor to our overall revenue today. So it doesn’t really have a significant impact on our gross margins. And while we’re not commenting specifically on the gross margins for WhatsApp, given its size, it is important to note though that while WhatsApp doesn’t have carrier fees like SMS does, we do still have to pay fees for using that channel. All right. Next question from Mason Marion from Jefferies. Twilio was always known for a light touch sales model with CPaaS business. What happened over the last few years that pushed you away from this strategy? And maybe we will start with Jeff. Yes, thanks, I’ll start. I would say that several years ago we were probably actually underinvested in sales. And so it was the right decision to grow our sales team. And we saw really strong results in terms of sales growth and new customer relationships formed. But that’s, of course, expensive and sometimes it’s unnecessary for customers to land and succeed on our platform. So I’d say that we’ve moved more recently and we’ve realized that while we love the sales motion and building those relationships, it makes more sense to put that energy behind our software products versus our CPaaS products. So we’re continuing to invest in our product-led growth where we’re already best-in-class, by the way, and to further to make it easier for customers to adopt CPaaS, while we point our sales team though towards our software-oriented products. And Elena, I don’t know if there is something you would want to add. Yes, so what that’s looked like in practice is a focus in go-to-market on three key things. And I mentioned most of this in my prepared remarks. It’s increasing our focus and reliance on automation and self-service, particularly in messaging, focusing our time and attention on strategic solutions, selling rhythms where that’s what our client needs and demands of us as we place these more pervasive software solutions. And then third, ensuring we’re placing our software solutions much more broadly and deeply. So, it’s across those changes that we’ve made in the organization that are in support of that. And we believe that that’s really going to set us up for success for the long haul. Great. We have another question from Meta Marshall, Morgan Stanley. Did management turnover at Segment cause some of the underperformance that was discussed today? And maybe Elena will continue with you on that one. Sure. Thanks Meta. No, not at the executive level. I did in my prepared remarks talk about turnover. But one of Peter’s legacies when he left was that the management team that he built was strong and is largely still in place. So as I mentioned, we did experience elevated attrition across our sellers. And in particular that was important because those sellers were the ones that were most knowledgeable about the segment product, about the segment market, competitive landscape and the customer. As we tried to integrate the sales teams, in my opinion too quickly.
So at this point, we have re-ramped, the sales force, we intend to win the CDB category full stop, with the best product in the market and a newly rebuilt team. Our software solutions require working with sometimes a different buyer. And it requires time to field to build that relationship and that experience. So there is terrific synergy with certain use cases in messaging. There is still sometimes new relationships to be built.
And so we feel like the changes we’ve made within go-to-market, where we’re creating that very explicit and specific focus to our software solutions individually, we’re just creating deep specialization that we think is required around those buyers.
Over time though, you should expect to see more and more of our sales force ramped. We’re starting with them originating business for those solutions. And over time as we get more and more reps under our belts, I think, we’ll start to see a lot more lift as well from the field in general. Excellent. And another question for Elena from Matt VanVliet from BTIG. How much of the company’s growth or mix of revenues comes through the systems integrator channel? And how is the company evolving its relationships with these firms to drive more growth? We have some great relationships with SIs and as I mentioned during my presentation those SIs include PwC, Capgemini, Slalom, and others. We do see some revenue generated through those partners, though it isn’t necessarily a large contributor today. That said, I see a lot of potential for both global SIs as well as regionals, especially as our software products mature and claim a growing slice of our customers marketing and engagement strategies, there’s going to be a bigger and bigger role for them to play. And the next question is from Mason Marion from Jefferies. How sales team incentives changed to sell Engage rather than CPaaS? And we’ll stick with Elena for that one. Sure. Thanks Mason. We have adjusted our sales incentive structures to align them with accelerating software. Put really simply those incentives will be highly biased to selling segment Flex and Engage, plus a couple of other higher margin communications products. All that said, we’ll continue to grow messaging too. We just want to grow it a lot more efficiently and effectively so that we can begin to drive op margin accretion through all of those channels. Great. And moving on to Mark Murphy from JP Morgan. Which pieces of the messaging business are seeing the most deceleration in the Q4 marketing verification or conversational sales and support? And specifically is the verification piece growing or shrinking? And I think that’s another one for Elena. Yes, thanks, Mark. We see the headwinds less correlated to use case and more correlated to external macro trends that impact specific verticals. So it’s more vertically aligned than tied to a specific use case. As we mentioned in our Q2 earnings, we saw a couple of areas of softness, areas like crypto, social and consumer on demand, and this certainly persisted through Q3. We also saw in Q3 some extension of those headwinds into retail and e-commerce. So that’s really where we see it. It’s less use case oriented and more kind of customer oriented. Great. Derrick Wood from Cowen. Elena, it sounds like integrating data platform sale and software solutions sales has been challenging. Could you further explain what changes you’ve made to drive more effective selling between these two motions? Thanks, Derrick. Yes, you’re right. We have seen some recent sales performance issues with segment as we tried to integrate too quickly and experienced elevated attrition across the sellers that again, were those that were closest to the product, closest to the customer, or the most knowledgeable. However, as I highlighted in my prepared remarks, we’ve revamped the sales force, we’ve rehired and we intend to win the category with the best product.
Our software solutions require working at times with different buyers. It requires some time in the field to kind of build those cycles, build that experience. But with the changes we’ve made to my organization overall, we’re creating a really deep and specialized organization that is specifically aligned to those solutions and buying personas. But as I mentioned earlier, over time, you should also expect more and more of our sales force to ramp become proficient and expert and we’ll see segment play a much deeper role in the hands of all of our teams over time. All right. Got another question from Mason Marion from Jefferies. On the 3Q results, gross profit dollars added year-over-year continued declining so $99 million versus $120 million last quarter. What’s driving this? We understand the gross margin is declining, but we are trying to understand the gross profit dollars and why they’re slowing, Khozema? Hey, Mason. I think you have the numbers on the revenue growth and the gross margin side for both Q2 and Q3. And so you can see that revenue growth was slower in Q3 than it was in Q2. So 41% versus 33% and during that same time period, gross margins were down slightly more in Q3 year-over-year than they were in Q2 year-over-year. And so the margin decline was largely driven by the higher messaging international mix, which we talked about during the presentation, as well as the new A2P, 10DLC fees in the U.S. The latter obviously doesn’t impact gross profit, but some of the other dynamics would. And another question for Khozema from Mark Murphy at JP Morgan. What do you see as the optimal level of organic revenue growth target going forward? Assuming this type of macroeconomic backdrop continues for a while and allows Twilio to deliver non-GAAP op profit? In other words, what is an attractive level of growth? Yes, hey, Mark. I mean, we obviously can’t control the macro. And so what we’re really focused on is what we can control. And what we can control is driving more profitability into the business. And we feel very good about our ability to do that. We think we provided you all with a financial framework that we feel very good about in terms of both our revenue, overall revenue guide over the next several quarters as well as the medium term, our software guide at 30% plus over the medium term. And that’s guidance that we feel comfortable with.
And I think the one thing to maybe underscore is, is that whatever the economic cycle and in spite of how gross margins or anything like that plays out, we feel very, very good about our ability to continue growing the top line, but in particular to drive op margin accretion. And a follow up question from Mark Murphy again, for Khozema, mechanically, how will revenue growth in Q4 fall below the Q3 DB&E level of 22% expansion? Yes, hey, Mark. I mean, it’s obviously driven by macro right now. And we are feeling the impacts across a variety of industries that Elena called out a moment ago. Given the majority of our revenue is usage based and tied to consumer activity, when the economy comes down, that slow down does impact our revenue faster than a subscription based model would, for example, and when the economy improves, kind of goes the other way. And so we would anticipate that we would see some downs relative to that expansion rate play out over the next quarter or so or for however long the macro plays out in this way. Great. Next question. Meta Marshall, Morgan Stanley. Understand that cross sell opportunity within customers but how often is it the same buyer between messaging and the software business? And that’s probably a good one for Elena. Yes, I mentioned during my prepared remarks, our most common messaging use cases in each of the logical buyers of these use cases across marketing verification and conversational sales support. Each messaging customer in these areas, it could be a logical buyer of our software solutions, but it doesn’t always necessarily mean that we have relationships across the board. So they certainly can ladder up to those incremental sort of software needs because ultimately that’s where the need for the message may have originated, but it doesn’t mean it’s the same people all up and down the chain.
And so we think there’s a very natural door opener there, and we’re working to make sure we push through that door. But we also recognize that, that to do our jobs well, we’ve got to not only do that and we’ve got to not only leverage the relationships we have with the existing customers and those existing specific buyer personas and relationships, but we have also got to build relationships with the key decision makers where we don’t already have them.
So good sort of functional alignment, not always necessarily the same people, but we think that gives us a lot of room to go and build the right relationships if we don’t already have them. Great. Thanks Elena. Another question from Rishi Jaluria from RBC. How do we think about the authentication business given what Apple’s doing with biometrics? Maybe that’s a Jeff question. Sure thing. Yes, so, the majority of our one-time password use cases are to prove that the phone number or device is owned by that user. And Twilio’s Verify and our programmable messaging products continue to be a key SMS solution for establishing phone and device ownership. By the way, you also see our silent network off that we just announced, does a similar thing proving you are the identity that you claim to be.
Now Fido is used to simplify returning users logging back in only after that phone number, device ownership has already been established. Furthermore, Fido typically replaces the password factor of 2FA. So for true 2FA, you would still need a second factor, which we expect to remain predominantly SMS OTPs for that verification of, are you who you say you are.
Now we do see the industry adoption of Fido and WebAuthn as a really important step in simple and secure authentication. At the same time, it all also adds to the matrix of technologies a developer needs to integrate with. So we see it as an opportunity for Twilio to help simplify that developer experience overall, including integration with Fido WebAuthn, which is something we’re actively exploring. And I know they can look similar, but for a person who gets a new phone, Fido, WebAuthn or a new computer or any of that is not set up. So you need a different way to establish the customer mapping to that device and that’s with a identifier that you use to communicate with them.
Generally a phone number or an email address. Once you set that up, then Fido, WebAuthn can be useful. And I think that’s the real distinction. Great. Jeff, and maybe a follow up from Rishi as well. Can you expand more on why your end of life being the Zipwhip business messaging and what the plan is for that asset going forward? And remind us of why you bought Zipwhip? I got Eyal sitting next to me. I’m going to have Eyal answer it. Thanks for the question. Well, I want to be clear that we announced these plans last year at the time of the acquisition with the target of end of life of the software at the end of 2022. However, we recently extended the end of life date to the end of 2023, but this isn’t all of Zipwhip. This only refers to the software part of Zipwhip business and SMB app for small business to text, which was relatively small from revenue standpoint.
When we look at it compared to Frontline and our other products, there is some duplicative functionality. So we’re going to combine efforts and make it so that we jointly deliver on products that really provide the best of everything that Frontline’s offer, as well as what we’ve done in those teams and technologies together to deliver first class product experiences to our customers. All right. We’ve got a question from Oscar Tejada at Wolf Research. Are you willing to start guiding the gross profit dollars instead of revenue growth? And that sounds like a Khozema question. Hey, Oscar, that’s a really good question actually, especially given what we highlighted today and given our focus on gross profit dollars. I don’t want to say anything definitive today necessarily, but I think it’s definitely something that we’re going to have to consider. Great. Next question Meta Marshall, Morgan Stanley. You’ve been hiring enterprise sales reps since Flex was introduced in 2019. And in investor conversations, you noted that you were in the fifth inning of these at the end of 2021. Were some of the missteps with these reps that caused the need for continuous hiring? And that’s a good question for Elena. Thanks, Meta. I’m confident that we’ve built a strong sales team and we’ll execute on our software plan as we continue to roll it out and embrace that motion. We have now dedicated focused reps on Flex and Segment. For the first time they’re 100% oriented to winning customers for these solutions entirely. That’s a big part of the change that we made here in 2022, less dilution in focus, more alignment to software.
Segment and Flex both have good product market fit too. I feel great about our solutions, but I also feel really good about the steps we’ve taken to address the issues that we’re getting in our way. And as we’ve said the Segment team now is rebuilt and Flex is gaining new and exciting traction as well in this new contacts and how we’ve set up those teams for success. Great. And we have a question from Rishi at RBC. 90 days ago you talked about being cautiously optimistic on 30% growth. Now you’re talking about 15% growth. What got that much worse in the macro environment in the last 90 days? And Khozema, do you want to answer that? Yes. I mean, we got a little bit higher than 15% in Q4 and we obviously provided you with a range over the medium term, but it’s a fair question, Rishi. During the course of Q3, we like many other companies, and I think you’ve seen this in their results too. We just noticed a much broader impact as a result of macro slowdown across a variety of industries. And I think previously we called out, for example, crypto and social. I think more recently we’re seeing additional impacts, for example, in retail and e-commerce.
And given that the majority of our soft – excuse me, as with the majority of our software peers, we’re just kind of feeling the impacts of this kind of broader macro slowdown. And given that we’re predominantly usage based, we are tied to consumer activities such that when the economy declines, we feel those slowdowns a lot faster in our business model than you just would in a subscription-based business model.
And I think equally when the economy improves, we would expect to see a faster overall recovery than what some of the subscription folks would feel. We feel good about what we put up in Q3 and I think it just made more sense to us to be a bit more cautious in the near-term, certainly based on the way that we’re guiding. All right. Next question is from Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo. Appreciate all the detail here. On the messaging side, is there anything you can do to control the scale of fee impacts? Is there a level of gross margin you wouldn’t allow the business to dip below? And how to think about free cash flow in the context of the margin targets? Yes, let me just take those in reverse order, Michael. So first of all, in terms of free cash flow relative to margins, what we said during the course of the day is that we intend to be non-GAAP operating profitable and to continue driving additional leverage in the coming years. And so I think what you should really read that as, as an indication that free cash flow will follow shortly thereafter. I mean, a company that generates profitability, obviously you would expect to be cash flowing, and so there’s always some timing impacts associated with these sorts of things. But ultimately we should expect that cash flow to come through kind of behind the operating margin that we’ll deliver.
In terms of the gross margins, I think the line for us would be if the gross profits that we were delivering wouldn’t hurdle what it would cost to distribute them, such that we weren’t a profitable business. And so what we think about all the time is, is that as we drive top line, as we generate gross profits that we ensure that we do that in an efficient fashion. And as long as it drives up margin accretion, I think we’d feel quite comfortable based on the unit economics that we took a lot of time to explain during the courses of today.
The fee impacts, I mean, that’s not really something that’s within our control. What I will say about it is, is that while the fee impacts create some noise around our gross margins, at least they don’t impact the economics of the business. They don’t impact the profits that come in, but we haven’t really seen any real impacts on demand either. All right. Moving on to Will Power of Baird. It’s great to see the commitment to non-GAAP operating profitability in 2023. What’s the timeline for positive and growing free cash flow? Khozema? Hey, Will, it’s kind of the same answer. We talked about our plan to deliver free cash flow during the course of the presentation in kind of the near to medium term. We define the medium term is three to five years, so that really gives you the timeframe. Obviously, from our standpoint getting to cash flowing starts with delivering non-GAAP operating profitability and I think as we do that, the cash flow will follow shortly thereafter. All right. Back to Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo. What gives confidence that the software business can outpace the overall business? Is there a target mix for how much software you’re looking for medium-term? We’ll go to Elena for that. Thanks, Michael. As I discussed during prepared remarks as well as a couple of the prior questions, we are shifting a good deal of our sales focus and resourcing to software as well as our sales incentive structure will also be highly biased towards selling Segment and Flex in the near term. We’re not going to provide a target mix for software, but obviously over time we do expect that the portion of our business – that portion of our business becomes more and more meaningful over time. And another one for Khozema from Will Power at Baird. Can you break down the sources of the weaker Q4 growth messaging versus voice versus software, et cetera? And was there any geographic breakdown of softness that you felt? Hey, Will, I’m not going to provide more disclosure than we gave today. But the macro decline that we’re seeing, it obviously impacts our usage based businesses more significantly. And so given that messaging is a pretty large contributor, you can imagine that it’s also contributing to the lower growth than we’re seeing versus prior periods. And another question for Khozema from Meta Marshall of Morgan Stanley. Are all international regions at a higher gross profit dollar per message? And have you evaluated stepping away from regions where the economics don’t work? Hi, Meta. Great question. Yes, and we have actually. There are regions that we won’t operate in because of the economics that I described before. If we don’t generate gross profit dollars, that hurdle our ability to distribute those efficiently and such that we can’t generate operating profits, we will not participate in those markets. And there are some around the world.
What we showed in the presentation though, is that we do generate attractive gross profit unit economics and look, they do bounce around from time to time just given that we’re constantly terminating messages in different places based upon the needs of our customers. But as long as we can do that efficiently, as long as it drives up margin accretion, I think we’ll continue taking that business.
I think the other thing that you obviously know being a long-term follower of the business is that messaging also serves as like a very effective land with new customers. And you heard Elena talk a lot about the engagement side of our business and what we want to do specifically with Segment and Flex engage. And I think as we grow internationally, it provides us a really unique opportunity to distribute – excuse me, to distribute some of those products as well. All right. Next question Mark Murphy, JPMorgan. How are customers responding this far to the SMB pricing priest, which went into effect back in May? Do they view it as a reasonable ask during these inflationary times? Or could it adversely affect some of the messaging volume by making some of it less economic? Khozema? Hey Mark. They don’t really affect customers who are locked into a fixed price contract. And so we really haven’t seen a material impact as a result just yet. I think over time, obviously those fixed price contracts will come up for renewal, and as they do, we would anticipate that those price dynamics flow into those new contracts. Obviously, one of the reasons that we did it was because we saw inflation in the environment. And so we felt it was a fair response given what we were seeing. All right. Moving on to Ryan Koontz from Needham. If we should focus on messaging profits, will you be reporting that metric every quarter? Khozema? Hey Ryan, no that’s probably not going to be a metric that we provide on a quarterly basis. We will give software. Jeff talked about that in his closing remarks, that that’s an additional disclosure that will give you quarterly. And I think there’s a smart question asked earlier in the Q&A about guiding towards gross profits, and I think that’s something that we’ll think about. Okay, Ryan McWilliams from Barclays. How should we think about the year-over-year AR growth for the software segment? How should we think of the potential for Engage and is it a standalone option? Or is it a up-sell on top of Segment? Maybe Khozema you want to start with that? Yes, I mean we feel pretty confident with the profile as well as the growth of software, and I’d say for Engage that given that the product just launched. And given that segment is it’ll be predominantly subscription based. I think we’ll be focused on just building up our bookings really over the next year. The pricing for Engage, is pretty similar to Segment where companies pay to manage the data for a specific number of their monthly customers. And so, there could be some overall excuse me, some small overages if they exceed the contracted number. But I think that’s something that we’re still evaluating.
I think also, like some of our other software products, Engage has a high gross margin profile. So, over time we would expect that that’ll contribute to both growth as well as margin expansion as it becomes a larger part of our revenue stream. And early customer feedback is such that it’s pretty strong. So, we’re pretty optimistic about the future of the product. And maybe Jeff, do you want to talk about whether or not standalone or an up-sell on top of Segment? Yes, sure. I mean they go together. I mean the short answer is, you can’t buy Engage without having a CDP, the data that powers it. And so Engage is built natively on top of Segment and, and all the Twilio’s channels. And this is a key advantage for us, because as we enter this multi-channel space. By being built on top of CDP, natively integrated real time, great data foundations, we can produce real dollar results for companies by having that real time data and really about, it’s about activating that data. So as a consumer forms an action, like, they’re browsing the site, they’re scrolling, they’re clicking, they make a purchase, we’re able to activate or for example, suppress audience actions in real time. That means consumer makes a purchase and our customer wouldn’t have to spend more money on Facebook or Google to try to get that ad.
And that’s sort of how we’ve talked about in our conference today, how certain customers like Domino’s was able to get a 700% increase in the return on ad spend because they’re getting a lot smarter about how do I understand my customer base and therefore target ads better and save a ton of money. And I think that is where the real value of a CDP comes into play. Like you first of all get the data in real time and assembled in very sophisticated ways, do the identity resolution, know who those customers are, but then you don’t just have data sitting there, you actually act on it. You do something with it. You buy ads more intelligently. You trigger campaigns, personalized journeys including conversations between a sales rep. I mean, there’s all sorts of things that can be triggered based on what you know about the customer at that point in their journey. And so that’s where we see the value of Engage. But the short answer is yes, there’s like a basic version for our marketing. There is a segment CDP version, and then there’s the full version, which is Twilio Engage, which activates all those capabilities, data plus marketing together. Great. Thanks Jeff. Moving on follow up question from Mark Murphy from JPMorgan. What effect do you expect to realize from the employee sabbatical program you recently put in place, for instance, better retention of tenured employees? Or do you expect to see a wave of employees coming back to work with their batteries recharged at some point next year? Maybe Jeff want to answer that? I mean, in short, yes, right. We want our employees to be productive and energized in the sabbatical program is a unique benefit we’ve decided to provide that allows for that, longer term we think it’ll be attractive for employee retention too. Great. Moving on next question Marcelo Lima from Heller House. How do you think Twilio achieves the 20% operating margin target? Is it fair to say at 3% it’ll take six years? Khozema? Hey Marcello, we provided a clear framework today for you all to think about non-GAAP profitability. We do expect to be profitable starting in 2023 and then to increase our operating margins by one to 300 bps per year after that, beyond that we’re just not going to give specific targets by here. Great. Next questions from Bilal Chaudhry from Blackstone. If you were to pursue M&A, what would be the most attractive areas to look? Khozema you want to follow up? Yes, I mean, I would say with emphasis that we talked in the presentation about the fact that we’re very focused on organic growth right now. I think we’ve got some fantastic products in our portfolio. Elena talked a lot about what we can do with Engage with Segment. Eyal talked a lot about the innovation that he’s driving into those products. And so right now I think we’re really, really focused on what we can do there as well as in the big opportunity that we see in Flex.
And so M&A quite frankly is a lower priority option. I think we want to maintain some optionality. That’s why we have the cash that we do in part at least. And so I think if we were to do something, we would probably do it around some of those areas and, probably in particular look at stuff that was AI oriented that would advance the capabilities of those products. Great. Next question, we actually had a similar question from Ryan McWilliams at Barclays and Taylor McGinnis at UBS. How should we think about the balance of how macro in recent go-to-market changes could have impacted the growth stepped down implied in the Q4 guide? Khozema? Yes. Hey, Ryan. I would say the go-to-market changes had no impact. We talked about the fact that if in fact, we had the exact same workforce size and the go-to-market organization even now that I don’t think it would’ve really impacted the way that we ended up guiding in Q4. I think in large part what we’re seeing is, is that there’s going to be kind of a macro environment here that we’re feeling the impacts of like a lot of other software companies out there in the marketplace. We called out some of the categories in which we’re seeing that, and I think that’s really what’s impacting our guide and the fact that we’re usage based, it probably tends to impact us a little bit faster on the way down. And I think as the economy recovers, I think you can probably anticipate that we’ll recover faster on the way up. Great. Next question we have from a few of the analysts, I think more of a clarification question. Are the business metrics provided today only going to be made available annually? And will you break out software quarterly? Yes, the framework that we provided you with today, we’re going to provide those metrics quarterly. You get four out of the five of those on a quarterly basis anyway, you can see them in our published financials. And then as Jeff committed in his closing remarks we’re also going to give you software quarterly. Great. Next questions from Nick Altman at Scotiabank. You guys seem to be more focused around profitability than ever, but I think some are confused as to why you didn’t put a stake in the ground around 2023 op margins. Can you give us a bit more color around how we should be thinking about 2023 op margins, especially on the heels of the restructuring and whether you’re going to reinvest those and whether you’re going to reinvest those dollars? Khozema you wan tto speak to that? Yes. Hey Nick, we’re not going to provide a range for 2023. I mean, I think we’ve been saying actually as far back as a year ago that we intend to be profitable in 2023. And that’s really what we’re committed to. I think importantly we’re also going to drive leverage over the medium term and we called out driving a 100 bps to 300 bps annually. And so you can anticipate that there’s going to be not just profitability next year, but op margin accretion thereafter. And otherwise we’re not really reinvesting what we did through the restructuring. However, we have continued to make investments in software as I all articulated, because we do think there’s a lot of really interesting innovation that we can drive there for our customers. And it looks like Michael Funk from Bank of America and Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer, both had a similar question around what are we assuming for pricing/competitive environment in your medium term revenue forecasts? Yes, I don’t think that there’s really going to be material differences in either relative to what we’ve seen historically. I mean, I think there was a question earlier about the price increase that we pass through and in a number of our products in particular U.S. messaging. And I think at some point, that’ll probably have somewhat of an impact on our financials especially as this fixed price contracts roll off. I think competitively, we have competitors in a number of different products. They’re different product to products, so it’s kind of hard to answer that question as well. But those competitors range from agile digital natives to some of the larger software giants.
And I think in spite of whatever happens in the competitive environment, we feel really, really good about our positioning. It’s helpful to have a leading CPaaS. It’s helpful to have a leading CDP and when you have the best products in the marketplace the next step is ensuring that you distribute them effectively and efficiently. And I think Elena’s given you a lot of evidence that we’ll be able to do that in the coming years. All right. Taylor McGinnis from UBS asks, you mentioned annual OpEx savings from restructuring slower pace of hires and reduced real estate of roughly $330 million. Would that be incremental to the guide to hit profitability next year. If we extrapolate the growth implied in the 4Q guide to next year, it seems to imply 700 basis points to 800 basis points of margin tailwind. So can you help us think through the potential benefit here? Yes, I think Taylor, this is Khozema. I wouldn’t anticipate that we’re going to drive 700 bps to 800 bps next year in terms of op margin op profitability. I think what we’ve committed to is being non-GAAP op profitable next year, and we’re going to do that. I think what you can count on is 100 bps to 300 bps thereafter. And if you look at the financial framework as well as some of the restructuring that we talked through, we gave you some ranges in terms of some of the actions and what kind of cost out that took as well as, where those impacts were felt in terms of our different OpEx lines. And we feel good about our ability to be profitable and then to drive up margin accretion going forward. Great. Ryan McWilliams from Barclays asks how should we think about the medium-term trajectory for international messaging gross margins? Kho, you want to talk to that? Yes. Hey, Ryan. I mean, we gave you a sense of it in the charts that we shared today. I mean, it’s generally pretty stable. I mean the unit economics as we showed you are actually, they have been improving over a period of time. So we feel pretty good about that. I think in general as we tried to explain a number of times today, like gross margins aren’t per se the focus relative to the way that we think about the messaging business, as long as we can drive incremental gross profits into the business, as long as we can distribute those gross profits efficiently and drive additional op margin accretion, I think we want to take on that business. And the margin rate will be less of a consideration than the gross profit dollars and the overall op profit dollars that we bring into the business. Great. Next question from Phillip Santos. What makes Engage’s value proposition so special for customers versus competitors like [indiscernible] activation through Twilio’s CPaaS is something they can do as well. Is it more about the cross-sell into your customer base? Maybe Eyal, do you want to talk about the product? Yes. We’ve seen a lot of customer excitement and momentum around Engage, time and time again we receive feedback that marketers have to wrangle data and then manually upload CSVs, or wait 12 hours to send real time messages. We now offer a fully integrated offering. With Engage, Twilio puts the power of data teams and the reach of our reliable Twilio channels into the marketers hand so they can focus on building engaging campaigns, instead of dealing with challenges around infrastructure or integrations, marketers have been able to reduce the time for real time messages to truly real time and send smarter more targeted messages to more detailed segments and the appropriate time on the customers’ journey. And that’s a big differentiator for them. Yes. So in addition to Eyal’s points about product, we really believe we need to be market leading across all of these dimensions to compete effectively. But its early days in this market, I think there’s still so much land to be covered. [Indiscernible] share is small and we’re going after a huge market with legacy players with new and unique needs on the behalf of our customers and a lot of change in dynamics. So we think all of that creates an environment for us to really win, whether there are point competitors here and there, there’s still a massive open market opportunity for us. All right. Michael Funk from Bank of America asks, how are you thinking about discounting within your complete set of customer engagement, messaging or other comp solutions to gain market share and retain customers? Maybe Elena, you want to follow-up on that? Yes, you bet. And I think Khozema laid out a little bit of framework for thinking about our messaging products, for example, and really the name of the game there is profitability. We don’t think we need to be doing a lot of discounting there. And what we need to be doing is creating efficiency below the line in our sales organizations and elsewhere.
And we talked a little bit already about how we’re going to do that, so I won’t get in into that too much. Holding the line on pricing is really, really important to us, and we believe we can do that because we’ve got solutions that warrant it. On the software side, where there are places where we want to work on massive sort of land grabbing and we’ve got room to do it.
We will, but that said, we have – we believe we have the best products out there. And so we think we’ve got power in this area and we intend to make sure that our values really recognized in the market that we’re selling that value, that we’re creating the right solutions and that we maintain the right kind of unit economics across all of our products.
But really, the dynamics of these products economically are different. And so we might have more room to be creative in other – in some areas and less room in others, but I think when you have great products to bring to bear, it’s not as difficult as it might sound to thread that needle. Next question from Mike Walkley, Canaccord Genuity, with the comments that have short-term headwinds, given the macro environment, are there certain end markets harder hit than others? While I realize you’re providing quarterly guidance for 2023, is the macro environment so uncertain that it might be challenging for Twilio to meet the lower end of your 15% to 25% medium-term target in 2023? Khozema? Yes. Hey Mike, I mean we gave you some of the end markets that, that have been impacted where we’ve seen impacts in our business. For example, we called out crypto, we called out social, I think we’ve called out retail, e-commerce for example. So those are all pretty consumer sensitive areas and you’ve seen other companies call out headwinds in some of those industries as well.
And so, not surprisingly, given the usage based nature of our business, we felt those impacts in ours as well. I’d say the macro environment certainly is creating some uncertainty, but I mean, I think we provided guidance for the fourth quarter that we certainly feel comfortable with and I think we feel pretty confident in our medium-term guidance and we think that’s a really good framework for the next several years. And maybe a follow-up question to that from Nick Altman at Scotia Bank. How should we think about revenue and gross profit growth in 2023? Hey, Nick. We’re not going guide to 2023 beyond what would we’ve said in our financial framework. We provided a guide for the fourth quarter. We provided a medium-term framework. We mentioned that we’re going to be guiding to quarter-to-quarter just given them volatility in macro. And I think we feel good about the financial framework that we put out there. And I think you should think about our results being in that range with a particular focus on being profitable. And Alex Zukin at Wolfe has the following question. How are you thinking through the incremental execution risk of changing your go-to-market strategy in a fourth quarter as the macro conditions deteriorate? And how should we be thinking through modeling those impacts into fiscal year 2023? Yes. Hey, Alex. This is Khozema. Maybe I can start and then if Elena wants to add anything she can. What I would say is, is that the financial framework that we provided you all with today is based on the fact that we took a number of actions in Q3 and we did so with eyes wide open. And as we mentioned, nothing that we guided to in Q4 was impacted by any of the changes that we made in that organization. And in particular, we also feel quite good about the way that the medium-term set up looks. I think we feel great about the different products that we have in the portfolio. Macro, definitely does create some uncertainty, but I think our framework is a good one. I think that both between our ability to innovate as well as our ability to distribute and then obviously drive leverage across all of our cost categories over time. I think we feel really good about the medium term setup. I would just add that though, we did take these cost actions recently. The movement toward focus is something we started a bit before that and we coupled it with cost actions here in September and just feel like that drive toward focus across our buying personas and products was the right answer, whether or not there’s economic headwinds. And the cost actions just give us a moment where we’re going to get more creative, we’re going to demand more of our – of automation and of self-service and we believe those are the right things to do. And as Kho mentioned, we don’t think they created incremental risk. We think they put the onus on us to continue to execute in this dynamic environment. Great. And Mason Marion from Jefferies has a question. If you think back to the 2020 when you issued the 60% gross margin expectations, what were your assumptions around messaging growth versus software? And then how did reality compare? And I actually think the 60% gross margin was – part was made at the 2016 IPO. Just to clarify, but maybe Khozema, you want to talk about that? Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Mason. So a couple things there. I think number one, as you think about the 60% back in 2016 relative to where we are today, what we definitely did not anticipate is a series of fees that have taken place within that timeframe. And I think what a lot of folks don’t even remember sometimes is that we broke out just today that there’s been a 240 bps drag over the – on our corporate gross margin rate just as a result of fees.
Zero impact whatsoever on the economics of the business, don’t impact gross profits, but the math of it impacts gross margins without driving any underlying changes in the business. And for long time – long-term followers of the story, what you’ll probably remember is, is that we’ve had prior instances of fees as well that have driven similar margin drags again, no economic difference in the business.
What I would say as well as is that messaging growth has just been really, really strong. And quite frankly, that’s a problem that I love to have. I mean, I want that dynamic all day long. Definitely, it accelerated during COVID for sure. We had higher international growth that was in part, because we have been making investments internationally. And so I think all of those dynamics are upside dynamics that we didn’t originally forecast. Yes, they had some impacts on gross margin. But where we’re really focused going forward is, is that as long as we’re generating gross profits across the board whether it’s domestically or internationally, we feel really good about the setup for the business.
As far as software goes, as we mentioned with respect to Flex, I mean, it’s a $100 million run rate business, its $162 million if you include some of the pull through revenues that I think our competitors would include. We feel really good about the progress of that business. I mean, we’re just four years in to be able to have that sort of a run rate, it feels quite good. And now we’ve obviously got segment. We’ve organically developed engage and we feel great about kind of the next wave. All right. And Nick Altman with Scotia Bank has a question. How do you guys ensure sales attrition doesn’t continue given your changing comp plans in tweaking the go-to-market on the messaging side? And that’s probably a good one for Elena. Thanks Nick. It’s ultimately my job as the leader of the go-to-market organization to ensure we’ve been able a plan where each AE can achieve, can earn their on target earnings; can develop as a sales – as a sales person or a sales leader. And that they, I see a path to winning as a team. I think coupled with that we want people that can attach to our mission and purpose. All those things together I feel like are very achievable going forward and I think we provide a great overall employee value proposition at Twilio. And just the number of things that people can come here and achieve and grab onto is high. And so I – while attrition is certainly always on our mind and we’ve always got to stay sharp and build the path to that execution and delivery I feel comfortable that we’re going to land that. Great. And a follow up question from Nick. When did you guys make the choice on the political side to stop working with some of those customers? I think some people are a bit confused giving you messages earlier, how there was going to be a benefit in the second half. So was that more of a recent decision? Jeff, do you want to take that one? Sure, I’ll take it. Look, we have set out acceptable use policies and along with the carriers have rules about when you can text a customer and that requires an opt-in. You have to opt-in to receive a text message. The political campaigns have long maintained that they don’t need to have an opt-in that just taking a phone number from a voter roll is enough to enable them to text a customer. And I think as many folks in U.S. have found, like that’s pretty annoying. And while it is technically legal, I believe because there was a carve-out in legislation it is not what consumers want and it creates a lot of complaints with carriers. And so after the 2020 election, we worked with carriers to refine the rules about how a political texting should be governed.
And we rolled those out to our political texting customers and those who said they would abide by the rules of getting opt-in for customers. Those are the organizations for whom we still have traffic. But a whole lot of them said they did not want to abide by that and we said we would part ways with that traffic. And we weren’t entirely sure exactly which customers would say they were going to follow these rules and which weren’t. But I do think we’ve always said that political traffic while it could provide a bump is immaterial to the general story of Twilio. And I think that continues to be true, although we did exit a bunch of this business because we thought they were not good for carriers and not good for consumers. All right. And Matt Stotler from William Blair asks, it’s good to see the announcement of general availability for Twilio Engage; however, this is a marketing focus product and marketing budgets tend to be impacted by weak or uncertain economic times like we are currently experiencing. How does this setup impact your expectation for the pace of adoption for engage going forward? Elena? Yes. Thanks Matt. Engage and Segment are making our customers more efficient with their spend, and I think that’s actually particularly important during these kinds of economic times where even one wasted ad or wasted click on a less well targeted customer is reason for concern. And so this is a time and space where of course there’s more scrutiny. We talked a little bit about sales cycles and people wanting to have a try before they buy experience and things like that across all of our products. We understand that and those things we’re prepared for, but we think largely in an economic time like this, when each marketing dollar is very precious and difficult to come by, our customers actually need Segment and Engage more than ever to make sure that those marketing dollars are the highest efficacy possible. So we think that’s what customers are looking for in this market. That’s certainly playing out in our conversations both in one-on-ones and walk in the halls this week at SIGNAL 2. Okay. Meta Marshall, Morgan Stanley. Since you don’t appear to commit – to be committing to the restructuring being incremental in 2023, what changed in the environment that made you need to make the change late in the year when the goal had been out there for much of 2023? Or did it just take a while to identify what changes needed to be made to drive to the non-GAAP operating profitability commitment in 2023? Khozema, you want to take that? Yes. Hey, Meta that’s a good question. I mean, I think as you can probably appreciate, like, it was a really difficult decision for us to undertake and in concert with that it was an incredibly confidential thing that, that we were evaluating for some time. We wanted to be very planful about the way that we did it and it was just like not a set of information that we could really share with investors in advance of determining what needed to be done internally, sharing it with employees first, and then only after we did all that was it appropriate to share it externally. And so I think it had been kind of part of our framework for 2023 as part of getting to profitability and it just wasn’t something that we could share previously. Next question is from Taylor McGinnis at UBS. You mentioned the potential to see gross margins stabilize/appreciate in the near term. When you look ahead, what are you seeing in the growth trajectories and view of the market opportunities and messaging versus software that gives you comfort that this mix shift could start to occur given the focus on continued messaging growth in some of the go-to-market hurdles in the software business? Are you able to provide color on the level of growth you’re currently seeing from these businesses and the path to how they could evolve over the medium term? Kho, you want to follow up on that Yes. Hey Taylor, just to maybe parse the question a little bit because I think it’s important to provide a few clarifications. I think first off, you know, we do anticipate some variability in, in terms of gross margins and I think it’s worth underscoring again, that with messaging in particular we really want to orient the business around gross profit dollars. We think that there are a lot of gross profit dollars out there to go get, as long as we can distribute those gross profit dollars efficiently and drive op margin accretion; we think that’s a good way to grow the business. And we also think it, and it lands us a number of customers with whom we can grow off of over time. So that’s important to us in, in two different ways. I think beyond that, look it’s going to take some time, but I think that the software business is growing well, it’s obviously growing based on the framework we provided you today.
We intend for it to grow at a faster rate than the other parts of the business and it’s just going to take some time to catch up. I think that we’re working through some changes obviously that both Jeff and Elena alluded to with respect to segment. I think we’re seeing great momentum on the Flex product and I think as time goes on we have a chance that mater – growing at materially higher rates than what we’ve talked about today. And I think as that happens, it’ll change the mix of gross margin over time. Great. And Matt Stotler from William Blair asks, give him the substantial headwind that pass through fees create on the gross margin line. Why do you recognize that revenue on a gross basis instead of a net basis is a net basis a possibility? Kho, you want to take that one as well? Yes. Hey Matt, I mean, it’s not really a possibility in that. We’re obviously, I’m not trying to be flipping or anything, but we are an SEC Filer and we have to report that revenue on a gross basis. I mean that that those are the regulations that we have to contend with and so that’s why we do it the way that we do it. That said obviously the way that we run the business has to be very much from the standpoint that whatever the gross profit dollars are that we generate are the ones that allow us to pay for the various OpEx categories that sit within the business.
And so to the extent that the fees are not just the incremental fees, but the carrier fees altogether are a pass through that hits both the revenue line as well as the cost line that is kind of how we think about running the business. And I would say increasingly the way that we even think about our OpEx categories is such that we view them as a percentage of gross profit versus as a percentage of revenue because we just think that’s a more responsible way to run the business. And we have another question from Philip Santos [ph]. Can you please explain exactly what are the differences between Segments product and Engage? What is the additional value proposition and how does it differentiate from competitors? That’s probably a good one, for Eyal. Yes. Thanks for the question. Segments takes data from multiple sources and turns it into usable profiles and customer audiences then engage, activates and deliver a highly powerful marketing automation solution that creates massive customer value. Data is no use if it’s just sitting there. So engage activates the data. There are markets for both, but they are much, much better together, using segment CDP capabilities data can be leveraged in real time to help create personalized marketing campaigns, which can be sent to end consumers via communication platform. This ultimately helps our customers deliver higher lifetime value while lowering their customer acquisition costs and building lasting meaningful relationship with their customers. Perfect. And another question from Nick Altman at Scotia Bank. Following up on the SBC question, what delusion are you guys targeting on an annualized basis? Khozema? Hey Nick, we’re not actually providing specific dilution targets, however, we are very focused on driving SBC costs down as the percentage of revenue and we’ve given you a framework to think about that over the medium term. Great. And another question from Rishi at RBC. The details today implied that software is roughly a 79% gross margin. Is that a fair steady state margin or is there a plan to drive software gross margin expansion? Kho? Hey, Rishi your math is about right. I would say, and I think that as we experience success as we intend to and certainly scale in the marketplace. I think over time, we do have an opportunity to grow those margins. But I think right now we feel good about the starting margin rate and we’re just very focused on distributing the product effectively and efficiently. And as we do that, we’ll see the benefits of that over time. Great. Question from Ittai Kidron at Oppenheimer. Can you talk about the competitive environment? Are you seeing more pricing pressure? Are customers fully interested in consolidating into one platform and anything you can share on win rates, Elena? Sure. Given our broad product portfolio, we see various levels of competition and there’s certainly different competition within different product areas as well as different markets. While areas like messaging are pretty fragmented, CDP is a little bit more crowded space with some large software companies involved. I think we talked a little bit about that earlier. Similarly with the launch of Engage, we expect that we’ll be competing against some of the established marketing cloud vendors in the market.
And I think I hit earlier why we believe we continue to win in that environment as well. We have seen a couple of instances of longer sales cycles, which we’ve talked about, but broadly speaking, the changes haven’t been material and our win rates remain solid across the board, even though growth is down from the highest scene in 2021, we don’t believe we’re losing share. We continue to price competitively. And we have raised prices across some of our comms channels over the past year as well. So the average price per unit for core messaging, for example, while influenced by geographic mix and other factors continues to rise across all sales segments. So we feel good about the competitive environment and our ability to continue to win within it. Great. Next question, Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo. How should we think about timing of when to expect to realize those annual benefits that were mentioned from the restructuring and the slowing of the hiring pace from earlier this year? Khozema? Hey Michael, you’ll start to see them in Q4. Just one thing about Q4 is, is that you’ve got kind of the idiosyncratic cost event of signal, and so that tends to drive a little bit of the guide and then obviously especially next year as we’ve committed to non-GAAP profitability in 2023. And we have another question for Khozema from Spencer Morris at Matrix is the messaging business EBITDA profitable today? Hey Spencer, we’re not going to provide segment specific disclosures per se, but what you can imagine is, is that we’re investing in the software businesses and we intend to use those profits. We intend to use profits from communications to fuel that ongoing investment. All right, and Alex Zukin from Wolfe, asks will you be breaking out software revenue quarterly and guiding to its quarterly as well? Khozema? Hey Alex. Yes and no. All right. Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley asks that the 2020 Analyst Day, you gave a stat as to how much of DBNE was from expansion into other products. You gave some examples, but is there a stat of either how many customers are multi-product or a refresh of the previous DBNE multi-product stat? Hey, Meta. This is Khozema. That’s a really good idea. We actually didn’t disclose that today, but it is something that we’ll consider providing in future updates. All right, next question is from Nikhil Gupta from 2N Capital. Why is holding $3.2 billion in net cash on the balance sheet, the right amount to be holding, particularly if you can improve free cash flow as you improve operating profit going forward? Is there any possibility of a shared buyback program? Khozema? Hey, Nikhil. I think that’s a reasonable question. I mean, we have a capital allocation strategy that we articulated a little bit during the course of today’s presentation. I think that for us, it’s been important to have a fortress balance sheet. That’s why we have the amount of cash that we do. I think certainly during economic down times; it’s good to be more cash rich than otherwise. That said, I think you’re right that as we become more profitable and as we start to generate free cash flow, you do have different directions that you can take that I think historically we’ve done M&A, but a share buyback is certainly not something I would take off the table either. It wouldn’t take signal from that, that’s something that we’re necessarily planning, but I think it’s got to be among a list of options. And it looks like another question for Khozema from Alex Zukin at Wolfe. Can you please help us bridge the big chart where you highlight sales and marketing, R&D and G&A. From year-to-date 2022 to medium term? How do we think about that for next year? And where’s the implied op margin going in fiscal year 2023? Kho? Hey, Alex, I mean, as you can appreciate, we’ve committed to non-GAAP profitability in 2023. Like detailing that by cost categories is, is just not something we’re going to do. We’re not going to guide to that, beyond what the financial framework that we showed you today. And just a quick follow up from Alex for Khozema, can you help us understand how we should think about gross profit dollar growth over the short and medium term? Yes. Hey, Alex we haven’t provided that kind of a framework. I think what we did say is that we’re going to continue growing gross profit dollars so long as we can distribute those gross profit dollars efficiently. I think there was a question in the very beginning of the Q&A intimating that it’d be a good idea to potentially guide on a gross profit basis. I think that is something that we’ll take into consideration. We’ll get back to you guys. All right. Question from Matt Stotler at William Blair. What is the impact in Q4 2022 related to the winding down of the Zipwhip texting platform? Kho? Yes. Hey Matt. It’s de-minimus. It’s not going to have a material impact on the business whatsoever. All right, and I think we’re going to close this out as the last question. Coming in from Arjun Kapoor at Kinetic Partners Management, you provided a medium term target on SBC as a percent of revenue. But what is a reasonable assumption for the long-term target on SBC as a percent of revenue? I think that’s a Kho question. Hey, Arjun. I mean, we gave you a medium term target today. I’m not going to further provide a long-term target. I think that it is a topic that we’ve been talking a lot about as a management team, certainly with our board and our comp committee. It is something that we’re quite focused on. We provided you today with some of the dynamics in terms of, how we’re thinking about it.
I think growing our employee count at a slower rate relative to our revenue is obviously going to be an important piece of the equation. We’ve taken a restructuring action that was really, really hard, but we thought it was the right long-term move for the company, and obviously that’s a step in the right direction. We talked about the slowing of hiring other than in segment and flex. So obviously that’s a big piece of how that employee count gets affected. And then I think beyond that, we also give you some dynamics around the way that we’re thinking about hiring and different geographies and how stock is valued internationally relative to in the domestic market.
And then also the way that we leverage equity compensation relative to performance will be another dynamic that we’ll think through. There may be others over time, but I think we’ve given you medium term target and I think that’s what we’re prepared to do today and we feel good about our ability to hit that. Excellent. And with that, I’m going to turn it back over to Jeff Lawson for a few closing words. Thanks, Kho. You did a lot of talking today. It’s someone going to get this guy glass of water for like, I want to thank everybody for joining today. We’ve provided you all with a lot of information. But the key points really are, first messaging was a good business and we’re focused on gross profit generation and growing the operating profit off of a large gross profit base of messaging.
Second, our customer engagement software products of Segment, Engage, Flex. They’re the next act for Twilio. Segment in particular is an area of focus due to the quick ROI that we can get for our customers and the importance of data. We know how to sell segment. We’ve rebuilt our sales team with the goal of growing that business at high rates over a long period of time. Third, we’re bringing together our leading CPaaS and leading CDP products to unlock more value for in our software applications layer.
And fourth, we’re laser focused on generating near term profitability. You’ve seen us take hard actions already. Our plan is simple, drive more leverage from our scaled communication businesses through product-led growth and more efficient distribution. While putting more and more of our go-to-market resources on selling our software products.
We got the right team in place to ensure that we’re going to gain leverage over the long period of time. So thank you for joining us today, and thank you for following Twilio. I appreciate the thoughtful questions that y’all had, and I really look forward to working with you all our investors or analysts on the huge opportunity ahead.

With that, I'll hand it over to Jeff for some opening remarks, then we'll open up the call for Q&A. Thanks, Bryan, and thank you all for joining us today. As you may have seen, we've made a number of significant changes to our business that we believe opt to perform in both the short, medium and long term. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are confident that this is the right set of actions and the right path forward for our customers, for our teams and that will enable us to create more value for our shareholders. And I'm sure you have questions, so let's hop right into it. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Great. Thanks. I appreciate it. Maybe a couple of questions for me. Just maybe to start, I know at the Analyst Day, you guys have talked about a lot of changes that you were making to kind of the data and application sales force and just the driver to growth that, that would be in the future? And just as you have gone through the process of splitting the business units, just where do you think you are on some of those initiatives?
And I guess, kind of as a second question to that, where do you feel like there are synergies or dissynergies from kind of splitting the segments as far as kind of getting customers to go from communications customers to kind of those data and applications customers? Thanks. Meta, it's Elena Donio here. Thanks for the question. A couple of things that you hit on there, I'll take them in turn and then pass it over to Jeff who can add a little bit of extra commentary. First question was about the data and applications business and kind of current state of growth and where we're at in terms of that transformation that we've been talking about, let me hit that one first.
We've -- I've spoken across the last couple of quarters about investment there and about growth there. We also addressed a little bit of sort of the trajectory as it relates to the beginning of last year and a couple of missteps that we made along the way. We actually feel a lot better about that business and trajectory now. And we believe that this movement in separating our sales forces into these business units more discretely is actually going to further amplify and accelerate that growth.
So obviously, revenue growth lags bookings. We feel good about where our Q4 landed across our data and applications business, and we're also confident in that reacceleration. I talked a little bit over the last couple of quarters about the hiring that needed to be done there, the onboarding, the enablement of those new reps.
We feel really good about having built out those teams with the right set of skills and the right capabilities, doing some internal transfers as well as hiring from the outside with the right set of bespoke skills. So, I'm really confident in how that's turning.
We've also talked about some macro headwinds. Those continue in a couple of areas, some lengthening of sales cycles pushing out of decisions and things like that from time to time. But with all of that in mind, we feel really good about the things we can control. We feel really good about the investments that we've made and the trajectory ahead. And we also have really -- we still believe and we shouldn't -- we don't think that this movement across two different business units should say anything different.
There is a better together story here. Our products really amplify one another. But what we found is that having very specific sales focus across the unique needs of each of these buyers is a really important one. And we think having moved our segment and Flex teams into separate spaces last year started that momentum building. And now this business unit move is one more step in that direction of focus. I think that hit both of the questions, but I'm going to hand it to Jeff for a little bit more commentary. Yes. Thanks, Elena. I think your -- the second part of your question was really about like synergies, dissynergies, et cetera. So, I'll tell you how we think about it. Every customer who comes to us for communications, like they actually have a use case of mind for how they're going to engage with their customers, right? They need voice, maybe it's because they need a contact center. They need messaging for identity verification or for customer contact two way. They need to e-mail for a marketing use case, right? There are these finite use cases for the vast majority of the things people use us for, and these use cases kind of cluster together.
So, we have this opportunity to ask customers, hey, what are you trying to accomplish? What are you trying to do with our platform? And by the way, have you looked at this other part of our platform that may actually help you achieve that better, faster or even cheaper in some cases.
Our applications create value for customers by entering their need in a more direct way over the communications channels that we then just use to execute the delivery of those messages.
And so, I think this is how this space is going to be won over time. It's getting it to why customers are sending these messages and doing these communications with our customers, in addition to powering the messages themselves. So, you might say, Jeff, the two-business unit structure, well, it seems like that makes it harder to actually bring these two worlds together.
And first for us that may have to be the experience. But today, let me tell you, what we've learned what didn't work -- let's have everything lumped into one back of a sales rep. And we've talked about that reason in the past the way I just hit on it, right?
So, at this stage, what we're focusing on is the unique needs of the various buyers with specialization there and focus. But we're also going to collaborate and partner utilizing our own data and intelligence to uncover opportunities to incentivize cross-team collaboration and to go understand which of our customers need which of these use cases, and therefore, would be really good customers of our applications and our data stack.
But I think it's important to distinguish here -- this is the important part -- between the short and medium term and the medium and long term. Because in the short to medium term, it's clear that we've got work to do to make communications more profitable and to take our data and applications business and execute on the sales model.
But I see these things as foundational, that the current environment is setting the stage for us to do, but we're getting better at using our data to drive these cross-sell conversations both in things like marketing and our automation, but also in our sales conversations. And then over time, we build more and more product connectivity between these various products.
And it's obvious, how with better customer data in terms of segment, we can power smarter, better, more effective communications, and that drives more usage of our platform. And so, I think that's how the synergies play out. But you do have to look at it short to medium term, medium to long term. Great. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Hi, thank you so much and congratulations to all the new folks who have been promoted. My first question is regarding the $250 million to $350 million non-GAAP operating profit that you expect this year. Should we assume that all of that is being generated by the Communications business? Or perhaps more than 100% of that, if we were to assume that the data and applications business is unprofitable this year? Hi, Mark, this is Khozema. I'll take that question. It's really the latter part of what you said. It's more than 100%, and that's kind of intentional on our part. We do think that we can be very efficient in the way that we bring the communications business to market and that it can throw off a lot of profitability, while at the same time, the data and applications business, they're in the middle of an investment cycle, and we're early stages in that.
And so, we do think it's appropriate so long as we're making judicious investments to be able to grow the top line of that business. It's also gross margin accretive, which we think is important longer term. But it is going to take some losses in the short term, which will work themselves out over time. Okay. Understood. And then as a follow-up, I looked at the prepared remarks and it says that some of the macro headwinds that you had mentioned still persist. So, I'm wondering if you could just clarify whether the buyer behavior feels any better out there. I mean in terms of the bookings cadence in recent months? Or would you say that, that is still continuing to degrade somehow? It's Elena. I'll take that one. I would say those factors persist. I wouldn't say it's all been flushed out of the system. But I think we're also getting better at navigating it. So, we did -- we are comfortable with where our Q4 bookings landed in our data and application space. And we're -- we think our products actually play a vital role in tough economic times.
And so, we're sort of navigating that headwind in the field as best we can. We've updated our messaging. We're making sure that we're very clear about why allocating budget to these kinds of products, at this time, in particular, is vital and important. And we think that message is landing. But definitely, economically, I don't think we're out of the woods yet. I'll hand it to Kho for more commentary. Mark, just one other thing I wanted to add is that importantly, we do intend to drive profitability through whatever the cycle ends up being. We provided a relatively large range on the non-GAAP operating profit in light of the current macro conditions, which are pretty dynamic, but we do think we can be profitable through whatever the cycle is, and we intend to be. Thank you, very much. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I guess just a follow-on on the operating income guide because it certainly stands out just relative to what was expected. Can we just -- I know you're guiding specifically for operating income, but just anything you can add on what would get you to $250 million versus $350 million? And how to think about just gross margin in the context of that conversation relative to the potential growth outcomes that would drive the delta potentially? Yes, a lot there, Michael. So, let me just try to unpack it a little bit. So, in terms of, I think the way that we planned for it, is that irrespective of kind of the gross margin outcomes, we're going to be able to deliver operating profitability within that range. I think the difference will be basically that if revenue kind of performs in line or kind of within a range of our expectations, then we'll be at the higher end of the range.
And if it doesn't, then we'll kind of be at the lower end of the range. Given how dynamic the macro is, we did want to provide a little bit of a cushion. We wanted to kind of plan and run the place a bit more conservatively in light of things that we've seen. Certainly, a lot of companies have reported similar. But irrespective, we'll be profitable, but that's kind of the color behind why that range.
In terms of gross margins, as I said, I don't think that they'll really have an impact on the way that this plays out. We're really trying to orient the business much more towards gross profit generation. We talked a little bit about that during our Investor Day. So long as the unit economics are good, especially in the Communications business, they're already very strong on the data and applications business, then we're going to keep seeking gross profit dollars I think a key difference being going forward that those gross profit dollars will drive incremental op profit dollars. Very helpful. It's a substantial answer to a substantial question. Just a quick follow-up, if I may. On the expansion rates, we're seeing compression in a number of different vendors across software. Can you just walk through what's driving the expansion rate headwinds you're seeing currently and how that informs the 1Q guide? Thank you. Yes. I think the expansion rate basically kind of follows some of the revenue growth rate decel that you've seen. One of the things about our business is that as macroeconomic factors kind of take the economy and other businesses down, given the usage-based nature of our business, we tend to feel those a little bit more acutely.
Kind of in the same way that we felt them a bit more acutely on the way up, right? If you kind of go back a couple of cycles or even the most recent cycle to COVID, like we turn up very, very quickly as different macro factors kind of pulled markets up. And so, I think we're starting to see that come down a little bit.
In terms of the Q1 guide, I mean, we still feel quite good about our ability to generate revenue growth in spite of a very difficult macroeconomic environment on a year-on-year basis, and we'll just continue to monitor it. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. This is Param Singh on for Ittai Kidron. So firstly, I want to understand what are the areas within communications you were able to cut back on overhead? Was it because of excessive hiring in '21? And how much of that cutback are, you would say, some international, which has a significantly lower gross margin profile? I don't think we entirely heard your question. So, I'm just going to try to play it back for a second. What I understood the question is being that in what areas were we able to cut back in the communications business? And what proportion of that was international relative to other markets? Is that right? Yes. That was the general crux of it, but I also wanted to understand like was -- is this because you over-hired in '21 in communications that you're getting back to more normalized pole, are there other areas of streamlining a communications business that were previously not identified? So, I just wanted to understand some of the dynamics behind the restructuring that we announced in the past since September? Yes. I mean I guess what I would say is that there's a couple of parts to it. So, if you go back to the fall and the restructuring that we did at that time, I would call that like kind of more cost cutting. Obviously, it had the unfortunate impact of us having to part ways with about 11% of our workforce at the time. And that obviously is something that we feel bad about, but that was more kind of in the cost-cutting vein.
And I would say this time around, it was more a restructuring around two different businesses that we think can drive better outcomes, both for our customers as well as our share owners just given the different buying cycles that have economic aspects of the two different businesses.
In terms of where the costs came from, I would say it was pretty much across the board. Like I wouldn't necessarily point out that it was heavier international necessarily relative to the way that it played out domestically. A lot of our roles are kind of global facing. Certainly, once you get out of go-to-market, the rules are very global facing, especially in engineering and G&A. So, I wouldn't say that we pulled more out of international than in any other kind of region.
One of the things to point out in international, in particular, is that -- and we talked about this at our last Investor Day, the unit economics of that business are actually quite strong. And so, we want to continue growing in international markets so long as those unit economics are good. And we're going to continue pursuing business in that way. But that hopefully gives you a little bit of color in terms of the costs that we try to take out this time. Absolutely. Thank you for that. And then if I could really quick. I want to understand the level of investments you're making in software, considering this past quarter is only 22% growth and 434 [ph] or 1 million of the like. So, I just want to understand the impact of your operating headwind that you're going to have in the near term while you bring this business to hopefully $1 billion-plus business. Yes. I mean, we're not going to break out that number specifically. What we did do is say in our prepared remarks that we're guiding in the current year to about $250 million to $350 million of non-GAAP operating profit.
Offsetting that or included in that number is about $150 million of incremental OpEx. And there's two dimensions of that, that we specifically broke out. One was an increase in the way that we're going to compensate employee’s vis-a-vis bonuses to help us offset some stock-based compensation headwinds that we've seen over the last few years that would otherwise continue.
And then the balance of that will really be predominantly investments in Segment and Flex. We think those are smart investments because we think those can accelerate the growth of those products. And then there's a little bit of other stuff in there as well, but we're not going to break out that number specifically. Thank you, so much. Your next question comes from the line of Taylor McGinnis with UBS. Your line is now open. Hi. Thanks, so much for taking my question. So, lots of great incremental color on the call. But one area that you didn't discuss was the 15% to 25% revenue outlook you provided at the Analyst Day. I would imagine here, given some of the changes that, that outlook might be a little bit stale. But any color you could provide on how you're thinking about the revenue potential now?
And then as a second part to that question, just looking at the 1Q guide, could you maybe talk a little bit more about what's embedded in that rev guide? And particularly how it might relate to some of the changes you made in any risk of disruption? Taylor, this is Khozema. I'll take that question. So, the 15% to 25% is really a medium-term guide. We both provided a revenue guide on the overall business of 15% to 25% in the medium term, which we labeled as three to five years during our Investor Day as well as 30% plus in the software business. And those aren't changed.
Beyond that, what we have said a few times now is that just given the dynamicism in the macro environment, that we're going to continue guiding quarter-to-quarter on the top line for now until we see the macroeconomic picture kind of clear up.
We haven't seen that play out really. In fact, we've seen it kind of get a little bit more rocky over the last couple of months. And so, we just want to be smart about the way that we guide things. I think that the 14% to 15% that we called out in Q1 is kind of reflective of that.
It is a tougher macroeconomic environment. I think in spite of that, we're going to be able to put up pretty good growth numbers on a year-on-year basis. But I think its basically macro signals that we're seeing that are kind of making us think about the business in light of a number of different things that could play out, and it just seems prudent to us to kind of plan and run the business conservatively in light of that. And then my last quick follow-up is I appreciate that you're talking near term about EBIT dollars and gross profit dollars and putting the focus there. But just as we think about the guide, that's -- the medium-term operating margin guide is on a percentage basis. So, can you just talk about what gives you comfort in that 300 to 400 medium-term outlook that you provided? Yes. I mean, I guess the way that I would say it is, is that you got a couple of factors in the mix. So, first is that we gave you $250 million to $350 million in the current year. That gives you some sense of kind of how we're anchoring 2023 to give us a base off of which to grow.
As we look out over the next several years, we're obviously taking into account our medium-term revenue guide with some appreciation in software, given that we've called that at 30% plus. And so, if you kind of run the math out over the next several years and assume a few different things around gross margins and the gross profit dollars that each of those two businesses will kick out, that kind of gives us a sense of how profitable a business that this can become.
And then I think some discipline on the OpEx side, which I think we've shown over the last couple of periods and certainly the most recent actions, really give us a sense of just how simplified and efficient we can run the business, that kind of gives us the confidence to say, as we look out, we can drive additional op margin accretion, which ultimately will yield GAAP profitability in 2027. Thank you, so much. Your next question comes from the line of Nick Altmann with Scotiabank. Your line is now open. Great. Thanks guys. Just a follow-up on the prior question. Just given how significant of a level of the restructuring you guys have done and you look at sort of the 1Q guide, how much of the headwind to growth is coming from the restructuring and having less quota-carrying reps versus some of these macro factors and the shift of focus to data and applications? Yes. Nick, this is Khozema. I'll take that one. Not much, to be honest. I mean, the reality is, is that in the short term, there may be some impact, so I don't want to suggest that they're going to be zero. But I think, by and large, the Q1 guide is not informed by some of the restructuring actions, either that we undertook in the last half of last year nor the ones that we took just a few days ago.
The revenue model and the way that the bookings play out, it takes a little bit of time for things to catch up. Again, as I said, I'm not going to say that it's going to be zero. But as we kind of put our planning assumptions together, we felt pretty good about the way that we guided in Q1. And took whatever impacts there may have been into account. I'm going to add one bit of context to that, if you will. So, this is Jeff. I want to underscore something that was said earlier that I think bears repeating, which is that we have a usage-based pricing model. And in a usage-based pricing model, we see an accelerated headwind in a macro environment like this. And I think that's what you're seeing in our recent results and in our guidance.
What we're not seeing, though, is a real change in, for example, our competitive situation, right? I think what you're seeing is a representation of just consumer activity and the general economic activity being slightly muted during this period of time.
But I think this also can play to our strength as you see economic recovery occur because that can be an accelerated tailwind for us as well. And that's also the nature of a usage-based pricing model. And as we mentioned earlier, like we saw in the early days of the pandemic when people were using our product for many new use cases. And so, I think we are an accelerated view into the macro economy based on the usage-based model.
And as we do move towards the economic recovery, I think you'll see a company that is in a really good position because we are more streamlined. We are more focused. And we've got a great customer base to enable us to see the tailwind from that recovery, including the business model.
And I just think it's worth again pointing out the nature of the usage model, which is, generally speaking, a great benefit to us during these times, feels like a little bit of a headwind for us. But I think in the long term, it's still the right model. Great. And then just as a follow-up. Earlier, you had said that the $250 million to $350 million operating profit outlook does not embed any gross margin expansion on the communications side of the business. But now that you're sort of managing the business in two separate units, can you maybe just walk us through the margin implications for the communications side?
I mean, would you guys ever sort of disclose that business unit as a separate entity in reporting? Do you have plans to pay a little bit more attention to the gross margin profile there and maybe be a little bit more disciplined on discounting on that part of the business? Yes. I mean, so there's a couple of things that you said in there. So, in terms -- let me just take the latter part first, and then I'll come back to the first part of the question. So, we actually are pretty disciplined already in the way that we price the product. And so, I feel quite good about the way that the pricing mechanisms work.
The unit economics are very strong, whether they're domestic or international, and we tend to be priced higher than the other guys. And as Jeff said a moment ago, we're not losing share. And so, we feel very, very good about the way that the product is priced and more importantly, about the value that our customers get from the product.
In terms of disclosures, which I think is kind of the other aspect of your question, what we committed during our Investor Day is that we provide additional transparency in terms of what we're now calling communications and then our data and applications businesses. And we're going to continue doing that as we have in the current quarter.
And I think one of the things that we're going to work through over the next few quarters is just to develop a little bit more robust reporting as we operationalize the business units. And we expect that, that probably will lead to additional disclosure over time. Your next question comes from the line of Fred Havemeyer with Macquarie Capital. Your line is now open. Hi, thank you. A question perhaps for Jeff and for Khozema. Firstly, it's great to see and hear that you are returning to the north star in communications of the product-led growth story there. I wanted to ask, with that -- with that shift in the emphasis of a sales-led motion back towards more product-led growth, should we anticipate any sort of change in, say, quarterly cadence of revenue within the Communications segment relative to what we've seen in prior years?
And I suppose also in that context, since you're guiding fiscal '23 on non-GAAP operating profitability, should we be thinking revenue of revenue at this point as less of a kind of a key metric for the company and something that will ultimately just be driving your operating margin outlook or rather operating profitability outlook? Fred, this is Jeff. I'll take the first part of your question, and then I'll hand it to Kho for the second half of your question. For the first part, if I understand the question, I think you're asking like how will it affect revenue given that we're moving to more of a product-led growth strategy.
And I would say, look, the goal -- once we win a customer, a lot of the growth in the account comes from their growth in the market of taking something they built from prototype that they're testing to a beta when they test out the idea to rolling it out to the entire customer base and then the growth of their business and their customer base.
And so really, it's about getting that kind of design win. And that's where developers are often very influential in the life cycle of adopting some of these communications products. And so, by moving back towards more product-led growth, what I think you're seeing is we're going to be investing in the things that make those developers and the companies that are in the early stages of adopting Twilio really successful in onboarding.
And I think we see a lot of opportunities to go streamline the product, make it easier to get up and running, but also to scale these products as customers scale globally. And the product can do a lot more heavy lifting in areas where I think we've relied on people to actually help our customers over the line in recent periods. And you're right, this is a return to the roots of Twilio, which is to make the product enable our customers to find success quickly and easily with a really powerful product.
And so that's what we're focused on. So, I think it will help us enable bringing on new customers as well as continuing to scale our existing customers in a way that customers will actually appreciate because it's going to be easier and faster for them to do so. So, for the second part of your question, I'll hand it to Kho. Fred, in terms of the second part of the question, I guess the way that I would think about it is just maybe take a step back and then I'll drill down for a second, is that one of the things that we thought a lot about as a company and as a management team is, is that we've become a really big business, but we also want to become a really profitable business.
And so, paired with becoming a large revenue generator, we also wanted to make sure that, that revenue threw off a lot of profit. And so that's why you've seen some of the restructuring that we've done into these two business units. We do think we have an opportunity to better focus in that way and generate a lot more profitability, for example, in the communications business while fueling what we believe can be a tremendous amount of future growth in the Data and Applications business.
With that said, we certainly haven't given up on growth in the communications business. We still think there's a ton more growth for us to go get. What's fortunate for us is that we're operating in end markets that are still growing at very, very rapid rates.
Our share is maintaining. And if anything, the pie is growing. And so that kind of bodes well in terms of a great growth setup going forward. We're still underpenetrated, I would say, internationally, and so that's a real opportunity. And then I think on the Data and Applications business, really, for us, the sky's a limit. We see a lot more growth opportunity there.
As Jeff and Elena have both said during the course of this conversation, we think that our data capabilities pair really well with our communications capabilities, too. And so, we think that will yield some additional growth, too. So, profit will certainly be a key feature as part of these calls. We want to give folks a sense of confidence that we do see line of sight to GAAP profitability, but please don't confuse that with any lack of focus on the growth side. And then just quickly for Elena. As you're thinking as you're looking at the portfolio of apps on Twilio, where are you thinking about really prioritizing your investments into the software and services in the platform? I think we're not going to obviously break that out in a lot of detail. But what I will tell you is that our Flex product is just at a different stage of play than our Segment product. So, it's got -- there are fewer resources behind it, fewer sales reps behind it, et cetera. But we both see a ton of green build. We see had a great build opportunity across both of those solutions.
Segment is creating connectivity to our comms platform through our Engage product. We think that product actually will ultimately fuel Flex as well as we utilize our data capabilities to power better engagement through Flex.
And so, we actually see them -- some real opportunity to bring them together and for them to be better together as well as fuel our communications business and vice versa. So, we think they're all equally important in our portfolio, but the Segment business is sort of just at a different stage of play. So, it's got a little more girth and half to it than the Flex business does, but the Flex business is growing in a healthy clip as well. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho. Your line is now open. This is Phil on for Siti. I just want to touch on the last question. So, for Flex, I know it's one of your key strategic priorities. How is it performing in this environment? And what sort of changes can you guys make to increase share in the CCaaS market? And also, what kind of traction are you guys seeing on the Engage platform? I'll take that, and I'll do it in reverse order. So just as a reminder, engage went general availability in Q4. So just a couple of months ago. And we're excited about the trajectory that we're seeing there. We've got a couple of dozen new customers deploying a lot of really new and interesting use cases on Engage and throwing through new e-mails and new SMS messages all as part of that.
And so -- and we've also talked about a couple of those customer wins in the back part of our prepared comments. There are a couple of others that we haven't been able to share directly, but we're pretty excited about in terms of their utilization of Engage and Segment, both from a renewal’s perspective as well as a good chunk of net news that we're excited to bring live over the next couple of months. So strong performance there with Engage. And we think real opportunity going forward.
Flex had good performance in Q4 as well. And as I mentioned in prior calls, we're in the process of building out these specialized sales forces doing a fair amount of hiring enablement onboarding. And as we see our sales reps coming online, getting out into the market, and beating the competition head to head in these deals, we just -- our optimism is growing for how that product will perform in the space.
Just to kind of cap it off with a word on the competition. We're not seeing new competition, and we're not necessarily seeing loss rates that are bothersome in any way. This is a matter of sort of getting out there into the greenfield opportunity, embracing it, making sure we've got the right marketing messages, campaigns, fleet generation programs, and then bringing those deals through to close.
So good momentum beginning to kick in as we see these new AEs coming online, and looking forward to sort of how that plays out here in 2023. Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Thanks for taking my question. And honestly, congrats on one of the best, I would say, presentations, thus far, that we've seen from the company in many quarters on multiple fronts, including the buyback.
I guess the first question is, maybe I missed this or I missed it in the letter, but can you maybe just go a little bit deeper into the headwinds that you saw on growth on both the communications side and the application side in Q4? Maybe also commenting on the linearity of the business in the quarter and what you're seeing into Q1 both the headwinds, I guess, but also the tailwinds to the point of how well -- how well you can be in both markets that are up and down? Alex, this is Khozema. I'll take the question. And then if you have other color you'd like, Elena can certainly chime in as well. So, I guess what I would say is that I'll just kind of echo something that Jeff said earlier, which is that, number one, we're not losing share. And so that gives us a lot of confidence that the business is headed in the right direction.
Number two, we're just seeing a lot of dynamism in the macro environment. And as our business is usage based, in large part, certainly on the communication side, we start to feel those effects much sooner than many others do because we're kind of a leading indicator in some ways, both on the way down as well as on the way up.
And so, you saw a little bit of that, obviously, in our expansion rate and you're seeing a little bit of that as well in our reported Q4 results as well as the way that we're guiding in Q1. In terms of some of the headwinds, it's -- there's nothing beyond really kind of the things that we called out previously. I mean, I would point to general macro which is a very broad category.
But some of the stuff that we called out previously is crypto and social and e-com, retail. All of those industries, as you know, have been impacted pretty significantly. And you see that in various earnings reports. You see that in the news cycle.
And so, we're just kind of caught up in the same. And I think what's important for us is that we play through that we continue to grow through whatever the environment is, and importantly, that we generate profitability in spite of whatever that macroeconomic environment is. So that's the way that I would really characterize it. I don't know, Elena, if there's anything else that you would add. I think that's good. I don't have anything to add. And I guess just maybe following up from that. So, if we look forward from here, I know I always ask the question about net retention. But if I think about that one, 10 number and I think about the progression through the year, when you start to anniversary some of those negative effects, and to Jeff's earlier point, on the way up the consumption model can be -- or the usage model can be really good, if you think about the linearity of the year, understanding that you're not guiding, how should we think about that progression? Or how are you thinking about it internally? Is it a back half normalization stabilization of that retention rate? Is it something that shifts to more net new? What's the right way to categorize it? Alex, I wish I did know, I don't. I think that we're planning conservatively basically, given the macro. I think it's just a really dynamic environment. And so, we're not necessarily forecasting an uptick per se. Could it be better? Maybe. I think we're all sort of hoping it's going to be, but we can't plan for that.
And so, we're going to plan for it kind of playing out the way that it has been maybe the last few months, last few quarters and kind of hope that it gets better. Obviously, our field teams are going to win like whatever the business they can. They're going to try to grow share in every way that we can off of our existing base.
We're going to keep growing with the accounts that we have. But how that plays out in terms of DB&E, I just don't know. And as you know, like it's not something that we've historically forecasted to.
All I'd say is that as the economy picks back up, our business will definitely pick back up, and we're certainly looking forward to the time that, that happens. By the way, I also appreciate your comments at the start of your question. Thank you. Thank you, guys. Congrats again. Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with Cowen. Your line is now open. Great. Thanks guys. As you look at driving more efficiency in the business, can you talk about how partners are going to play a role and maybe what you're doing to drive more partner leverage, especially in light of shifting to a two-business unit strategy? Derrick, it's Elena. I'll take that one. We think partners play a vital role. They are helpful in bringing in some of the flagship customers. You heard us talk about both this quarter and over the last couple of quarters.
We put them in a couple of different camps.
There's implementation partners that also could be reseller or referral partners. And then there's also just straight up referral partners that might have a piece of technology that works together well with one or more of our products. And so, we are in the process of actually creating sort of bespoke partner acquisition, partner enablement and partner co-selling teams across our new sort of business unit structure. We think that will create a lot more focus on the opportunity there.
And we're not going to sort of break out exactly what that trajectory looks like. But we do believe that partnership will play an important and growing importantly role in our growth and new bookings, both across the data and applications business as well as across the comms business. Got it. Great. Maybe a follow-up for you, Elena, as well on Segment. Just wondering how the progression of growth trended over the year. You guys obviously had a lot of organizational change. Just was hoping to get a comment on that. And then as you look at kind of how Q4 ended and going into Q1, what end market demand looks like for CDP investments in this macro condition? Yes. Thanks, Derrick. And I think even the way you phrased the question is right. Into the beginning of last year is when we had some stumbling, lost a fair amount of key talent and then began to rebuild. That was a huge priority of mine when I came online in May. And we've worked to sort of execute through that hard time.
And I think really, finally, you started to get our legs under us again in Q4 with a couple of really great customer wins. They're listed in the documents from us, but JPMorgan Chase was a fantastic win across multiple business units and with Engage and Segment, Box and a couple of others.
We had some great new seven figure consumer brand wins as well that we look forward to bringing live. So excited about the trajectory. A lot more work to do. As I mentioned, these AEs, or account execs, are still coming online and getting their own legs under them, but we're excited about the trajectory.
I think the CDP space is still in early innings, but I think also the important thing to note is sort of where we take it from here. So, we think the data in the CDP can create amazing power across our applications. And then we also think what we're building in terms of orchestration with Engage, also in terms of connectivity to our communications platform as well as to Flex really just create such an incredibly powerful set of capabilities for our customers but also competitive differentiation.
So, it's a matter of getting people to part with precious budgets right now. We feel like we've got a great message there. We feel like we really do create lift for brands, particularly in a time like this when it's really important to be super surgical about how they spend every single one of their marketing dollars.
But when ad spend and marketing spend are impacted and are strained, people just want to spend a little bit more time in the sales cycle, a little bit more time making sure that it's exactly what they want. But we also know when we get to proof of concept, we tend to win. And so that's really what we're focused on is making sure we get into the game and get those deals closed over time. So, I wish I had a crystal ball on the macro environment, but we play through, and we think we do well in that context. This is Jeff. I'll add one other thing. I'll just point out one other thing. If you noticed, we tweaked a lot of our messaging at SIGNAL last year for the buyers of this market, right? We said, look, this is about acquiring customers more efficiently and then increasing your lifetime value, your revenue with those customers.
And so that really is a targeted message based on how our products are relevant in this period of time.
And I think you see some of the results that we put out, both in terms of JPMorgan adopting Engage Box, who is a long-time Segment customer moving into Engage, but also a leading e-commerce company that they adopted us in order to improve their ad spend. I mean these are really good examples from our customers that we could talk about in our prepared remarks of exactly what we see going on in the market. Your next question comes from the line of Rishi Jaluria with RBC. Your line is now open. Wonderful. Thanks for taking my question. Two from my end. First, I want to continue talking about Segment. Maybe this is one for Elena. As we think about the core communications side kind of returning to its PLG routes, how should we be thinking about the kind of evolution of segment go-to-market, especially considering the CDP market is a little bit more evangelical, it is a little bit more greenfield.
And maybe alongside that, as we think about potential larger vendors trying to get into this space in a big way, be it Salesforce with its own offering in T&E or Adobe, what's kind of the plan to maintain Segment's market leadership as the larger software companies try to get into the space? And then I've got a follow-up. Thanks, Rishi. This is a strategic sales motion, getting in, getting the product introduced, getting customers using it in proof of concept and things like that. And so, we have really focused our attention on just building fantastic enterprise sales capability and blanketing the market with our message and getting in there and helping customers through sort of putting their dreams into action in the product as we show them our capabilities and turn them into paying happy customers.
And so, while there's definitely more we can do in terms of demos and the sort of the developer message, this really is an enterprise sales motion, and we're investing in that accordingly. And we think the price tag obviously accommodates that as well.
So that said, the connectivity across our -- the rest of our products is a real opportunity for lift. And so, finding examples within our Communications business, where the data can be useful and where then we can turn around and through the orchestration of engage, push communications back out, I think everything ultimately becomes better together.
And the developer as a discoverer of those communications channels sort of opens that door for us on the communications side. And then I think we get to go back in from the Segment and Engage side as well. Second part of what you talked about was the big competition, and we're certainly aware of the moves of our big competitors. But we love our chances that we have the better product.
We have 100% sort of focus on the very specific and bespoke things we do in the CDP space and in the customer engagement platform space. And we think we continue to stay ahead from a capabilities perspective and just we'll continue to invest in the product to make sure that we stay ahead. The work for us is going to be to make sure that we're competing every single time one of those decisions is made, and we're orienting ourselves to do just that. Got it. That's really helpful. And then just a quick financial one for Khozema. Look, I appreciate the longer-term guidance and commitment to GAAP profitability. If I just kind of think about looking out and it's hard to predict two quarters out, let alone five years out, but maybe let's try or sort of talk about GAAP profitability in 2027 as well as bringing down your SBC to 10% to 12% of revenue.
I mean, that just implies that your non-GAAP operating margins though in 2027, as you pivot more toward profitable growth and presumably reach a substantially larger scale, that your non-GAAP margins would be in that 10% to 12% range.
And maybe just given all of the kind of areas of focus, that seems like it's maybe a little bit low as a target to reach for. Can you maybe walk me through kind of the thought process here? And maybe where I may be wrong in my thinking on the long-term framework? Thank you. Rishi, thanks for the question. So, I think just one edit to what you said, and I don't know if you misspoke or not, but I think what you said towards the end was that our long-term framework was 10% to 12% op margins, and that's actually not the case.
So, the way that, I guess, we're thinking about it is that there's the 250 to 350 in the current year, you can kind of run the math on what the implied might be based on our Q1 guide. Obviously, we're not guiding quarter-to-quarter right now, or we are getting quarter to quarter. We're not guiding for the year just given how dynamic it is post that, we see 300 to 400 bps per year.
And I guess the way that we think about it is, is that if you stretch it out over those -- that five year period is that, number one, we get to something that probably looks like if we can execute well and at the upper end, 20% plus, one; two, that if we can get to the 10% to 12% that I talked about that we disclosed in the remarks on the SBC side, which we feel pretty good about, just given some of the changes that we've made in terms of compensation and moving more from stock-based to cash-based.
And then three, I think that the net of those two, obviously, yields some GAAP profitability overall as well. So that's kind of the math that we're doing. I mean, could it be better? Perhaps. But that's certainly not something five years out that I would want to commit to. We feel good about the setup. Certainly, in the current year, we -- if we execute, we can be on the higher end of that. If revenue is tough, we'll be at the lower end, but all the same will be very profitable in 2023.
And then over multiple years out, we see really strong op margin accretion, which we think is a good signal. And then being GAAP profitable is really the name of the game, obviously. And our ability to control SBC is going to be the principal lever and we know how to do that. Your next question comes from the line of Will Power with Baird. Your line is now open. Okay. Great. A couple of questions. Let me start, I guess, on the Communications segment. I'm just trying to think through go-to-market and potential impacts to growth there.
I think you suggested earlier you didn't expect limited growth, but a little bit of an impact. I'm just trying to understand, just given the magnitude of the changes taking place there, how you get comfort that there's not a more meaningful impact to revenue growth? And any framework you could maybe provide around what you expect for growth in that Communications segment, whether this year or next couple of years? I'll take that. In my -- in the capacity of my prior role, just covering go-to-market, very large, it's Elena here, and then Khozema can jump in if you've got anything else to add. So, I understand the point. We obviously did a substantive cost cut here. And I think the important -- there's a couple of important things to think about.
And that we've sort of started to talk about over the last couple of quarters. It was really important to us to begin to demand more of our products, more of our tooling and more of our process as we think about the right go-to-market model for communications. And so, we believe there's a lot of efficiency to be gained there. We're making progress against all three of those dimensions now and plan to even make more improvement in how we create efficiency across the team going forward by increasing our capabilities in product like growth and in self-service.
I think when you actually really sort of peel the layers back in how we were servicing our customers historically, we had a number of people involved in any kind of -- in any sort of customer experience. And we believe we were a bit over levered there. And that when you kind of get underneath where our efficiency was great and where it wasn't, we think we can provide those fantastic customer experiences and really benefit from our customers' usage of Twilio without having people involved at every stage of the process and really reserving that human capital for the times when our customers really and truly need us.
And that's when they're making a decision when they're deciding whether they turn left or right with their use cases and when they're struggling with something with solving a problem. And so that's really where we want to apply that human capacity and capability. And we're not going to let go with that. We will still be there for our customers when they need us.
But as it relates to sort of new customer acquisition, that's also more human-capital intensive at times. When it's big customers making -- running big loads on Twilio, we'll be there for those customers as well. But there was a lot of space where we have begun to see that our efficiency was degrading as we added large numbers of talented individuals over the last number of years.
So, we just don't feel like that's necessary for us to continue the growth trajectory given our penetration in the space, given how our tooling and products are coming along and given what we believe that we could do with the human capital we have around keeping our customers satisfied. Okay. And then maybe, Elena, just to follow up with you. I mean, I guess shifting over to your new primary focus -- congratulations on that, by the way -- and thinking about applications and software. Can you maybe just remind us, as you think about Flex and Segment, what are the synergies there might be on go-to-market? I know you've got some specialized folks you're hiring probably for each of those segments. But just trying to think through the synergies and differences and kind of how you balance that with those two different products? Yes, for sure. We really see sort of the best uses of Flex being where a customer is running a digital contact center where engagement is key. We've got some great use cases of customers using Flex where they're actually in selling environment, not just service or support environment.
And so, we believe there's a really interesting synergy in tie with Segment, where the data will actually create incremental efficacy in those interactions that are happening in Flex, and we're beginning to lay that track now. We expect to see some of that capability here actually in 2023.
But I want us to lay that track first before we begin to think about this as sort of one product or one set of use cases. They are pretty different today. And so, we're going to keep those sales organizations really specifically focused on those unique customers, those unique buying patterns, what those customers need from us. But we will be working on adding some of the benefits of Segment into Flex, and we expect to see some of that this year. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Pat Walravens with JMP. Your line is now open. Great. Thank you. And congratulations on all the progress. Jeff, this is a very big picture. But Twilio has this unusual situation where you have a dual class of stock that collapses to a single class seven years after the IPO. So, in June.
And as the founder, I would just love to hear your thoughts and sort of the history on why you guys originally structured it that way. And now that we've hit the milestone, how do you feel about the decision and how things might be going forward? Yes. Thanks, Pat. I mean, look, all along, we run this business as owners and for the benefit of all of our shareholders. And we're focused on driving attractive growth, lowering OpEx, increasing profitability. And we've extensively engaged with our shareholders over the last several months and over the whole time we've been public.
Help inform the actions that we take as management in terms of balancing growth, balancing our customers' needs, our employees' needs, our shareholders' needs. And our goal is to create value for our shareholders, and we believe the strategy that we're executing is going to do that. And when I think about it from the perspective of a newly public company, when we put this in place just prior to our IPO, I think the idea is for a young company to get its feet as a public company.
And that's why we thought of it with an expiration that was seven years in the future. Now at that time, that felt like a long ways off. And here we are. And so, I think that it did its job to get us on our footing as a public company.
During that whole time, we're able to listen to our shareholders. We're able to make decisions as a young public company. And now having the benefit of seven years in the public market, that will come off. And the scheduled expiration of our dual class really doesn't change any of that -- any of those ways in which we've run the company. And so that's how I think about it as a founder, as a CEO and as a fiduciary of the company. Got it. Very helpful. Thank you. This concludes our Q&A for this portion of today. I turn the call back to the speakers for any closing remarks. Thank you all for joining us today, and we will speak again soon. Thank you for attending.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks, there will be a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions]
I will now turn the conference over to Bryan Vaniman, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thanks, Sara. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Twilio's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Our prepared remarks, earnings press release, investor presentation, SEC filings and a replay of today's call can be found on our IR website at investors.twilio.com.
Joining me today for Q&A are Jeff Lawson, Co-Founder and CEO; Elena Donio, President, Twilio Data Applications; Khozema Shipchandler, President, Twilio Communications; and Aidan Viggiano, Chief Financial Officer.
As a reminder, some of our commentary today will include non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics. Reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and further information related to guidance, definitions and key metrics can be found in our earnings press release and the appendix of our prepared remarks, both of which can be found on our IR website.
The information provided and discussed today also include forward-looking statements, including statements about our future outlook and goals. These forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that are described in more detail in our most recent periodic reports filed with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and our forthcoming quarterly report on Form 10-Q, which are available on our website and at sec.gov.
Forward-looking statements represent our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made. Actual results may vary significantly and we expressly assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, except as required by law.
With that, I'll hand it over to Jeff for some opening remarks, and then we'll open the call for Q&A. Thanks, Bryan. Before we hop into the call, I wanted to really take note of three things today. First, I wanted to note that the substantial actions that we took in Q1 are working, as you can see from our strong non-GAAP operating profit results. One quarter in, we're really starting to show the profit potential of this business. We're also one quarter in to our new structure. And as you can see from our Q2 guide, we're looking into continued headwinds as we built the sales capacity of our data and apps business and doing that in a very tough macro environment as well. But the good news is, I see our leadership role continuing and even expanding in this environment, and I don't see things like changes in our churn or losing share in the market. I see moderation in our consumer-facing usage patterns as well as us lapping our peak crypto usage from last year. And these are some of the headwinds that we'll talk about.
But through all of this, what I really want to do is to thank the Twilio team. We've been navigating a lot of change over the last quarter. And I see Twilions every day navigating these changes with grace, with energy and understanding of the job that has to be done here, and it's truly energizing for me and for the rest of the leaders in the organization. That's really truly the Twilio magic in action. So thank you.
Second, I'm sure this is on people's minds. The AI platform shift is upon us. Like the PC to web transition, the web to mobile, this is the next major technology shift in our society. Working with customers, we see many ways to activate customer data in segment across the whole customer life cycle using artificial intelligence.
Now we'll have more to say about this during the course of this quarter and of course, at SIGNAL in August in terms of products, in terms of partnerships and in terms of customer use cases really looking forward to that. And the third thing I wanted to mention today lastly is go down.
Now, onto your questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Thank you, very much. So, a question for Elena. You mentioned being in a strong position to actually reaccelerate bookings later this year. And Khozema, in their prepared remarks, you're mentioning optimism in being able to reaccelerate growth as the year progresses. I'm wondering, if you can just shed a little light on what is underpinning that positive thought process? And could it mean that Q2 might mark a bottom actually for the revenue growth rate or a local bottom for the revenue growth rate? Hey Mark, it's Elena here. I'll start, and then I'll pass it over to Khozema for some commentary on the communications business. First, let me just kind of walk you through the path to here to provide some context and groundwork for what's to come. First of all, I joined the company a year ago, exactly this week. And at the time, Jeff asked me to sort of rearchitect and rebuild our go-to-market muscle and motion. And what that meant was two things. One, more substantively impact the communications; and one, on the data and application space. So, we realigned, rearchitected our sort of resource map and went through some of the big cost-cutting initiatives that you've seen and you're starting to see the results of that. And that was primarily around our go-to-market muscle in the comm space.
At the same time, we were sort of reinvesting in the data and application space. And the job there has been to rebuild and grow our talent base there. So, we had some -- early in 2022, we had some turnover, some attrition, some changes in how we set up the sales team, which we then unwound and began to rebuild from there. And so that rebuilding effort has taken us the last few quarters. We're now fully hired for the most part, but we're not fully ramped. So, we're all over that over the next couple of quarters is getting that field organization, both at the AE level and the manager level, fully ramped. So right now, our big focus is on enablement. It's on getting those reps from kind of their first deal to their test deal and really showing -- we're really showing sort of what that team is capable of. I'm just back -- several investors just back from our delayed sales kickoff, where it was very much a training-focused event and enablement-focused event. And having spent a bunch of time with our people across the last few weeks, I feel really comfortable about the team that we have in place. That's a big reason for optimism as you've asked.
I think, we're also doing all of this work during a pretty tough macro time, as we've also talked about. We're seeing evidence of that in a couple of areas. So, we've talked in the past about things like cycle lengths, average selling prices, conversion rates across the funnel and a little bit of contraction. We're definitely seeing all of that, at the same time that we're rebuilding, reengaging, reenergizing a field organization.
So with all that said, I just want to close out with the things that give us real optimism. Number one, that Jeff talked about in this kickoff, we're seeing sort of great customer wins amidst all of this. I had a couple in my prepared remarks, Cricket Wireless. He was current Twilio customer, became a segment engaged customer; Web Health, a large BPO becoming a sizable Flex customer. We've had a couple of other really key wins in the financial services space across this quarter and last. And so we're seeing great strides there as well as great strides in our innovation agenda.
Our product teams are really taking down a lot of the road map, delivering a lot of new capabilities from Segment Unify to Flex Unify, which ties together Flex and Segment with some customer wins across each of those as well. So team just our enablement journey is in full swing. Our product delivery is in full swing and bringing down some pretty exciting customer wins. Those are the things that give me faith that we'll begin to see ourselves climbing out of the trough that I think was in part self-inflicted, as we talked about throughout last year and in part driven by the headwinds in the economy. I'll let Khozema talk about the corollary on the comp side. Hey, Mark, what I would say is, first of all, I totally echo Elena's enthusiasm about the path ahead here. I think there's a lot to be excited about. Our sales kickoff was at the same time. We kind of did them together. And so there's a lot of energy among the sales rep force. So just to maybe go to that first. First of all, sales rep productivity remains quite high. As Elena mentioned, we did a lot of work on cost structure. But even in spite of that, I think we feel very, very good about rep productivity. Second thing is that we are maintaining share and what is -- continues to be a tough kind of macro environment. And we feel good about like a lot of our most recent customer wins. We talked about two deals in the script specifically where they were our largest ever on e-mail and selling network authentication.
So I think those are indicators that customers are continuing to -- we're continuing to win with our customers. They're continuing to grow with us, albeit at slower rates than where they were. And third, and perhaps most importantly, especially as you look at our financials is we have a really tough comp relative to last year. Crypto was really outsized in the way that that part of the impact in our business grew, and we're kind of hitting the peak points in -- as we're lapping that.
So I think just naturally, as we come out of the next couple of quarters, you're going to see just some natural acceleration in the growth rate as a result of that. I would hesitate to call it bottom. I mean, it's very dynamic, obviously. And so I don't think we're necessarily prepared to say that, but I think we're very, very excited about the setup for the back half of the year and especially with our energy with customers. Wonderful. Thank you so much. Thanks, Mark. Your next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Great. Thanks. I appreciate it. I just wanted to -- you mentioned kind of anniversarying peak crypto. But if you could just give a sense of what verticals you're seeing the most headwinds? And then just on the Communications side, like what does reduced marketing budgets mean is that we cut certain use cases? Do we just kind of send fewer e-mails, or is it just simply from a reduction in transactions? I think just as we try to kind of think about how to model a recovery, just trying to get a sense of how use cases or the bounce back would evolve? Thanks. Hi, Meta, this is Aidan. I'll start, and I'll hand it over to Khozema. So just to talk about some of the industry headwinds. We've called some of them out in the past, and we continue to see headwinds persist on the social side, consumer on-demand, e-commerce and in particular, crypto. So those continued in the quarter. And as it relates to crypto, again, as Khozema said, we saw volume peak on our platform kind of in the Q2, Q3-ish time frame last year, and that's creating a few hundred basis point headwind year-over-year on the growth. Khozema, I'll hand it over to you. Yes. I mean I would largely echo what Aidan said. I mean, I think as she mentioned, crypto was pretty significant last year. And so as we lap that, I think we feel pretty good about our ability to come out of that. I think the marketing spend that we referred to was much more on kind of the customer side, if you will, not necessarily on our side. And so obviously, some of our products end up serving used cases that are marketing related. And so as customer marketing volumes have come down a little bit, frankly, that impacts both sides of our business to a degree. But it honestly impacts probably the communications business a bit more significantly upfront. We talked about the dynamics, and Meta, you know the company really well. And on the way up, like we react very, very quickly; and on the way down, unfortunately, we react very, very quickly. And so, as things kind of moderate, I'm really optimistic that we'll be able to come out of it pretty fast. And otherwise, it's kind of business as usual. I mean Aidan called out some of the industries, but otherwise, we continue winning, we continue expanding and we continue to maintain our share. And we're not seeing really any pricing pressure out there either. So, feel pretty good otherwise. Great. Thanks. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Hey great, thanks. Appreciate you taking the question. Just on guidance and what's assumed, given there are a number of moving pieces, you mentioned in the prepared remarks. Can you just maybe walk through, what you're assuming in terms of the macro and what you're seeing in expansion rates? Is this a consistent environment that's assumed? And then, just also thinking through the progression of some of the go-to-market improvements that you're making, is there a way for us just to think about the time line and progression of where expected benefits from those might start to play through? Thanks, very much. Yes, I'll start with a bit on the second quarter and then -- this is Aidan, by the way, and then go a little bit into some of the traction for the year. So, it's largely macro as we think about the second quarter. So the market continues to be pretty dynamic, and we're feeling the impacts of a broader slowdown. And so you see that reflected in our guide.
I think the other thing that's important to remember is that, the majority of our revenue comes from our communications business, about 85% of our revenue. As Khozema just said, that's a consumption model tied to consumer activity. So in that business, we are dealing with a combination of macro, as well as the tough comparisons that we just talked about on crypto. And so again, that's creating a headwind year-over-year as it relates to the second quarter growth rate.
On the data and application side, Elena has talked about it as well, but we are rebuilding -- Elena talked about our efforts there to ramp up the sales force and really enabled the team further. And we're also doing that in a tougher macro cycle. So, I'd say on the communications side, it's a combination of macro, some tough comparisons on the software side, it's a mix of our efforts to rebuild plus the macro, and we factored all of this into our guide. So, I'd say some choppiness on growth in the short term, but despite that, we're focused on what we can control, which is delivering profit in any environment.
As we think about the rest of the year, we're not going to guide quarter -- we're going to continue to guide quarter-to-quarter. We're not going to guide beyond the second quarter at this point. Again, given the fact that most of our revenue is communications and usage based makes it a little bit tougher to call. Like in light of that, we'll continue to plan conservatively guide quarter-to-quarter. I think, the other thing to consider is, as the macro recovers and the consumption-based model comes back, our growth will improve, our DD&E will improve alongside it, and we'll be well positioned on the other side with a much more efficient cost structure. Appreciate the detail answer. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ryan MacWilliams with Barclays. Please go ahead. Thanks for taking the question. Just one housekeeping piece. How much essentially is the potential sale of your IoT business potentially taking out the second quarter guide? And are there any products or geographies where you're currently deemphasizing revenue as part of these go-to-market changes? Thanks. So as it relates to -- this is Aidan, Ryan. Thanks for the question. So as it relates to the sale of our IoT business. It's a relatively small contributor on revenue in kind of the mid to high single-digit millions. We'll provide some more of that as we go forward. It will be adjusted out of our organic calculations going forward as well. So you'll get an apples-to-apples comparison on revenue growth, but a relatively small contributor overall. As it relates to any specific regions, no plans to deemphasize revenue in certain geos. Your next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer & Company. Please go ahead. Thanks. My question is for Elena. I was wondering if you can kind of double-click on the data and application business. And more specifically, when you look at the growth of the unit in the quarter, help us understand what products are growing faster versus below this average segment Engage Flex marketing. Which ones are growing faster than the 19% you delivered versus lower? And then since we don't have the historical data on this, maybe you could talk about what deteriorated the most over the last two, three, quarters? And what part perhaps you expect to recover the fastest over the next two, three quarters? Thank you. Sure. So we don't break out product by product. And just I'll remind you a couple of things. One, a number of these products are new. So the Unify product, Engage, like a lot of those things have only been in market for -- from months to a handful of quarters. And so we're excited about the momentum and the progress, but we're -- we shouldn't expect to see those meaningfully impact the Twilio data and applications business units revenue in the very near term. Again, we don't -- we won't be breaking that out product by product. I would just say and reiterate something I said earlier that the real path out of -- the real path to reacceleration, the real path out of this deceleration comes down to two things.
Number one is making sure that our team is in seat and enabled. We're putting a lot of emphasis on that. And then number two is just playing through the tough macro environment and really making sure that we're setting ourselves apart from what's happening in the competitive landscape and ensuring customers that even in a time of belt tightening, this is a really good investment, and it makes each of your marketing dollars work harder, to Meta's question earlier. That's really what we're playing for right now. But at the end of the day, like I would say a lot of the themes are hitting both our Flex and Segment products largely, and we're working on ramping and building the team to work through that. When you look into the next quarter guide, is there another significant step-down assumed in this business from a year-over-year growth standpoint? This business was not impacted by crypto. So I'm just trying to understand the drag on the next quarter. How much of that is the communication business versus the data and applications business? Hi Ittai, this is Aidan. I'll take that. So, we don't provide guidance by business unit on revenue. But as you think about the second quarter, you can generally assume that the slower growth is attributable to both businesses. Though I would say, given the much larger size of communications, it obviously has a bigger impact on our consolidated growth. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Taylor McGinnis with UBS. Please go ahead. Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just looking at the 1Q rev, the 1Q rev declined sequentially and the 2Q guide, I think even if you strip out IoT, assumes something similar. I know you mentioned that there hasn't been much change in churn. So, can you just provide more color on the drivers there? It seems like it might be some seasonality. But if that's the case, as we look throughout the rest of the year, any other seasonal patterns to keep in mind? I'll start here and then if Elena and Khozema want to add, they can. You're right, churn overall has been relatively consistent. Where we are seeing some impact is, we are seeing a bit higher contraction again, really, we think, due to just lower spending on the part of our customers, and we attribute that to the macro.
On the expansion side, we are seeing that at a bit lower rates than where we've been historically. And again, we think that's customers being budget conscious, scrutinizing their spend, and that's really a function of the macros -- the macro. The one area where we are seeing a little bit of an impact on new business, Elena has already talked about it, but is on data and application side. And as she has mentioned, we expect to gain traction there over the year as we ramp our sales force, and we expect bookings to reaccelerate towards the end of the year.
So that just gives you a little bit of color in terms of how to think about revenue for the rest of the year, we're going to continue to guide quarter-to-quarter just given how dynamic the macro is. The only other thing I'll call out, which we have already is that, we do have some tough comparisons here in the second quarter. I would just a little bit more color on contraction for Twilio data and applications. I think the good news there is that, when we see contraction, it is not that we're seeing competitive loss or competitive takeouts and things like that. It's really just customers belt tightening, their marketing spend going down, or their transaction usage, for example, on segment or utilization on segment, just going down because they are contracting. And so, we take heart in the fact that, the product is extremely valuable, extremely usable, but they, as customers, are going through tough times on their own. We see that show up in some of the contraction numbers that we're seeing. So, feel good competitively, but we've got obviously a contraction happening that is a newer dynamic over the past few quarters. Appreciate the extra color. Thanks. Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with Cowen. Please go ahead. Great. Thanks. This is for Khozema. One of the questions we had was whether growth in consumption from the base would be impacted by the sales restructuring since you were taking so many reps out of that business. With -- given the net revenue retention rate down at 106, how much of that pressure is coming from the macro versus how much is kind of the pullback in your own growth investments? And as you look at a few months into your new low-touch structure, what's -- what do you feel like is working well? What do you feel like you'd like to see some improvements on? Yeah, that's a good question, Derrick. I would say, in general, I would attribute it almost all to macro. I think the reduction in investments that we made on the sales and marketing side, I think that they were difficult decisions, obviously, that we went through. And obviously, there was impact to employees, and we feel bad about that. But I do think that with the -- going into it and now with the benefit of hindsight, that it was absolutely the right thing to do, and that we're seeing the benefits of the efficiency. You can see those fall through to the bottom line.
And I think in terms of any impact in DB&E and/or overall growth, like we're just not seeing it right now. So what I would say is working is that kind of in this BU structure, I think having reps aligned to a certain set of products that are very tightly aligned to an economic buyer on the other side that matches the product set. I think that has been hugely impactful for our business. I know Elena would say the exact same thing about her business as well. And so I think adopting this BU structure in that way is proving to be very, very useful.
I think the two other things that I would call out specific to communications is as a result of those reductions, we tilted much more towards a self-service, product-led, growth-oriented go-to-market motion. And I think we're definitely seeing a lot of early successes there. There are various aspects of the experience, like onboarding, like compliance, like cross-selling, like getting additional products into the bundle that we're just working on making a lot easier for customers so that they can adopt Twilio really at a speed that they want to be able to operate at versus us having to gate any of that.
So I think that's been quite good. I'd say we probably tilted a little bit more towards marketing dollars versus kind of rep-oriented dollars. And so I think that's worked pretty well, too. It's obviously all a work in progress still. But I feel really good about where things are headed and cautiously optimistic about where things are going for the back half of the year. Got it. Thanks for the color. Thanks. Your next question comes from the line of Nick Altmann with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Yeah. Thanks, guys. Just building on Derrick's question, it sounds like you guys haven't seen much pressure on the growth side of the equation from the communication side from the headcount reduction and some of the go-to-market changes. And so I'm just wondering, can you maybe parse out for us like how significant those changes were on the communication side? I mean, I know you guys have talked about sort of this reversion to low-touch model. But is there any way to sort of give more granularity around what's the split of quota-carrying reps focusing on data apps versus communications? And then just as that sort of progresses throughout 2023, how do you guys sort of measure that impact and make changes, so to speak, Like if the communication side sort of sees further growth decel, will you start to sort of allocate more reps to that side of the business? Just any more granularity around that would be super helpful. Thanks. Sure. So this is Khozema. I can start the answer, and then if Elena wants to add some additional color, she will. But I think what's important to remember, as we went through the restructuring that we did over the last six to eight months, is that they were almost entirely impacting the communications business. There were impacts to other G&A categories. But otherwise, they were almost entirely impacting the communications business. And so as you think about the costs that came out of the business, it was really largely out of communications.
In fact, to say it a little bit differently, in the data and applications business, as Elena mentioned in some of her remarks earlier, in fact, what we're trying to do is make good investments right now, because we see a really big opportunity going forward. And we think it would be remiss, quite frankly, if we weren't investing through the cycle. And so, in a way, like we're trying to optimize for profit on the communications side, while continuing to optimize for growth on the data application side.
We haven't historically given a split of rep count or anything like that like between businesses or how that splits necessarily between products. What I would say about that, though, is we did definitely make reductions in rep count as it related to our communications business. I mean that was part of kind of getting ourselves much more towards a self-serve oriented motion. We retained reps on strategic accounts, obviously, those that are kind of larger spenders, more enterprise-like, and then we continue to grow our rep count in the data and applications business. So, hopefully, that provides you with some additional color. I can't go exactly there in terms of the rep split. Well, I would just add because we -- Khozema and I, partnered on this together, and we started orchestrating this move when I was still in the -- had a go-to-market role. Like I would say, we looked at what is the ROI of each cohort of sellers and supporting roles within the go-to-market organization and really took a close look at where our rep in was yielding discontinuous growth and where it was and we cut that out, and we made a concerted effort to make sure that sort of everywhere we are at injecting human capital, we're seeing a return for it. And so that's how I think about the fitness level that we've created across go-to-market now in both communications and data and applications. Yes. And I guess just the last thing I would add, Nick, is that in spite of all these changes that we've kind of undergone in communications business, we've maintained share, customers sustained on the platform, we haven't seen any elevated churn, and we continue winning with some really material accounts. So, that to me is a significant number of proof points that things are moving in the right direction. There's obviously more work to do. But starting off the year with strong profitability, which is kind of where we were oriented, was really important for us. And now the rest of it is execution. Great. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Samad Samana with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. So I wanted to ask maybe on the software side of the business, and I was a little bit late, so I apologize if this has already been asked. But just as you think about the -- I know you're investing for rep, but if you think about the bookings trends even as maybe customers spend on marketing is a little bit less, just how should we think about the changes and how that's driving maybe leads into the pipeline, the type of conversation that you're having? Is it changing the nature of where customers are viewing you, versus just maybe the near-term financial results, which have been impacted by changes? And then I have a follow-up. Great. I'll take that. It's Elena here. So we don't disclose our booking metrics, but we did say in prepared remarks and probably throughout the first question, that we are seeing headwinds of a couple of different flavors. I think the first thing for you to take away is that, of the sort of work we're doing to rebuild, reorient and specialize the organization, like that work's still in progress. And so while we're making great strides there, we've hired the team. We've got dedicated sellers in place for both Segments and Flex, and that's what makes up the Twilio data and applications business or software business, as you called it. The heads are in seat, but they're not fully ramped. And that's what we're working on over the next couple of quarters is making sure that these reps are ramped and fully productive and have what they need to be successful.
So we're working through that. We expect to hit that stride over the next couple of quarters, but that we're also doing that during a tough macro time period. You mentioned marketing spend and things like that. And that is exactly the sort of customer messaging breakthrough that we're seeking to have and making sure that customers continue to allocate budget to these kinds of things because we think that they're particularly helpful in this kind of a time where we're producing things like a return on ad spend, it's higher than it would be without Segment.
And so that messaging is really important right now, but at the same time, we do see substantive -- like we do see headwinds from a macro perspective. So customers adding people to the sales cycle, adding approval levels, which will elongate sales cycles, we see a little -- a small decrement in average selling price and things like that. And so we're playing through that period of time, but we feel good about the wins that we're seeing and the innovation that we're laying down in order to, number one, play through this time; but number two, prepare ourselves really well for as spend comes back online, we think we're first in line to take it. Great. And then maybe just a follow-up. There's been some scuttlebutt Google recently was talking about rolling out something called Passkeys, which is meant to kind of limit the amount of 2FA that you need and/or changing just the nature of passwords in general and maybe accessing different apps and websites. I'm curious if you guys have any thoughts on maybe what the opportunity is for Twilio. I know 2FA has been a revenue driver in the past and just how you guys are thinking about that and maybe what you're doing as how we get authenticated evolves over time? And if you have any doubts on that, that would be great. Yeah. Absolutely, Samad. This is Jeff. I'll answer that one. So the way I think about authentication these days is basically there's typically multiple forms. There's something you know, there's something you have, et cetera. And that's what we've come to understand as best practices for how to authenticate yourself. And Passkeys are really evolving the evolution of passwords, right? And they're easier to use, they're more secure, you can't reuse them. There's a lot of advantages to using this for -- instead of a password.
But the -- it's like almost like as if the computer is generating the password for you as opposed to you having to typing it in and remember it, is a way to simplify the notion there. But what it doesn't do is provide you any information about who is this customer, to identify with. How do I know who they are? And that's things where like an e-mail address or a phone number, actually provide a notion of a person and their identity as opposed to just a way to have a share and secret for some way to reauthenticate yourself.
And so these things typically work together. And if you think about our Verify product, Twilio Verify, is actually, it does the identity verification of saying you are or proving you are who you say you are, but it also does the work of saying, and this customer has this phone number. And therefore, like I know who that is. I can talk to them at that phone number. When they come back to me, I know who they are. And so I think FIDO and WebAuthn, which Passkey is basically for all times purpose is the same thing. It's a way of essentially presenting a password that is more secure, but it doesn't provide a sense of identity. Who is this person? Here's an e-mail address, a phone number. Something you can use to actually contact them and uniquely identify them in the world. That's what we offer. So these things actually work well together, and we've been evolving our offering in terms of things like Verify that offer side with network authentication as well as other forms of identity verification like WhatsApp, all wrapped up into one really nice product. And that product is selling really well. If you'll see, we had a very large Fortune 100 entertainment company, that we sold the largest Verify deal to as well as a very large AI company that we sold Verify to in this past quarter. And so the product is selling very nicely, even in an environment where FIDO and WebAuthn have been getting a lot more traction for a number of years. Great Jeff. That's very helpful. Thank you so much. Your next question comes from the line of Matt Stotler with William Blair. Please go ahead. Hey, guys, this is Alex [ph] on for Matt. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to speak about the partner channel. If you could talk to any updates you might have there, especially with the GSIs and regional Sis. How are you enabling those partners? Do you have any thoughts on expanding the partner contribution going forward? Thanks. I will take that one. It's Elana here on the data and application side. We see a big role for partners, both today going forward. We've got a fiber and ecosystem of partners and particularly partners on the SI side, not just global SIs, but regional as well. And so, I'd say that the SI community is performing well in the big ecosystem as well as black, so those tend to be different partners. We also have a couple of others that I wouldn't necessarily put in the SI bucket, but are, I think, pretty interesting for us today, segment, the top partners within the AWS IV Accelerate program, which connects AWS sellers and our sales process. We're seeing some good deals from that. And then on the flex side, we've got several partners that sort of span just the SI world, but also build product side by side with flex as well. And so, I'd say that we are -- I said over the past couple of calls, actually that this is an area of focus and investment for us. I think we're seeing some good green shoots there, lots, lots more to do. I don't know if statement has anything to add on the comp side. Thanks. Your next question comes from the line of Fred Havemeyer with Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead. Hi. Thank you. I wanted to ask about some of the segment wins that you were talking about there. I think the selection of customers was actually quite interesting. You have a health care company. You have a database company. You have a wireless company that has a more expansive relationship with Twilio. So, could you talk about perhaps some of the use cases that these companies are using segment for? And where those companies are finding value right now with segment? Segments super interesting. We talk a lot about B2C, and there's definitely fantastic brands that are direct to consumer or have a big consumer element to what they do that are really out there working to find, identify, engage, acquire and just better nurture. Those kinds of relationships in a way that is cost effective, really fast and petty and gives them the ability to do things that they can't do with their traditional kind of cobbled together CRM infrastructure. That said, we do have a percentage of our segment customer population, that's also B2B. And so people that play in both B2B and B2C that are finding ways to sort of cross-pollinate their own channels and their own customer identity is using the power of segment.
And so, we see customers do everything from sort of the core sort of data platform use cases and really using us for things that are quite simple, but hard to pull off. And then we have customers that are growing set of customers that are adding on capabilities, so Engage, for example, and our new Unify capability that we talked about in our prepared remarks.
So those are a couple of things that we're doing. I think long game, we expect the customer data platform to sort of be at the center for there to be a lot that we do with that. And so from Engage, for example, actually engaging your customers getting out via our different communications channels to utilizing segment information, to have better experiences with Flex in the call center or in a digital sort of in-app communication mechanism that a customer might be using with Flex. So we see a ton of extension capability here with that CDP as the center. Thank you. And I think as a follow-up question. I was noticing the top 10 customer accounts are now down to about 10% of total revenue. I wanted to ask, is that a function of just diversification of Twilio's revenue base, or is there anything to read in there in terms of how your top customers are also trending their own usage of Twilio? This is Aidan. I'll take that. Yeah, it's largely a function of continued diversification. We are well diversified across industries, across customers and so that continued. I'd say in terms of lower usage, we have seen that generally across the communications and the D&A business, and that's again largely a function of the macro, but as it relates to the top tenants, its continued diversification. Thank you. So Fred, this is Jeff. You asked about some of the use cases for segment and I might expand because I think there's a few that are interesting that I thought would be worth sharing because one of the really cool things about segment and having this customer data is like a great platform. Once a customer puts it in, I think they find that there are multiple like many benefits of having the customer data in a spot, having it clean, having it good governance over it and then ways in which you can activate it across many different parts of the customer life cycle.
And so I was talking to a global Fortune 100 this morning about a segment opportunity. they rattled off like five different use cases from CRM to personalization across properties to tracking their customers across multiple acquisitions they had done. And knowing if a customer in one customer base was the same as a customer in other part of customer base, so they could do more effective cross-selling and more effective retention of those customers. And so I think in M&A cases, for example, there are great opportunities because you have different identifiers for customers.
There's one customer that I think is a great neat use case that I really like, which is they brought in the segment so that they could personalize their IDRs. And the idea was the thing they had seen was, if you are trying to log in, say through the website or a mobile app and you consistently can't log in, like your passport is not working. They can see that in a real-time using segment and flag your profile of someone who is likely having a password problem. And when you call in, which probably at the scale of this customer, happens, I don't know, 100,000 tonnes a day or whatever, they will put the first thing in ideas, having issues logging in and press one. It was ordinarily you have to go like 10 menus deep to get to that look probably. But for you, because they saw your behavior on the website, is clearly even trouble logging in, they dynamically program that. I mean like these are the kinds of use cases we see customers building across many different parts of their customer life cycle, marketing, sales, product, service support, that allow customers to serve their customers better. And that's why I think data as a platform in segment is such a great product. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Hey, guys, thanks for taking the question. I guess maybe just the first question is, the gross margins in the quarter were actually better, I think, than we anticipated. I think that was the best performance in the last -- since Q1 of last year, is international didn't go down as a percentage of the total revenue. Was there something else that you're maybe walking away from business more that had a lower gross margin in the quarter? I know that we're not guiding to it, but at least from a trend lining perspective, how should we think about that? And then I've got a quick follow-up for Jeff. Hi Alex, this is Aidan. Yes. So it was 52.3% in the quarter and that was up sequentially about 170 basis points. So that was positive. Although, I would say we'll continue to see variability on this line. And so it's largely a function of the mix of products and also within the messaging business, the mix of geography where the traffic terminates, which is a little bit different than the international percent of revenue that you're looking at, which is based on customer headquarters. And what we saw this quarter relative to last quarter, there was a different mix in terms of where traffic was terminating and that drove the better gross margin overall.
As we think about going forward and how to think about this, we're really orienting the business more to gross profit dollars and the gross margin rates, given the strong unit economics, in particular in the messaging business. And so that will continue to be our focus as we move forward is really orienting the team to gross profit dollar generation. And as long as we can do that with the right cost structure, we think that's a good business to keep doing. Got it. And then maybe, Jeff, one for you. You talked about AI and generative AI with respect to segment and CDP. I guess, one common question we get is the notion of bidirectional messaging, conversational messaging seems like that trend is having a massive moment right now in the marketplace. Can you maybe talk about the puts and takes and the potential tailwinds to the communications side of the business from generative AI, what you're seeing in customer conversations that you're having existing or new around that? Yes. So just to give you a quick backdrop, I mentioned at the beginning of the call that generative AI is the next platform shift in technology. A matter it's in technology, it's actually in society. And if you think about the -- when these ships occur, like the PC or the arrival of the PC and the PC to the web, and the web to mobile, right, you can see the kind of disruption that occurs in market after market when these transformations happen.
In fact, it's interesting, there was a Wall Street Journal headline today that says, is this the iPhone moment. And I think, absolutely, I would answer yes. Yes, it is. Now there's an interesting question though, if you remember in the early days of, say, the web, where companies were trying to figure out what do we do? Do we give a brochure on the site? Remember when companies used to say, like we're not allowed to like off of our site because there's a legal problem of that? Everyone’s like, what?
So people have to figure out how to use these new technologies in the corporate setting. And I think that's what the conversations I’m having with customers now are exactly that, right? Is this ready for an enterprise use case or is a bot that I put in front of my customer is going to start like talking saying stuff that I don't want to say, right? Is it going to start having a dialogue with my customers about God knows what -- or are they going to stay on topic and can talk about my products, my services and all that kind of stuff. And so I think that's where a lot of the work is going right now.
And I think there's really good questions that are getting answered every day that work we are doing, work others are doing in terms of like how to keep these large language models on topic and provide boundaries for them so that they are useful in a corporate context. And that stuff is getting resolved, I think, pretty quickly. And so the converse -- I'll put you into a conversation now with the customer recently which I think is indicative of what I think is going to happen. It was I was talking to a customer, a very large financial services company.
And they were telling me how they had spent the last seven years building out all of the intent to have a bot for their service use cases that could contain customer culture containment as the -- didn't have to reach a person. And they said, well, this containment was after seven years of work or whatever, it's about 40% and so 60% of the call is made through that. And I asked -- and we're talking about large language models, and I said, do you think you're going to keep that investment or do you think you're going to start from scratch in the large language model world.
And the customers say now, I will keep that investment, but hopefully, large language models will help us move it forward from 40% up from there. And through the course of the conversation, we talked a lot about what's possible in the architecture of these new language models and how they can work with segment customer data and things like this. And at the end of the conversation they asked again, do you think you're going to keep that 40% -- the investment you made over the last seven years that got you to 40% containment?
And the customer said, no its going in the garbage can, right? Like every decision we've made for the last seven years about what's possible is now like a relic of the past and we are up for relitigation and potentially new approaches, new vendors, new ways of implementing it because large language model world just upends what is possible. And I think that is why it is a gift in terms of creating new opportunities for companies like Twilio who is helping our customers to activate their customer data across the customer life cycle, take CRM, which has historically business like kind of a sleepy area of like just a database, not activated, making useful across many different touch points.
Large language models are an absolute gift, and I'm very happy that we bought segment when we did because the data that is in segment enables a company to customize these interactions based on who they're talking to. The end user, the customer of our customer, and that is very powerful. So anyway, this is day zero of large language models, and you'll be hearing more from us in the course of this quarter. Obviously, we have signaled in August and I would not be a responsible technology leader. If AI wasn't prominently a part of what we're talking about at Signal, so we'll have more coming, and I hope everybody joins us in Signal in August. Perfect. Thank you guys. Your next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Hey, guys, it's Phil on for Siti. Thanks for taking my question. In your prepared remarks, you guys noted a flex win with a major financial services company. Would we love to learn a bit more about this win, as it sourced through an SI partner. And how well is flex position to compete with the other CCaaS vendors? So a couple of things. We -- I don't believe that one was partner sourced. But it's a deal we've been working on for a few quarters. They are -- it is a legacy takeout, and it is sort of a contact center specific use case. But I would say, because you asked about Flex, that's really not our only use case. We're starting to see sort of a cold lessing around three or four key things that we see really playing well in the market. So, first is sort of this in-app digital communication and that digital concierge kind of capability, and we see a lot of great direct-to-consumer brands utilizing flex in that way.
Secondly is sort of a high-touch contextual sales kind of moment, and we see certain large retailers and some other financial institutions playing in that area. And then lastly is sort of our core contact center use cases in the service and support area. And this example that you mentioned happens to live a rate in that area, and that's the one that was in our prepared remarks today. Okay. Thanks. Your final question comes from the line of Michael Funk with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Yeah, thanks for squeezing me. Two, if I could, quickly. So Aidan, one for you if I could. The operating margin guidance for 2Q, I saw you called out a number of factors pressuring that sequentially. However, I would have thought the full quarter of the head count reduction, potentially positive mix shift would have offset the reversal for example, you called out other things. Are there other factors going into that? Thanks for the question, Michael. So, we try to be pretty transparent about this in the prepared remarks, because we are expecting profit to be down quarter-over-quarter. So you gave a lot of information there, and I recognize it's a little bit counterintuitive given the timing of the restructuring in the first quarter. So let me just like to walk through some of the pieces and I'll talk about what will continue beyond the second quarter as well. So, first, the first quarter benefited from a $12 million onetime accrual reversal related to the sunsetting of our employee sabbatical program. That will repeat in the second quarter or beyond. We guided to lower quarter-over-quarter revenues, which directly impacts our gross profit as well as our operating profit.
And then we expect a number of different cost items to be ahead with quarter-over-quarter. First, merit goes into effect in the second quarter as it does every year. And so that will obviously go into effect Q2 and for the rest of the year. We're moving some employees who talked about this in the prior earnings call. We're moving some employees to cash bonuses from equity-based awards. This is for a subset of our employee base, but it will help moderate stock-based compensation expense growth going forward. And but that in the period presents an OpEx headwind.
We've also made some changes to our incentive compensation structure to the communications sales team to better align to Twilio’s financial goals. And while that doesn't result in any difference in cash being paid to a specific sales executive, there's a bit of a difference in accounting in terms of what is incurred in period versus what is deferred over time. And so that creates a little bit of a headwind.
And then lastly, we do expect more normalized levels of marketing and travel spend in the second quarter. I'd say we're pretty light in the first quarter, just post the reorganization as teams are settling into the new structures. We just didn't spend as much as we had planned we would. And so all of those items more than offset the full quarter benefit of the restructuring actions that we announced in February, but we're still guiding to $65 million to $75 million we raised the low end of our guide for the year to $2.75 to $3.50, and we're tracking really well to date. That’s very helpful color. I appreciate it. Thank you. This concludes the conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect your lines.","our prepared remarks, earnings press release, investor presentation, SEC filings and a replay of today's call can be found on our IR website at investors.twilio.com . some of our commentary today will include non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics .",0.0

At this time, I would like to hand the call over to Mr. Bryan Vaniman, for opening remarks. Please go ahead, sir. Thanks, Lisa. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Twilio's second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Our prepared remarks, earnings press release, investor presentation, SEC filings and a replay of today's call can be found on our IR website at investors.twilio.com.
Joining me today for Q&A are Jeff Lawson, Co-Founder and CEO; Elena Donio, President Twilio Data and Applications; Khozema Shipchandler, President, Twilio Communications; and Aidan Viggiano, Chief Financial Officer. Due to an issue with our external website vendor, the prepared remarks were only recently posted to our IR website. Thus, the team will be reading these live at the outset of the call.
As a reminder, some of our commentary today will include non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics. Reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and further information related to guidance, definitions and key metrics can be found in our earnings press release and the appendix of our prepared remarks, both of which can be found on our IR website.
The information provided and discussed today also will include forward-looking statements, including statements about our future outlook and goals. These forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that are described in more detail in our most recent periodic reports filed with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and our subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, which are available on our website and at sec.gov. Forward-looking statements represent our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made. Actual results may vary significantly, and we expressly assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.
I'd also like to highlight that following our recent field reorganization into two business units, beginning this quarter, we will be reporting our revenue and non-GAAP gross profit results in two segments, Twilio communications and Twilio Data and Applications.
With that, I'll hand it over to Jeff to open the prepared remarks. Thank you, Bryan. We closed out a strong second quarter, over delivering on both our revenue and profit targets, and generating record quarterly non-GAAP income from operations of $120 million. We begin the second half of the year energized by the progress we’ve made to date in Communications, confident that we’ve laid the foundation to reaccelerate growth in our Data & Applications business over time, and optimistic about AI’s potential to be an accelerant for Twilio’s vision. We also remain committed to continuing to deliver against our profitability targets in any financial environment.
We’ve made substantial strides on our path to GAAP profitability and have substantially increased the operating margin profile of our business. In Q2, we reduced GAAP loss from operations by over 50% year-over-year, drove a continued reduction in stock-based compensation, and delivered $72 million of free cash flow in the quarter. We’re executing well against our commitments, and as a result of our strong performance for the first half of the year, we're raising our full-year non-GAAP income from operations guidance to $350 million to $400 million.
A business transformation as big as what Twilio is taking on takes time. It requires tactical focus in the short term and a bold vision for what’s possible in the long term. Twilio’s Act 1, Communications, has been a success in terms of scale and efficiency. Our Communications business continues to deliver against the objectives we’ve set, driving efficient growth, while we target ongoing operating leverage in the coming years.
And we're now building Act two based on our belief that Twilio’s data asset, when combined with the power and reach of our Communications platform and accelerated by AI, can unlock value for businesses that we are uniquely positioned to deliver through our innovative combination of product offerings. While I don’t expect the road ahead to be linear, we’ve embarked on a massive market opportunity, one that has the ability to transform the status quo for customer engagement.
Now, to where we are today: In Communications, we delivered a strong quarter and are encouraged by continued signs of stabilization across our customer base. The efficiency actions and have proven to be the right ones and the business is delivering with a more streamlined operating profile. Following our largest email deal in Q1, the team signed our largest ever messaging deal in Q2, an exciting milestone for Twilio at this scale.
As a part of our efforts to focus on doing fewer things better, we also recently completed the divestitures of Twilio's IoT and ValueFirst businesses. The usage-based nature of our Communications business makes it sensitive to macro conditions, so the team continues to manage towards gross profit growth and driving leverage. Khozema will share where the team is focused on driving further efficiencies, while capitalizing on our growth opportunities through the second half of the year and beyond.
In Data & Applications, we are continuing to focus on executing against our go-to-market rebuild efforts. We now have sales reps ramped in our most critical areas and we are optimistic that our bookings will improve towards the end of the year and that revenue growth will accelerate during 2024. Elena will share more about our progress here.
In June, we previewed our vision for CustomerAI, which we have designed to layer predictive and generative AI capabilities across our platform at every customer touch point. As I shared last quarter, I believe the real value unlock for artificial intelligence will be pairing large language models with first party data sets . We believe this is where Twilio is most differentiated through our data asset segment
Segment’s customer profiles will become even more data rich with AI, accelerating our data and communications flywheel. By training large language models for customers with their data that lives inside segment, Twilio will help customers enter the AI race multiple steps ahead of their peers. Twilio's ability to drive that level of differentiated customer value proposition has the potential to be a significant tailwind for our business.
We’re also excited to be building an ecosystem of partners and integrations including Google, Databricks, FrameAI, and OpenAI to power some of CustomerAI’s generative capabilities as well as AWS to power predictive AI use cases within Segment. I can’t I wait to showcase several of the products that will advance our CustomerAI vision at SIGNAL on August 23rd just a few weeks away.
I’m proud of the team for navigating through a lot of change as we reoriented the company over the last several quarters. This is a team that has executed well against our plans, as evidenced by the speed in which they have adapted to the new structure of the business, driving greater efficiency and having delivered over $220 million of non-GAAP operating income through the first two quarters of 2023, exceeding our financial targets and building a foundation that sets us up to continue to achieve our goals and capitalize on the tremendous opportunity ahead. I remain confident we have the right team, the right plan and solutions to deliver meaningful value to our customers and look forward to sharing our progress today.
Now I am going to hand it over to Elena. Thanks, Twilio Data & Applications delivered $125 million in revenue in Q2, up 12% year-over-year, with a non-GAAP gross margin of 81.7%. During the quarter we continued to execute against our plan to mature our sales organization, invest in new AI-powered products and capabilities, and expand our pipeline in an environment where buyers are facing increased budget scrutiny. I’m pleased with our progress to date, but we have more work ahead.
Since last quarter we’ve announced several exciting partnerships and new product capabilities that reflect our unique position in the market. In July, IDC ranked Segment as the number one CDP by worldwide market share in 20221. We recently announced a partnership with Databricks to develop a bi-directional integration that will help Segment customers unlock even more value from their data.
Additionally, we are partnering with Google to bring generative AI into Flex and transform how brands personalize their customer interactions. Finally, we unveiled CustomerAI, infusing generative and predictive AI capabilities into Segment, Engage, Flex, and Communications. Our Signal conference is two weeks away and we plan to showcase new innovation and an exciting roadmap built around our CustomerAI vision.
Our software products are resonating in the market as evidenced by multiple notable customer wins this quarter. A long-standing Communications customer that provides software solutions to health and wellness providers signed a deal in Q2 with Segment CDP to deliver personalized customer experiences, increase trial-to-paid subscription rates, and drive improved patient outcomes.
Follett, a leading provider of education technology, will leverage our entire suite of Segment products, including Connections, Protocols, Audiences, Journeys, and Unify. We won this competitive deal because of Segment’s faster time-to-value and ease of use in the future when the customer wants to leverage Segment’s APIs to connect to additional tools throughout their future as the customers of ours.
Fortune Media, a multinational media company, was a competitive win due to the flexibility of Segment Connections and the power of our Profile API, allowing Fortune Media to obtain a single view of their end users, furthering the ability to personalize and improve the overall engagement experience.

A large financial services company based in Israel committed to a comprehensive contact center solution leveraging Flex and our Conversations API for a custom-built AI chatbot with seamless agent handoff, allowing them to scale while improving the customer experience.
A Fortune 100 property and casualty insurance provider that we signed an eight-figure deal with in Q3’22 scaled to over 15,000 agents during the quarter by leveraging new capabilities in Flex allowing for enterprise scale. This Flex scale initiative, which was launched in limited availability in February, allows Flex to support customers scaling up to 30,000 agents concurrently in a single account.
As I mentioned last quarter, we’ve made good progress with our transition to a dedicated sales model for Segment and Flex, and have rebuilt a specialized sales motion with highly skilled reps. Training and enablement was a key focus area for Q2 and we delivered increased in-person training sessions and improved overall sales capacity across the board. I’m excited that for the first time in over a year, the majority of our Segment sales team has been in-seat for at least nine months.
We’ve seen early signs of traction with these efforts, including a strong increase in pipeline generation within Flex and significant improvement in Segment pipeline conversion from Q1. While I’m encouraged by our progress and some of these early signals, we continue to navigate a challenging macro, which has led to some instances of higher renewal contraction and lower expansion.
Competitive churn has remained low and stable, but we are seeing instances of greater price sensitivity with some of our SMB customers. To address this, we are implementing initiatives designed to give customers, particularly small and mid-sized businesses, more flexibility to start small, deploy quickly, and expand to leverage more Segment capabilities as their business grows.
We feel good about the steps we’ve made to improve execution, but there is still more work ahead to get our Data & Applications performance back to where we believe it should be. Going forward, we’ll continue to focus on onboarding and ramping our teams, optimizing our marketing campaigns, and driving more top-of-funnel activity.
We’ll also focus on giving our customers more accessible entry points to our products and delivering faster time to value. We believe we’re laying a solid foundation for long-term growth for the business, and I’m confident that this will lead to improved bookings towards the back-end of the year.
With that, I am going to turn it over to Khozema. Thank you, Elena, Twilio Communications delivered $913 million in revenue in Q2, up 10% year-over-year, with a non-GAAP gross margin of 48.2%. As a team, we continue to focus on driving growth with a more streamlined cost structure, and generating meaningful profits. I’m pleased with our team’s ability to quickly adapt to the organizational changes we made earlier this year, which is evidenced by the results we delivered in Q2.
Once again, Twilio was named a leader in IDC’s recent 2023 CPaaS MarketScape report. Leveraging this leadership position, our go-to-market team has been focused on proactively driving cross-sell opportunities across our broad portfolio of Communications products, and we’re seeing meaningful traction. As an example, last quarter we highlighted our largest email deal in Twilio history, and this quarter we signed our largest messaging deal ever with the same leading marketing automation company, bringing their total commitment to Twilio to more than $100 million.
Additionally, a Fortune 500 entertainment customer that has been using our messaging, account security and voice APIs, recently chose Twilio to exclusively power a critical customer onboarding initiative, increasing their ongoing messaging spend with Twilio by $1 million a month.
We continue to see an exciting runway for efficient growth in our Communications business against a $50+ billion TAM, and we believe our innovations in AI can help accelerate market share gains in the coming years. We are bringing AI/ML capabilities to life in our core Communications products, including the release of Fraud Guard for Verify
In Q2 we signed an expansion deal with a leading employment company to enhance their multi-channel, high-touch customer relationship model via our messaging, voice, and email APIs. Fraud Guard was an instrumental component of this deal. We also piloted SMS Pumping Protection in the second quarter, which leverages AI to \ automatically detect and block artificially inflated SMS traffic via our messaging API. This product prevented meaningful losses on behalf of our pilot customers and as a result of the successful pilot, we’ve recently moved it into private beta.
We also released Twilio Voice Intelligence into public beta, an AI-powered capability allowing our customers to extract data insights from their call recordings, unlocking process automation and data-driven decision making at scale. A global financial services institution and a longstanding Programmable Voice customer is one of our first major customers to adopt this product. Leveraging Voice Intelligence has proven to continually increase the quality of their customer service and ensure robust compliance.
We’re also continuing to focus on our sales assisted product-led growth motion, and in Q2 we made great strides in returning to our self-service roots. During the quarter we rolled out several updates to drive greater pricing transparency. We also implemented a decentralized solutions engineering team, removed layers of leadership and specialist teams, and arranged our international go-to-market team to be centrally managed. We are thoughtfully deploying our go-to-market resources to spend time on our larges existing and prospective customers to drive greater efficiencies and customer wins in
the coming quarters.
We are encouraged by our growth trajectory in Q2, but still see a choppy macro, which also means we have less visibility in this environment. We’re seeing volume growth across a number of our verticals, but we are still experiencing volume weakness in a few verticals including Social & Messaging and Crypto. On balance, we remain hopeful about Q3 and beyond, and believe we have a good setup to continue to drive operating leverage and growth moving forward with a much more efficient go-to-market model.
It’s worth noting that we have made a commitment to our carrier partners to block unregistered U.S.-bound 10DLC SMS and MMS traffic as of August 31, 2023. We expect this will have a modest negative impact on revenue growth in Q3 of up to 100 basis points, and it could yield a potential headwind of 200 to 300 basis points on growth in Q4. While the majority of our traffic is already registered, we are actively working with customers who are not yet compliant to get their traffic registered in advance of the deadline.
I’m excited by the progress we made during the first half of the year as the team successfully navigated the operational and organizational changes we implemented, together with a challenging external environment. We’re executing well, and as volume stabilization continues, we believe we’re in a strong position to leverage our scale, large customer base and leading set of Communications products to continue to win new business everywhere we can, while driving further efficiencies, and we are confident revenue growth will reaccelerate over time
With that, I will turn it over to Aidan, to disucss our financials. Thank you, Khozema. We continue to execute on our plans to drive greater efficiencies across our business and establish an accelerated path to profitability. We’ve made solid progress against our targets, delivering record quarterly non-GAAP income from operations in Q2 and continuing on our path towards GAAP profitability. While we have more to accomplish, I’m pleased with the traction we’ve achieved to date and the results our team delivered in the quarter.
Second quarter revenue was $1.038 billion, up 10% year-over-year on both a reported and organic basis. Communications revenue was $913 million, up 10% year-over-year; Data & Applications revenue was $125 million, up 12% year-over-year; and IoT and ValueFirst revenue was $25 million and is included in our Communications revenue for Q2; adjusting for these recent divestitures, total Q2 revenue would have been $1.013 million, up 11% year-over-year.
While the market remains dynamic, we saw continued stabilization of volumes across our usage-based products throughout the quarter, which helped drive our revenue beat. As we referenced during our Q1 earnings call, our Q2 revenue growth rate was negatively impacted by headwinds from customers in the crypto industry. Total Q2 organic revenue growth excluding crypto customers was 14% year-over-year.
We anticipate similar headwinds in Q3, after which the impact will start to moderate. Our Q2 Dollar-Based Net Expansion Rate was 103%. This is directly correlated to the overall growth trends we’re experiencing across the business. Dollar-based net expansion rates for the Communications and Data & Applications business units were 103% and 99%, respectively.
Q2 non-GAAP gross profit grew 13% year-over-year, representing a non-GAAP gross margin of 52.2%. This is up 130 basis points year-over-year and down 10 basis points quarter-over-quarter, driven predominantly by product mix. Non-GAAP gross margins for our Communications and Data & Applications business were 48.2% and 81.7% respectively.
Q2 non-GAAP income from operations was $120 million, representing a non-GAAP operating margin of 11.6%. This was significantly ahead of expectations, primarily due to the revenue beat and our ongoing efforts to maintain cost discipline across the business.
Q2 GAAP loss from operations was $142 million, which includes expenses associated with the February restructuring action, a loss associated with our ValueFirst divestiture, and real estate impairment charges, all-in totaling $55 million.
Stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenue was 14.7% in Q2 excluding approximately $3000 of restructuring costs, down 120 basis points quarter-over-quarter.
Lastly, for Q2 we generated $72 million in free cash flow, and this is an area of focus for us as we drive greater profitability in the business. We’re delivering against the plans that we outlined in February, and the progress that we demonstrated in Q2 shows that the changes we’ve made in the business are yielding the intended efficiency gains and profitability results.
We’ve also continued to execute against our $1 billion share repurchase program that we commenced in February. We completed the first $500 million of new repurchases in early July, ahead of our original six month target. We intend to continue to make progress against the balance of our share repurchase authorization moving forward.
While we feel confident about the strength of our competitive positioning and market opportunity, we’re continuing to plan and run the business prudently given the dynamic external environment.
For Q3 guidance, we’re initiating a revenue target of $980 million to $990 million, representing year-over-year reported revenue growth of 0% to 1% and 3% to 4% on an organic basis. The organic growth rate excludes our ValueFirst and IoT businesses, both of which were recently divested.
Also, as mentioned above, these growth rates reflect a few hundred basis point headwind from crypto customers, as well as the potential one hundred basis point headwind associated with 10 DLC registration changes that Khozema highlighted.
We expect Q3 non-GAAP income from operations of $75 million to $85 million. This takes into account approximately $10 million of expenses for our SIGNAL Conference, which will take place this month. Given our strong first half performance, we're raising our full-year non-GAAP income from operations guidance to $350 million to $400 million.
We’ve made meaningful progress over the first half of the year, but there is still more work to be done. I’m confident that we are taking the right set of actions that will enable us to continue to drive focused execution and deliver increased value to our shareholders in the quarters to come.
With that, I'll hand it back to Jeff for some final remarks before we transition to Q&A. Thank you, Aidan and team. I just wanted to close by reminding folks if you haven't already heard enough to our prepared remarks, that indeed, our annual SIGNAL Conference is coming up on August 23rd. And CustomerAI, which we presume June, it's going to be taking center stage, and I'm really excited to be sharing the product details behind customer AI at Signal, and customer AI, the set of capabilities that it brings will help bring together our leading communications platform and our leading customer data platform with AI in the middle. So I can't ind customer's bill on top of customer AI.
And with that, why don't we turn it over to your questions. Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Meta Marshall, Morgan Stanley. Great. Thanks. And Jeff, you may have just alluded to this, but we'll hear more at Signal. But I just wanted to get a sense of how kind of the increase in AI visibility or capability has changed the road map for Twilio? And just where are customers and the knowledge of how they want to actually approach some of these AI projects? Are they to the point where they know what they want to implement? Or is it still kind of an education phase? Thanks. Yes. Thanks for the question, Meta. I talked to a lot of customers. And what I find is that customers are still very much in a learning mode and planning for the future mode, but not necessarily in deploying things actively most. And so I think it's a really constructive conversation.
When I look at customer AI and what we can do with artificial intelligence, I think this is the glue that brings together segments and Twilio communications into this one, customer engagement platform that we've been talking about for quite a while.
And I think AI is arriving even sooner than we thought in terms of generative AI to be able to bring a lot of those benefits to the table. We're already seeing the benefit of a bunch of AI, whether it's Verify with a new broadband product, in some of our compliance on authentication products. But I think this is like - this isn't even the first inning. This is like still doing warm-up pitches in terms of the AI game here.
And so we're really excited, though, to bring some new products to market as well as to really speak to much more detail about the vision for customer AI at signal, but I think this is a massive accelerator and our ability to deliver value between data and communications and can become a great talent in the company. Great. Thanks. Next question is Taylor McGinnis [UBS] Yes. Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. Maybe just on the data and apps part of the story. So if I'm trying to bridge the gross margins were down 250 basis points year-over-year, and then you reported an NRR of 99% in that segment. So I know you talked about some greater renewal contraction and some price sensitivities. But just as we look ahead, like can you see, I guess, more risk to the gross margins in that segment?
And then just in terms of the top line, when we think about the 12% growth you just reported, that's still well above like the 99% NRR. So any direction or color you can just give in terms of how you see that business progressing throughout the year? And if there could be a trough in the level of growth that we could see. Thanks so much. Why don't I start, Taylor, this is Aidan. I'll go through gross margins, and then I'll hand it over to Aidan to talk about DB&E and revenue growth. So you're right that TD&A margins were down year-over-year. That actually primarily driven by accounting and in particular, accounting for capitalized software. So the initial capitalized software balance following the acquisition of segment was written off. And that's typical post an acquisition. That boosted the gross margins in the 2021 and 2022 period.
And as product development and innovation has been ongoing post-acquisition, that balance is building back up to a more normalized level. Now that we're kind of three years or approaching three years post acquisition, that should start to normalize, but that's really what's driving the year-over-year decline. The business is still obviously very high margins at 82%. And there will always be pluses and minuses period-to-period, but we feel pretty good about that gross margin rate. We don't see anything materially in the future. So why don't I hand it over to Elena with that. Sure. I'll hit a couple of comments on growth. Our current growth is really reflective of bookings that have happened in prior quarters. And we've talked over the last couple of quarters about a deceleration in booking performance, which is now coming to bear in the revenue line, which we expect to inflect and turn back up as we see bookings improve this year. So we've talked a lot, I think historically about the work that we're doing to improve that bookings trajectory, everything from building out, hiring, enabling and preparing that team to go out and win in the market and also working to make sure that we're breaking through during a tough economic climate.
A couple of other things impacting growth are trending to traction numbers. They've been impacting us a little more than we lag in the near term. We have some segment customers that are rightsizing their spend levels. Mostly, as their own businesses have contracted over time, we see some instances of sensitivity, particularly in the SMB space where those customers at times have had some viability issues.
And so all of that taken together, so some good traction in our bookings performance and increased customer contraction and churn, though not competitive, but it's sort of a signal of what's happening in the market. Our growth has been sort of moderated here in the near term. I want to reiterate that we do expect bookings to continue to improve as that team comes online and we break through the tough macro. And that revenue performance will follow into next year. Great. Thanks. Thanks so much and congrats on the quarter. Your next question is Mark Murphy, JPMorgan. Yes. Thank you very much. So Khozema, just given that the messaging business is usage-based. And therefore, it is macro sensitive, as you noted. Can you just comment on the stability that you're seeing there? Specifically, I'm just wondering, should we read that as stabilizing around 10% year-over-year growth or stabilizing around $900 million in quarterly revenue? Or do you mean something else there? And then can you just comment on whether that trending continued to improve at all in June and July? Yeah, Mark, good question. So maybe to start off with kind of the first part. So what we see overall is that volumes have stabilized. And we're not trying to imply really either of the things that you said either that we're going to turn in kind of regular 10% revenue growth quarters nor that we're going to see the business kind of flat line. I'd say, it's probably kind of closer to being in the middle of that somewhere -- while we've seen volumes stabilize, we haven't necessarily seen them inflect up. But obviously, we're encouraged by the quarter that we just put up in Q2.
I'd say across the board, we've generally seen that most of the sectors in which we operate have seen pretty good revenue and volume growth. There have been a couple of downs, which we called out in the prepared remarks. Notably, we have seen some contracting activity in messaging and social meeting social messaging.
And I think that had it not been for some of those items like we would have seen obviously a pretty decent growth in the quarter beyond where we ended up landing. I think we also called out some of the 10 DLC dynamics that are coming up in Q3, Q4. We think that's kind of a good thing, obviously, for the industry over the long term. But that's kind of the way that I would characterize it is that volumes stabilized. We're not seeing them inflect quite up yet. But based on our execution against sales targets, we're very encouraged about how that translates into financial results. Just a super quick follow-up because you mentioned it, does that headwind from blocking unregistered traffic continue at 300 basis points into 2024. I'm just trying to understand, it seems like it widens from Q3 to Q4? And then does it presumably kind of moderate a little bit in 2024? Yes. Another good question, Mark. So the way to think about it is that basically, the way that we have made the agreement with the carriers is that 8/31 is the deadline. And so you're just not going to see the impact in Q3 in the same way that you would in Q4. That's kind of the discrepancy between 100 bps in quarter versus 200 to 300 bps in the next quarter. I think the other dynamic that you want to think about is that the vast majority of this traffic is already registered and compliant. And so I think as we get into 2024, like, we're not really talking about the impacts, but we think it will kind of more or less normalized. Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Turrin, Wells Fargo Securities0 Hey great, thanks. Appreciate you taking the question. If we just look at the revenue upside you delivered in Q2, it's more pronounced than we've seen in a number of quarters. I'm wondering, is most of that just tied to the stabilization commentary you're making on the usage side and results that are coming in ahead of what you're expecting? And then just if there's any commentary you can add around if the usage trends at all changed as the quarter progressed, meaning, did we start at a lower point and potentially build back up? Or is that stabilization holding somewhat consistent, I think that color is just useful as we all just try to parse through what's ahead here. Thanks. Thanks, Michael. So to answer your first question in terms of the larger beats, so we’re continuing about 5% a head of the midpoint of the guidance range. That is, as you say, it's largely as a result of the volume stabilization that we noted. So we saw that we called it out in May. We saw that volume stabilization continued through the rest of the quarter, and that's really what drove the outperformance. And we're pretty encouraged by that. I mean, the market is still very dynamic. It's still usage-based business for the vast majority of our business. So, we are susceptible to changes and we'll continue to plan prudently as a result.
In terms of the volume trends, so what I would say is relatively constant throughout the second quarter, but a different trend than we saw kind of the coming out of 2022 and in the early stages of Q1. And so we felt pretty encouraged by the fact that it was relatively constant across the months in the second quarter. That’s helpful. Thank you. The next question comes from Ryan Koontz, Needham & Company. Thanks for question. I have one for Khozema on the communications side. As you think about kind of the journey into more and more automation, can you give us an idea kind of where you are today in terms of automation, where you expect to be, say, a year from now in terms of deal screening, onboarding, delivery execution? Just any color on that journey would be helpful. Thank you. Yes. Hey Ryan. I just want to clarify one part of your question. Do you mean automation vis-à-vis the kind of description that we gave back to kind of our product line growth kind of self-serve roots? Yes. Yes. So I would say, for the most part, like we obviously took a number of like really significant headcount actions, right, in the latter part of 2022 and then the beginning part of 2023. And so the way that we think about the business going forward is that we continue to see like a lot of of growth potential for the business in the future, and we want to basically kind of stabilize our costs. And I think the way to do that is largely going to be through automation. Jeff talked about AI and the promise of a lot of the things that we could do from a customer perspective. I also think there's a lot of those things that we could do internal to the company as well in terms of eating with some of that automation.
There are a number of areas that we're starting to explore in currently, and I think that could be really interesting. For the most part, I would say that we've seen really good profit generation in terms of the business. I think we continue to see additional profit generation as we move forward. And I think in large part, that's going to come through some combination of additional growth and then just being able to hold the cost line and probably generate some productivity in the cost line and the bulk of that will largely come through automotive -- automation efforts. Sure. That's helpful. Just a quick clarification. Would you say maybe you're halfway there in terms of what you want to see operationally or for the most part, you're there? I wouldn't say we're there. I mean, I'd be a little bit careful about qualifying exactly where we are in the journey. Personally, I mean I do see a lot more opportunity for us to drive volume leverage. And so I think we'll just kind of play through and see where we go into next year. Excellent. Thanks so much. Kash Rangan, Goldman Sachs has the next question. Hi, thank you very much. Curious to get your take on how you characterize the outlook for potentially accelerating bookings growth or how that might translate the better revenue growth rate going forward. If you can talk about the demand signals that you're seeing at the front end of the pipeline from an external perspective and some of the things that you're seeing back from an internal perspective, of course, with the realignment of the organization even better footing with the internal [Technical Difficulty] that encourage you to see the demand signals outside in conjunction with some of the operational improvements that you've made internally, make you feel better about second half bookings and potentially a better growth in the years ahead. Thank you so much. Hey, Kash, just so we're clear. Was that a question for one of the business units in particular? You could take it for both units or in aggregate. Thank you, Elena. Appreciate it. Okay. Great. Yes, sure. Why don't I hand it to Khozema and Aidan, they can cover their respective business units. Yes. I would say, Kash, like the way that kind of I answered the prior question, like we've done a lot, obviously, to make the sales motion a lot more efficient in the communications part of the business. We obviously took some material headcount actions. And I think on balance, like we're seeing really, really strong profitability, which is what we committed to investors. And I think we're at least encouraged by some of the growth that we've seen, particularly in Q2. I think the signal in particular that we're watching inside the company to kind of more precisely answer your question is that we are hitting our sales targets. Sales targets obviously take some time to show up into revenue.
Based on our ability to continue hitting sales targets, and based on what we've seen, I'm certainly more encouraged that, that translates into financial results into 2024, and I think ends up being a pretty good setup. As Aidan alluded to, like it's obviously a kind of a choppy environment. And this being kind of the usage side of the business, like we're going to plan prudently in terms of that. Certainly not going to add any cost back into the business. But we feel pretty good about the setup based on the way that we've hit sales targets, the way that we've stabilized the team, the way that we have generated profit through a pretty tough external environment. And I'd say that's a pretty good set up going forward. With that, why don't I turn it over to Elena to talk about TDA. Sure. Let me hit a couple of high points. And then if there's -- your question had a lot of dimension to it. So, if we missed anything, please do feel free to circle back. But we're really focused on the data and application side of the business on the implant to the things we can control. We're focused on making sure that we've got the right folks in seat the right process, the right methodology and the right enablement. And I feel really good about our progress there.
We are starting to see some improvement in the pipeline as well. Top of tunnel [ph] continues to be really strong. So, we think there's a robust demand environment out there. We are starting to see some improvement in things like conversion through the pipe. So, lots of work what to do. It's not exactly where we'd like it. But again, I've talked in historical quarters about this being in a bit of a rebuild. And we feel good about our progress against that rebuild node. And again, we'll see bookings continue to improve this year, which will translate into revenue next year in 2024.
So, I think there's reason to be optimistic here, but there's also a long road ahead as we continue to work toward that improvement in net new business acquisition. At the same time, working on making sure we're managing through churn and contraction and that we've got a lot of reasons for customers to embrace that to play it quickly and stay a good long time. And so we're doubling down on our efforts there as well. Got it. And would you consider hiring to meet the -- what could be improving demand environment as you go to 2024. Firstly, in TDA, I'll let Khozema talk about how he feels about that question from a comps perspective. We have just gotten to the point where our reps are largely onboarded and ramped. I really want to see those productivity metrics getting up to where we'd like them before we layer on the next degree of headcount ad teams expand into new markets and things like that. Yes. And I basically agree with the light on the Communications side think we're in a spot where we like the way that we've sized the team, the efficiencies that we've gotten out of it as I alluded to earlier, I don't think there's additional volume leverage to be gained there. If we saw a really accelerated market opportunity. It's not off the table, but it's not the plan. Thank you so much. Your next question is Nick Altmann, Scotiabank. Awesome. Thanks guys. Maybe one for Jeff or Elena. You guys had called out this $100 million customer, which is a pretty monumental deal. And a big theme this year is sort of around this notion of vendor consolidation. And historically, some of your larger customers had maybe multi-source CPaaS vendors.
And so I wanted to ask two parts around this specific deal. One, was this sort of a deal where the customer sort of consolidated CPaaS relationships and kind of went all in on Twilio?
And then maybe as a second part, is this sort of a strategy that you're leaning into this year? And could you just provide maybe any color around what's the sort of level of customer appetite for these sort of consolidation deals? I think that would be really interesting. Thanks. Yes. Hey Nick, this is Khozema. It was actually a communications customer. So, I'll answer your question. I think the short answer to the first question is, yes, it was an opportunity for us to help one of our really important customers consolidate their spend all onto Twilio across a number of channels.
I think what was particularly a differentiating feature of this deal was our ability to kind of optimize traffic patterns. Like -- I think that's a really important aspect of the way that some of these like really sophisticated customers want to do business, they want to make sure that the right signals are reaching their customers at the right times, and that effectively ends up being like a kind of prioritization and queuing process that we're really good at.
I think in terms of strategy going forward, we're certainly looking at any opportunity where we have the ability to consolidate spend and constantly take share. I think we do have a lot of those opportunities across the board, frankly, whether it's with different customer segments or even internationally. And so I think that is going to be a part of the strategy that you'll see from us going forward.
And let me add one other point, actually, but not at the risk of price. Like I think that's one thing that we've done a pretty good job of holding firm is making sure that we don't take price down, making sure that we show discipline in terms of gross profit so that we're always hurdling so that we generate op profit. I think you can kind of see that in our gross margins. And I think you'd find that we're generally a price higher than the competition.
Q - Nick Altmann Great.
Thanks, guys. Thanks, Nick. We will now hear from Derrick Wood, TD Cowen. Great. Thanks. Khozema, I'll stay with you and maybe kind of on that last topic around gross margins. And just wondering kind of within your restructuring efforts, if you've made any notable changes around kind of incentives for sales teams or other business leaders to focus on driving gross margins? And I guess, whether you have or not or -- are there levers you can lean on to help drive more improvements in gross margins in the near to medium term? Yeah. Hey, Derrick, the way that we've reoriented our sales comp is basically to pay on a gross profit basis. Now there's one caveat to that. We're only going to take a gross profit deal if we can see that it hurdles and generates op profit. So we're clearly not going to take margin that ends up resulting ultimately in a bottom line loss. And so that is an important change that we made in the compensation plan for our reps I wouldn't say necessarily that we're biasing the business, especially on the communication side to necessarily generate higher gross margin.
Like I think we do have opportunities in terms of cross-sell, for example, I mean, I think there's a lot that we can do, for example, in terms of selling more voice or e-mail as just as examples in divesting customers. We'll continue with that as part of the strategy. I think the idea, though, really is ensuring that the unit economics of every one of these customers is solid, that those of the business overall are solid. And as long as we can go and efficiently get incremental gross profit dollars, we'll do that in the future. Great. Thank you. A>: Thanks, Derrick. Up next is Matt Stotler, William Blair. Hey, guys. This is Alex [ph] on for Matt. One for me on the international strategy. With the new SaaS first strategy, what, if any, implications are there for the international business? And how do you expect international revenue to trend as a percentage of total revenue going forward? What you mean by SaaS first. Yeah, just the software - the split of the business and the software focused strategy. So I'll take a crack at this line and then if anyone else wants to jump in, they count at the late and I'll speak first to our data and applications business. We operate in a number of international markets. We haven't seen market change in the balance between US versus international bookings growth, for example. And we're committed to the markets that we serve. We're not necessarily looking to open up into new markets in the very near term. We think there's an enormous TAM right here in our core markets.
And the good news is that there's demand across all of our international markets. We see improvement in performance across sort of each of those theaters. And so -- and we're able to service those markets as well from a software perspective in terms of sort of everything from functionality and capability to our standards on privacy and data protection and things like that. I don't know how or anyone else to have anything else to add? I'll just add on the communication side. I mean, we continue to see a lot of opportunity internationally. I mean, that's historically been a set of markets that we've been under-penetrated in from a communications perspective. And so there's a lot of additional growth. And I think with we found is that a lot of the customers in those markets are actually not being serviced by anybody. And so I think there's a lot of open field running there.
In addition to that, as you may remember from our Investor Day last year, the unit economics are actually quite good as well internationally. And so we think there's a lot of gross profit dollars out there to go and consume. And so I think similar to Elena, like it's not like we have to open up and necessarily in 10 more markets. We want to be very cost efficient about the way that we do it. But we do see a lot of opportunity out there. We're going to continue winning it. Maybe I'll just add one more thing. This is Aidan. If you're asking because you've seen the international percent of revenue come down slightly quarter-over-quarter, that's just really largely a function of the crypto dynamics that we've been talking about, a lot of that volumes concentrated internationally. And so I wouldn't read too much into it if that's where you were going. Got it. Perfect. Thanks guys. That's helpful

Next question is Alex Zukin, Wolfe Research. Hey, guys, thanks for taking the question. I guess maybe Jeff or Elena for you. You called out reacceleration in revenue for next year. Is that attributable to First, is that aspirational? Is that a comment on a particular quarter that you see that happening next year? And if we look at the data and apps business, like do you see -- is that business going to grow in Q4 given the bookings commentary from before? And do you see that reaccelerating in the early part of next year? And how much, if any, would you expect kind of driven revenue or products or initiatives to kind of contribute to that next year? I have a quick follow-up. So let me take a point here. And then as Jeff wants out a thing on the AI side, can o that as well. So
we're not committing to specific time lines on the reacceleration in terms of when in 2024, it happens. But what I will say and growth is always aspirational. We definitely are looking forward to that happening.
But I'll say that it's -- it will be reflective of bookings improvements that we're going to see this year. And that is a big -- it's a function of the rebuild that we've been undergoing and the addition of our round reps and the coming up the curve with those individuals that are newly in seed. And so the bookings are happening now happening towards the back half of this year as well, that will translate in 2024. So hope that's clear, but we're not doing a quarter-by-quarter view. And then I can speak to the AI part of your question. Look, segment is the centerpiece of our customer AI strategy, because that is where the proprietary data sets of our customers live, it is the sum of what they know about their customer, and therefore, how they're going to unlock the value in that data to go personalize like every touch forte with their customers. And now with generative AI, you can do it so much more efficiently and so much more in an individualized basis that it opens up tremendous new opportunities.
Now that said, I think that AI as a monetization like vector for the company, I think it follows, right? I think that's probably what you're seeing in most companies out there, which is AI is in its earliest stages now, buyers are interested in hearing what we have to say. They are interested in the products we're bringing to market, but obviously, those products are brand new, because generative AI really started hitting a stride of utility in the last six months, right? And so no one's got mature product set really to speak of.
And so that speaks to sort of the whole market is in this journey. But from my conversations that I and our customers, they are liking our vision, and I think that can turn into sales of segments as companies start to get their data ready for what the coming AI future has for them. And that will be a key part of our selling value proposition going forward. Got it. And then Tim, maybe for you, just on free cash flow. You guys are doing a great job on the operating income front. You raised that number for the year. How could we think about that op income to free cash flow conversion, both this year, but realizing this year has some onetime issues, maybe even more so next year. That would be super helpful. Yeah. Thanks, Alex. It's Aidan. So as it relates to free cash flow, so maybe just talk a little bit about the performance in the quarter. So we generated $72 million in the quarter. That number actually included $30 million of restructuring payments. So adjusting for those nonrecurring payments, we generated about $100 million, and that's a record free cash flow quarter for us. So really proud of really posting those results. And it's really a function of like when you look at the drivers, it's really the higher profitability, both the non-GAAP line, as well as lower restructuring costs.
As you think about going forward, so we're not going to put out any new framework in terms of how to think about it. I will just say there's always some level of timing and variability in cash flow. So I wouldn't expect that performance is necessarily linear. But it's a huge focus for us. We'll continue to look for avenues to both drive efficiency from a cost perspective, as well as growth free cash flow profile of the business over time. Perfect. Thank you. The next question is Phillip Leytes, Mizuho. Hi. This is actually Siti Panigrahi from Mizuho. My question is, Elena, when you look at data and application, you have products catered to different LOEs. You have flex more on customer support and engage more marketing. Are you seeing any demand specifically in any particular segment? Are you more optimistic about any particular segment? And as you're executing on your go-to-market, how are you rebuilding your sales folks? Is it more one -- same sales guys targeting all these products? Or are you building different verticals? Any color would be helpful. Sure. So we -- when I -- let me just start with little bit of a history. We started talking, I think, four, five quarters ago about the need to rebuild the sales team in a specialized manner. And so that meant having individuals that were very, very familiar with each customer and who they are, what they need from us, what they expect in the software offerings, how they think, how they buy. And so we have a team specific to segment in the CDP space. That organization focuses predominantly on through the data buyer, which is oftentimes part of a product organization in the consumer space and the marketer. And that's really sort of part and parcel of who the segment buyer is in flex. We're talking about a contact center buyer. But more and more, we're excited about how these two themes come together in a customer experience umbrella and how segment is really positioned so well to operate within the context of Flex to provide, for example, a world where an agent has access to the latest and greatest customer information as they're doing their jobs.
So while we have teams that are focused on those specific buyers, we think underneath the hard where everything comes together in front of that end user, they're both really, really useful. And so we spent time over the last couple of quarters, making sure that they're interoperable and connected. And we're starting to see that pay off in terms of customer interest and demand in that capability.
I think you started off a little bit with what that rebuild has looked like. And so again, we started this a number of quarters ago, essentially going out to the market and rehiring for these specialized sales organizations that we just, for example, in segment across the threshold where the majority of those reps are now what we consider ramp sales equivalent and are sort of beginning to operate at full quota full quota potential. So again, this is really the key to making sure that we reaccelerate bookings as we'll see here in the back half of the year. And again, that will translate into revenue next year. Thanks for the color.

Our Final question today comes from Rishi Jaluria, RBC Capital Markets. Wonderful. Thanks so much for squeezing me in. I wanted to go back to the topic of AI and your opportunity there. Maybe can you drill a little bit into how you feel you're more differentiated versus your peers to really capitalize on the AI opportunity, both when it comes to kind of the pure play communications providers as well as others within kind of the broader CDP landscape when it comes to segment. Thanks. I just think the combination of communications workloads and the data asset of the CDP is the killer combination, right? When I think about communications alone, right, communications needs to get smarter. Most of our customers do not want to just spend up more communication. They want to send more effective communications. And so as we move the company from a company that sends communications to one of the sense more effective communications, that requires data and that requires personalization understanding of who the recipient of all those messages are.
Now you go look at segment and segment is the leading CDP in the market for IDC it has amazing real-time technical capabilities. It has ETL, reverse ETL profile capabilities. It is really the composable CDP, every part of that composability is right there in the segment product. And so we can address a great many parts of that market while customers are building up their data assets that are going to power AI. And so we're bringing together these two parts of the company in a way that is extraordinarily differentiated. I mean I don't see any other communications company with a CDP. And I think to go forward to build value as a company, communications has to have data, and it has to be unlocking better communications, not just more communications. And on the flip side and the CDP, we have the most bank CDP of the market. And so I think on both sides, we have a very differentiated product, and then you bring them together and nobody has that capability. Wonderful. Thank you, so much. And everyone, that does conclude today's Twilio earnings call. We would like to thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.+","our prepared remarks, earnings press release, investor presentation, SEC filings and a replay of today's call can be found on our IR website at investors.twilio.com . some of our commentary today will include non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics .",0.0

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Bryan Vaniman, SVP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Twilio's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Our prepared remarks, earnings press release, investor presentation, SEC filings and a replay of today's call can be found on our IR website at investors.twilio.com. Joining me today are Jeff Lawson, Co-Founder and CEO; Khozema Shipchandler, President, Twilio Communications; and Aidan Viggiano, Chief Financial Officer.
As a reminder, we will disclose non-GAAP financial measures on this call. Definitions and reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in our earnings release and our prepared remarks posted on our IR website. We will also make forward-looking statements on this call, including statements about our future outlook and goals. Such statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described.
Many of those risks and uncertainties are described in our SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-Q. Forward-looking statements represent our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made. We disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. And with that, I'll hand it over to Jeff and the team, who will discuss our Q3 results, and then we'll open the call for Q&A. Thank you, Bryan, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Twilio delivered a strong third quarter, exceeding our revenue and non-GAAP profitability targets and generating another record quarter of non-GAAP income from operations and free cash flow. All told, we delivered $1.034 billion of revenue, $136 million of non-GAAP income from operations and $195 million of free cash flow. On the back of our strong year-to-date results, we're raising our full year non-GAAP income from operations guidance to $475 million to $485 million.
As you can see, the efficiency gains are rapidly showing in our quarterly results, reflecting the fundamental strength of our Communications business, which represented 88% of our revenue in Q3. In fact, our Communications business was recently recognized by Gartner as a leader in the first-ever Magic Quadrant for CPaaS, a terrific recognition, indicative of our attractive market position and the strength of our platform. We continue to focus on opportunities with our Communications go-to-market motion to win new customers, improve our self-service capabilities and drive more cross-sell opportunities across our customer base.
We're also forming meaningful partnerships to help us win further market share, including a significant expansion of our SoftBank partnership. We expect these efforts to drive durable, efficient growth in our Communications business moving forward. But the real story is how, over time, we believe we can continue to grow the top line of our Communications business while controlling costs. With our more streamlined cost structure and continued innovation, we are proving every day that this business can be a powerful driver of profit and cash flow for Twilio.
As our Communications business continues to successfully execute in an environment where usage volumes are stabilizing, we're also focused on driving improvements in our Data & Applications business. We've been rebuilding our go-to-market function and have seen some initial green shoots, including a modest uptick in bookings in the third quarter. We also continued to receive external validation for the strength of our products, and Segment was once again named the CDP market share leader as of June 2023 and was also named the leader in the IDC CDP MarketScape for financial services. While these early signals are encouraging, there is still more work to be done.
Before I get further into the details of the quarter, I'd like to share that Elena Donio will be transitioning out of her role as President of Twilio Data & Applications and into an advisory role. Elena and I have partnered closely to decide on the best path forward to reaccelerate the business, especially in light of the AI opportunity ahead.
With Elena as an adviser, I will run TD&A in the interim period until we recruit a seasoned leader to lead this part of our business. Thank you to Elena for joining the Twilio team at a critical time for our company and leading us through a difficult but necessary transition. I respect your partnership as a Board member, executive and as an adviser.
As I mentioned, the TD&A business saw a modest improvement in bookings this quarter. However, those are not yet where we want them to be. While this is a very small portion of our business today, only 12% of our revenue in Q3, we believe TD&A overall and the foundations for AI, in particular, are key assets for our future. We are committed to success in this business as we work to reaccelerate growth, drive further progress on our go-to-market scaling efforts and undertake investments to take advantage of the significant AI opportunity.
We saw a number of exciting customer wins across both Flex and Segment in the quarter that are encouraging and which I'll detail later. And spending time with our customers at SIGNAL events in both San Francisco and London continues to reinforce for me the market demand for and the unmatched capabilities of our software solutions. Speaking of SIGNAL, in August, we revealed CustomerAI, a set of predictive and generative capabilities that pairs customer data with large language models to give companies AI that truly knows their customers.
When I talk to our customers, they all know that AI will fundamentally rewire the core of their companies. Their workforce will need to change. The skills required to deliver their vision will change and importantly, the need for data to power their AI initiatives will grow. This is the initial set of opportunities we are working with customers, using Segment to get their customer data AI-ready and then activating on that data with Twilio Communications.
This communications and data flywheel will empower brands to enter the AI race steps ahead of their competitors armed with the AI-ready data, the platform that will allow them to interact with customers informed by that knowledge and enable them to glean more insights from each message, call, and email interaction. We believe this will improve their customer data sets and in doing so, help them deliver more effective, personalized customer communications.
Our teams have made immense progress over the course of 2023. In just 9 months, we have delivered $360 million in non-GAAP income from operations, and we've begun to generate meaningful levels of free cash flow. We are solidifying a strong foundation that positions us well to drive durable growth, deliver strong profitability and realize the benefits of our CustomerAI strategy over the long term. I'm excited to work more closely with our Data & Applications team to deliver a value proposition around CustomerAI that is truly differentiated to Twilio.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Khozema to talk about our Communications business. Thanks, Jeff. Twilio Communications delivered $907 million in revenue in Q3, up 5% year-over-year on a reported basis and 8% on an organic basis with a non-GAAP gross margin of 49.8%. As a team, we continue to focus on driving efficient growth, landing new logos, cross-selling across our Communications portfolio and generating meaningful non-GAAP profits. And we're executing well against all of these objectives.
We're continuing to push the bounds of innovation, highlighted by our recent new product announcements focused on CustomerAI, including voice intelligence, traffic optimization engine, brand calling, SendGrid engagement quality and Fraud Guard, which are already creating new opportunities for our Communications customers and prospects. For example, our customers can assign preferences for high-priority messages such as one-time passcodes to be delivered leveraging the most timely route, whereas a marketing communication can be delivered via the most cost-effective route.
We continue to demonstrate solid traction in our ability to drive growth with a more efficient cost structure. Our go-to-market model has been streamlined, and we've had success in expanding our ISV and global technology partnerships. As a result, we are seeing momentum with landing large new logos across our Communications product portfolio and through focused cross-selling efforts. In fact, roughly half of our expansion deals in North America were in non-messaging use cases.
A couple of cross-sell wins to highlight from Q3 include a long-standing Communications customer in the financial services industry who adopted Verify to replace their legacy solution for identity and security. Additionally, a leading Latin American e-commerce platform added Twilio Interactive Voice Response while also expanding their voice business with us. We saw encouraging results in our voice business overall in the quarter.
We also landed several new logos in Q3, beginning with one of the largest European airlines who chose Twilio Programmable Messaging based on our reliability and superior compliance standards to streamline their customer feedback workflows. Similarly, a global hotel brand chose Twilio's account security capabilities to serve their millions of app users, again citing our ability to navigate global regulatory and compliance while delivering a seamless customer experience. And finally, a leading AI company adopted Verify Pro, which allows customers to consume Verify as a subscription with upfront payments.
We're continuing to broaden our go-to-market footprint, leveraging our market leadership position to drive wins with ISVs and global technology leaders. In Q3, we signed a landmark agreement with SoftBank. SoftBank will offer Twilio services through its sales channels in Japan, which have a strong domestic customer base to draw upon. SoftBank will also provide 24/7 support for Japanese customers. This is an exciting expansion of our partnership with SoftBank, and we will continue to pursue strategic partnerships to efficiently capture additional market share.
We're also focused on improving our self-serve motion and automation efforts so customers can more easily purchase, build and grow with us. In the near term, we are expecting to bring more purchasing, billing and contract management capabilities into the Twilio console where customers can seamlessly adopt new products and expand usage. In addition, our teams will continue to automate compliance requirements and phone number provisioning that allow new customers to onboard much more quickly.
As a reminder, we previously made a commitment to our carrier partners to only permit registered U.S.-bound 10DLC, SMS and MMS traffic effective August 31, 2023. I'm very pleased with our success in executing against our 10DLC registration deadline and exceeding our initial goals. Thus far, we've been able to register virtually all of this traffic, which has enabled us to mitigate much of the revenue risk we had anticipated for the second half of the year. We now expect the revenue impact in Q4 to be minimal in light of the amount of registered traffic going into the quarter. This is an improvement from the potential headwind of up to 300 basis points that we previously referenced.
Similar to our efforts in registering U.S.-bound 10DLC, SMS and MMS traffic, we will also be requiring our customers to register U.S.-bound traffic from toll-free phone numbers as of today, November 8. We expect the revenue impact in Q4 and beyond to be immaterial. Our Q3 dollar-based net expansion rate for Communications was 101% and 104%, excluding crypto customers. Similar to last quarter, new customers are driving a greater portion of the overall growth, while crypto and social and messaging headwinds mask the success we are seeing with our cross-sell and expansion opportunities. Churn continues to remain relatively stable, and we are seeing year-over-year volume growth across many industries.
I'm proud of the execution that our team demonstrated in the third quarter. Leading the charge on compliance and enacting our 10DLC registration deadline was no small feat. We continue to focus on streamlining our go-to-market, including improving our self-serve motion and capitalizing on cross-sell opportunities across Communications. We are seeing encouraging results, and there is still further opportunity to improve, so I'm confident we will be able to make sustained progress over the coming quarters. And with that, I'll turn it back to Jeff to talk about the TD&A business. Thanks, Khozema. Turning to TD&A's results. Our primary focus continues to be reaccelerating growth. In Q3, this business unit delivered $127 million in revenue, up 9% year-over-year with a non-GAAP gross margin of 79.8%. The evolution of our TD&A business is ongoing. And while we've seen some initial encouraging signals from our go-to-market rebuild efforts, we need to translate early proof points to further bookings reacceleration.
This business deserves to grow faster and has all the ingredients to do so. I believe that reconstituting our old go-to-market playbook was necessary but not enough. We have to continue to evolve it as well, given a rapidly changing market. Now that we have the selling team in place, I'll be working with our go-to-market leadership to accelerate further changes to our playbooks, taking into account recent learnings.
At this stage, we continue to see increased churn and contraction in TD&A, reflecting the current dynamic environment and issues some of our customers are experiencing in growth with their businesses. Despite this market dynamic, we're still continuing to land exciting new customer deals across both Flex and Segment. We saw several Flex customers win this quarter, including a competitive 7-figure deal with a leading insurance company, which was looking to migrate not only agents off of their legacy on-premises solution, but also their IVR and messaging and chat, ultimately consolidating all contact center flows onto Twilio.
We also signed a cross-sell deal with Sweetwater, a musical instruments retailer. A long-time Twilio customer of voice, messaging and email, Sweetwater is now actively bringing all of their agents under the Flex platform from their previous on-premises vendor. Sweetwater is a great example of a company who came to Twilio as a communications customer looking to deliver a bespoke experience to their customers and has since gone all-in on the Twilio platform because of the customizability of the experience they're able to deliver across our solutions.
Turning to Segment. At SIGNAL London last week, we announced that we have processed more than 12 trillion data events in the last 12 months and resolved those data points into over 100 billion customer profiles on behalf of brands. And we can do all of that in milliseconds. This is the basis of our market share leadership recognition and underscores the need for a real-time CDP in the market, which Segment delivers.
In Q3, the Segment team signed a deal with a leading fintech company and long-standing Communications customer who is driving a product-led growth initiative. Their first use case is leveraging Segment to process real-time transactional data across all of their data systems in order to identify cross-sell opportunities, all in real-time.
We also established a new relationship with a software company in the construction space. As the company has been very acquisitive historically, they needed to consolidate data from multiple disparate systems to build a 360-degree view of the customer to inform their marketing journeys. We also inked a deal with a leading global toy company that will be using Segment's Reverse ETL capabilities with Databricks to offer their millions of customers real-time personalization across their most popular apps and games.
What's most exciting is that Segment will give hundreds of employees access to advanced customer data models and insights to help improve the customer experience for a globally recognized brand. This exciting deal was won with a great GSI partner as well. We think this is a repeatable partner model and look forward to continuing to invest in our partner ecosystem around Segment.
Segment's capabilities are foundational to CustomerAI. We've already announced the general availability of our first TD&A CustomerAI product, Predictions, which allows customers to create hyper-targeted audiences based on predictive traits like lifetime value, likelihood to churn or the propensity to take an action such as making a purchase, subscribing, et cetera. We have more than 100 customers using Predictions already and they're quickly seeing results.
One company has seen their cost of customer acquisition fall by 85% with more targeted advertising based on propensity to convert predictions. Another company saw a 2x improvement across all funnel metrics for their e-mail campaigns, including opens, click-throughs, et cetera, based on product recommendation predictions.
Our early customers show that engagement is multiplying and costs are rapidly declining, and that's just the first of several CustomerAI capabilities that we're working on bringing to market. Our short-term goal is to help customers see how the coming AI use cases require better customer data, something that Segment can provide today. Our long-term goal is to provide unprecedented automation, cost savings and better customer relationships thanks to AI.
So we are seeing significant customer wins within TD&A and our investments in AI products are generating significant customer interest. We have more work to do, and I intend to get closer to our field teams, our product teams, and most importantly, our customers to build on our foundation and deliver on the incredible potential of this business. I'll now turn it over to Aidan to walk through the financials in more detail. Thank you, Jeff. We continue to build a strong financial foundation for Twilio. We exceeded our Q3 revenue guidance and delivered another record quarter of non-GAAP income from operations and free cash flow. We came into the year targeting $250 million to $350 million of non-GAAP income from operations and have exceeded that goal in 3 quarters, delivering $360 million year-to-date.
Our results demonstrate our ability and commitment to drive meaningful levels of profitability in our business over time. Third quarter revenue was $1.034 billion up 5% and 8% year-over-year on a reported and organic basis, respectively. As a reminder, this compares to second quarter revenue of $1.013 billion after adjusting for the $25 million of revenue from our divested ValueFirst and IoT businesses.
Communications revenue was $907 million, up 5% year-over-year on a reported basis and 8% on an organic basis. Data & Applications revenue was $127 million, up 9% year-over-year. We continue to see stabilization in volumes across our usage-based products throughout the quarter. We also executed well against our 10DLC registration goal, mitigating revenue risk. Both of these factors helped drive our revenue beat in Q3.
As we referenced during our Q2 earnings call, our Q3 revenue growth rate was negatively impacted by headwinds from customers in the crypto industry. Total Q3 organic revenue growth excluding crypto customers was 11% year-over-year. While the impact has started to moderate, we still expect about 200 basis points of crypto-related revenue headwinds in Q4, down from 370 basis points in Q2 and 290 basis points in Q3.
Our Q3 dollar-based net expansion rate was 101%. As Khozema mentioned, dollar-based net expansion for communications was 101% or 104% excluding crypto customers. Dollar-based net expansion for data and applications was 96%, driven primarily by instances of higher contraction and churn among segment customers.
We continue to see some customers experiencing growth slowdowns and facing cost-cutting initiatives in their own businesses, given the current macro environment. We delivered non-GAAP gross profit in Q3 of $553 million, growing 11% year-over-year and representing a non-GAAP gross margin of 53.5%. That was up 270 basis points year-over-year and up 120 basis points quarter-over-quarter, driven by messaging termination mix and product mix within Communications.
Gross margins also benefited from our recent divestitures. Non-GAAP gross margins for our Communications and Data & Applications segments were 49.8% and 79.8%, respectively. Q3 non-GAAP income from operations came in meaningfully ahead of expectations at $136 million, representing a non-GAAP operating margin of 13.2%. This was due to our revenue beat and our continued focus on driving more efficiencies across the business.
Q3 GAAP loss from operations was $109 million, which includes $7 million of expenses associated with restructuring and real estate impairment charges. Stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenue was 17.9% in Q3, excluding approximately $0.5 million of restructuring costs, up 320 basis points quarter-over-quarter but down [ 188 ] basis points year-over-year. The sequential increase was primarily driven by the timing of employee refresh brands, which occurred later than in prior years. We expect stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenue to decline modestly in Q4.
In Q3, we generated free cash flow of $195 million, driven in part by heightened collections. While we do not expect this level to reoccur each quarter, free cash flow remains a focus for us as we drive greater profitability in the business. Lastly, we continue to execute against our $1 billion share repurchase program that we announced in February and have now completed approximately $620 million of repurchases to date.
Moving on to guidance. For Q4, we're initiating a revenue target of $1.03 billion to $1.04 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 1% to 2% on a reported basis and 4% to 5% on an organic basis, which account for our recent ValueFirst and IoT divestitures. We expect Q4 non-GAAP income from operations of $115 million to $125 million, and we're raising our full year non-GAAP income from operations guidance to $475 million to $485 million.
I'm pleased with the progress we've made on our profitability targets to date. The teams are executing well, which provides a good setup as we look to deliver a strong finish to the year and enter 2024 with momentum. And with that, let's open it up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Taylor McGinnis with UBS. This is Jeff Hickey on for Taylor. Congrats on the quarter. On the Data & Apps business, with the net retention falling to 96% from 99%, seems like things continue to soften a bit there. What are you seeing in terms of trends when we could maybe hit a bottom? And is gross churn something that could be impacting the gross margins of that segment currently? This is Jeff. I'll take the first part of the question and maybe of this gross margin aspect of the question, then I'll let Aidan take it. As we noted, we've been working through some of the churn and contraction headwinds, particularly as customers are realizing lower growth in their own businesses. They're focused on cost-cutting efforts, as you'd expect, and this results in reduced deal sizes at renewal and, in some cases, outright churn.
Several initiatives we have in place to try to mitigate the churn and contraction, we're making a concerted push with our post sales teams to drive faster and easier implementations of customers as well as mandating professional services in certain instances to make sure customers implement successfully. We're also ensuring our sales incentives are aligned to not just driving the bookings but also mitigating churn and contraction as well.
And ultimately, we need to drive bookings improvements and continue to deliver on the value of our products to those customers in order to improve TD&A. And I think we did see modest improvements in bookings in Q3 relative to Q2. And we have an ambitious product road map for TD&A around CustomerAI as well, which is driving a lot of early interest in meetings, given we announced it just over a month ago. But most importantly, we're not seeing an increase in competitive churn. And I think that's the most important part of what we are seeing in the churn and contraction. Aidan, is there anything you would add about gross margin? Yes, sure. So I don't think -- the churn is not what's impacting gross margins in Data & Applications. So they are down year-over-year and they're down quarter-over-quarter. So a couple of dynamics, Jeff, to understand there. So first, as we mentioned last quarter, we continue to invest in innovation in this business. And that's driven an increase in capitalized software expenses, which is flowing through our P&L.
And obviously, these innovations are focused around things like CustomerAI and our next-gen products and features. We're also seeing and expect to continue to see higher infrastructure and hosting costs in Data & Applications. We're continuing to invest in AI capabilities across the portfolio, as I said.
And to ensure efficient scaling of these products, we're migrating certain back-end functionality and infrastructure, tech functionality to new vendors in 2024, and that will optimize our spend over the longer term. So there will be a period of time where we have overlapping or double expenses, and you'll see that in the margin rates. On the back end, obviously, we'd expect to reap the benefits of these investments. Our next question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Maybe sticking with the Data & Applications business. Jeff, just what do you see as the keys to the reacceleration of this business maybe outside of overall macro? Is it still room to go on go-to-market or product advancements? And just kind of what are you looking for as you look for new leadership for this business? Yes. Thanks, Meta. There's 2 things that really speak to the growth trajectory of TD&A. Number one is arresting churn and contraction; and number two, new bookings, right? So that's what we've been focused on all year. We just talked a bit about churn and contraction, in terms of what are the things we can do to make sure customers are successful, make sure customers, when it comes time for renewal, are most likely to renew, and those are things that are in our control.
Customers [indiscernible] business, not a lot you can do or stuff like that, but that's really not the majority of it. Really a lot of this is in our control. The second thing, of course, is new bookings. And so we are very focused, as you know, on the reconstitution of the sales team, which is something we've spent the greater part of the last year doing so, hiring up the sales reps, enabling them, training them, building pipeline, et cetera.
And like I said, we've been seeing bookings growth throughout the year. We'd love to see it continue to grow and grow even more aggressively than it has, but we are seeing the bookings growth happen. And meaningful logos, expansions, cross-sells, I mean, we talked about all those things on the call today. So those are all the positive signals that we're looking for, especially as we go into the fourth quarter. And it's also worth noting that we see win rates and enterprise ASPs remaining healthy and stable. And just the leadership, kind of what you are looking for, is it somebody with more sales or product focus? That's a great question. We're looking for a leader to -- I think, with a good go-to-market background, but also obviously, some degree of technology, given that AI is becoming increasingly important, especially for the Segment business, the contact center business as well as, obviously, our big CustomerAI initiative. So we're looking for someone who primarily, I would say, has go-to-market, really good product market fit understandings both with the current products we have as well as we bring new products to market in the form of CustomerAI. Next question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Jeff, thinking back to the SIGNAL conference, you spoke with Sam Altman, and he brought up this idea that the cost of intelligence could fall by a factor of 1 million. And so I'm wondering, if it -- even if it moves in that direction, if Twilio ends up being the mechanism that allows bots to understand who they're talking to and who the customer is, how much do you think that could amplify Twilio's value to the typical customer as all of these generative AI projects gather steam? I mean, I'm just wondering if you can see cases where customers -- the customer spend on Twilio would really kind of ratchet up pretty materially. Well, thanks, Mark. Obviously, it's very early in this game so it's hard to tell exactly how things are going to play out. We set out our vision for CustomerAI for what we think is going to happen. And I kind of said that not only is this going to become possible, I think it will become inevitable.
And the key to a lot, if not all, of those things I talked about is companies having a really good handle on all the data about their customers. right? So if you've got your data spread across all the different systems and sitting in all these different places and not aligned, it's very dirty, it's really hard to actually put AI to use solving some of the really big things that I think AI will be able to solve for companies.
And so the first order of business here is getting customer data in order so that as these AI use cases come to maturity, they have the raw information that they need to understand who they're talking to and how you can start going about optimizing these customer interactions, customer relationships, and overall, like the business, the front office of every company. And so that's how we're thinking about it today.
Now the other thing I think that's super interesting in the world of generative AI in particular, I think that SaaS businesses that license per seat have the opportunity to be very much disrupted in this coming world because I think companies will need fewer seats. I think that the things that AI is going to need to latch on to is essentially data sitting in systems, and that data is going to be really used in a usage-type model.
And so I think our business is, generally speaking, well set up for a world where companies may need fewer seats. They may contract the number of seats they're using. They may not grow with the same number of seats. But the data, the back-end systems, the processes, the workflows that are triggered by AI, that's what really matters in this coming world. And so I'm very happy that Twilio is not in a position to largely be monetizing our service on a per seat basis but rather we have a usage-based model based on our Communications business and even the Data business as well. Our next question comes from Nick Altmann with Scotiabank. First, can you just talk about the Communications usage trends you guys have sort of seen in October and November? And then just given there's some seasonality in Q4 for messaging, can you maybe just speak to how much the guidance is sort of one-time in nature or more due to sort of seasonal factors versus sort of underlying stabilization?
I just think people are trying to understand the extent and what you're seeing stabilization on the Communications side, but the seasonal trends in Q4 blur that a bit. So any way you can kind of parse out those 2 would be helpful. Yes. So I'll start, this is Aidan, and talk a little bit about the guide and then I'll hand it over to Khozema to add any comments. So we're guiding to $1.03 billion to $1.04 billion of revenue in the quarter, which is roughly flat compared to the third quarter.
And so what I'd say is, overall, we're really encouraged by the performance and the volume stabilization that we saw in both the second quarter and the third quarter in Communications, and we're optimistic that volumes will remain stable, but we know that the environment remains uncertain, with some customers really seeing variability in their revenue lines and with many cutting costs, and therefore, we're continuing to plan prudently, particularly given the usage-based nature of that business, which is nearly 90% of our revenue. Yes. I wouldn't really add anything additional to what Aidan said. I mean, I think we obviously can't comment on October, November, those being in-quarter periods, but we are encouraged by what transpired in Q3. And I would just echo what Aidan said that volumes remain stable, and we're kind of cautiously optimistic heading into Q4 and certainly into 2024. Our next question comes from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Jeff, I'm curious to get your thoughts on the interplay of AI and data. It looks like there's some logical conclusion that if you're a system of record, a full-blown CRM system, then it has all the data and the AI will be able to work with the data to create actionable campaigns and there's a closed feedback loop.
I'm curious how you think about Twilio's assets sans that system of record, which you don't have. But how are you planning to add value to that, what seems to be the closed loop where you have a system of record data, AI and a whole AI loop can function within that application ecosystem, whereas you bring a slightly different perspective. I'm just curious to get your thoughts on how you take advantage of your assets in the world the way we laid it out. Yes. Thanks, Kash. There's a reason why we bought Segment when we did, which is I think that you've been looking at companies trying to solve this problem of having a single view of their customer for, give or take, 20 years. And CRM has been the thing that oftentimes customers have turned to and said, ""Oh, like this will be the answer. This will be how we're going to have that system of record, a single view of our customer.""
And if that were working, then I don't think companies would also be turning the data warehouses to try to solve this problem as well. So I think it is ample proof when you talk to customers that CRM is not solving this problem. It is actually a bunch of systems of record. And by the way, none of that speaks to all the event data, the streaming data of clicks and scrolls and page views and mobile app opens, all that kind of stuff that is going on in the world of specialty consumer scale data and consumer scale companies.
And so CRM is a part of the story, so is the click stream data, so is all the data that's in other systems of record. So is the customer service data, so is the -- and the list goes on. And that's why this is such a hard problem to solve. And that's why 20 years into the world of CRM, at least on the cloud, it's an unsolved problem still.
And Segment is a solution that solves that problem and so that's really where we're starting. We're not trying to create another system of record. We are trying to bring to market the solution to the problem of companies already have too many systems of record. And in fact, they need to make sense of it all. And that's what customers are coming to Twilio for. Our next question comes from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Securities. Aidan, on margin, that operating income target continues to move up fairly significantly, but we're also seeing some of the growth rates and core metrics in the Data & Apps segment, in particular, show some decay. So just wondering if you're reaching a point where you need to dial back the margin expansion and just drive some investment into reinforcing the foundation. Appreciate there's some just general transition happening there. Maybe just help level set how we should think about margin trajectory from here, given the significant improvements you're showing. Yes. So we guided to this year in terms of profit. We haven't given a guide for 2024. This year has obviously played out better than what we laid out coming into the year, so we're really pleased with the profit performance to date. When you think about that profit and you think about the relative -- the 2 different business units, the Communications business today generates 88% of our revenue, 82% of our non-GAAP gross profit. So that business is really the profit generator for the company.
And then on Data & Applications side, we're investing. So I would say that for the foreseeable future, you could assume that the efficiencies that we're generating on the Communications side of the house are really what's enabling the investment in Data & Applications. So I think that we have opportunity going forward to continue to see leverage.
I'd expect both of those -- or that leverage should come from 2 areas, largely the Communications business as we move to self-serve, as we shift to lower-cost regions and we leverage automation as well as the G&A functions where automation and shift to lower-cost regions are also areas that we're pursuing. But we're not going to give a specific outlook in terms of a range right now. Our next question comes from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. I guess maybe just the kind of 1A, 1B for me would be if you think about the Applications business, when -- we're talking about reacceleration. I guess maybe I just want to better understand when do we expect the net retention rate to trough? And then if I calculate just the change in deferred revenue plus the applications revenue, I think I get to about a 5% billings growth number for that business. Is that the right way to think about the kind of the range of the future growth rate kind of ex meaningful improvement?
And then maybe for Jeff, you guys have made such great progress on the operating efficiency side, but if we think about the reconstituting or, I would say, activating some of the sales motion on the app side, do you need -- is that where you actually need to put in now greater investment on the sales and marketing side and versus kind of where we've been seeing some of the savings? Why don't I start and then I'll hand it over to Jeff? So there was a lot in there. So starting with the Data & Applications kind of DBNE and where there's a trough. So we don't guide to that metric and I'm not going to give an outlook there, but maybe just some thoughts on the Data & Applications growth rate. So we grew 9% in the quarter. That was compared to 12% last quarter, so it did slow down a bit quarter-over-quarter.
And we would expect, just based on prior period bookings, we would expect more muted sequential revenue growth in the Data & Applications business in the fourth quarter, though we continue to expect sequential bookings improvement into Q4. And that's really where we're focused, higher bookings and reducing churn and contraction, as Jeff said, that will result in a higher revenue growth in the future. So that's the focus. We saw a number of solid wins in the quarter, and we're really working to build on the uptick in bookings we saw in the third quarter.
The second question was with regards to deferred revenue. So deferred revenue trends, so I wouldn't take this -- the change in the deferred revenue balance as -- I wouldn't over-index to it, I guess. It was driven by Data & Applications in the quarter. There's always timing and lumpiness of payments and things like that, but the trend -- it was driven by Data & Applications, but I wouldn't over-index to that number. So let me hand it over to Jeff to take the next part of the question. Thank you, Alex. The question was, essentially, we need to invest more in the sales effort for TD&A. And the short answer is no, I don't believe we do. We have hired a good number of reps. We have enabled them and we are starting to see that productivity. Now obviously, we want the whole thing to be happening faster, but in general, I don't think that spending more money on that effort is the answer. It's not a matter of us underinvesting.
I think it's a matter of productivity, and I think it's a matter of continuing to evolve our presence in the market. And there's a number of things that we're doing in order to make that team continually growing in their productivity to hit the numbers that we want to hit. So I don't think it's a matter of us having to invest more. I think we've got enough waffles on the plate, now we just have to add some syrup. Our next question comes from James Fish with Piper Sandler. Building actually off of Michael's prior question around margin, actually wanting to [ stay on ] the cash flow side, Aidan, you actually talked about stronger collections. Can you just walk us through the linearity of what you actually saw this quarter overall, if we should expect more of these upfront deals to happen in the coming years so it would help drive these better collections overall? Additionally, is there any way to think about long-term free cash flow conversion relative to net income here over the next couple of years? Yes, let me just touch on free cash flow. So this is a record quarter for us, $195 million of free cash flow in the third quarter, second quarter of solid free cash flow generation. So a couple of things to consider there. Obviously, as we become more and more profitable, our free cash flow metrics should generally correlate with non-GAAP profit.
We're not going to give a guide right now on what the free cash flow margin should be, but as profitability improves, free cash flow will improve. Now what tends to happen on free cash flow is there is some variability quarter-to-quarter with working capital. And this quarter, we ended up with higher collections or heightened collections relative to prior periods. We had about a 3-day improvement in DSO. We just don't expect that to happen every period.
What I will say is even excluding that unusual heightened collections, our free cash flow was better in the quarter than the second quarter, so we did see improvement quarter-over-quarter. But you'll always have some of the lumpiness, whether it's collections or there's a prepayment in the quarter going the other way. And so it's never perfect. It's never linear. But like over time, we should see free cash flow improve as we see profitability improve. Right. But can you talk about any linearity within the quarter itself, what you guys kind of saw earlier on versus kind of exiting here? No, we're not going to break it down within the quarter. Our next question comes from Derrick Wood with TD Cowen. I wanted to touch on the continued pressure on net new customers at, I think, about 2,000 in the quarter. And I guess, how are you guys balancing investments in new customers versus cross-selling the base? And how are you feeling about the effectiveness of the PLG motion and driving new customers on the comp side? Let me just touch on the metric quickly, and then I'll let Khozema and Jeff talk more about the business. So one thing to note is that you're right, the Communications customer count, first of all, was up 10% year-over-year, up 1% quarter-over-quarter. There was a small detractor in there driven by the dispositions so that it would have been up slightly more if we didn't dispose of the ValueFirst business in the quarter.
I think importantly, in that business, churn continues to be low. And so we don't see churn as a concern within the Communications business. So let me hand it over to Khozema and he can talk more about what's going on. Yes. I mean I think just to provide a little additional color on the self-serve side of it, to answer your question outright, I mean, I feel quite good about some of the progress that we've been making there. We've obviously focused a lot of our efforts on streamlining it.
I would say, in the very recent past, the 10DLC registration process that we went through certainly drove some friction in terms of new customer sign-ups and stuff like that. But absolutely, it was the right thing to do, and we feel really, really good about the trust that we've been able to create the ecosystem as a result of that.
I think beyond that, we do feel like, A, that there'll be ongoing efficiencies that we'll be able to drive into the self-serve side of things, but I don't think it's going to end up coming at the expense of growth. I think importantly, we're not seeing any pressure on pricing, for example.
We highlighted a number of really interesting wins in the quarter that actually came from products that were beyond messaging. That also feels pretty good. Aidan kind of alluded to the fact that it is a bit of a volatile macro. I think in spite of that, the business continues to perform quite well.
And I think probably the most important dynamic in the whole thing is, is that we are seeing a stabilization in volumes. And while we don't necessarily see an inflection yet, I think we do have a fair amount of optimism about Q4 and how things look heading into 2024. Our next question comes from Samad Samana with Jefferies. This is Billy Fitzsimmons on for Samad Samana. I want to dig a little deeper into the macro impacts in the prepared remarks and build on some of the questions that were already answered by kind of digging into the incremental macro impacts in the third quarter. It sounds like churn remains stable and you're calling out growth slowdowns in cost-cutting measures for some of your customers.
But curious if you could dig in a little more on how the business metrics tracked over the course of the third quarter when compared to the second. And Twilio was pretty upfront about the macro impacts in the first half of the year, and you've talked about business trends a little bit in the answers to some of the other questions.
But what I'm trying to get at here is that we're midway through earnings season, and we've heard from a couple of software companies this quarter that specifically called out that headwinds that got incrementally worse in the third quarter, and some software companies called out that there was a material drop in spending from certain customer verticals. Others called out diverging spending trends in enterprise versus SMB customers, noting that SMB got incrementally weaker over the course of the quarter. So curious to hear a little bit more about how Twilio's business compares to that commentary from some other companies. Sure. So why don't I start and then Khozema or Jeff can jump in as well. So as it relates to -- let's talk about Communications. That's the vast majority of the business. So we continue to see volumes remain stable in the quarter. So that's been 2 quarters in a row. Second quarter and third quarter, we've seen volumes stabilize, and that played out through the third quarter. And when you look at it at an industry level, we do see some verticals presenting a headwind.
We talked about crypto and social and messaging, but when you look at the other kind of larger industry verticals, we are seeing growth in those. And so our overall growth rate is somewhat masked by the headwinds that we are seeing on crypto and in social and media as well.
So we do feel good about where the business is. I'd also say as you think about the dollar-based net expansion rate for that business, so it's lower than it historically has been. It's 101% in the quarter. And it's an 8% growth rate overall, right? So the vast majority of the growth is coming from the new customer base.
The other thing to consider on the dollar-based net expansion rate is what we're seeing is churn has been historically low. It continues to be low. We're seeing really higher contraction and lower expansion relative to historical levels, and this is where something like crypto comes into play. So it's a good example in terms of understanding what we're seeing.
So obviously, when there's less crypto volumes on our customers' platforms, it results in less verification messages on our platform. So we are seeing some specific industry headwinds, but overall, feel pretty good about how the business is performing from a stabilization perspective and across most of the industry. Yes. I would basically agree with what Aidan said. I mean I think you specifically asked about headwinds in part of your question. And I think the one that we've pointed out a number of times now is crypto. We've also historically kind of talked about social and messaging and some of the headwinds associated with those categories.
But I think if you look at several of the other industries in which we participate, we are seeing pretty good growth, and I think that generally makes us feel pretty good. As Aidan alluded to, volumes have been stable. That certainly feels pretty encouraging.
And I think the way that we've dialed the business and the way that we've addressed our cost structure, I think in spite of whatever it is that kind of comes at us for the foreseeable future, we feel pretty good about the way that the business is sized. And so I think now we're prepared to kind of execute through whatever that environment is. Perfect. I mean, any difference in spending for enterprise versus SMBs at this point? Nothing specific that I would really point to there. I mean we gave you a little bit of additional color on self-serve earlier. I mean I think there were some short-term dynamics with 10DLC, for example, that created some friction at the time. We're past that now so I wouldn't really expect that to persist. I wouldn't call out anything specific with enterprises. Our next question comes from Ryan Koontz with Needham & Company. I wanted to drill down on kind of where we are on the cost-out journey for the Comms business. Obviously, a lot of great work there in terms of expanding profitability. How much room is there to go either through the self-service efforts or other programs that are still in place and what you're working on? Yes. I mean, obviously, we've come quite a long way in a short period of time. I do think that there is some additional opportunity in terms of driving efficiency. I think that as you've seen in the published results, our business has responded quite well as a result of some of the structural changes that we've made.
We did 2, right, that we've kind of talked about over the last year or so. And as a result, we've been able to take out quite a lot of cost. I think we've also driven a lot more disciplined focus, simplicity and all of that has created greater efficiency. In terms of additional areas, I mean, I think we talked about self-serve a little bit. I think that's always an area that will allow us to drive ongoing efficiencies.
I think in that category, in particular, what we've really been focused on is simplifying the onboarding, the experience, the user experience, the kind of product journey so that a lot of the kind of high-touch human interactions that would have happened historically, that those have waned and that will help us reduce our cost of sale.
I don't think we have to really add any material incremental headcount to the Communications business to get after growth. So that feels pretty good as well. AI is obviously an area that you can imagine, both externally and many of the remarks that Jeff shared and Aidan shared earlier in terms of like CustomerAI, like we definitely see that being a growth accelerate at some point.
But I think two, we're also looking at some internal opportunities in which we can drive efficiencies there as well. And so I think just to put a wrapper on the whole thing, we feel like that we can continue driving incremental growth without really any sort of meaningful increase in the operating expense profile, and that's how we're running the business. Our next question comes from Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. It's really great to see the success of the Communications business at nearly $1 billion quarterly run rate. My question, Jeff, is I mean, if -- even with new leadership, the TD&A business performance doesn't improve, do you think Twilio could drive sustained long-term shareholder value just with the Communications business and without the TD&A business? Yes. Thank you, Pat, for the question. So look, I'm really proud what the Communications business has driven as well. I think we've shown the business at scale can drive profit. However, I do think that an even better business that we're building over the long term is a business that fuses communications and data together. Why? Because with an understanding of who those communications are going to, we can drive better communications, not just more communications. And that's the strategy that we're pursuing.
And so if we are able to take the data assets in Segment and bring them together with our Communications assets, what we have the opportunity to do is add a lot more value to our customers, drive a lot more software value to the company and really competitively differentiate in a market where this is what customers want.  Customers want more effective communication.
So I love these stories about how -- for example, I talked earlier in the prepared remarks about the customers using Segment using predictive traits were able to bring down the cost of customer acquisition by 85%, right? Like those are the types of stories and business results I think we can drive when we bring together data, which allows companies to be a lot smarter and Communications, which is the vehicle to actually drive a lot of those outcomes in terms of how you talk to a customer.
And so when I think about the opportunity ahead, look, so far, the conversation has been very much focused on the stand-alone nature of the Segment business. And obviously, we've been focused on making sure that we drive growth as a stand-alone. But what we've -- the next step for us is to really start talking about what we can unlock together. And that's the better, not more story.
And I'm really looking forward to using especially AI and all the things we talked about with CustomerAI as the vehicle to fuse communications and data together in a way that's extremely differentiated and honestly is emerging, right? There's no one in that market today, and so the gift of the renaissance of AI that's going on right now is the idea that you can get out there with a new value proposition that is truly differentiated, and that's what we're pursuing. Our next question comes from Ryan MacWilliams with Barclays. Any early insight into how your customers are thinking about holiday season traffic this year similar to last year? And then just we've seen a pickup in M&A recently from a number of software companies. Just checking to see if there's been any incremental changes on your strategy there. I can talk about maybe holiday seasonality and then Aidan can talk about capital allocation, or Jeff. In terms of the holidays, I mean, there is some seasonality, obviously. We would certainly anticipate that, as with any prior period, especially around the kind of Thanksgiving period, that we'll see an uptick in certain traffic certainly heading into the Christmas season. But I wouldn't call out anything unusual relative to prior years. I think it will be kind of the normal seasonality that we see in the business, and it will more or less line up with what Aidan provided in the guidance. This is Jeff. I'll talk about M&A. As a matter of good corporate hygiene, we always are keeping an active game board of opportunities that are out there in the market. That said, I don't think M&A is our top priority right now. Obviously, we're digesting a lot of change, and we're really proud of the results that we've shown in terms of turning the corner on non-GAAP operating profit and really growing the business in an organic way. And so that's really where the management team's focus is right now. But that said, we always do keep an active game board, and obviously, we've got a pretty good war chest. Our final question comes from Fred Havemeyer with Macquarie Capital. I think I fundamentally agree about data as one of the key differentiators in the generative AI application race. And I think just closing out the call, I guess with a question at a high level here, big picture, longer term, OpenAI at the start of the week, I think, hinted at a longer-term trend that we might see more autonomous agents in the AI space where they carry out tasks without human intervention.
And so just thinking about that where perhaps more is done via AI automatically without human communication, how do you see Twilio over the next -- I mean, I don't know who can estimate when we might see this exactly, but over the next coming years, where Twilio would fit into that value chain? Thank you, Fred. Look, this AI world is rapidly evolving. And I think what we've set out is our vision for our role in it, which is to help companies to use predictive and generative AI to really automate and improve all their customer interactions by taking a really good understanding of their customers, the story that's told by the data that those customers give off, their clicks, their scrolls, what do they sign up for, what do they not sign up for, everything that they've done, turn that into an understanding of the customer, that's the Segment profile, take that profile and now inject it into every touch point a company has using AI to improve every one of those touch points.
I think you're going to see a tremendous amount of automation in terms of customer service, in terms of presales, in terms of marketing. When we showed this vision at SIGNAL, which basically says, look, I believe there's going to be a tremendous amount of automation. Now one -- part of that is this idea of like agents that are taking actions on behalf of people. And I absolutely think that's true. We look at what else is going to happen, right, those agents are going to be taking actions on behalf of companies.
And the raw ingredients for how those agents are going to operate is, number one, they have to have access to knowledge about the companies. Number two, they have to have access to tools to go operate within those companies. Number three, they're going to need access to guardrails about what they're allowed to do. And number four, they need access to the information about the customer that they're serving.
And that's the kind of framework that we've thought about as we've gone about thinking how is CustomerAI going to change how companies operate every customer-facing function? And we believe there's a tremendous amount of automation that is going to come to play. And the result of that automation, I think companies are going to get 10x more productive at serving their customers. They can do it at 1/10 of the cost that they probably would have to spend otherwise. And we're here to power that future for our customers.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Twilio had a terrific fourth quarter to close out a strong 2023. We exceeded our revenue and non-GAAP income from operations targets for the quarter, delivering nearly $1.1 billion in revenue, $173 million in non-GAAP income from operations and $211 million in free cash flow.
Before jumping into the results of the quarter, I wanted to start this call, my first as Twilio's CEO, by sharing that it is a privilege to be leading this company into its next chapter. I believe there is an incredible opportunity to unlock increased value for customers and shareholders.
As we continue to innovate, we're focused on combining the power of communications, data and AI to make every interaction more personalized and intelligent. Our vision to become the leading customer engagement platform is unchanged, and we are executing on this from a solid operational foundation and a fundamentally strong competitive and financial position. We have a great set of products and hundreds of thousands of customers who are committed to Twilio, because we are bringing tremendous value to their businesses.
Over the last year, we took significant steps to enhance our focus and execution while optimizing our capital allocation strategy. We also took meaningful actions to streamline our cost structure, accelerate our path to profitability and deliver durable growth. Our teams delivered on these objectives in 2023 and the numbers underscore this.
During 2023, we generated $4.2 billion in revenue, improved our non-GAAP operating results from a non-GAAP operating loss of $4 million in 2022, to non-GAAP operating income of $533 million, delivered $364 million in free cash flow and reduced our stock-based compensation, excluding restructuring expense as a percent of revenue by 450 basis points year-over-year. All of this hard work enabled us to take significant strides on our path to GAAP profitability.
Our product teams have worked to infuse AI capabilities into our CustomerAI solutions, enabling us to continue on our promise of more intelligent communications for our customers.
Our Twilio communications business continues to demonstrate meaningful leverage, which helped to drive the impressive financial performance that Twilio delivered for the year, and we will build upon this momentum in 2024.
At the same time, Twilio Segment is not performing at the level it needs to. I have already begun to take a closer look at this business to see how we can deliver improved performance. I'll touch on this a bit later.
Our Twilio Communications business, which drove 93% of Twilio's revenue in 2023 had a very strong fourth quarter, with revenue of just over $1 billion. And for the full year, it generated revenue of $3.859 billion and grew 11% year-over-year on an organic basis. I have the privilege of leading Twilio Communications over the last year and I am extremely proud of what the team accomplished in terms of increasing both operational efficiency and product innovation.
Throughout the year, we undertook a number of actions to drive increased operating leverage and further streamline our go-to-market activity. We continued these efforts in Q4 by moving both Flex and marketing campaigns into Communications and the results we are reporting today reflect this shift.
With these changes, we're better aligning how our customers want to buy our products and are also taking advantage of natural upsell and cross-sell opportunities. We also delivered an aggressive product road maps, and saw early signs of success with CustomerAI.
In Q4, Twilio Voice Intelligence, an AI-powered capability that enables our customers to extract data insights from their call reportings, was released in beta and customers have already used it to analyze over 42 million call minutes. Our traffic optimization engine and the traffic shaping algorithm are examples of innovations we introduced to drive greater flexibility and increased performance in our messaging products.
Our products also set new records by sending over 4 billion messages and 64 billion e-mails during Cyber Week, with 100% uptime across core messaging and e-mail, a testament to the scale and reliability of our platform. Our innovations are also getting recognized externally as we maintained our position in the CPaaS industry, as evidenced by the fact that Twilio is named a leader in the 2023 Gartner Magic Quadrant for CPaaS and a leader in the Omdia Universe: Customer Engagement Platforms, 2023 to 2024.
We're continuing to deliver impressive customer wins. In Q4, we signed our largest messaging deal to date, a 9-figure commitment with a leading cloud communications software company. We're also leveraging our network of ISVs and partners, to accelerate our ability to reach new customers and expand our geographic footprint.
For example, we signed a 3-year, 8-figure deal with Airship. Airship's mobile app experience platform powers trillions of interactions for thousands of global brands, and they will become an important partner where our customers will be able to leverage a fully integrated cross-channel orchestration solution for both messaging and e-mail channels. Our partner channel is certainly proving to be an area of opportunity for us and one we will continue to focus on this year.
Our Twilio Segment business, formerly Twilio Data & Applications, while still strategically important to Twilio continues to underperform. Although we drove sequential bookings improvement in Q4, growth is not yet accelerating up to our expectations. We need to execute better and I believe that we can.
Over the past 5 weeks, I've been working with the team to conduct an extensive operational review of Segment. and this work is ongoing. We plan to do a readout of these results in March, at which time I'll be ready to share our findings path forward and any changes to Twilio's financial framework as a result.
That said, the Segment product teams are laser-focused on shipping updates to customers, and we're seeing a great response to our CustomerAI innovations. Since becoming publicly available in Q3 2023, CustomerAI Predictions has been adopted by over 150 customers. And our CustomerAI recommendations tool, which helps determine the products that are most likely to drive purchases and engagement for each unique customer went live in a private beta in Q4.
Staples Canada, a leading provider of services, tech and other merchandise solutions for work and school life was able to leverage CustomerAI recommendations in its effort to provide more personalized recommendation to sell excess inventory and improve their cross-selling efforts. It's abundantly clear that Segment is a powerful product that is driving meaningful value for customers and demonstrating market leadership, as evidenced by IDC's most recent reports where Twilio is in the Leaders category in the 2023 IDC MarketScape on Customer Data Platforms for the Financial Services Industry and the #1 CDP for 2022 market share.
We continue to see strong traction with customers recognizing the unique value proposition of combining our communications and data capabilities. In the fourth quarter, we signed a competitive multiyear 8-figure deal with a leading U.S. financial services company whose usage of our platform spans both Communications and Segment. They chose Twilio to meet their needs, both internally and externally with their customers.
Internally, they're deploying Segment so they can get a real-time and personalized view of their end users across multiple business units. They will leverage Segment's zero-copy architecture to query their data warehouse directly, to efficiently and securely enrich segment profiles. Externally, they're deploying Verify so that the millions of customers who rely on them to get a seamless and secure authentication process when logging in.
We also signed a 7-figure deal with an international salon management software company. With Twilio, this company moved away from the incumbent providers and now relies solely on Twilio Messaging for all of its one-to-one messaging with customers. And the company already deployed Segment for its B2B business so that they are able to have a better customer view of those purchasing beauty products directly from them.
These customers are leveraging Twilio to not just bring their communications and data together, but to help them personalize and build lasting loyalty with their customers.
Our team enters 2024 focused on making balanced and intentional decisions that will help us to deliver durable, profitable growth. Our priorities for the year are clear. First, we need to continue running our business with better sales execution, and we will continue to look for areas where we can accelerate growth.
Second, we need to wrap up our business review of Segment and determine the best path forward that will position Twilio for long-term success while advancing our objective of optimizing profitable growth.
And third, we remain extremely bullish on AI and our ability to innovate across our portfolio with several incredible examples in both our product road maps and in private beta.
For the past 15 years, our co-founder, Jeff Lawson, did a remarkable job of leading this company, from a disruptive start-up to the admired company that it is today. I truly believe that we're set up for success to build for the next phase of our journey, and I'm grateful to follow in Jeff's footsteps.
I also want to express my gratitude for the thousands of Twilions who make this company such a special place. Our employees have undergone a lot of change this past year. Yet through it all, they've remained committed to building a great company that's focused on delivering for our customers. We will continue to run a financially sound and extremely innovative business. I'm continually impressed with the progress the team has made and how we've positioned the business to optimize for profitable growth moving forward. That said, we have more work to do, and I look forward to leading Twilio in this next phase.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Aidan. Thank you, Khozema. Twilio finished the year with a strong fourth quarter. We exceeded our guidance and delivered another record quarter of revenue, non-GAAP income from operations and free cash flow.
For the full year, we generated $4.154 billion in revenue, 10% organic revenue growth, $533 million in non-GAAP income from operations and $364 million in free cash flow.
These results demonstrate the significant progress we've made over the last year, from a business that was roughly breakeven on a non-GAAP basis and generated negative free cash flow in 2022, to one that is now generating meaningful levels of non-GAAP income from operations and free cash flow while delivering double-digit organic growth. We came into 2023 committed to this outcome, and we exceeded what we said we were going to do.
Fourth quarter revenue was $1.076 billion, up 5% reported and 8% organic year-over-year. Communications revenue was $1 billion, up 5% reported and 8% organic year-over-year. Segment revenue was $75 million, up 4% year-over-year.
As a result of the operational changes Khozema highlighted regarding Flex and marketing campaigns, these products are now reported as part of our Communications business. For Q4, this represented $54 million of revenue that would have previously been allocated to Data & Applications. We have also renamed Data & Applications to Twilio Segment, which includes both our Segment and Engage products.
As a result of these changes, all segment level results and metrics have been recast accordingly.
We continue to see stabilization in volumes across our usage-based products throughout the quarter as well as strong seasonal activity around the holidays, which helped to drive our revenue beat in Q4.
Similar to the last 2 quarters, our Q4 revenue growth rate was negatively impacted by headwinds from customers in the crypto industry. Total Q4 organic revenue growth, excluding crypto customers was 10% year-over-year. And for the full year 2023, total organic revenue growth excluding crypto customers was 13% year-over-year. We expect Q1 headwinds from crypto to be roughly in line with Q4, after which we will have lapped the vast majority of the crypto impact.
Our Q4 dollar-based net expansion rate was 102%. Our dollar-based net expansion rate for Communications was 102% or 104% excluding crypto customers. Dollar-based net expansion rate for Segment was 96%, driven primarily by elevated churn and contraction, that we did see a modest improvement in churn and contraction versus Q3.
We delivered Q4 non-GAAP gross profit of $564 million, growing 9% year-over-year and representing a non-GAAP gross margin of 52.4%. This was up 180 basis points year-over-year and down 110 basis points quarter-over-quarter. The decline quarter-over-quarter was primarily driven by lower 10DLC campaign registration fees and international messaging.
Q4 non-GAAP gross margins for our Communications and Segment business units were 50.7% and 74.4%, respectively. Q4 non-GAAP income from operations came in meaningfully ahead of expectations at $173 million, representing a non-GAAP operating margin of 16%. This was primarily driven by better-than-expected revenue and ongoing cost discipline, though we also benefited from savings related to our December restructuring and recognized a onetime $6 million gain for our settlement with the city of San Francisco.
As we continue to evolve our disclosures in support of our commitment to provide greater transparency on business performance and in response to investor feedback, going forward, we intend to report quarterly non-GAAP income and loss from operations by business unit.
Q4 non-GAAP income from operations for our Communications business was $248 million. And Q4 non-GAAP loss from operations for our Segment business was $18 million.
As Khozema mentioned, we are undergoing an operational review of the Segment business in order to identify the appropriate path forward for improved execution and profitable growth. We'll provide more details on the outcome of this review upon its completion in March.
As a result of Segment's business performance, we completed an impairment test on the intangible assets we acquired as part of our Segment acquisition. The test resulted in a $286 million impairment of our developed technology and customer relationship intangible assets. No impairment of our Segment reporting unit goodwill was identified. Segment carried approximately $300 million in goodwill at year-end.
Q4 non-GAAP loss from operations was $362 million, which includes $25 million of expenses associated with restructuring charges and the aforementioned $286 million intangible asset impairment charge related to Segment. Stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenue was 15.3% in Q4, excluding approximately $1.9 million of restructuring costs, down 260 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 360 basis points year-over-year.
In Q4, we generated free cash flow of $211 million, driven primarily by strong non-GAAP profitability as well as tightened collections and an $18 million onetime cash benefit related to our settlement with the city of San Francisco. While we expect free cash flow to vary quarter-to-quarter, free cash flow remains a focus for us as we drive greater profitability in the business.
Lastly, we continue to execute against the $1 billion share repurchase program that we announced in February 2023 and have now completed over $730 million of repurchases to date.
Moving to guidance. For Q1, we're initiating a revenue target of $1.025 billion to $1.035 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 2% to 3% on a reported basis, and 5% to 6% on an organic basis. The expected sequential decline in revenue is due in part to elevated seasonal activity on our platform in Q4, which we do not expect to recur in Q1. This is a similar dynamic to what we saw last year.
We continue to see volume stabilization across our communications products that we're planning prudently given the usage-based nature of our business. We do expect year-over-year growth through the balance of the year.
Turning to our profitability outlook for Q1. We expect non-GAAP income from operations of $120 million to $130 million, down sequentially quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to our lower revenue guide and an estimated $20 million of incremental expenses associated with a new cash bonus program. This new program will allow us to reduce go-forward equity grants as a proportion of total compensation and as part of our continued efforts to transition employee compensation from equity towards cash in order to reduce stock-based compensation expenses.
We're continuing to focus on driving operating leverage, and we remain committed to reducing stock-based compensation on our path to GAAP profitability.
Given the Segment operational review currently underway, it's premature to provide full year 2024 non-GAAP income from operations guidance at this stage. But at a minimum, we expect to exceed our 2023 non-GAAP income from operations even after taking into account an estimated $90 million of incremental annual expenses for the new cash bonus program. We intend to provide a full year 2024 non-GAAP income from operations outlook and any updates to our financial framework following the completion of the Segment operational review in March.
We've made significant strides over the last year in driving meaningful non-GAAP profitability and free cash flow generation in our business. We have strengthened our financial foundation and set ourselves up well to deliver durable efficient growth in 2024 and beyond. I'm proud of everything our teams have accomplished in 2023, and I'm excited for the opportunities ahead.
With that, we'll open it up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Great. Maybe first question, just what are you looking at to see traction in the Segment business. Was there -- I know in the past, you had said kind of improving pipelines or sales efficiency growing. You didn't kind of give some of those same statistics. So just what can we use to kind of benchmark improving performance there?
And then just maybe a second question on -- generally, we see a pickup in gross margins in Q4 on the Communications side of the business, just given a little bit more of that traffic ends up being North America-focused, noticed the kind of step down sequentially. So just any commentary on gross margins would be helpful. Yes. Sure. Meta, I'll start with the Segment part of it and Aidan can answer the gross margin part of it. So on Segment, I mean, some of the indicators that we're looking at is sequential bookings and we did see improvement in Q4. But as we alluded to, it's not exactly where we'd like it to be. And I think just the overall pace of the improvements that we were anticipating and that we would expect of ourselves, they're just kind of not meeting our expectations.
I think we've also seen consistent win rates over the course of the year. And again, we did see a modest improvement in the win rate in Q4. And notably, Q4 was sort of our best new logo bookings performance as well, actually since 2021. And so we feel pretty good about that, at least in terms of trajectory, but again, have work to do.
And then just finally, it's the #1 CDP, at least based on the most recent report by market share as determined by IDC. And we think that just based on what we've been able to do with it in CustomerAI and how we can expand it across our Segment product portfolio that there's just more that we can do there. But as we said, it's strategically important, but we definitely do think we can do a better job in terms of running that part of the business. Meta, I'll take the gross margin question on comp. So it was down quarter-over-quarter. We did see Q3 bump up quite a bit. So Q4 is still higher than what we saw in the first half of the year. The drop quarter-over-quarter was driven by lower U.S. 10DLC registration freeze quarter-over-quarter.
If you remember last quarter, we made a push to get customers using 10DLC in the U.S. registered, that resulted in additional fees and we are seeing some of that margin pressure kind of quarter-over-quarter driven by that. And in addition to that, within international messaging, we saw a little bit of margin pressure as well, primarily a function of just where messages are going within different countries in the international bucket.
So those are the 2 big drivers. But when you look at margins overall for the business, pretty good performance year-over-year. Communications is up 230 basis points quarter-over-quarter in Q4, for the year, up 190 basis points. So generally, a positive margin trend in the year, although down a bit versus Q3. Your next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Khozema, I believe you mentioned a 9-figure messaging win and largest messaging deal that you've won to date. Can you just shed any light on how that came together? Anything on contract duration so we can annualize it? And then just perhaps when you think that might start contributing revenue? Not clear to me whether that could click in immediately or perhaps sometime later in the year? Then I have a quick follow-up. Yes. I mean I can't get too far into it because we can't disclose the customer names, but we're certainly proud of the fact that we're able to score both of those deals. They're -- each is a little bit unique just based on kind of the customer type that's involved in each one. I think that those are both kind of multiyear arrangements. And so there's an opportunity for that revenue to continue over a period of time, like that's kind of the typical contract duration length that we typically see. And we should see that revenue over the next quarter or 2. Okay. Got it. Aidan as a quick follow-up, what is it that drives a little different spread for Q1 where -- I believe you're guiding fairly consistently or even a little better on the organic growth compared to how you guided Q4 and then it's -- but it translates to slightly less in the kind of the revenue growth rate that we actually have to model. Is it possible to step us through that? Is it something relating to crypto impact or something else? Let me take it, Mark, here. So there's a couple of things that are happening. So we're guiding to 5% to 6% organic growth. We were 8% in Q4. And so there's a couple of things to consider. So on the growth side, we did talk about crypto, right? That was a 200 basis point headwind in Q4. We expect it to be a similar headwind in Q1.
When you look at the rest of the business, the other thing to remember is, we didn't mention this in our prepared remarks, so I'll mention it here. We continue to streamline our product portfolio, really to focus on doing fewer things better. We are deprecating our video product as well as our software component of our Zipwhip business this year, both are planned wind-downs of those products, but they will result in a roughly 150 basis point headwind to growth in Q1.
And I would say, roughly similar impact on total year 2024 growth. So you have about 200 basis points from crypto, you have about another 150 basis points from the end of life of the video and the software business within Zipwhip. And then the last thing I'll just say is, again, we'll continue to plan prudently just given the usage-based nature of our business, much different than a subscription business, which is more predictable. So we'll plan prudently. We do expect year-over-year revenue growth throughout the balance of the year. Your next question comes from the line of Jim Fish with Piper Sandler. This is Quinton on for Jim Fish. Maybe for [indiscernible] that's been out in the market has been competitors potentially getting more aggressive from a pricing standpoint, specifically in the core messaging segment. Is that something you're seeing already here in Q1 or anything you saw in Q4? And then anything you can point to in terms of changes from a competitive landscape positioning? Yes. This is Khozema. I'll take the question. In short, no, the way that I would characterize it is that the success of the company is really built on the innovation and quality of our offering. And so I'm aware of what you're kind of referring to. And we never really comment on any specific competitor.
I think the reality of what we do is that we deliver a really broad and innovative set of solutions for our communications customers and we charge a fair price for it. And so whether it's the breadth of our channels, the reliability of our super network or the global scale, all of those factors are in the mix in terms of the way that we serve customers and serve them very, very well.
We've made a lot of investments in compliance and fraud mitigation as well to ensure users aren't stuck paying for fraudulent messages either. And we just want to ensure that we deliver great experiences. And fundamentally, we think that that's a better setup for Twilio and our customers.
And we've had a long history really of maintaining price discipline. And so we've been able to compete very, very successfully with folks that are on the lower end of the market and maintain, if not grow our market share over time. Makes sense. And then maybe just as a quick follow-up. I understand the crypto headwinds here. But I think one interesting point is you've seen kind of a rebound in kind of the crypto pricing. And so maybe, are you seeing any sort of improvement from a quarter-over-quarter basis of the crypto-specific activity? And how do you expect that to trend in 2024 as we see a potential kind of increase in the pricing landscape? Do we still see that relationship of -- as crypto pricing increases, we see activity increase on Twilio? Yes. So from a crypto perspective, a couple of things. Last year, in the second and third quarter, we talked about those periods kind of being the peak of our crypto volume on our platform. So we played through the last several quarters with that headwind, we expect the headwind in Q1 to be roughly in line with the headwind that we saw in Q4, after which we expect crypto kind of pressures or headwinds on growth to kind of abate a little bit.
Beyond that, I'm not going to provide any kind of outlook in terms of the specific industry. But we are kind of starting to lap those higher periods of crypto volume. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Securities. Great. I appreciate you taking the question. Just on the -- I understand there's a number of moving pieces as you're fine-tuning the organization and just the underlying customer profile. But when we're looking at the customer metrics, I think the Communications segment is not one where we've seen that metric down. So maybe you can just add some detail on what's driving the customer metrics currently?
And then in terms of the Segment evaluation, is just the second part, I think we've often viewed that as maybe a strategic opportunity to add more data-driven intelligence to the Communications portfolio, if at all possible. Is that something you can address independently were Segment to go a different route? I'm just wondering if you can just add more on kind of the data enablement piece of what Twilio has in its portfolio across the Communications segment as it's currently built as well. Why don't I start, I'll start on the customer question, and then I'll hand it over to Khozema.
So just to start with the numbers. So customer count was 305,000 at the company level, down 30 basis points quarter-over-quarter, up 5% year-over-year. Really, what we're seeing is on the Communications side, we saw a reduction in customer count really driven by smaller dollar self-serve customers. And maybe just to take a step back and a reminder on the metric itself, customers are only included in our customer count if they generated at least $5 of revenue in the final month of the quarter. And so what we saw was customers that might have been slightly above $5 like slip below $5, and so that's really what drove the change kind of quarter-over-quarter.
Importantly, when we look at revenue churn, which is kind of how we look at that metric,  as some more relevant metric, that remains very low. And we're seeing customer count growth in our largest spending cohorts. And ARPUs actually increased quarter-over-quarter, with revenue up but customer count down, you can see that, that metric would naturally go up.
So overall, it's really driven by just small dollar self-serve customers on the Communications side, but revenue churn remains low as it has historically been in this business. Yes. As it relates to Segment and kind of CDP more broadly, and I think your question was really towards its connection with Communications. I think that we do see a lot of opportunity there in terms of our ability to combine our data offering with our Communications offering. And we've started to launch a handful of products that do exactly that, bring together kind of all of the best capabilities of Twilio within single offerings.
You see that today, for example, in our Flex Unify offering, which has been announced relatively recently, I think as it relates to the need and value of the CDP, like we're certainly open-minded about the way that we want to create value for the company. I think first and foremost, we're very, very focused on durable and profitable growth. We alluded to the fact that we are undergoing an operational review of Segment and with an eye towards value creation, again, demonstrated through durable profitable growth. I think that segment happens to be a pretty unique asset that we think remains strategically important. We do think that having first-party data combined with Communications, has a lot more inherent value than just a stand-alone CDP.
All that said, I think there are a lot of opportunities for us to be able to improve the way in which we're doing things. And we talked about some of the executional things that we want to get better on. But I think having Segment deeply embedded with others in the data ecosystem, we have opportunities to do that and then also pursuing partnerships with other ISVs. I think there's an opportunity there too.
And so we're not taking anything off the table per se, but we do think that we have a really interesting asset. We'll have a lot more to share in March when we complete our operational review. Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Koontz with Needham & Company. Appreciate how you unpack kind of the revenue guide down sequentially here with some compares. I wonder if you could do the same thing on the operating income guide, which seems even like a bigger move down percentage-wise. Is that mainly the new comp plan? Are there any other kind of impacts on the operating income line we should think about? And I have one follow-up. Sure. Yes, I'll start. So you're right, we're stepping down on profit, $173 million in Q4, Q1 guide of $120 million to $130 million. So there's really 3 things that come into play, Ryan. So first, level revenue. The step down is really primarily driven to -- by revenue seasonality in Q4, right? We talked about in our prepared remarks, we had a record volumes during Cyber Week. We had a very strong holiday season. We expect revenue to kind of step down quarter-over-quarter as a result of that. So that's a driver.
The other drivers are on the OpEx line. The first is, as you mentioned, the new bonus program, we'll begin accruing expenses in Q1 associated with that program. We noted in the prepared remarks that it's roughly $20 million in Q1 and $90 million for the full year of '24. Those are net new incremental expenses that will hit the non-GAAP line.
Importantly, this new cash bonus program will allow us to reduce our stock-based compensation expenses over time. So that's one item on the OpEx side.
And then the second is actually related to payroll taxes that are just higher in Q1 than they are in Q4, really due to resetting of tax contribution. That's about a $10 million to $12 million headwind in Q1. So that starts to abate as you move throughout the year just based on how payroll taxes work. That's great. Perfectly clear. And I wonder if you could also kind of unpack the 10DLC, kind of where we are in that cycle? I know it's -- I'm sure it's a complex issue, but maybe just the 30-second version of kind of where we are in this 10DLC registration fees and onboarding and churn you saw like, it's been a bit of a journey. Yes. I mean we're effectively over is the short answer. The fees are abating and Aidan kind of alluded to that being one of the reasons for the margin step down Q3 to Q4, there were accelerated fees in Q3 as a result of an acceleration in the registrations to be able to meet the deadline. That deadline since past, I think we alluded to in prior remarks that 99%-plus of our customers were able to get through that process.
And so the balance of those, we wouldn't anticipate ending up there for a variety reasons. And there is no -- there's actually nothing to talk about anymore about that. So that's kind of where we are, and it's behind us. And those fees were like expedite-type fees you're seeing? No. They were onetime registration fees associated with that process. And so they were ephemeral in that regard. Your next question comes from the line of Pat Walravens with Citizens JMP. Great. Thank you. And I'll just say, Khozema, congrats on getting a lot done so far. So I know there's still a lot to do. But so look, Twilio has over $4 billion in cash and less than $1 billion in debt. So I guess, 2 questions there. Why not increase the stock purchase? And what are the -- what are some of the possibilities in terms of what you could do with that cash? Yes. Thanks, Pat. I'll take the question, Khozema can chime in if he likes. Yes, we recognize we're sitting on a lot of cash. That was the combination of our emerging free cash flow profile kind of affords us a lot of flexibility. We're focused right now on executing against the existing authorization, of which we have about $270 million remaining. And I'd just say that any updates to our capital allocation strategy or our financial framework will come upon the completion of our Segment operational review in March. Your next question comes from the line of Taylor McGinnis with UBS. Maybe just to touch on what you saw in 4Q, so it looks like the sequential growth in the Communications business was slightly softer than last year. And the upside to total revenue growth compared to the guide it was a bit softer as well. So can you just maybe talk about what drove that? Were there any areas that became more challenged in the quarter? And it's tough, I guess, to disaggregate what you're seeing with SMS and some of the core API businesses versus Flex and others, given the change. So maybe you can just talk about the difference between performance between those. Yes. I don't think they're -- I think the one thing I'd call out is we came in about, I don't know, 4% ahead of the midpoint of the guidance range that we provided for Q4. It was really just driven by record volumes during Cyber Week. We really saw elevated holiday traffic throughout the quarter.
Again, so I would say largely a seasonal lift relative to kind of the fee and kind of what drove that. Is that kind of your question? I just want to make sure I'm understanding what you're asking, Taylor. Yes. Yes, that and just -- when you look at, I guess, sequential growth quarter-over-quarter in the Communications business, it looks like last year might have been a little bit stronger at the same time. So I'm just wondering if there was anything that may be deteriorated in the macro or anything that maybe came in a little bit softer just to be mindful of? Well, I mean, I think it was largely in line. Last year, we were up 4.5% in Q4 relative to Q3. And this year, we're up -- we're a little bit over 4%. So it's roughly similar to what we saw last year. Your next question comes from the line of William Power with Baird. Okay. Great. Maybe a first question or a primary question for Khozema. I know you're obviously already running the Communications business. But I guess now that you're wearing the CEO hat, so to speak, maybe you can just update us on how you're thinking about kind of key strategic priorities for the Communications business in '24 kind of across revenue margins, et cetera? And maybe just as kind of part of that, the Communications operating margin is now approaching 25%. Any color on how to think about levers you can maybe still pull there? Yes. Both good questions. So I see just kind of -- just to maybe start with like sort of the strategy and vision level, like I wouldn't really anticipate a material diversion there. I think at the end of the day, we want to build out the world's leading customer engagement platform. And I think that we pointed out a few opportunities in which we can improve our execution. But I think you've already seen like really, really strong progress on the Communications side, and we certainly intend to continue that.
I'd say, secondly, we're very focused on profitable growth. And as you said, I mean, we have made a lot of strides there. The margin rates have uplifted quite a lot. I think that we definitely do have an opportunity to improve our sales execution across the business and grow the company faster. And I think we can do it from a structurally more profitable position, I think we have an opportunity, for example, with ISV relationships, we have an opportunity to improve in self-serve, and we can continue to build off of some of our cross-sell opportunities as well in our product portfolio to deliver faster growth.
As well, I mean I think innovation has always kind of been at the heart of what we've tried to do at Twilio. And I think sticking just to Communications, I think that we have a number of AI-related products that we've been able to put into our road map. Examples being Voice Intelligence, Fraud Guard, Flex. We've got a lot of other products and features still to come. I say there's a kind of close cousin to that, which is inside the company, there's a lot of automation of internal processes that I think are a big opportunity that will help us become more efficient, also allow us to serve our customers better. That could be in the back office that could be the resiliency of our platforms, could be increasing developer productivity, for example, with copilots and the like.
And so I do think that there's opportunity for additional volume leverage in that business. And it's really a combination of both focusing on increased profits while also delivering increased growth. Your next question comes from the line of Ryan MacWilliams with Barclays. First one for me. Pleased to see the stabilization of the dollar-based net retention rate from both the Communication and the Segment pieces. Do you feel like you have a tough floor here from a net retention standpoint, assuming like stable macro and you have more visibility on both of those divisions? Yes. I think that's another way of asking for our revenue guide beyond the next quarter. So we were not going to provide an outlook to DBNE. What I would say is we guided to 5% to 6% on Q1 revenue. We are obviously working on a number of initiatives, as Khozema just mentioned, to release businesses faster. The dynamics that we saw in the quarter, we are happy to talk about those really on the Communications side.
With regards to DBNE, it has kind of leveled off, as you mentioned. We are seeing low churn in that business, but relative to historical levels kind of pre-2023, just higher contraction and more muted expansion. And then on the Segment side, again, has leveled off, was up 100 basis points versus last quarter. Still below 100%, and that's really just driven by the higher churn and contraction that we talked about in previous periods. And then for Khozema, I know RCS messaging for a long time has been something that could be a thing, but has never really showed up. But with RCS messaging coming through the iPhone in 2024. Do you think this could change things at all for the Communications business going forward or are customers have been asking about it? Or is it still kind of wait and see? Yes. Good question. I think it's an opportunity. I think in the short term, we don't really see a significant impact from the adoption of RCS on the business. I think we see peer-to-peer messaging as having the greatest impact in terms of improving the messaging experience between iOS and Android, probably less so in the near term on A2P. I think we do support RCS and A2P business messaging, and we do think it can ultimately help customers deliver richer, more engaging messages. I don't think it's necessarily a near-term dynamic, but I think over the medium to long term, it is an opportunity for the business. Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. This is Ethan Bruck on for Alex Zukin. Just -- as we think for '24, I just wondered if you could just decompose how we should think about what the main growth drivers are and kind of get back to that or you'll need to just kind of -- the year-over-year growth through the back half of the year or the remainder of the year after 1Q.
And then also just kind of touching down on how we should think about the capital allocation strategy going forward? And just similar to the comment you made around the FY '24 operating margin, or the operating income to be better than '23, is it also [indiscernible] thing that this should would apply to your free cash flow as well? Why don't I start on the last question and Khozema can talk about some of the growth drivers of the businesses. So I would say just generally on free cash flow, we would expect -- we're not going to provide like a specific guide on it. I will say there will be variability quarter-to-quarter. We're really pleased with the performance that we've delivered in 2023. And in general, I would expect as income becomes better, that free cash flow would follow. Yes. And in terms of the growth drivers, let me just kind of split it between Communications and Segment. So in Communications, what we're really focused on is use case-based selling, streamlining our customer self-serve process and CustomerAI. And we're obviously not providing guidance for 2024, but we do have a number of initiatives across the business. And I think where we've really been focused is in partnering in those areas that I just alluded to a moment ago.
I think AI, in particular, allows us an opportunity to deliver really innovative solutions. We're already starting to see that in Verify, for example, for omni-channel authentication. We see it in Unify for more personalized customer engagement on the front lines and then also Voice Intelligence for a richer, very actionable insights from customer conversations. And then as well, we're leaning into our ISV partnerships where we are seeing strong growth as we help them scale their businesses. And we think there's an opportunity to partner better there. And then finally, we're continuing to improve on our self-serve capacity, streamlining, onboarding, billing, compliance, stuff like that.
In terms of Segment, our first priority is really just in mitigating churn and contraction. In customer conversations, what we're leading with is core use cases around personalization, ad spend optimization and driving cross-sell and we do think we have an opportunity to help our customers kind of streamline their implementations and enable faster time to value. And then just maybe [ broadly ] touching in on like how should we think about just capital allocation broadly going forward? Yes, I can maybe just follow up again. I think Aidan alluded to it earlier that we certainly do have some optionality given our balance sheet as well as the cash flow characteristics of the company. We're not providing any guidance as it relates to capital allocation. We're going to do some work as a part of our kind of ongoing operational review. And in March, we'll provide any updates around capital allocation as well as the other elements of our financial framework. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Funk with Bank of America. Yes. So the first one for the comms business. Aside from creating the best possible product there, what should we expect or what do you expect to drive better revenue growth? Is it the Olympics later in the year, the election? Is it macro? What are your expectations for revenue growth drivers? Yes. I wouldn't point to any one of those events as being items that we're looking at to provide a driver of growth. I also wouldn't point to kind of macro dynamics. I would say we're really in a position in which we want to be able to produce our own kind of durable growth.
As I mentioned earlier, like some of the areas that we're really focused on is use case-based selling, self-serve and CustomerAI. I think one of the ways in which we've really tried to approach our customers is through the lens of the problems that they're trying to solve versus just necessarily the products that we have in our bag.
I mentioned a few examples of that a moment ago in terms of Verify as it relates to omnichannel, authentication, Unify for personalized customer engagement and then Voice Intelligence for richer customer conversations.
And so those are all areas where we do anticipate that we'll be able to lift growth. I think AI, in particular, is a really exciting opportunity in which we have an opportunity to enrich Communications, also combined data, our data capabilities with Communications.
And then finally, as it relates to Segment, is again, as I mentioned a moment ago, I think it's really -- the priority is to mitigate churn and contraction. And I think if we can do all those things, then it's really much more around our control and doesn't actually have much to do with the election or for the Olympics. And then one more, if I could, Khozema, you said that nothing is off the table for the strategic review of Segment. Does that include a sale? And then you mentioned change in financial framework, I apologize, not exactly sure what that means. Does that potentially mean mothballing that business until the market comes to you with demand for CDP? Maybe some more clarity would be helpful. Yes, I wouldn't necessarily read any of those things into it. However, what I will say is that on the one hand, Segment is strategically important to the company. But on the other hand, we are approaching the review that we talked about with an open mind. We know the business is underperforming. We definitely do believe that we can execute better, and we're just approaching the operational review with an open mind so that we can determine the best path forward.
Our overall priority as a company, whether it's comms or Segment is durable profitable growth. And as it relates to the March framework, what we said is that beyond the guidance that we obviously provided today, any other elements of our financials, whether it be capital allocation or kind of medium-term targets, et cetera, we would provide in March in addition to any operational changes that we would make with respect to Segment. Great. And March means at earnings? Or would that come out prior to earnings? We're kind of targeting early March. Earnings would be much later in April. Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with TD Cowen. Khozema, I just wanted to touch on the Flex side of the business. You guys made some cuts in Q4, you shifted that go-to-market to the Communications side. Just kind of curious how you're feeling about the level of growth capacity in Flex and if there's potentially some disruption in the first half because of the changes? And then just kind of what levers you're looking to lean into to drive more cross-selling with the new go-to-market structure? Yes. I mean, I think more broadly speaking, I'll take the second question perhaps first. I think that there is an opportunity to do more cross-selling across the company. We've talked about the opportunity, for example, in the way that we can do a Communications deal and transform that, for example, into a Verify deal where we can do omni-channel authentication.
We talked a little bit about Unify, for example, which allows for personalized customer engagement on the front lines, that combines the best of Flex with sort of the best of Segment. And then Voice Intelligence is sort of another area where we've got a lot of existing voice customers. We have an opportunity to use AI as a means to add to their existing capabilities, richer, much more actionable insights. And so we think those are all like really interesting ways in which sort of writ large, we can add a lot of value in terms of the way that we cross-sell into our existing business.
As it relates to Flex, I would say, I mean, not a lot of changes, honestly, in the first half or even the balance of the year. I don't think we've really seen much change. I think when we made some of the actions in December, what was clear to us was that the buying personas for Voice, IVR and Flex were pretty similar. We wanted to make sure that we were simplifying the experience for our customers while also being able to extract some efficiencies in the business.
So we consolidated some of those capabilities. And now our account executives in Communications can sell Flex and/or kind of the composable offerings of contact center capabilities to every one of our customers, aligned in a way in which our customers actually want to buy. And so no real negative impact as a result. I think that we see possibilities and opportunities in the future based upon that realignment. Your final question will come from the line of Matt VanVliet of BTIG. Maybe just following up on not only the Flex opportunity, but across Communications, I mean, how are you thinking about partner engagement and sort of reengaging with the channel, building that team back out and using that as a leverage point and an additional distribution into larger enterprises? Yes. So I think there's a few opportunities there, and I wouldn't actually just limit it to Flex necessarily. I think that what we see sort of more broadly is, is that in Flex -- maybe I'll start there. With Flex itself, we do have a partner ecosystem, they've been building alongside us. They've developed a number of innovative capabilities that sort of augment what we do inside of Flex and provide the overall kind of enhanced experience to a customer. And we're very excited about continuing the progress there.
I think based on some of the changes that we've made inside the business and sort of to echo the answer to the prior question as well, we do have an opportunity to both decompose or make composable the aspects of Flex to be able to suit whatever the customer buying need is, in a way that I think is a little bit different than just selling kind of a fully-instantiated contact center solution.
I think the other part of it is, for the overall business, we do see a really significant opportunity with our ISVs. We alluded to a large deal, for example, that we signed with a partner, we do see partners becoming an increasingly more important part of the business and our ability to both help them grow with their own customers, as well as partner with them to be able to bring solutions to market, I do think presents a really interesting opportunity for the business and will certainly be an area of focus for us. Thank you. That will conclude today's conference call. We thank you for joining.

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Development, Bryan Vaniman. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Twilio's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Khozema Shipchandler, Chief Executive Officer; and Aidan Viggiano, Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, we will disclose non-GAAP financial measures on this call. Definitions and reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in our earnings release and our earnings presentation posted on our IR website at investors.twilio.com.
We will also make forward-looking statements on this call, including statements about our future outlook and goals. Such statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described. Many of those risks and uncertainties are described in our SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K and our forthcoming Form 10-Q. Forward-looking statements represent our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made. We disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.
With that, I'll hand it over to Khozema and Aidan, who will discuss our Q1 results, and then we'll open the call for Q&A. Thank you, Bryan. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Twilio had a solid start to the year, exceeding our Q1 guidance, delivering $1.047 billion in revenue and $160 million in non-GAAP income from operations. Our teams executed well across the board in Q1 as evidenced by a record quarter of non-GAAP gross profit of $566 million, a 54% year-over-year increase in our non-GAAP income from operations, and another strong quarter of free cash flow of $177 million.
We are in the early stages of reinvigorating the business and are optimistic about our progress thus far. In fact, we're executing with greater discipline, rigor and focus on innovation than ever before. In the last 5 quarters, we've begun delivering significant non-GAAP operating profitability. In the last 4 quarters, that's been paired with significant free cash flow, and we are committed to additional operating leverage and accompanying free cash flow.
In the meantime, we are also making new targeted R&D investments that we expect to reaccelerate growth over time. In March, we announced an accelerated target for GAAP operating profitability to Q4 2025, and we also announced that the Board authorized an additional $2 billion of share repurchases, bringing our total share repurchase authorization to $3 billion. This is a reflection of the board's confidence in our strategy and the opportunity ahead. As of today, we've repurchased approximately $1.5 billion of shares, and we're targeting to complete the remaining $1.5 billion of repurchases by the end of this year.
At that same time, we also completed our operational review of Segment, and the team is focused on executing the plans we outlined, including more focused product innovation, embedding Segment's capabilities into Communications products, and the commitment to getting Twilio Segment to breakeven on a non-GAAP operating income basis by Q2 2025. We are making progress in each area.
Across the board, we're innovating and releasing new products, many of which are underpinned by CustomerAI, our predictive and generative AI layer. Finally, we welcomed a new bench of leaders to Twilio, who will play an important role in shaping the next chapter of our company as we operate with greater financial discipline, operational rigor and focus on innovation.
And now let's turn to our business highlights. Our Twilio Communications business had a strong first quarter with revenue of $972 million, up 7% on an organic basis year-over-year and representing 93% of our overall revenue. During the quarter, Communications landed meaningful customer wins, released new products and deepened our relationships with ISVs, partners and resellers. With this disciplined approach, we're focused on growth levers that we believe will drive reacceleration in both the short and long term.
In the short term, our growth will be fueled by expanding our network of ISVs and global partners, driving more self-service and cross-sell momentum and extending the value that we're delivering to customers. In Q1, we signed a 7-figure partner agreement with China Unicom, one of China's wireless carriers, who will resell a majority of our Communications products for its enterprise customers across Singapore and Hong Kong. We also signed a partnership with Bloomreach, a leader in the marketing automation space and will be working with them to co-sell Twilio products.
Over the long term, our focus on innovation will unlock more value for customers, creating stickier relationships and ultimately expand Twilio into new markets and larger deal sizes. We made progress on a number of our AI products and are driving better synergies with our Communications and Segment products. In Q1, we announced Agent Copilot, our first of 3 launches in 2024, where Twilio will natively embed Segment into Twilio's Communications products.
With Agent Copilot, we've embedded Unified Profiles powered by Segment within Flex, giving agents deeper insights into their customers' behaviors and preferences. By accessing the real-time data from Unified Profiles, Agent Copilot assists in intelligent routing to agents and provides them with actionable insights for each customer interaction, automating and enhancing agent productivity while reducing resolution times.
Agent Copilot and Unified Profiles are currently in public beta, and customers like Universidad Uk are already leveraging these capabilities within their contact centers. As a result, they've driven a reduction in handle time by 30%. And by using our embedded AI automation tools, they've been able to deflect 70% of support cases in just 2 months.
While it's still early, these results are impressive as it illustrates how our customers are able to quickly realize tremendous business value at scale when combining Segment within our Communications capabilities. Our customers also continue to realize tangible benefits when using our other customer AI innovations, including Voice Intelligence, which has gotten a great response from our initial public beta customers. With Voice Intelligence, brands like PGA of America are leveraging transcriptions for their customer support interactions within their Flex instance, getting valuable data insights from call recordings.
Of the hundreds of customers that have deployed Voice Intelligence, over half are using language operators, which allows brands to trigger an action based on any keyword, allowing for better personalized communications. We also recently introduced language operators that uses generative AI and large language models to determine the best sentiment for the overall conversation so brands can get a better sense of where escalations or customer churn may take place.
And we're continuing to embed AI capabilities into our verification products. We currently have over 11,000 customers leveraging Verify Fraud Guard. And in Q1 alone, Fraud Guard blocked more than 62 million fraudulent messages. We are not only saving our customers money, but we're also ensuring our customers and users have a seamless experience.
During the quarter, we signed a competitive deal with Bluesky, a social media app, which recently launched its app to the public. They chose Twilio's Verify API to ensure a seamless and secure sign-up process for new users. At launch, the company saw an impressive amount of sign-ups, gaining almost 800,000 new users in one day. And Fraud Guard not only helped save the company hundreds of thousands of dollars, but it ensured new users received secure authentication.
Now turning to our Twilio Segment business. For Q1, Segment revenue was $75 million, up 2% year-over-year. It was a challenging quarter, but we came out of our segment operational review in March with greater clarity around a short list of priorities that we believe will address the underperformance of Segment.
We will continue to focus on rationalizing our investments to rightsize Segment's cost base, accelerating time to value for customers by using AI to automate onboarding and enhancing data warehouse interoperability, delivering 3 products in 2024 that natively embed Segment into Communications and capitalizing on CustomerAI momentum.
In the month following the review, we've already made meaningful progress against all of these areas, and we believe that we have the right set of plans in place to turn this business around, address churn and contraction and improve its financial performance. We are also committed to getting Segment to breakeven on a non-GAAP operating income basis by Q2 2025. During the quarter, we deepened our partnerships with Databricks and Snowflake.
With Databricks, we launched a new bidirectional integration that allows customers to seamlessly ingest and activate data. We are on track to deliver further enhancements to our data warehouse interoperability offerings across partners in Q2, and as mentioned earlier, we delivered focused product innovation like Agent Copilot that demonstrates Segment's value when it's natively embedded into Communications.
CustomerAI Predictions is continuing to get adopted by new customers, and since its GA in Q3 2023, more customers are realizing the benefits and positive material impact to their businesses. For instance, XP Inc., a Brazilian investment management company, said that since implementing CustomerAI Predictions and by using our out-of-the-box tools, they've been able to save their team 4 weeks of data science work and improved audience engagement and conversion rates.
Looking ahead to Q2, we'll bring our second product that natively embeds Segment into Communications into beta, which further demonstrates the value we can deliver to our customers by combining Segment data with our Communications products.
Before turning things over to Aidan, I want to take a moment to welcome the new leaders that have joined my management team. During the quarter, we welcomed Inbal Shani as our Chief Product Officer for Twilio Communications; and Thomas Wyatt as our President of Segment. And yesterday, Chris Koehler joined as our Chief Marketing Officer.
We've also taken a thoughtful approach to evolving our governance practices. First, we welcomed Andy Stafman, a partner at Sachem Head Capital Management, to Twilio's Board of Directors. And second, we announced in early April that we plan to hold an Investor Day within the next 12 months, at which time we'll share an updated medium-term financial framework and set of targets. And finally, we recently submitted a proposal for the declassification of our Board, which will be voted upon at our Annual Shareholder Meeting in June.
In summary, we're making a lot of progress in a very short period of time, and we're continuing to drive significant change. We're maturing as a company and as a team, we're making deliberate decisions with discipline, rigor and focus to deliver attractive levels of growth and profitability over the medium term.
While we've started to see positive impacts from some of these changes in our recent financial results, others will take longer to bear fruit, but we are confident that the opportunities we pursue will create meaningful value for all of our stakeholders and allow us to deliver on our commitment to drive durable, profitable growth over the long term. And with that, I'll turn it over to Aidan. Thank you, Khozema. In Q1, we exceeded our guidance on both revenue and non-GAAP income from operations and delivered our fourth consecutive quarter of solid free cash flow generation. Q1 revenue was $1.047 billion, up 4% reported and 7% organically year-over-year; Communications revenue was $972 million, up 4% reported and 7% organically year-over-year; and Segment revenue was $75 million, up 2% year-over-year.
Our Q1 revenue growth was impacted by the crypto headwinds that we've referenced in the past several quarters as well as the sunsetting of the software component of our Zipwhip business that we discussed during our Q4 2023 earnings call. These represented a combined 210 basis point headwind to our organic revenue growth in Q1. Excluding these items, consolidated Q1 organic revenue growth was 9% and Communications organic revenue growth was 10% year-over-year.
We have now lapped the crypto headwinds and do not expect a material negative impact to revenue growth from these customers moving forward. We continue to expect modest headwinds throughout 2024 from sunsetting the software component of our Zipwhip business, which we estimate to be roughly 100 basis points in Q2 and 80 basis points for the full year. We also previously announced the sunsetting of our video product. However, based on customer feedback, we've extended the transition support time line through 2026. As a result, we no longer expect notable headwinds from video in 2024.
Our Q1 dollar-based net expansion rate was 102%. Our dollar-based net expansion rate for Communications was 103%, a modest improvement quarter-over-quarter. Our dollar-based net expansion for Communications was 105% excluding crypto and Zipwhip software customers. Our dollar-based net expansion rate for Segment was 92%, driven primarily by elevated churn and contraction. As discussed during our operational review in early March, we are focused on improving customer time to value, and we're also investing in data warehouse interoperability, both of which we believe will improve Segment's trending contraction over time.
We delivered record non-GAAP gross profit of $566 million, up 8% year-over-year. This represented a non-GAAP gross margin of 54.1%. This was up 180 basis points year-over-year and 170 basis points quarter-over-quarter. The margin improvement quarter-over-quarter was primarily driven by lower international messaging mix and lower hosting fees as a result of larger credits on our cloud spend, which benefited both Communications and Segment gross margins. As a reminder, we continue to manage the business towards gross profit dollar growth.
Q1 non-GAAP gross margins for our Communications and Segment business units were 52.2% and 77.6%, respectively. As a reminder, we are migrating part of Segment's architecture to new infrastructure providers this year to recognize greater efficiencies. During this transition, we will incur some overlapping vendor expenses. As a result, we expect Segment's gross margin rate to decline throughout the year until the migration is completed.
Q1 non-GAAP income from operations was $160 million, up 54% year-over-year. As we mentioned last quarter, this included $19 million of sequential incremental expenses associated with our new employee cash bonus program, which we initiated to reduce stock-based compensation expenses over time. Our Q1 non-GAAP operating margin of 15.2% was up almost 500 basis points year-over-year and down 80 basis points versus the prior quarter, driven by a 180 basis point impact from the new employee cash bonus program.
Q1 non-GAAP income from operations for our Communications business was $249 million, and the Q1 non-GAAP loss from operations for our Segment business unit was $21 million. Q1 GAAP loss from operations was $44 million, which included $10 million of expenses associated with restructuring charges. Stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenue was 14.9% in Q1, excluding approximately $2 million of restructuring costs, down 40 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 100 basis points year-over-year.
We generated free cash flow of $177 million in Q1, inclusive of $23 million of restructuring payments. This is up $292 million year-over-year, and over the last 12 months, we've generated free cash flow of $655 million. I'm really pleased with our continued progress on free cash flow. It's been a key area of focus for the team over the last several quarters and reflects our ongoing work to drive efficiency in the business.
As a reminder, in March, we provided fiscal year 2024 targets of 5% to 10% organic revenue growth and $550 million to $600 million of non-GAAP income from operations, inclusive of an estimated $90 million of incremental expenses associated with the new employee cash bonus program that was introduced to reduce stock-based compensation expenses over time. And as Khozema mentioned, we accelerated our target for GAAP operating profitability from fiscal year 2027 to Q4 2025. We also committed to driving Segment to breakeven on a non-GAAP income from operations basis by Q2 2025.
Finally, we're continuing to make good progress on our $3 billion share buyback program, having repurchased over $720 million since our last earnings call in February. This brings our total repurchases to date to approximately $1.5 billion. We intend to complete the remaining $1.5 billion of authorized repurchases by year's end, which should meaningfully reduce our outstanding share count over the next few quarters.
Moving to guidance. For Q2, we're initiating a revenue target of $1.05 billion to $1.06 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 1% to 2% on a reported basis and 4% to 5% on an organic basis. We're also reiterating our full year organic revenue growth range of 5% to 10%. Turning to our profit outlook. For Q2, we expect non-GAAP income from operations of $135 million to $145 million.
This is down sequentially, primarily due to incremental payroll expenses associated with our standard merit increases that go into effect in Q2, consistent with prior years, as well as increased marketing and travel expenditures. However, given our outperformance in Q1, we're raising our full year non-GAAP income from operations guidance to $585 million to $635 million. Additionally, we are continuing to focus on improving our free cash flow profile, and we anticipate that full year free cash flow generation will be in line with our full year non-GAAP income from operations.
As we look ahead, we're investing in initiatives to reaccelerate growth. At the same time, we've accelerated our path to GAAP profitability. We're generating significant free cash flow and [ reaffirming our ] share buyback program. I'm excited to continue to build on the progress we've made to deliver improved outcomes for both our customers and our shareholders over the coming quarters. And with that, we'll now open it up to questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jim Fish with PSC. This is Quinton on for Jim Fish. Maybe first, how are you looking at kind of the bifurcation between budgets or demand strength across, call it, your mid-market and commercial versus your more enterprise customers at this point? Is the willingness to spend very similar across those 2 verticals? Or are you seeing significant strength or weaknesses across one or the other? Yes. I would say that, in general, we're seeing kind of demand volume kind of hanging there across the board. I think that the growth profile that we've seen with most customers continues to be pretty good. There's a couple of pockets, I'd say, especially with respect to internationally terminating traffic, where we're seeing a little bit more weakness.
But I think that as you look at most of the industries that we end up serving, we are seeing year-over-year growth. Obviously, there's some noise in our business with respect to what we've got in terms of Zipwhip and the comps that, that creates.
And I think in general, like we've oriented our sales team around gross profit dollars, as Aidan mentioned in her remarks, and we're trying to maintain the price discipline that we've always talked about in prior calls like these. I think kind of the wrapper on the whole thing is, is that we've seen volumes stabilize for some period of time. We haven't seen them quite inflect upwards. And I'd say, in particular, that's a call out for international.
I think on the flip side, there's a number of things that we're working through, both short-term and long-term kind of growth initiatives, and we feel pretty good about those, but those are going to take some time to kind of play out. I think in the short term, cross-sell is an area that we're particularly focused as well as with ISVs that should drive incremental growth over time, and in the meantime, we're really focused on cash flow and additional operating leverage. Got it. And then, Aidan, maybe for you. Gross margins here was a bright spot for sure. Can you talk about why this wouldn't be a kind of sustainable uplift? Understanding some benefit from product mix, but why couldn't we see this kind of upside continue through the rest of the year? Yes, sure. So we saw gross margins up 170 basis points quarter-over-quarter, with both business units up as well. So a couple of dynamics. First, on the Communications side, which is the business that carries Twilio at this point. They were up 150 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Part of it was what you said, which was the favorable mix between U.S. and international.
As Khozema just mentioned, we did see lower international terminating traffic. So that has a benefit to gross margins because we know gross margins, as we've communicated in the past, are lower internationally than domestically. We also had, in this quarter, as I said in the prepared remarks, some benefit from credits related to hosting spend. That benefited Q1 by about 80 basis points. We don't expect it to continue. And so I'd say the combination of those 2 things, the hosting credits not continuing as well as the fact that mix isn't necessarily controllable by us is kind of how I think about gross margins going forward, Quin. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Khozema, I was -- thinking back prior to the business review, our sense was that the Segment business could preserve some of the AI optionality, because you can combine that with Comms, as you mentioned, and then the broader CustomerAI vision.
Just recognizing it's sluggish overall in that business, is Segment seeing some usage for pulling customer data into LLMs? And I'm also wondering about that because you did mention the Databricks connectivity. I was just trying to understand what kind of projects those are, and if you're seeing more of that in the pipeline? And then I do have a very quick follow-up. Yes. Good question, Mark. So there's kind of 2 dynamics there. So I think the first is that with respect to Segment specifically, like one of the things that we committed to as part of the operating review was to make sure that we were able to combine some of the data elements of Segment with the Communications capabilities that we have.
We launched that product. It's called the Agent Copilot. That Agent Copilot uses something that we refer to as Unified Profiles. And so basically, what that allows for is, is the ability for an agent to be able to absorb information during the context of a call, for that data to be stored subsequently, and then for us to be able to create a flywheel so that every subsequent interaction with that consumer and then with consumers more broadly for one of our customers, they are able to get value out of that, fundamentally reduce cost, have a better customer experience.
And that kind of creates like a generative flywheel, if you will, where Segment is continually used through the Unified Profile, if that data is then subsequently fed back into the Copilot, and then that flywheel just kind of keeps on turning. And so that's how I kind of think about the optionality with respect to Segment. We committed to 3 products actually during the course of the year. We've delivered one. We kind of alluded to the second one being on track for the upcoming quarters, so we feel pretty good about our progress there, too.
And then I think more broadly, like there's a number of generative AI elements, both within Communications as well as Segment, and those things are happening nicely. The other part of the question that you asked about was Databricks. And with Databricks and Snowflake, actually, one of the priorities that we also laid out as part of the operating review was to establish greater data warehouse interoperability with those folks as well as the other big data warehouse players that are out in the market.
And so the way that you should think about some of the announcements that we made as part of the release today is that fulfilling on that exact same road map that we articulated about 1.5 months ago, we're making the progress that we intended to make.
We're starting to see traction with those 2 players, in particular, you asked about Databricks, that allows us to basically seamlessly offer data back and forth on behalf of our customers who may be already Databricks users. And so we think that, that's additive, not just to Segment but increasingly to the entire enterprise as we leverage the combined capabilities of Segment Communications. Our next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Great. Maybe following up on Segment, understanding kind of the product rollouts that are happening, but maybe just -- we're about 60 days in to new leadership there. Just any thoughts of new leadership as they've gotten in and how to improve the go-to-market there? That would be helpful. Yes. Good question, Meta. So I'll just kind of answer your question more generally, and then I think more specifically about Thomas and I think the leadership that he's brought. So I think in terms of the business, we've started to take steps in terms of our path towards the non-GAAP operating profit target that we established for Q2 '25. And we feel like we're on track for that. We're making good progress. That path isn't necessarily going to be linear.
And while we're seeing good progress in terms of bookings, that's going to take some time to kind of catch up and ultimately show up in the revenue line. And so there's like sort of some dynamics there. In the meantime, we're going to control our costs and be very focused about the R&D areas of prioritization. In terms of go-to-market, before I get to Thomas, we are starting to see some green shoots. There's a couple of customers that we referenced in our talk track. I think we're very excited about the nature of those customers, what they do, our ability to grow with them.
I think in particular, what we're very excited about is our ability to deliver time to value for those customers. significantly faster than, I think, where we've been historically. I think in the past, that has taken us up to 6 months, in some cases, to be able to get to value initially. And I think we're starting to see some -- several instances, actually, where we've been able to achieve that in as fast as 30 days. I think Thomas has been an awesome addition to the leadership team, quite frankly. With respect to all of our leaders, I feel very, very strong about our leadership bench overall.
But in terms of Thomas specifically, given his deep knowledge of the product, just given his background where he focused both on sort of product as well as marketing, which is useful because the marketer often tends to be the buyer in some of these instances. I think that's been a real accelerant in terms of the progress that we expect. And I think just in general, it's provided some stability and focus, which is also something that we're very geared towards, with respect to Segment. Our next question comes from the line of Taylor McGinnis with UBS. I'm hoping that you could provide a little bit more color on what's driving the slower organic rev growth guide of 4% to 5% in 2Q. So it looks like crypto revenue in 1Q is actually higher than 4Q. So that, combined with some of the other headwinds you might be lapping, you would think that, that would lead to accelerating growth. So can you just maybe comment on why that might not be materializing? And at the start of 2Q, has there been any deterioration in the macro or anything in the demand environment that might be driving some of that? I'll start, Taylor, and if Khozema wants to add, he can. So a couple of things to call out. So we have largely lapped crypto at this point. We don't expect it to be a headwind in Q2. We do have some product-specific dynamics that we called out for. So as we've said, so first, Segment's revenue was 2% in Q1 from a growth perspective. We expect it to be muted for the year.
As Khozema said, we're working on a number of different initiatives there, but they'll take time to kind of show up in our financial results. We also have some noise from the end of life of our Zipwhip software product. That will be a headwind to growth. It will be about 100 basis points of a headwind in Q2, roughly 80 basis points for the year.
And then I'd just say more broadly, we've continued to see volumes stabilize, as Khozema mentioned, in our Communications business. And we are seeing year-over-year growth in most of the industries that we operate in, but we're not yet seeing total volumes kind of inflect or growth reaccelerate. And I'd say that trend is more evident with our internationally terminating traffic.
So we've seen lower internationally terminating traffic volumes, which is reflected in kind of what we talked about with gross margins being a little bit higher, as I mentioned earlier. We're really reorienting the teams around gross profit, and we're maintaining price discipline as we pursue certain international markets.
And so we saw our gross profits grow by 10%. We think that's the right way to run the business, but we are seeing lower traffic there. So that's having a bit of an impact. But we're not standing still. As Khozema mentioned, we have a number of short long-term growth initiatives underway. I'm not going to reiterate all of the actions and the opportunities that he's talked about.
The last thing I'll say is that regardless of where we are in the growth range, we're going to continue to deliver the profits and cash flow. We've proven over the last year that we can drive significant profitability and cash generation in this business, and while we're working through reaccelerate growth, we're confident in our ability to get there on both profit and cash as evidenced by the incremental guidance that we gave on total year free cash flow today. And I'd say we're also willing to be opportunistic and repurchase our shares when we believe they're undervalued. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. I guess maybe any [ better ] changes in the competitive environment internationally? And then domestically, again, it sounds like a stabilization in messaging volume. Is that more of a mix shift towards SMS and personalized messaging as a [ brand of ] calling? Curious what's helping kind of drive that NRR stabilization. And then just a quick follow-up. Yes, Alex, I'm just going to repeat back the question because we had a little bit of difficulty hearing you. So the way that I heard you ask it was whether or not we were seeing any changes in the competitive environment, international or domestically, then it sounds like to you that there was stabilization of messaging volumes, and then is there more of a mix shift towards SMS, precise messaging, basically what's kind of driving NRR stabilization? Did we hear the question right? Yes, you did. Okay. So in terms of the competitive environment, maybe I'll just take that one first, I wouldn't say that we've seen any real changes there. I think that as Aidan alluded to in her prior answer, we have seen a little bit of softness in terms of internationally terminating traffic. I think from our perspective, like we always want to maintain price discipline about the way that we think about those markets. And so that's kind of what we've seen.
Otherwise, the volumes across the board have been more or less stable, but they haven't inflected. And I think that's kind of impacting some of the growth dynamics as we look forward. There's a bunch of new stuff in the hopper that we're kind of thinking about and executing against. It will just take a little bit of time for that to show up in some of the growth numbers.
In terms of mix, I wouldn't say that there's like anything significant happening in mix other than what we've already talked about in terms of as international weakens a little bit and you see strength in domestic, that's obviously going to have an impact on gross margins, but I think as it relates to more personalized messaging over time, I think that is certainly our expectation, especially as we pull in Segment into more of our Communications workloads.
I think we're already starting to see examples of that with customers wanting to deliver much more personalized communications using data. I think you'll see more of that through some of the products that we kind of called off. I think Agent Copilot with Unified Profiles is one, but Voice Intelligence, which we've been kind of using within the confines of voice itself is another.
And I think increasingly, you'll start to see a lot more personalized communications. I think that's the way that generative AI is really going to accelerate our business and some of the impacts that we see with customers fundamentally to reduce costs and generate better outcomes. Makes sense. And then on the OpEx side, obviously, some kind of moving pieces here in Q1 and Q2. But where do we -- as you guys think about kind of the balance of both getting the most leverage out of the model and where are you actually hiring and investing incremental dollars, how should we think about the hiring targets for kind of the next kind of incremental year or 2 quarters? Yes. I can kind of take the question more generally. I think that we don't feel like we have significant headcount needs right now. I mean obviously, we go through kind of the normal process of backfilling and stuff like that, but we're not looking to do any material adds. I'd say that our priorities right now have been around R&D. It's just kind of replenishing the pipeline there. We have a number of really focused projects in both Communications and Segment that we do expect to bear fruit over sort of the medium to long term. And I think that over time, this will start to show up in some of the growth numbers.
I think other than that, I wouldn't really expect anything around OpEx other than what we've called out in the past, which is we've got this bonus program that we've obviously rolled out across the business. That's kind of a near-term impact on OpEx, but I think you understand the dynamics there and the way that, that impacts stock-based compensation over time. But otherwise, I think we feel pretty good about the cost basis that we've already got.
And I think just one last thing maybe I'll add is we still see opportunity in terms of like geo diversification of the roles that we're hiring. And then I think the last one is like automation, right? We're obviously doing a lot with automation for customers, and we would expect that a lot of those same workloads that we're offering externally should have positive benefits as [indiscernible] to Twilio as well. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Koontz with Needham & Company. I wanted to follow up, if I could, on Alex's last question there about the competitive dynamic. And how would you explain kind of what's happening with registered and unregistered messages these days? I know you are a leader, certainly, in driving toward that. And how is that impacting the competitive landscape today? And is there any -- what's also your perspective, I guess, on the opportunity around political messaging as it relates to the election coming up? Yes. A couple of questions in there, Ryan. So let me take the political one first. So I think in 2024, generally, obviously, we're in the middle of an election season cycle, we'll generate some revenue from political customers, but we don't really anticipate an expected outsized impact as a result of the race. Just as a reminder, we have registration requirements and an acceptable use policy in place that we expect all of our customers to follow, especially as it relates to opt-ins.
And that really just sort of ensures the quality of traffic on our network. It protects consumers. And so we're not going to accept any business where that policy is not being properly followed during this upcoming cycle. And we think that's in the best long-term interest of the business and the best long-term interest of certainly the American consumer, but that has actually global implications as well because we're taking kind of the same stance in most markets.
That's kind of a good segue to the dynamic that you asked in the first part of your question, the whole 10DLC thing is entirely behind us. We went through that process last year. I think we felt a very small impact as a result of that. And so I don't think that there'll be really any impact as a result, and toll-free is kind of a nonissue as well because that got done at that point as well.
And then finally, just in terms of competitive dynamics, like I don't really think it alters anything other than the feedback that we receive from our customers is that, a, they want to work with a trusted provider, and so we think that we benefit from using compliance, not just to sort of our regulatory posture but actually as a unique selling point of the business; and b, I think increasingly, they want to work with someone who doesn't just prosecute that traffic in that fashion, but also ensures that no fraud or anything of that nature is being committed as well, which is where our AI tools and the like can really play a role in helping our customers with their traffic and ensuring that it's clean. That's really great, Khozema. And just a real quick follow-up. On the A2P side, is that relatively stable now? Or are those still inching up? I'd say it's relatively stable at this stage. There's nothing kind of new to talk about since, I don't know, a couple of years ago, I guess. Our next question comes from the line of Samad Samana with Jefferies. Awesome. This is actually Billy Fitzsimmons on for Samad. I'll [ give you ] pretty quick. Intra-quarter, you gave an organic growth target range and [ reaffirmed it ] today. Can you just remind us what that growth range kind of assumes in terms of macro dynamics as you progress through the year? Yes. So we've seen relatively volume -- stable volumes, Bill, as we've talked about. And I'd say as you think about kind of the range of outcomes between the low end of the range and the higher end of the range, I would say volumes -- if we did see any erosion kind of overall in volumes, I would say that would kind of get you to the lower end of the range.
Conversely, if we started to see volumes in Flex up and we continue to execute on our cross-sell initiatives and expansion with ISVs and the different initiatives that we're working on, we could see volume and revenue at the higher end of the range. What I would say is that -- I said this before, but regardless of where we are in the range, we're going to deliver on the profit and free cash flow. We're very intent and focused on that. We were kind of very zeroed in regardless of where we land on the revenue range. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo. Just on the Communications customer metric, that had ticked down a bit Q3 to Q4 and picked back up in Q1. So I'm just curious if any of that is definitional, just tied to the splitting of segments, or if that is a return to just a bounce back in customer activity on the core Communications segment. No, it's not definitional. It is, I would say, the bounce back, given the 2 options that you gave me there. But what I would just say overall is that this metric represents -- is anchored to a minimum $5 monthly revenue spend. And so we have a large number of active customer accounts with relatively low individual spend that, in aggregate, do not drive like a significant portion of the revenue.
So it has nothing to do with definitional. It's a bounce back, I guess, in terms of the customer count, but I would just say the relative importance of this metric given the size and the scale of the business at this point, and we're talking about a $5 threshold, I don't think it's probably the most relevant metric today. Just [ kind of ] the size of the business and how much we've grown. On Segment, just how should we think about the time line to get that piece of the business to a good foundational cost base to restart from? Obviously, there had been an evaluation period. So now going forward, how should we think about the time line of where you've gotten to at least sort of a good foundational restarting point, if you will. From a cost perspective, Michael? I think so. Yes, I mean just when you feel like the -- I mean, obviously, there are some moving pieces there, but when you feel like the sort of the foundation is in place of at least the initial efforts in rebuilding that business. Why don't I start with the cost side and then Khozema can talk more around all the actions that we're taking? What I would say is the business lost $21 million in the first quarter. That was actually up a little bit versus the fourth quarter. We have a path to get that business to breakeven by the second quarter of next year.
What I would say is we don't expect this to be completely linear, right? We have a number of initiatives that we're working on. Khozema talked about the product from a product perspective, getting to data warehouse interoperability. There's a number of things we're working on with regards to time to value.
So we intend to incur some costs to deliver on those objectives, but we will get to the breakeven by Q2 of 2025. It's just that decline for Q2 2025 won't necessarily be linear. So we have plans in place, but I just wanted to put that out there, so you know how to think about that and model it. Yes. The only thing that I would add there, Michael, is that this management team has been quite good about meeting targets that we set out for ourselves, and nothing's changed about our ability and confidence in being able to get to non-GAAP breakeven by Q2 '25 of next year.
In the meantime, there are a number of other things that we also committed to that were more operational in nature, data warehouse interoperability, delivering a combined Segment, Twilio offering, making sure that we had a number of additional things like that on our road map upcoming, improving our time to value. And against each of those operational areas, we're actually making quite good progress.
And again, as you alluded to, there are some dynamics here in terms of both revenue and cost. And some of the revenue dynamics are going to just take a little bit of time, given the nature of how bookings have to kind of catch up. But we are seeing green shoots. We are seeing interesting new customers.
And I think as we continue to execute on the operational items that are important to the future of the business, I think we feel increasingly confident that Segment is a really important asset to Twilio, that data is going to play a really critical role in terms of the way that we're going to deliver customer outcomes. And I think you saw the first one of those with this Agent Copilot that we released using Segment and Comms in Q1. And our next question comes from the line of Ryan MacWilliams with Barclays. This is Pete Newton for Ryan MacWilliams. Just a question on the sales side. Maybe how has sales efficiency and rep execution trended recently? And is this efficiency level in line with just internal... We have a little bit of a bad connection to you. Could you try again? Is this better? Yes. Perfect. Just a question on the sales side. How has sales efficiency trended recently? And is this in line with internal expectations? Maybe if you could delineate between sales efficiency on the Segment side versus the Communication side, just so we can get a full picture. Yes, I think on the Communications side of the house, it's in line with where we expected it to be. There's -- the team's executing. We have reoriented that team to gross profit dollar generation, for the most part. I'd say probably 80% of the team is measured on that. And they're performing kind of in line with expectations.
On the Segment side, we are kind of in a bit of a rebuild here. I'd say bookings came in, I would say, a little lighter than we want to see like longer term in the Segment business in Q1. But the team has a number of actions in place, and Khozema has kind of talked about them several times now, so I won't reiterate them.
But it's going to take a couple of quarters for Thomas and the team to get that business back and humming kind of where we want it to be, and it will take some time for that to show up in the financial metrics. I think sales efficiency generally has been pretty good. I mean we obviously took some very significant cost actions last year. Revenue line continues to grow. As Aidan mentioned, we're anchoring everybody against the gross profit dollar metric, and we think that's important to be able to incentivize the sales force.
And so I think that combination of things has yielded a lot of the operating leverage that you've seen over the last year, which we continued into Q1. And obviously, a lot of that now is starting to translate to really significant cash flow, which feels quite good. And our next question comes from the line of Arjun Bhatia with William Blair. Just one quick one for me. When we're thinking of some of the Segment plans that you had laid out with the deeper integration as well, and I think you touched on some of this a little bit. So curious like how long -- I know there's quite a bit still left to do here, but how long before we start to see results from some of that flow through to enhance the Comms business? Is that something that the '24 outcome, or with some of the products work still to be done, something that maybe we should expect in '25 and beyond? Yes. I mean I think we have to delay a little bit between when it shows up in our financials versus how customers are starting to get value from it. But we cited an example in our earlier remarks about how, when a customer fielded the combined capability of Segment inside of Communications, that was a specific contact center environment, it was a really powerful outcome, right? They were able to reduce their cost by about 30%. They were able to increase their deflection rate by about 70%.
And what's at the core of this is fundamentally, how do we deliver a better outcome for a customer at a materially lower cost point for them overall. Now some of that value obviously accrues to us because we'll be able to kind of upsell, using AI, some of these different products that we're trying to uplift. So I think that, in general, we feel pretty good about the customer delivery.
And again, we'll use examples like that to kind of prove that this adds really demonstrable value to customers. We'll continue signing new logos on that basis over the next several quarters, and then those bookings will just take time to turn into revenue. But so far, so good, and I'm certainly very encouraged by some of the early examples. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Funk with Bank of America. So on the international softness that you cited, I'm curious how much of that is due to shift in traffic, so to RCS and WhatsApp, for example, versus a reduction in traffic volume. Yes. I wouldn't say it's due to a shift in anything actually, Michael. I think that it's -- they're just a little bit soft from a kind of demand environment perspective in terms of that international termination. I think in terms of RCS, more specifically, like we haven't really seen significant activity there yet. We certainly expect RCS to play a role down the line. I think if anything, it will probably be accretive to the business, but that's not what we saw in international volumes. That's very helpful. And one more quick one, if I could. Thank you for the color on Agent Copilot embedding Segment and more of the Comms products. For clarification there, are you charging additional or separate for the embedding of Segment? Or is it more of a teaser to get customers more familiar with Segment and hopefully drive churn lower, higher usage and engagement and interest in that product over time? Yes. Ultimately, it will result in a price upsell. There's like a lot of details. But just to answer your question in short, it will fundamentally result in a price upsell. There's a number of like kind of packaging and pricing considerations that kind of go into how we'll ultimately take some of these products to market, but the short answer is it will ultimately result in increased price. Okay. But in the short term, as you initially launch, there is no price increase. It's simply embedded in the product. But over time, there will be separate SKUs or pricing. Is that correct? When it's in private beta, we typically offer it for like a teaser period, where there's not as much of a price increase. But once it kind of goes out of the private and it's fully GA-ed and the customer is actually using it beyond kind of the test period, then there is fundamentally a price increase that goes into effect. So it's not meant to be just protective. It's meant to be value-enhancing and therefore, with the price uptick. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Weed with Bernstein. One of the things that you changed in Communications here recently was grouping in Flex and some of the marketing in with Communications. And I'm wondering how much they may either be benefiting or dragging on the Communications business, if we just looked at what would be isolated and what we might have been looking at in the Communications business more historically. I think your question was when we moved over Flex and marketing campaigns to Communications, is there like a -- well, just to be clear, like when we talk about Communications, we talk about it on an apples-to-apples basis. So all of history has kind of been recasted for Flex and marketing campaigns moving over. So there's no like artificial benefit from that reorganization. Sure. I get that. I'm more like -- I'm just thinking about before it was moved over, we kind of knew how it was going, and I just don't know if they are -- the reason that is ticking up from an NRR, or would NRR for Communications be picking up more aggressively, and those are more like Segment where they've got below 100% NRR and actually breaking down Communications. No, I wouldn't say -- I'd say like we'd be roughly in the same position. They're not dragging down. They're not necessarily benefiting the communications business either in terms of pulling up the NRR. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may now disconnect.","we will disclose non-GAAP financial measures on this call . these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties . we disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements, except as required by law .",0.0

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Twilio delivered a good second quarter. We are driving durable profitable growth as we exceeded our Q2 guidance with $1.1 billion in revenue and $175 million in non-GAAP income from operations, both record levels. We also delivered nearly $200 million of free cash flow, another strong quarter of cash generation.
We're running the business with increased rigor, which we are confident will drive improved growth rates and additional operating leverage over time. The communications business is performing very well. And in our Segment business, we're focused on executing on our commitments. While reducing non-GAAP operating losses, in Q2, we saw continued signs that Communications growth is stabilizing, including quarter-over-quarter improvement in international trends. And I'm encouraged that our more disciplined approach is unlocking teams to innovate on the critical areas that will enable Twilio to power the future of customer engagement.
What's true across the board is that in the world of AI, contextual data is paramount. According to Twilio's Annual State of Customer Engagement Report, we found 84% of businesses said they provide good or excellent customer engagement, yet only 54% of consumers agree. That disconnect is because brands need help contextualizing the data they have.
By combining our leading communications capabilities, our rich and contextual data and the power of AI, we are uniquely positioned to unlock smarter, and more personalized interactions for brands that enable them to reimagine customer engagement and drive more revenue at a lower cost.
Let's turn to our business highlights. Our Twilio Communications business had a strong quarter, with revenue of $1.01 billion, up 7% on an organic basis year-over-year on the back of solid performance in messaging, acceleration in e-mail growth and strong ISV contributions.
During the quarter, we also focused on a number of initiatives that we believe will deliver improved growth rates over time. In the near term, we expect our growth to be fueled by our expanded network of partners and ISVs, self-service enhancements and cross-sell opportunities.
While we have made meaningful progress in all these areas, I'm particularly pleased with our success in securing new partners and ISVs. During the quarter, we achieved an 8-figure renewal with a leading customer experience provider who will continue to embed Twilio Voice within their customer service software solution. Additionally, we signed a new partnership with Omnisend, an omnichannel marketing platform targeting the SMB retail market, who will help Twilio expand its footprint into new geographies. We also extended our co-sell partnerships with Airship, BloomReach, Brase, Insider and Clavo into new geographical territories to power a data-enriched end-to-end marketing experience.
During the quarter, we delivered the strongest revenue growth in our self-service business since Q1 of 2023, and we continue to make enhancements to simplify the onboarding experience for customers. For example, we introduced a new console experience that helps make recommendations, guiding customers to which products they should be using based on their desired use cases and outcomes. And our new 1 sign-up streamlines the log-in process by having 1 log-in for a customer to access all of their Twilio accounts and products.
In the medium term, product innovation will be an important growth lever as we deliver on our vision to unlock smarter, more personalized interactions for brands. In the quarter, we started to see success with our newer higher-margin software products. These are products that leverage AI such as VERIFY and voice intelligence, as well as platform innovations that natively embed AI and machine learning, such as traffic optimization engine and engagement suite to drive greater deliverability and better customer engagement. These products are rapidly gaining adoption and can become meaningful growth drivers over time.
One customer, a leading mortgage lender, adopted both Voice and VERIFI in the quarter and expanded their messaging usage. Twilio won this competitive cross-sell deal as our platform enabled the customer to have a single console with both voice and messaging for the thousands of bankers who are using it on a daily basis to better connect with customers. Since deploying Twilio, the company is already seeing a 38% increase in SMS response rates and a 20% increase in banker productivity. More importantly, these products are gaining adoption because they are simple to use, trusted and intelligent.
Verify is a great example. Not only is it growing quickly it is saving our customers millions of dollars by mitigating fraud at the source and to continue to deliver better outcomes for our customers leveraging AI, our SMS pumping protection product went GA during the quarter, which can be enabled with one click and automatically detects and blocks fraudulent messages, a growing issue in certain international markets.
We're continuing to deliver on our promise of natively integrating Segment capabilities into our Communications business. This quarter, we released personalized virtual agent into private beta, marking Twilio's second product that natively embeds Segment into Communications. With personalized virtual agent, our customers receive a truly personalized interactive voice response. Each caller receives a custom menu of options based on the recent interactions with the company, purchase history, recent support inquiries and responses to marketing e-mails, among others. The product combines voice, virtual agent with Google Dialogflow agent, studio and unified profiles into one simple product that is guided with this wizard setup. We're excited with this release as it marks the next chapter for how IVR is evolving in the world of AI.
And lastly, Twilio's Communications products continue to receive recognition as we were named a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for CPaaS for the second year in a row, positioned highest for ability to execute and ranked #1 in 4 of 6 use cases in the Gartner Critical Capabilities report. Twilio is also named a leader in IDC's Marketscape Worldwide Contact Center as a Service.
Turning to our folio Segment business. Segment delivered revenue of $75 million, up 3% year-over-year as we continue to focus on delivering against the priorities that we outlined in our operational review in March. We made solid progress in improving customer time to value and executing on data warehouse interoperability. We also made significant improvements in our cost profile in Q2 and and lowered our non-GAAP operating losses by 25% quarter-over-quarter. We also continue to focus on driving efficiencies in our go-to-market, which yielded an increase in sales productivity, and in Q2, over 40% of our new bookings were multiyear deals versus 17% in the prior year period. A key win for Segment included our largest deal of the quarter, a 7-figure deal with IBM.
On the product front, we delivered on new capabilities to further enhance our interoperability with data platforms and data warehouses. In Q2, we released data graph and linked audiences into public beta, which seamlessly integrate with data warehouses, including Databricks and Snowflake. With linked audiences, marketers can now activate centralized data in the warehouse and combine it with real-time events and predictive AI traits to generate unified customer profiles and audience cohorts to deliver targeted, personalized experiences. We've gotten a great response, and we're excited to have customers like Legal Zoom and TradeMe deploy and realize the benefits and efficiencies.
We are also improving time to value for customers. During the quarter, our use case in-product onboarding went live, guiding customers through a customized onboarding experience, focused on their specific business goal. Additionally, our CDP co-pilot is reducing instrumentation and development time. Customers can now deploy and get value from segment 4x faster, and we are seeing early signs that we're able to accelerate business wins for our customers.
Overall, I'm very pleased with the progress we've made so far this year. We're continuing to deliver durable, profitable growth while driving strong free cash flow, and we have a number of organic initiatives underway that we believe will reaccelerate revenue growth over time. I'm incredibly energized about our opportunity to become the leading customer engagement platform combining communications, contextual data and AI to deliver intelligent engagement and outsized outcomes for our customers. And I remain very confident in our ability to deliver accelerated growth and continued improvements in our free cash flow profile over the coming quarters.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Aidan. Thank you, Khozema, and good afternoon, everyone. Jumping into our results. Total Q2 revenue was $1.083 billion, up 4% reported and 7% organically year-over-year. Communications revenue was $1.007 billion, up 4% reported and 7% organically year-over-year. And Segment revenue was $75 million, up 3% year-over-year.
Our Q2 revenue growth was driven by solid performance in messaging, acceleration in e-mail growth as well as continued strength in our IFC business. We continue to see signs of growth stabilization in our Communications business, and we saw modest sequential improvements in international as well.
Company organic revenue growth and communications organic revenue growth were both roughly 100 basis points lower due to the sunsetting of the software component of our Zipwhip business. We continue to expect modest headwinds over the balance of 2024 from this decision, which we estimate will be roughly 90 basis points in Q3 and 80 basis points for the full year.
Our Q2 dollar-based net expansion rate was 102%. Our dollar-based net expansion rate for Communications was 102% and 103% when excluding Zipwhip software customers. Our dollar-based net expansion rate for segment was 93%, driven by elevated churn and contraction. Mitigating churning contraction remains a focus for segment, and we're encouraged by the progress we made in Q2. As Khozema discussed, we are improving time to value and customers are deploying use cases 4x faster as a result. We are also pushing for more multiyear deals with customers. And in Q2, over 40% of Segment's new bookings were multiyear deals versus 17% a year ago.
We delivered record non-GAAP gross profit of $577 million, up 7% year-over-year. This represented a non-GAAP gross margin of 53.3%, up 110 basis points year-over-year and down 70 basis points quarter-over-quarter. As we noted in our Q1 call, we recognized elevated cloud hosting credits that benefited Q1 gross margins by roughly 80 basis points, and those credits did not recur in Q2.
Non-GAAP gross margins for our Communications and Segment business units were 51.8% and 73.4%, respectively. As we noted in Q1, we are migrating part of segments architecture to new infrastructure providers this year to recognize greater efficiencies. We began migrating data to our new provider in Q2, and during this transition, we will incur some overlapping vendor expenses. As a result, we expect reduced segment gross margins until the migration is complete, which is expected to occur by the end of 2024.
Non-GAAP income from operations came in well ahead of expectations at $175 million, up 46% year-over-year even after including $20 million of incremental expenses associated with our new employee cash bonus program. As a reminder, we initiated this program at the start of the year to reduce stock-based compensation expenses over time.
The outperformance was driven by our revenue beat, improvements in Segment's expense profile and ongoing cost discipline. Our non-GAAP operating margin of 16.2% was up 460 basis points year-over-year and 100 basis points sequentially.
Non-GAAP income from operations for our Communications business was $250 million and non-GAAP loss from operations for our Segment business was [ $16 ] million, a $5 million improvement quarter-over-quarter.
GAAP loss from operations was $19 million as we continue to make solid progress on our path towards GAAP profitability. Stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenue was 13.6% excluding restructuring costs, down 130 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 110 basis points year-over-year.
We generated free cash flow of $198 million, driven by continued operating efficiency and ongoing collection strength. This was up $126 million year-over-year. And over the last 12 months, we generated free cash flow of $781 million.
We're making good progress on free cash flow, and we believe there are significant opportunities to drive more leverage over time.
Finally, we're continuing to execute on our $3 billion share repurchase program and have repurchased over $700 million since our last earnings call in May. This brings our total repurchases to date to over $2.2 billion. We intend to complete the remaining $800 million of authorized repurchases by year-end, which should meaningfully reduce our outstanding share count over the next 2 quarters. Our total shares outstanding as of June 30 was $164 million, down 10% year-to-date.
Moving to guidance. For Q3, we're initiating a revenue target of $1.085 billion to $1.095 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 5% to 6% on both a reported and organic basis. We've now lapped our 2 divestitures from last year, so starting in Q3, reported and organic quarterly revenue will be equivalent.
Given year-to-date performance, we're narrowing our full year organic revenue growth guidance range to 6% to 7%.
Turning to our profit outlook. For Q3, we expect non-GAAP income from operations of $160 million to $170 million. Given our outperformance in Q2, we're raising our full year non-GAAP income from operations guidance to $650 million to $675 million. Finally, we remain focused on improving our free cash flow profile, and we continue to expect that full year free cash flow generation will be in line with our full year non-GAAP income from operations.
We're encouraged by the performance we delivered in the first half as we stabilized revenue growth and delivered strong profitability and free cash flow. As we look ahead, we're investing in initiatives to reaccelerate growth, but we continue to plan and guide prudently. We are progressing towards GAAP profitability, and we continue to see significant opportunities for margin expansion and improve free cash flow over time. I'm excited to continue to build on the progress we've made to deliver improved outcomes for both our customers and our shareholders over the coming quarters.
And with that, we'll now open it up to questions. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is going to come from the line of James Fish with Piper Sandler. This is Quinton on for Jim Fish. Maybe first on the margin side. You've talked about a fair amount of incremental leverage opportunity coming from automation of back-office activities like contract management or that product activation. What inning are we in for those operational improvements across the business? And as we think about the upside you've shown relative to guide so far this year, how much of the cost savings is coming from these process improvements versus just better rigor around managing spend? Why don't I start and then Khozema can jump in. Listen, I think we've done a lot on margins. If you just take a step back and think about the expansion that we got last year, and then coming into this year, our initial guide assumes very little operating margin leverage. If you look at our current guide for the year at the midpoint, it's about -- I'd say 250-ish basis points of margin expansion. So we continue to find opportunities to get expansion on both the OpEx line as well as the stock-based compensation line. And we don't think we're done. So we've talked about the fact that we're going to get the Segment business to break even by the second quarter of next year. That business lost $16 million in the second quarter, $21 million in the first quarter. So you can see that there's an opportunity to get leverage there.
And then in addition, in the broader business, I'd say in communications and the G&A functions, there's a lot of work that we're doing around, you mentioned automation. We are a remote-first company, so we do have the opportunity to leverage lower-cost geographies as a way to continue to get efficiencies. And so we're doing all of these things and continue to do them. I would say -- I'm not going to give you an exact inning, but I would say we have a lot of opportunity to continue to expand margins both on the non-GAAP side as well as the GAAP side, including stock-based compensation.
In terms of the profit, in terms of what's coming from improvements in process versus cost discipline, I think it's a little bit of both. It's largely cost discipline though. We continue to believe that we can run this company without having to add a lot of incremental costs. You've seen us do that now for 6 quarters in a row. And so we're really just much more disciplined in terms of how we're running the company, and that's something Khozema drives pretty regularly with the team. That's helpful. And then on the revenue front, it sounds like we found stabilization here and actually quarter-over-quarter things sound a little bit better, which is great. But we also tightened the kind of revenue targets for the full year down slightly. Can you talk about what's embedded into the guide here? What assumptions or incremental prudence that you've incorporated relative to the kind of last guide that we got last quarter? Yes. Thanks for the question. I'll take it again. So we grew year-to-date through the first half 7%. We're guiding to 5% to 6% in Q3. We think the 6% to 7% that we gave for the year is a reasonable range based on what we're seeing today. I will say that, in the second quarter, we did see a number of very encouraging trends in the business. In particular, we saw strength in messaging, as you know, that's our biggest business. Solid performance, both in the U.S., which we've seen for the majority of this year, but also, we saw modestly improving trends internationally.
We also saw growth in our e-mail business accelerate and really -- and Khozema kind of talked about it in his prepared remarks as well, really strong performance in both our ISV and self-serve businesses. So we saw a number of encouraging trends. We guided to 5% to 6% in the third quarter. I mean if you think about how we guided in Q1 and Q2, that was 4% to 5%. So you are seeing some of these trends kind of flow through to the guidance. But we are still a usage-based business. So there is inherent variability that comes along with that. And so we'll continue to plan, we'll continue to guide prudently just given that and given the dynamic market that we're operating in. I'll just add one thing maybe, which is, we're not really planning for any kind of like macroeconomic environment like whether it's good or bad. I think we're just planning to run the company well. As we've alluded to a number of times, running it with better discipline, better rigor, and it's obviously a dynamic global market with a lot of different kind of geo things going on, macro things going on. I think irrespective of however any of that plays, we feel really good about the guidance that we've given. And as Aidan said, we'll continue to be prudent about the way that we guide. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is going to come from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Khozema, you mentioned an acceleration in e-mail. And I'm curious to what you might attribute to that, whether it's more marketing e-mails, transactional e-mails, notification e-mails, is there anything there that makes you think companies are finally starting to lean back in to outbound marketing activities or on customer engagement initiatives in a way that maybe they weren't a couple of quarters ago? And then I have a quick follow-up. Yes. Mark, thanks for the question. I wouldn't say that it necessarily breaks down exactly the way that you said it. I think, in general, we are seeing just kind of elevated trends in that product, in that part of the business. I think maybe to just sort of build on your question through the Twilio lens a little bit more. I think where we continue to see a lot of opportunity, and I think e-mail and the other channels to be beneficiaries is, as Communications become more targeted, as they start to leverage more contextual data as we kind of talked about, especially through vis-a-vis Segment, I think there is an opportunity to grow the e-mail channel. And because what you and I will receive as consumers will be much more specified, much more targeted, much richer communication. And I think we're seeing a little bit of that. And I think a lot of that is kind of really more on the comm. But in the quarter, I wouldn't necessarily point to one thing or the other. I'd just say kind of elevated trends on the product. Okay. And then Aidan, I wanted to ask you -- I want to try to combine 2 quick thoughts. But you generated, I think, $1.25 a share of free cash flow in Q2, right? So it arguably puts you on a $5 per share run rate, which is a lot. And just -- is anything onetime in nature? Or could we roll that kind of free cash flow margin into 2025? And then I did just -- relating back to that question of the narrowing of the range, we're trying -- I think we're trying to reconcile there's a lot of positive comments and then that got narrowed just a hair below the midpoint.
And I'm just wondering, we've had a Starbucks, Nike, McDonald's, Tesla, there's been a lot of consumer slowdown. Is there anything there factoring in maybe to how you're thinking about the holiday season? Yes. So Mark, let me start on the back end of the question, and then I'll let Aidan pick up on the cash flow side. So I think from an industry perspective, I mean, kind of the good news for Twilio is, I mean, you know the company really well. You've been following us for a long time. Like we have a very, very distributed consumer -- or customer base, right? So over 300,000 customers, we're spread across a wide variety of industries. And so we're always, quite frankly, looking at like some up, some down in a variety of these different areas.
I would say as it relates to some of the kind of areas that you pointed to, like let's maybe just categorize those as retail, e-commerce. I would say that, that was an area that was particularly good for us. I wouldn't necessarily point to a seasonal or holiday trend. I'm not necessarily forecasting like a strong like Thanksgiving or Christmas season. Like again, we're kind of planning for like whatever the period is. We just want to run the company well, and guide prudently through all that. So that's kind of how we're thinking about the way that we're running the company, first and foremost, and then how that ends up translating into some of our revenue guidance.
And then on cash, Aidan, do you want to take that? Yes. So thanks, Mark. And if you look at our cash performance kind of through the first half or at least in the second quarter, you can see that cash is kind of outpacing our non-GAAP profit. It was about 18% free cash flow margin in the second quarter. What we saw there is largely a function of the profit generation and the continued leverage that we're getting on OpEx, but we did see collections improvement in the quarter by about 2 days. Now on the flip side, AP kind of went the other way. So net-net, working capital really wasn't a help. So I wouldn't call out anything specifically. What we said for the year is you should expect free cash flow generation to be in line with non-GAAP profit. I think that's a good framework in terms of how to think about it for the time. [Operator Instructions] And our next question is going to come from the line of Arjun Bhatia with William Blair. This is Chris on for Arjun. I was hoping to get a little extra color on segment NRR in the quarter. It was great to see the improvement there. And I was wondering if you think that we're starting to stabilize and kind of found the bottom and how we should think about the trends going forward. Yes. I think as it relates to segments dollar-based net expansion was 93% this quarter was 92% last quarter. The business grew 3%. What we said for this year is you should expect that business to -- the growth in that business to be muted. I think that continues to be our expectation for the year. I'd say 93% DBNE per segment was kind of in line with what we were expecting. And really there, we're focused on a number of different initiatives that we laid out in March kind of at our operational review readout. And we're focused on a couple of things. #1, we're improving our customers' onboarding experience. Historically, it took way too long for customers to get to value. And now Thomas and the team have implemented a number of different things that get customers to value on their first use case in a matter of weeks versus historically in a matter of months.
In addition to that, we're making a concerted effort to sign more multiyear deals, and that will help with churn and contraction. That will help with dollar-based net expansion as a result. And this quarter of the bookings that we signed, 40% of them were multiyear deals versus just 17% a year ago. And then the last thing we committed to at the Investor Day or one of the other things I should say, it's not the only thing, we are making progress on our data warehouse interoperability, which is important for our customers. And in Q2, we introduced linked audiences. And what that does is it allows customers to combine their segment CDP data with data in their warehouses. And that's, again, an important thing for our customer base.
So all of those things combined, we think, over time, help DBNE. It won't be immediate. DBNE is a trailing 12-month metric. So it's not going to reflect immediately. But as these things start to get traction, we think that it will send that metric in the right direction kind of over time. Great. That's very helpful color. And the second question for me was, the personalized agent sounds like an interesting way to kind of combine the Communications platform with Segment. I was curious what kind of reception is getting from customers so far? And what other kinds of products are on the road map that incorporate Segment into Communications? Yes. I don't want to get too far ahead of the road map. So maybe I'll park that for an upcoming period when we report. I think in terms of the launch that we just did, I think it's pretty early. I mean we just launched the thing a few weeks ago. I think based on the customer conversations that I've had, people are really, really excited about it. I think the whole notion of being able to leverage like a detailed profile about a customer in the context of a conversation is incredibly important. And I think it also has the benefit of like creating a feedback loop. So the customers that I've spoken with are very, very excited. I know our team is very excited based on the customers they've spoken with as well. But in terms of financials, it's just early days, and we'll have to kind of report back on that later. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is going to come from the line of Taylor McGinnis with UBS. So maybe going back to the full year revenue outlook and some of the assumptions, you talked about an improvement in trends with international and e-mail. Segment growth improved slightly, and then you talked about some of the ISC And co-sell opportunities. So I know you have some initiatives in place to accelerate growth that could be additive to a stabilization in the macro in the second half. So when you think about like those playing out and what might be embedded into the guide, it looks like the revenue guide just assumes trends remain status quo and maybe doesn't assume much upside from some of these initiatives that you have in place. So could you just provide a little bit more color there and what those opportunities could look like? Yes. I think we -- I'll start. I think we believe that the Q4 implied math gets you to kind of a reasonable range of outcomes based on kind of what we're seeing in the business today. As we said, you kind of call them out, a number of different trends that we're seeing that have been encouraging over the last 3 months. I think the thing to remember is Twilio is very dynamic, and we are usage-based. And so we continue to just plan prudently in that light. And so we just want to make sure that we're not getting ahead of ourselves. We're not reading into too much in terms of what we're seeing over 3 months, and that's just the right thing to do, just given how dynamic the market is. Yes, the only thing I'd add is, I mean, again, just to maybe reinforce a few points that Aidan made, I think we see encouraging signs like we feel good about the guidance that we provided today. I think as these things start to materialize, like we'll feel better, obviously, but there are a number of things that are happening inside the business today that certainly feel like they could be juice for growth down the road, and we're optimistic about it. But we're going to continue guiding prudently just given that it's a dynamic environment. Perfect. And then just maybe as a follow-up. So when you talked about some of the improvement in trends that you saw in 2Q, maybe you could just talk about like linearity a little bit in the quarter. And as we start 3Q, would you say that a lot of those trends have remained similar or any notable changes to flag? Yes. I mean we're not going to get ahead of that, obviously, Taylor. Like I think orders don't have sort of the linearity dynamics maybe of what you see in some other companies. I think, again, we saw pretty positive trends as a result of the 3-month period that we're talking about today. I certainly don't want to get into July or anything like that, but based on what we've seen, we're encouraged, and we'll play through Q3. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is going to come from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. I just wanted to kind of confirm on political traffic. I know in the past, you guys have kind of said that, that was going to be an area that you weren't going to invest in. But just as we kind of head into a political season, just should we still be thinking about kind of political traffic either to e-mail or text message is something that's kind of more limited contribution to Twilio. Yes. I think as it relates to political, we always have some political traffic kind of rolling through our business. But I wouldn't expect outsized revenue impact as a result of the upcoming election. We have registration requirements we talked about before with you in an acceptable use policy. And if customers don't meet those policies, we won't take the traffic. So it ensures a level of quality on our networks and on our platform, and it protects consumers. We think that's the right thing to do. So there might be a little bit of a bump, but it won't be anything outsized as we get closer to the U.S. elections. Great. And then just -- I noted you guys said international improvement. Is that some end market improvement? Or do you kind of attribute that to some of the ISV relationships growing? Just how do you think about kind of some of that improvement that you're seeing or ISV traction? Yes. So we did see this kind of improving trend with the international. It's international -- when we say international, just to be clear, it's internationally terminating messaging traffic. And I would say it was a bit broad-based. It wasn't 1 group of customers or the other. So that was encouraging in a way to see that it was a bit broader versus just an ISV group or another group of customers. But beyond that, I wouldn't call out anything specific. It wasn't a certain industry. It wasn't a certain market where traffic was terminating that spiked or jumped out to us. It was broader. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is going to come from the line of Ryan Koontz with Needham & Co. I wanted to ask about any of the changes you're making in go-to-market and these sort of changes that are driving the strength you're able to reduce costs? And any progress in automation that you've had on the Comm side of the business? Yes. I mean just to maybe go back a little bit, like we made a number of changes, obviously, that unfortunately resulted in a whole series of layoffs towards the earlier part of last year. So now we're kind of back into 2023. And we're starting to see some of those -- well, a lot of those changes, frankly, especially in our cost profile, rippled through the business.
In terms of some of the rationale behind what we did at the time and what we were kind of expecting going forward, like we did want to orient many more of our customers towards self-serve. And I think we pointed to a couple of things in the quarter around self-serve like it was definitely one of the better quarters for that kind of cohort and segment of customers. It's a very, very kind of broad set like you can have customer spending small amounts of money up to kind of decently large sized amounts of money. And so it's a kind of broad category that has seen strength. There's a number of things that we did from a technology perspective as well to make sure that we were able to onboard, onramp customers in a way that they could kind of activate with Twilio fairly quickly as well.
So I'd say very good progress, quite frankly, in terms of self-serve as it relates to communications. Maybe just the other thing that you didn't ask, but just to kind of touch on is also with -- as Aidan kind of talked about in some of her comments, also good progress, I wouldn't call it per se self-serve, but in terms of just accelerating customers to value on the segment side as well, like we have done a lot of work from a technology perspective there, too, to increase just the velocity with which customers get to value. And then I think more broadly, there is work that we're doing on automation. But we still think that our ability to drive cost leverage here that there is a lot of opportunity going forward, and we'll continue doing that. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is going to come from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolf. This is Rich Magnus on for Alex Zukin. I just wanted to double-click again on that segment onboarding process you've been speaking about. I know in the past, you mentioned leveraging AI to produce friction in that process and drive that faster TTV through the self-serve process. But can you sort of help us think through any impacts there that might drive segment growth this year and next year? Yes. Maybe I'll just touch on the technology, and I think Aidan kind of answered the growth dynamics earlier. Like just to reiterate that last point, I think growth will continue to be muted for the kind of foreseeable future. We've been kind of saying that for a while. And I think while there are improvements in the business, like just given the nature of it, that will take a little bit of time to show up in growth. That said, I'd say there's a handful of things that have been really encouraging for us in the Segment business. I think one is that time to value work. It's a combination of AI work that we've done to help customers get through the process faster. There's also use case onboarding wizard that's also allowed customers to kind of get to their specified use case a lot faster. And then I'd say also a really concerted effort by our customer success team.
And so the combination of those things, I think, has been pretty powerful, frankly, in really accelerating what Aidan characterized as what was months in the past, down to weeks, and what we've kind of quantified as a 4x improvement from where we were. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is going to come from the line of Walravens with Citizens JMP. Right. This is Austin Call on for Pat. You touched on a 8-figure renewal during the quarter in Twilio voice being a part of that. Can you just talk about how you view your opportunity with respect to AI at this point and the opportunity with these products? Yes. I mean I think that our opportunity around AI is everything to do with data. And I think as it relates to data, in particular, contextual data. And I think the reason that we feel such deep conviction about that is, is that all of our customers are sitting on proprietary data sets that will never be turned over to an LLM, right? Like that is the part of their business, and our ability to work with them vis-a-vis Segment and ingest that data, use it as part of an overall profile that we have for every single unique consumer to be able to drive a personalization experience back to them, I think that is like a really, really significant unlock that's going to be able to drive business more -- drive growth, excuse me, more broadly for the overall business.
But it's that combination of communications plus contextual data plus AI and the mix as well. Now just to go back to voice for a second since that's where you started, I think what's interesting about voice as it relates to all of that is, is that AI is the most natural in voice, right? Like in the same way that you and I are interacting right now, like it's just very normal to kind of have a conversation in that way. And I think that the AI capabilities are becoming so sophisticated in their ability to process natural language in this way that, when paired with contextual data, I think that is going to be a heck of an opportunity. And I think a lot of that value will end up accruing, not just a messaging and e-mail, which we feel optimistic about, but certainly voice as well. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is going to come from the line of Nick Altmann with Scotiabank. Awesome. You guys sort of have a reenergized focus on your ISVs. You named a handful of new partnerships in the prepared remarks. I guess when you look at sort of the other potential ISV partnerships out there, how much runway is there left in terms of acquiring new ISVs? And then just any sense of what percentage of the business is coming from those partners and any goalposts in terms of how fast that part of the business is growing? Yes. We're not going to break out the kind of percentage of revenue per se, but I'll just maybe provide a little bit of color based on your question. Obviously, there's been strong growth there, and we feel very positive about it, as you probably ascertained from our remarks. It is a sizable portion of the Communications revenue today, and it's also growing faster than our total organic growth rate, and it's got, quite frankly, compelling gross margins as well. So that all feels pretty good. As you alluded to, we did sign a number of large ISV deals in the quarter, including wins with payment processors, customer experience companies, marketing automation platforms and more. i'd say those businesses have been growing pretty well, too. And so I think we'll accrue some benefits as a result of their growth.
I think, two, it's not just domestic, which kind of speaks to like how much runway is there here. We're also seeing good growth in EMEA and APJ as well. And I think what's kind of important from our standpoint is, is that these relationships are evolving beyond just being like software providers using our channels to kind of real relationships where we have an opportunity to kind of deepen what we do with the likes of a Braze, [indiscernible], Insider, Bloomreach Ship because we've got like these strong integrations within the ecosystem. We're engaged in cosell and resell with a lot of these partners. And I think that also allows us to get some go-to-market leverage in terms of expanding our own go-to-market footprint.
So yes, I mean, we do feel pretty good about where we are. We do feel pretty good about the growth trajectory and we're excited. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is going to come from the line of William Power with Baird. This is Yoni Similas on for Will. I know you mentioned earlier in the call that retail and e-commerce was pretty good this past quarter, and it seems like things are pretty stable overall across the business. But I guess, outside of retail and e-commerce, are there any other verticals out there that are standing out right now or maybe even showing signs of upward inflection? When we look at our top industries, I'd say most of them are actually up and growing. I'd say for us, social and messaging continues to be one that's a little bit softer, though it's a relatively smaller portion of our business right now. So financial services is one that has been strong. You called out retail, e-commerce and a couple of others that have been pretty strong as well. But broadly, I'd say most of the industries that we operate in, our top industries are growing. And just to be clear, growing but not necessarily growing above the company average or... In some cases, they are, in some cases, it's more in line with the company average. [Operator Instructions] And our next question is going to come from the line of Derrick Wood with TD Cowen. Just on AI, I guess, stepping back a bit from a high level, Khozema, how would you describe the generative AI monetization strategy for Twilio, whether whether via direct modernization or just indirect implications? Yes. I think there's a couple of angles there. So let me just -- I'll spend a moment on it. So I think, first of all, where we kind of started with AI with some of the earliest use cases was really around fraud and trust, right? So we embedded AI capabilities to help protect the consumer just given that we want to, at all costs, protect the vitality of the ecosystem. And so there were a number of things that we introduced to basically protect the consumer, like Fraud Guard, Verify, these are different products we've announced over the course of the last year or so. As we talked about in the remarks today, like we're seeing good activity there.
I think as we go, it's really going to be maybe AI-centered predominantly around contextual data. I think where we see the big unlock here, certainly for our business and as it relates to what we've referred to for a long time and others do, too, is customer engagement like the real unlock there is like through personalization at scale. And so the way that you get there is having this like really rich contextual data about every single one of us as consumers that comes through segment. Being able to relay that back to a consumer vis-a-vis some sort of communication channel and then obviously using AI to supercharge that. So one example might be like we have a voice intelligence product. We talked about that today, too, where we're able to extract insights as a result of the context of that call, use it both inside of that call that's taking place at the time, but also feed it back into a profile so that, that data can be reused for the next time that, that brand ends up interacting with the consumer.
Similarly, I think where that will increasingly go is you'll end up without perhaps even realizing it, although I think we'll probably disclose it, interacting with an automated agent where all of that is taking place seamlessly. They're able to process natural language. Like I don't think that's per se like our strategic advantage in AI. There're a number of companies that can do that. We'll partner with those organizations. What they don't have, though, which I think is our secret sauce is going to be how do you get to that specific consumer and thousands of others at exactly the same moment in time to deliver each of them a unique and personalized experience. That comes from contextual data, and that's why we're so bent on ensuring that we deliver Segment natively inside of Communications so that we can deliver that entire workload. Does that make sense, Derrick? Yes, that's great color. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is going to come from the line of Samad Samana with Jefferies. This is actually Billy Fitzsimmons on for Samad. In terms of a short one, stock-based comp is down year-over-year in both dollar terms and percentage terms. Just how should we think about where that can kind of go from here and kind of what inning we're in on that front? Obviously, you guys have highlighted changes to the bonus structure what should it kind of bottom? Is there more -- is there more work to be done -- continue to decline the way it has been? Yes. Thanks for the question. There's more leverage here in terms of the opportunity ahead. So we were 13.6% SBC in the quarter, it was down 110 basis points year-over-year, it was down 13% quarter-over-quarter. It's on the back of the things that you've talked about. We've reduced, obviously, the size of the employee base we've made a shift in terms of compensation mix away from equity and towards cash. And we've also been more selective in terms of which employees get equity in the company.
Those changes have already been made. In terms of looking forward, we think that there's still opportunity here for leverage. We had originally, several years ago, committed to 10% to 12% SBC as a percentage of revenue by 2027. So we're still marching our way down the cost curve to get to that kind of range. And then if I can ask a second one. Can we just double-click on Communications' gross margins in the quarter? Any changes there, positive or negative, both domestically and/or internationally? And then how should we kind of think about the Comm's gross margins going forward given some of the new initiatives and given the mix of growth in new products going forward? Yes. In the quarter, you'll see that Comm's gross margins were up year-over-year but down quarter-over-quarter. The quarter-over-quarter dynamic was just really driven by the hosting credits that we saw come through in the first quarter. They were about 80 basis points of a help in the first quarter. That didn't repeat quarter-over-quarter. So that's kind of the headwind. Year-over-year, they were up 160 basis points or so, and that was driven by 2 things: product mix. So when we talked about e-mail growing or accelerating that obviously helps margins because it's higher margin than the Comm's average. The other dynamic in that year-over-year growth was the fact that we had the dispositions last year that we did that in July timeframe. They were at a gross margin rate that was dilutive to the company. And so not having those -- the value first and IoT businesses actually helps margins.
As we think about going forward, margins in the Communications business tend to be driven really by mix. That product mix between messaging or voice or e-mail, et cetera, or termination mix within the messaging business. So if you're terminating more internationally or domestically, that will drive different gross margins.
I think the framework we think about and kind of look at is we look at the unit economics. And so long as the unit economics remain attractive, we'll continue to do the business. So you should expect, I'd say, in the near term, some level of variability in the Communications' gross margin. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Mike Funk with Bank of America. This is Matt on for Mike Funk. Can you help us think about the second half revenue guidance in the context of new customer additions versus uplift from expansion? And then looking beyond even this year from a high level, how you might expect the growth across to shake out in the medium term? I missed the second part. No, we're not going to get into the split in terms of how to think about the revenue guidance. That's not something we've ever really done in terms of splitting the guide between new customers and expansion. I think we feel good about the 5% to 6% range we gave you for Q3, the 6% to 7% for the year. And we talked about the dynamic market, the fact that we're usage based and the fact that we will continue to plan prudently just given those dynamics. Can you just repeat your second question? I missed it. Yes. It was just high level about how the growth algorithm could shake out over the next couple of years, but it seems like that's not something you're going to comment on. Yes, not today, at a later time. Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions. So this is going to conclude today's question-and-answer session. Ladies and gentlemen, this is also going to conclude today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day. Goodbye.","we will disclose non-GAAP financial measures on this call, including statements about our future outlook and goals . we disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements, except as required by law .",1.0
