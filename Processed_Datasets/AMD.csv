Now, with all of that out of the way, I'm happy to turn the call over to Lisa. Lisa? Thank you, Laura. And good afternoon to all those listening in today. We started 2018 with excellent financial results, as we delivered our third straight quarter of double-digit year-over-year revenue growth. First quarter revenue of $1. 65 billion grew 40% year-over-year. Gross margin improved 4 percentage points and earnings per share increased significantly based on very strong operating and net income growth.
Our strong first quarter financial results demonstrate that our long-term strategies paying off. We are executing consistently on our product roadmap. Our customers are increasingly adopting our new products and we are strengthening the foundation of AMD with the right long-term investments.
Looking at our Computing and Graphics segment in the quarter, excellent momentum for our premium product portfolio drove double-digit year-over-year and sequential revenue growth. Client processor sales were significantly better than seasonality, as Ryzen processor shipments grew year-over-year and sequentially. Ryzen processors accounted for 60% of our overall client processor revenue, up from the low-40s in Q4, with desktop and notebook client processor ASPs increasing.
Product execution was strong in the quarter, as we expanded our Ryzen processor portfolio with new high-performance products. We launched the first AMD Ryzen desktop APUs, combining the power of our Zen CPU and Vega GPU on a single chip, delivering the world's most powerful graphics on a desktop processor, with the Ryzen desktop 2400G.
Initial sales were strong in the component channel, which contributed to the significant Ryzen processor sales increase in the quarter. Additionally, we began shipments of our second-generation Ryzen desktop CPUs based on a 12-nanometer Zen+ architecture, delivering outstanding gaming performance and best-in-class multiprocessing leadership for gamers, creators and hardware enthusiasts.
Ryzen mobile unit shipments also ramped in the quarter ahead of OEM system launches planned for Q2, driving double-digit increases in our mobile processor unit shipments, both year-over-year and sequentially.
Initial Acer, HP and Lenovo platforms had strong sales in the quarter, and Dell released new notebooks and 2-in-1s in early April that further expanded our Ryzen portfolio. Additionally, our first Ryzen PRO commercial notebooks are expected to launch in Q2. Dell, HP and Lenovo are all planning to offer AMD-based commercial notebooks based on the excellent performance and features of this new APU.
Overall, the number of Ryzen-based systems from OEMs continues to grow. In Q2 alone, we expect 25 new Ryzen-based consumer and commercial notebooks to launch, and our customers remain on track to bring a total of 60 Ryzen-based systems to market by the end of the year.
In Graphics, we delivered strong year-over-year revenue growth as ASP and unit shipments increased significantly. On a sequential basis, revenue increased and we outperformed seasonality with strong Radeon Vega and 500 series channel sales, driven by both gaming and blockchain demand.
Gaming continues to be a top priority for us, with growth being driven by the expanding number of PC gamers and increasing demand for graphics performance to deliver more immersive experiences. Demand for our Radeon series of graphics products remained strong as new AAA game titles, such as Far Cry 5, were released. We continued our investments in gaming software and released our Radeon esports experience, providing a performance uplift on popular esports games such as Fortnite, PUBG, DOTA 2 and Overwatch.
We continue to see significant demand for Radeon Vega graphics family, as customers accelerate their ramps based on increasing availability of our high-performance GPUs, with more supply coming to market.
In Professional Graphics, HP and Dell both expanded their AMD Radeon Pro workstation portfolio offerings in the quarter, including HP's launch of new ZBook thin and light mobile workstations powered by the AMD Radeon Pro WX 3100.
Our machine learning strategy continues to gain momentum. Mega data center partners are validating and testing our Radeon Instinct MI25 for deep learning applications, and we introduced our Radeon Open Compute ecosystem, ROCm 1.7, a top to bottom open solution software stack for machine learning.
I'm also happy to report that our next-generation 7-nanometer Radeon Instinct product, optimized for machine learning workloads, is running in our labs and we remain on track to provide samples to customers later this year.
Turning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. Q1 revenue decreased year-over-year, due to lower semi-custom revenue, as expected, based on maturity of the current game console cycle, and increased sequentially. In the quarter, Microsoft announced support for our industry-leading Radeon FreeSync technology in their Xbox One S and Xbox One X consoles, delivering stutter-free gaming experiences.
Server revenue increased double-digit percentage sequentially, across mega data center, OEM and channel customers. EPYC processor unit shipments nearly doubled from the previous quarter. We continued to grow our data center momentum with dozens of new design wins across key workloads, including HPC, storage, virtualization and cloud applications.
Dell EMC launched three of their newest PowerEdge platforms, powering virtualized storage area networks, hybrid cloud applications, dense virtualization and big data analytics with EPYC 7000 series processors. Recently, supercomputing leader, Cray, announced that it added EPYC processors to its Cray CS500 line of HPC offerings. The Cray announcement tops off a very active quarter in HPC and big data, building on workload momentum in automotive simulations, university clusters and healthcare.
And multiple mega data center customers pass key production milestones as they look to expand their deployments of EPYC-powered instances this year. To-date, there are more than 40 EPYC-based platforms in market, and we are actively working with OEMs, system integrators and channel partners to increase deployment to end customers. We remain focused on achieving mid-single-digit server unit share by the end of 2018.
Our Embedded business delivered increased revenue, unit shipments and ASPs, year-over-year and sequentially, as we introduced two new product families: the EPYC Embedded 3000 and the Ryzen Embedded V1000 processors to enable a new class of thin client, IoT and other embedded solutions.
In closing, we are extremely pleased with our first quarter financial results and strong product execution. We believe 2018 is shaping up to be an excellent year for AMD, with continued revenue growth and margin expansion driven by significant demand for our high-performance Ryzen, Radeon and EPYC products.
Looking forward, we are confident that we have the right long-term strategy to deliver sustained revenue and profitability growth. The market TAM in high-performance computing will grow to over $75 billion over the next few years, including high-growth segments like gaming, data center, machine learning and artificial intelligence.
We have built a strong execution engine, and we will continue to make significant investments in hardware and software to deliver an even more compelling roadmap for our customers in 2019 and beyond.
Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder, to provide some additional color on our first quarter financial performance. Thank you, Lisa. Good afternoon, everyone. The first quarter was a strong quarter for AMD. Year-over-year, we grew revenue 40%, expended gross margin by more than 400 basis points, significantly improved net income and earnings per share and achieved GAAP and non-GAAP net profitability.
Total revenue of $1.65 billion was driven by strong demand for our new products, with Ryzen and Radeon products growing double-digit percentage year-on-year, Ryzen sales coming in higher-than-expected and EPYC server processors ramping. Gross margin was 36%, up 420 basis points year-on-year, driven by a higher proportion of revenue from new products.
Operating expenses were $446 million compared to $371 million a year ago. Operating expenses were 27% of revenue, lower than our prior guidance of 28%, and down 4 percentage points from 31% a year ago, as we continue to make strategic R&D investments, launch new products and invest in our multi-generation product roadmaps.
Operating income was $152 million, up sharply from $34 million a year ago, and operating margin was 9%, up from 3% a year ago. Net income was $121 million or diluted earnings of $0.11 per share as compared to a net income of $2 million a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA was $196 million compared to $68 million a year ago and on a trailing 12-month basis adjusted EBITDA was $496 million.
Now, turning to the first quarter business segment results. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $1.12 billion, up 95% year-over-year due to strong sales of both Radeon and Ryzen products. Our Ryzen offerings outperformed our expectations in Q1, accounting for approximately 60% of client processor revenue and contributed to strong sequential double-digit percentage growth in client revenue. The strength in Radeon products was driven by both gaming and blockchain demand. We believe blockchain was approximately 10% of AMD revenue in Q1 2018.
Computing and Graphics segment operating income was $138 million compared to a loss of $21 million a year ago. This significant turnaround was due to strong revenue growth and improved operating expense leverage.
Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom revenue was $532 million, down 12% year-over-year, with lower semi-custom revenue partially offset by higher server and embedded revenue. As a reminder, revenue in both Q1 2018 and Q1 2017 include semi-custom revenue related to quarter-end inventory, associated with non-cancelable purchase orders as required under the ASC 606 revenue accounting standard.
EESC operating income was $14 million, down from $55 million a year ago, primarily due to a licensing gain in Q1 2017, as well as increased operating expense investments in our data center business.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $1.04 billion at the end of the quarter, down from $1.18 billion in Q4, and up from $943 million in the year ago quarter. Free cash flow was negative $132 million in the first quarter. Inventory was $715 million, up slightly from the prior quarter.
Total principal debt, including our secured revolving line of credit, was $1.7 billion. We deployed cash to repurchase $14 million of debt in the first quarter, as we continue to reduce term debt and interest expense.
Now, turning to our financial outlook: For the second quarter of 2018, AMD expects revenue to be approximately $1.725 billion, plus or minus $50 million. This is an increase of 50% year-over-year, driven by the growth of Ryzen, Radeon, EPYC and semi-custom revenue. On a sequential basis, we expect Q2 revenue to benefit from continued strength in our Ryzen and EPYC product families and a seasonal increase in semi-custom revenue, partially offset by a modest decline in graphics due to blockchain.
As a reminder, for comparative purposes, Q2 2017 revenue was $1.15 billion under the ASC 606 revenue accounting standard. In addition, for Q2 2018, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 37%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $460 million or 27% of revenue, non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other, to be approximately $35 million and inventory to be up slightly on a sequential basis in support of higher revenue.
Our financial progress in the first quarter is attributable to the ongoing strength of Radeon and Ryzen products, as well as continued early contributions from our EPYC products. Our business is strong, and we look forward to continued revenue growth, margin expansion and increased profitability year-over-year.
Based on the strength of our business momentum, for the full year 2018, we now expect revenue to increase by mid-20s percent over 2017, driven by the ramp of our new products. Blockchain revenue to be mid to high-single-digit percentage of revenue for 2018. Non-GAAP gross margin to be greater than 37%.
In summary, the first quarter was excellent. We are pleased with the momentum in our business execution and strong financial results, which we believe lay the foundation for a strong 2018. We are focused on delivering our long-term target financial model, as we execute our multi-generational roadmaps and introduce and ramp high-performance computing products.
With that, I'll turn it back to Laura for the Q&A session. Laura? Thank you very much. Appreciate that, Devinder. Operator, we're ready to go. Certainly. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question today is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now live. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the strong results, especially on getting to the double-digit op margins in your Computing and Graphics segment. it's been awhile since we saw that.
For my first question, Lisa, on EPYC server sales, you mentioned they doubled sequentially. If you could give us some sense of what the magnitude is, so we at least have some ballpark sense of where you are right now. But importantly, what are the remaining pushbacks from customers, in terms of what they would like to see before they adopt EPYC in a more meaningful way, is it just a matter of time? Is it a performance or a pricing gap, or what else do you need to deliver on to get EPYC to a more meaningful level? Yeah, absolutely, Vivek. Thanks for the question. So look, on EPYC, we did make a very nice progress in the quarter. I think when you look at it from a revenue standpoint, it's strong double-digit percentage. There's – we certainly view that the units increasing is also a very positive thing. The traction actually is across all areas. So we saw traction in Enterprise sort of end user deployments. We saw some channel and system integrator deployments as well as hyperscale deployments.
And our goal is to get to mid-single-digit share by the end of this year. I think we are making good progress towards that. What we're working with customers now is just going through their various stages of qualifications. So they go from proof-of-concept to initial deployment then to large volume deployment. And we're in that initial deployment phase.
And so, I think we're making good progress, and it is – there are no real pushbacks other than just time going through the qualification process and working with them in their environments to make sure that we get fully qualified. Got it. And as a follow-up, if I look at your server ASPs in the past, they were sort of in the $300 to $400 range, well below what your competitor had. As you look at a lot of these engagements that you're participating in now, how should we think about pricing trends that you're seeing in that market? Are you able to sell in a higher value segment than you were able to do in the past? Yes. So Vivek, I think the very strong part of our roadmap right now is we're really playing across the entire portfolio. So from, let's call it, the low-end of the server market, the entry-level, all the way through the high-end 2P SKUs. So the pricing that we're seeing in the market is very reasonable. From our standpoint, they are – we are providing value to the customer, but they're also very accretive to the margins of our overall business. So the pricing environment is good. Okay. Thank you. Thanks, Lisa. Thanks, Vivek. Next question, please. Thank you. Your next question is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First question on the Ryzen notebook effort, it sounds like it's really starting to hit its stride. And I was hoping you could give us a little bit more color, which segments does it seem to resonate with, to what extent, is it a commercial versus a consumer product? And do you think that the Ryzen notebook opportunity, is it bigger than the desktop opportunity ultimately in your minds? Thank you. Yes, Mark. So look, we're making very good progress on Ryzen. I think we're very pleased with the Q1 results, and then, what we see going into Q2 in the second half. It is true that up until this quarter, much of our progress has been in the channel and in the desktop portion of the business. We saw a nice increase this quarter in notebooks and what it is is many of the OEMs are actually launching systems in Q2. And with that, we had – they're basically building up their production for the second quarter launches.
What you're going to see in second quarter is a number of impressive premium consumer designs, thin and light designs that I think are representative of the strength of the product. And we will also see the first launch of the commercial systems from the top OEMs and the expectation is that the commercial notebooks will kick in in the second half of the year. Q2 is more of a consumer cycle.
But overall, I think we're seeing that the notebook OEM opportunity is a good one. We have strong design wins. The customers are working closely with us. We're doing a lot of work with retailers and the overall go-to-market to ensure that the notebook opportunity is important and notebook is larger than desktop overall. Okay, great. That's helpful. And a follow-up, if I may. On EPYC, the product has been in the market for a while. I understand that you have to go through the testing phase, and then, pilot programs and initial deployments, and then, hopefully, larger scale deployments. How do you think or how should we think about the cadence of updates on this product? Is this a similar cadence that you would see on the desktop or notebook side? Thank you. Sure, Mark. So on the server side, the cadence of deployments does tend to be longer. I think we're well into the cadence. And so, I think the EPYC work with the OEMs, you saw the combination of that with HPE announcing in December, and then, Dell announcing in the first quarter, that will now move over into Enterprise customers who are then taking their systems into their labs and doing their initial deployments. So I think the cadence is over a number of quarters.
I will say for the first-generation EPYC, we're seeing really nice customer interest, and it's quite broad. And so, it is across Enterprise as well as the hyperscale customers. And we view this as a multi-generational play. So we're very excited about what EPYC can do over the next couple of quarters. But we also believe that this is the right investment to make with the customer set, as we bring out the second-generation of EPYC and the third generation of EPYC, obviously, it would go a little bit faster, because the customer set is familiar with our system. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question is coming from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live. Yeah, good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on the strong results, Lisa and Devinder. Devinder, impressive year-over-year gross margin growth in the March quarter of 400 basis points. I'm just kind of curious, clearly, Ryzen has had a positive impact. Can you help break down the 400 basis points year-on-year growth between kind of new products and the fact that semi-custom sort of declined as a percent of the mix pretty significantly from 2017 to 2018? And then, how do we think about the incremental margin leverage as EPYC comes in and perhaps Ryzen too? Yes, good question, John. Actually, if you look at it from a margin standpoint year-over-year, the semi-custom revenue was actually down, so that was helpful. But beyond that, if you look at the new products, fundamentally, the new products is what's driving the margin. Ryzen, EPYC, GPU Compute, which are all higher than corporate average, those are all driving the increase in the margin.
And as we get to the rest of the year as you observed, the momentum in the products is there for the new products. They're going to go ahead and contribute to the margin increase and that's why, from prior guidance, we just updated our margin to, say, maybe you said greater than 36% the last time, we updated to, say, greater than 37% this time for the year and that's fundamentally all with the momentum that we have for the new products. That's helpful, Devinder. And then, Lisa, as my follow-up, I appreciate kind of quantifying blockchain for both the first quarter and for last year and also your commentary about it being it looks like down sequentially at least in embedded in your June guidance. I'm just kind of curious, just given how hard it is to track where these GPUs are really going, how do you get a sense of what's a blockchain application versus something else, one?
And two, do you see this as a viable long-term market or do you believe that as this market develops, it's going to have to move from proof of work to proof of stake which might just negate mining altogether? And if that scenario were to play out, how worried are you about sort of secondary cards coming back into the market and kind of hurting pricing either in the second half of this year or into 2019? Sure, John. So look, on the blockchain there is a lot of discussion about this. From our standpoint, we stay very, very close to the customer set in the graphics space. And so, we spend time with the commercial miners as well as spending time with our partners.
And the way we look at this, our first priority when we look at allocation of graphics cards is to gamers. And so that's through OEMs, that's through system integrators, that's also working with key e-tailers to make sure that they are prioritizing the gamers segment and we're going to continue to do that. And so, that's one piece that we know well.
We also work directly with the commercial miners, and so, we see kind of what their forecasts are and they work with us and so that we have good visibility on. There is a piece that go through retail that is hard to tell whether that's gaming or mining, but we believe we have a good sense of what that is. So it is an approximation, but we think it's a good approximation of where we are.
And then, to your longer-term question, I do think the blockchain infrastructure is here to stay. I think there are numerous currencies. There are numerous applications that are using the blockchain technology. We don't see a significant risk of secondhand GPUs coming into the market. I think what you find is that, one, there are number of different currencies, and, two, a lot of these users that are buying GPUs these days are actually buying them for multiple use cases, both commercial and consumer. So they're not necessarily buying just for mining.
And I think for that reason, we do think this is a different cycle. That being the case, we do see a bit of volatility and that's why we are putting into our forecast for the second quarter and the second half a little bit lower blockchain demand, but that's more than made up for by the other new products and the way the new products are ramping in the business. That's great. Thanks, Lisa. I really appreciate it. Thanks, John. Operator, next question. Certainly. Our next question is coming from David Wong from Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Thanks very much. Could you give us some idea of what your June guidance assumes in terms of sequential microprocessor sales growth compared to discrete graphics growth? Sure, David. So in our second quarter guidance, we're actually assuming that Ryzen and EPYC are up, and semi-custom is also up seasonally, and we expect graphics to be down modestly based on some of the blockchain demand. Excellent. Could you give us an update on what new products you plan to launch through the rest of this year and next year? And when these are scheduled to come out? Sure. That's a lot, David, but let me say a couple things. I think, relative to our CPU business, I mean we are launching additional Ryzen-based products in the second half of the year. We just launched the second-generation Ryzen desktop in 12-nanometer and that launch has gone really well. I mean, we're very happy with the positioning and how customers are reacting to that. In the second half, we'll have some commercial systems and some other updates to our Ryzen lineup that we will launch.
We have a 7-nanometer GPU based on Vega that we'll sample later this year. We have a 7-nanometer server CPU that we'll sample later this year. And then, obviously, we have a number of products that are planned for 2019 as well. So it's a very, very busy product season for us. But we're pleased with the sort of the execution on the product roadmap. Thanks, Lisa. Thanks, David. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your line is now live. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Firstly, on OpEx, are you still looking for a 28% of revenue for the full year on a higher revenue base? And given that – if that's so, what areas are kind of key for investment on this as we go through the rest of the year and going forward? Yeah. Let me take that, and then, Lisa can add. So yes, we are targeting 28%. As you've seen, Stacy, we had a long-term target model of 26%, 30%. The year has started out well. We came in at 27% in Q1 and targeting around the same for Q2. But we are still in investment mode, and obviously, investing in R&D and the product roadmap. And Lisa can maybe add some of the details in terms of where we are investing in terms of OpEx. Yeah. Sure, Stacy. So I think from the investment side, certainly, we're investing in R&D on the CPU and the GPU side, but a key focus for us is in software, and particularly, machine learning software. I think there's a high demand of people wanting to use our GPUs in the compute space. And so, we're increasing our investments in software around machine learning. Got it. Thank you. For my follow-up, I had a question on the ASC 606. I know last quarter you kind of gave some historicals for how that was a headwind versus a tailwind versus what would have been normal seasonality, particularly in semi-custom. Is the ASC 606 in the Q2 – is that a headwind or tailwind on the guide? And how should we think about that as we go through the second half as well versus what we would have seen without the accounting change? Yeah. Fundamentally, ASC 606, from a revenue standpoint, what happens is the seasonality and the profile of the semi-custom revenue changes. Some of the revenue that we used to get in the second half moved to the first half, so I would say, it's a little bit more balanced between the first half and the second half, as opposed to the peak revenue we used to see in Q3. So that is the primary effect on the profile of the revenue, not necessarily the annual revenue.
ASC 606 has not had any significant impact on our annual revenue. It's more of the profile of the revenue within the quarters. As far as impact is concerned, if you're comparing year-over-year, for example, in Q1 of 2018, semi-custom was down, because we had more revenue in Q1 of 2017, and in Q2, it is slightly up, but very balanced from where we see it from an overall standpoint. So last year in Q2, it was like – I forget how much, like a $75 million headwind versus what would have been otherwise? Is it a similar amount of headwind this time in Q2 or is it less? Or is it a tailwind? I would say that it was a headwind last year. This year, from an overall standpoint, if I compare year-over-year, it is up slightly from where we were in Q2 of 2018. So if you're comparing Q2 2017 to Q2 2018, it's a benefit to the revenue in Q2 of 2018 in our guidance. Got it. Thank you. Thank you, Stacy. Go ahead. Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your line is now live. Thank you. I had two. I'm curious about your comments just now on blockchain, and I'm a little surprised to hear as you think that there would be limited risk that that product would come back into the market. Can you again go over why you think that is, because you're selling more of a general SKU, right? And then, I guess, also, how you handicap the potential for there to be some ASP effect on that too? I know you've captured some of the rising ASPs in the channel, so how do you handicap that looking out throughout the rest of the year? Thanks. Yeah. Absolutely, Tim. Look, so when you look at, I think, most people are comparing sort of this blockchain time period to the last one which was a couple of years ago and I think there are a couple of important differences. I think the first one is that there are multiple currencies and multiple applications that are being used. And what we've seen is that people who are mining do go from one currency to another depending on what's happening.
We're also seeing that many users, on both the commercial and consumer side, are actually buying GPUs for multiple use cases. And from that standpoint, again, we see that there is good demand for, not just blockchain, but for gaming, for the cloud and for those things as well. So I think it's a balanced assessment of where we are. I think the breadth of the blockchain applications and also the breadth of the customer base give us that belief.
Now, as you go forward, there's also a – when we look at the Graphics business go forward minus blockchain, we actually see a very good environment. We see a good environment for gaming growing, we see a good environment for GPU Compute growing, and frankly, on the gaming side, some of those users have not been able to get access to GPUs, and so, again, that's – those are all positives as we go forward.
And then, you had a second question, Tim? I did, yeah. I think you said that the 7-nanometer product is in the lab, and it's going to launch later this year. That's the product at TSMC, correct? And I guess, I'm just wondering on that front do you feel comfortable that you can get capacity from that vendor. Thanks. So our foundry strategy is to use both TSMC and GLOBALFOUNDRIES on the first 7-nanometer product. We are using TSMC for that product and we have a very strong relationship with them. And so, we do see a good momentum on it from what we see, and I'm not concerned about capacity. Thank you so much. Thanks, Tim. Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Good afternoon. And solid job on the quarterly execution. Just a follow-up on the semi-custom business, on the June quarter guide, you mentioned sequential growth in semi-custom. But if I look at your ASC 606 reconciliations for last year, it looks like the semi-custom business was actually down double-digits percentage points sequentially going from Q1 to Q2. So like-for-like on the 606, why the different shipment profile this year, Q1 to Q2? Yeah, I can explain that. So in Q1 of 2017, there was a strategic buy of wafers that we did in Q1 2017. So it had a bigger impact in Q1 2017. And then, the effect caught up in Q2. So the impact Q1 to Q2 was significant. This year, it's more balanced, and from that standpoint, when you compare year-over-year, Q1 to Q1, it's down, but Q2 to Q2, it's up. So there was a different profile in Q1 2017 just based on the way the wafers are purchased in 2017 as opposed to 2018 where it's a little bit more balanced. Great. Thanks for the insights there. Question for Lisa. Embedded solutions contributed to the year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter growth in EESC. I think that this is kind of an often overlooked part of the business, because embedded is nice, because it gives you guys exposure to kind of a diverse set of the market applications. Can you just help us understand where the team is seeing good demand traction in embedded and maybe give us a rough idea on kind of overall revenue contribution to EESC? Yes, Harlan. So yeah, embedded is a nice segment. You're absolutely right. I think it's a margin accretive segment to us. The end markets that we ship into there are thin clients, they are places where you need graphics for displays, so there's some embedded displays that we ship into there.
It's still a small business for us, but we actually believe, in addition to the goodness around Ryzen and EPYC, when we launch those products, Ryzen and EPYC embedded, we actually saw very strong interest from customers. And so, we think as the products strength in our PC and in our server business increase, they will also help that embedded solutions business overall.
So I would say it's still a small piece of the business, but we believe it will be a nice growing margin accretive portion of the business over the next couple of years. Great. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Srini Pajjuri from Macquarie. Your line is now live. Thank you. Lisa, a question on the ASPs. I think you said the ASPs went up because of the Ryzen mix improving. Could you give us some more color as to where Ryzen is in terms of mix? And then, with the Ryzen 2, do you expect that to be accretive to ASPs and margins? Yeah. So in terms of the client business, we saw units up overall. We saw ASPs up overall and they were up in both desktop and mobile. And when you look underneath that, I think what the main thing is we're seeing a larger mix of the business become Ryzen. So in the fourth quarter, we had stated that the Ryzen mix of the client business was kind of in the low-40s. And so, we had notebook, a lot of legacy product that we're still shipping and in desktop, we had some legacy product that we're still shipping.
As we move over to the first quarter, the notebook mix has mixed nicely into Ryzen, and the desktop is now mixed very nicely into Ryzen as well. So overall, that's what led to the ASP increase.
I think the second generation Ryzen is a very, very good product. I think it's – it actually – when you look at the first-generation Ryzen, we were very good on multi-threaded performance, but there were some detractors around single-threaded and gaming performance. I think the second-generation Ryzen is actually much more competitive on gaming performance. So we do see an opportunity for that to help us increase share in the desktop business, and certainly, that would be accretive to margin. Great. And then, one question on the server business, I guess, your target is to get to mid-single-digit share by end of this year, which is fairly gradual ramp. Just curious as to when you expect the 7-nanometer part to be available in the market and when that happens, do you see an inflection to your share gains or do you continue to expect gradual share gains? Thank you. Yeah. So all of the sales this year will be around the current generation of Ryzen, and so, that gets us to the mid-single-digit share. 7-nanometer Zen 2 based product we'll sample later this year to customers and that will be in production in 2019, and we do believe that the adoption rate of the second-generation could potentially be higher than the adoption rate of the first-generation, mostly because customers will be more familiar with our systems and our products. And so, we'll see how it goes, but we certainly – our overall goals are ambitious in the server space. And so, this year, it's first-generation Ryzen; next year, we'll mix in the 7-nanometer second-generation – I'm sorry, first-generation EPYC, and next year, we'll mix in the second-generation of the EPYC products. Thank you. Thanks, Srini. Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. Perhaps your phone is on mute. Toshiya Hari, you're line is live. Perhaps your phone is on mute on your end. Charles calling in for Toshiya. Hello. Go ahead, Charles. Hello. Yes, sorry about that. Thanks for taking the time. I had a – my first question is on the competitive landscape in the AI space. So just wondering how you're thinking about your positioning, relative to not only your biggest competitor there in NVIDIA, but also new entrants that could potentially be working on custom solutions. And then, I have a follow-up. Sure. So the AI market is certainly growing very, very fast relative to the competitive landscape, we are a new entrant. I think our GPU Compute hardware is very good. I think we have a strong roadmap that we are putting in place for that. I think on the software side, we have more work to do, and we are making significant investments in some of the machine learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow and Caffe, and some of these key frameworks to ensure that we make it easier to adopt our solutions.
But we see this as a multi-year, really, opportunity for us. So GPU Compute will continue to be a focus area for us. We think we can be very competitive and we're going to continue to invest in this area.
As it relates to, let's call it, non-GPU solutions, I think there will – the landscape says there will be some ASIC solutions in the marketplace, but I view that as complementary to the GPU solutions. And from that standpoint, I think we have CPUs, we have GPUs, and then, we have the ability to connect heterogeneously to these other elements. So from our standpoint again, we see this as a market that very much fits our capability and we will continue to invest in it. Got it. Thank you. And then, my follow-up's on the upcoming shareholder meeting. I know one of the proposals is to increase the authorized share authorization by about 700 million shares. Obviously, my understanding is that that wouldn't be dilutive initially. But just wondering how you're thinking about potential uses of that share is. Yes. So you're correct. There is a proposal at the shareholder meeting. It is not going to be dilutive to begin with, and it's really good housekeeping. We don't have any particular plans at this point. Thank you. Thanks, Charles. Next question. Certainly. Our next question is coming from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now live. Hi. Thank you very much. I had two questions. One was just a follow-up to what Lisa you were talking about on the machine learning side. When do we see – so just give us an update of where you are in traction and should we expect any meaningful revenues on that front from AMD in this year? Yes. So I think last year, we announced a partnership with Baidu to do software optimizations for machine learning. And we have several other partnerships with others in this area. So there's a lot of interest. I think the time for meaningful revenue – we will see some revenue in the second half of the year that's part of the growth in the margin expansion story. And I think into 2019 and 2020, this will continue to be an area of growth for us. Okay. And then, for my follow-up, just getting back to the discrete graphics in the quarter reported, the channel was really dry heading into the first quarter. So where are we on the channel inventory? And is there any way for you to help us understand how much of the growth was driven by the buildup in the channel in the March quarter? Thank you. Yes. So the channel inventory was at very, very low levels going into the quarter, and frankly, it was hard to get the GPU. It was hard to get GPUs. I think if you look now on typical retailer and e-tailer sites, the channel inventory is good. And I think there was an element of channel replenishment, but from what we see at the inventory levels today, they're, I would say, normal. And what is the normal level, Lisa, in terms of weeks? Maybe somewhere between four and five weeks. Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Hans Mosesmann from Rosenblatt Securities. Please proceed with your question. Thank you. Lisa, a couple of questions. Can you comment qualitatively about the competitive dynamic that you're seeing in microprocessors? And as a second question, can you give us an update on Spectre, in terms of the impact it's had on the business going forward? Thanks. Sure, Hans. So on the microprocessor side, I think the competitive landscape, as we see it, Ryzen and EPYC are very competitive. And we've seen that in head-to-head design opportunities. I think from a CPU standpoint, we're very pleased with that. I think second-generation Ryzen in 12-nanometer actually improves the overall performance, and so, we like how that positions us on the PC side.
I think as we look forward, and I think this is important, we believe that the 7-nanometer capability of the foundry ecosystem is very good, and that puts us in a good competitive spot from a manufacturing standpoint. And then, on the design side, obviously, we have things that we're planning. And so, I see the competitive environment as one that is as good and we're going to work very hard to make sure that it gets better over time. Obviously, we take the competition very seriously.
Oh, yes, and the second question, sorry about that, Hans, on Spectre. We have spent a good amount of time with our customer set to make sure that they're fully protected on Spectre. We've actually released a number of software mitigations already to our OEM customers and to our partners. They're in their process of deploying. So I think it took a lot of energy. Certainly, we spent a lot of time on it and our customers had to spend time on it. But we don't see any long-term effects. It's more that we want to make sure to get the work done quickly, and that's been our focus. Thanks, Lisa. Thanks, Hans. Operator, we have time for two more questions, please. Certainly. Our next question is coming from Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Your line is now live. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask you, I think you mentioned double-digit sequential growth in the CPU business. I was just kind of curious what stage you're on in terms of channel fill for the Ryzen mobile business? And then, I've one more follow-up. Yes. So we did, as I mentioned, have some mobile product shipped ahead of OEM system launches in the second quarter. But we see this really as the beginning of the Ryzen ramp. So my expectation is that the client or the Ryzen portion of our business will be up in the second quarter, and it will be up in the second half. And so, it's the beginning of the notebook ramp. And then, I wanted to ask some of the OpEx side, Devinder, just in terms of licensing gains that have been in OpEx offset, do you expect any of those gains this year? I think there could be, but it's hard to tell, because it's kind of dependent upon the milestones that come into play. That was the OpEx offset last year that got reversed, but we'll see when it happens from a milestone standpoint. I think, Blayne, just as a point of clarification on this point, from an IP standpoint, we're not forecasting IP either here in the second quarter or into the second half. I think, as Devinder said, we do have some IP arrangements that we're working on, and depending on when those milestones complete, we will then sort of forecast it into the business. Thank you. Thanks, Blayne. Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Gus Richard from Northland. Your line is now live. Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Real, real quickly, can you just tell me if the 12-nanometer is a dye shrink or just performance improvement? Yes, Gus, it is primarily performance improvement, and it is some design improvements. So you see some of the latency improvements and so on. It is not a dye shrink. Got it. Thanks. Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back for any further or closing comments. That's it for our call for today. We thank you very much for joining us. Look forward to seeing you at the Morgan Stanley Conference and at the Cowen Conference. And as always, we thank you for your support of AMD. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.

Please refer to the cautionary statements in today's press release for more information. You also find detailed discussions about our risk factors in our filings with the SEC, and in particular, AMD's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.
Now with that, I will hand the call over to Lisa. Lisa? Thank you, Laura; and good afternoon to all those listening in today. We ended the first half of 2018 strong delivering our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year revenue growth, driven by increased demand for our high-performance products. Second quarter revenue of $1.76 billion grew 53% year-over-year and gross margin improved more than three percentage points, resulting in our highest quarterly net income in seven years.
We are very pleased with the year-over-year financial performance across both of our business segments. As we continue to gain share, driven by strong customer adoption of our new products in the PC, gaming and data center markets.
Looking at our Computing and Graphics segment, second quarter CG segment revenue increased 64% year-over-year, driven by strong demand for our Radeon GPUs and a significant ramp of our Ryzen mobile processors. Ryzen unit shipments grew strong double-digit sequentially as Ryzen mobile processor shipments more than doubled in the quarter. Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Huawei, Lenovo and Samsung launched dozens of Ryzen processor-based notebooks, which position us well to continue growing Ryzen mobile sales, heading into the back-to-school and holiday seasons.
In the commercial PC market, we launched our Ryzen PRO commercial mobile APUs in the quarter. For the first time in our history, all three major commercial OEMs, Dell, HP and Lenovo now offer enterprise class notebooks and desktops, powered by AMD. And we are seeing strong initial interest as customers evaluate these new systems.
Continuing our strong roadmap execution, we launched our second generation Ryzen desktop CPU to very positive reviews in April, just 13 months after the first Ryzen desktop processors were released. Additionally, in June, we delivered the first public demonstration of our second generation AMD Ryzen Threadripper processors, with the industry's first 32 core PC processor designed for the high-end desktop market. We are on track to launch our second generation Threadripper processor in August with leadership performance for the enthusiast and content creation markets.
Overall, we are very pleased with the market adoption of our Ryzen processors. 44 consumer and commercial Ryzen-based desktops and notebooks have been launched this year, and our customers remain on track to bring a total of 60 Ryzen-based systems to market in 2018. In Graphics, strong channel and data center demand drove significant year-over-year increases in revenue and ASPs. Sequentially, Graphics revenue was down primarily driven by lower blockchain-related sales, partially offset by stronger data center sales.
Sales into the high-end enthusiast and performance portions of the gaming market grew substantially year-over-year based on the adoption of our latest Radeon RX 500 and Vega series GPUs.
We continue to execute our software strategy to provide the best gaming experience in the industry, with new AMD Radeon GPU drivers published for every major game launched in the quarter and expanded partnerships with Ubisoft, Capcom and Rebellion to optimize their next generation of games on Radeon graphics.
On the hardware side, we continue to expand the adoption of our Radeon Vega architecture with the introduction of new OEM systems and AIB cards in smaller and more mobile form factors. Samsung also announced they added our FreeSync technology to many of their high-end TVs, giving PC and console gamers the ultimate big screen gaming experience. The AMD FreeSync ecosystem is the broadest in the industry with more than 400 FreeSync-enabled monitors and TVs in market to-date.
Data center GPU revenue increased significantly in the quarter, driven by Vega-based Radeon Instinct MI25 shipments. Our GPU engagements with large cloud customers continued to expand as we increased our investments in hardware and open software solutions in this important space.
At Computex this year, we showed the first public demonstration of our next generation 7-nanometer Radeon Vega GPU, which includes new features optimized for the artificial intelligence and machine learning markets. We started sampling of this product in the second quarter and we are on track to launch this next generation product, the world's first 7-nanometer GPU later this year.
Turning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, second quarter segment revenue increased 37% year-over-year, primarily driven by strong Semi-Custom sales and growing adoption of our EPYC data center processors.
Starting with our Server business, we celebrated our one-year anniversary of the launch of our EPYC server processors with an increase of greater than 50% in both revenue and unit shipments sequentially.
We have over 50 customer platforms now in market, including Cisco who announced their highest density server offering ever, powered by EPYC processors and HP Enterprise who launched their first EPYC-based single socket ProLiant server, which delivers significantly lower costs per virtual machine than the leading dual-socket competitor.
We also saw strong progress with our mega data center partners as Tencent Cloud announced immediate availability of their SA1 Cloud Service, delivering 30% lower costs per VM with outstanding performance across key workloads.
Shipments for mega data center customers more than doubled in the quarter, as we made significant progress towards qualification of production instances at multiple cloud providers in anticipation of deployments planned in the second half of this year. We're also seeing momentum from Tier 2 next wave cloud service providers that have the ability to ramp quickly with the noted preference for the value and capability that our EPYC single socket offering brings.
Turning to large enterprise customers, we added dozens of new end customers in the quarter. Our value proposition continues to be strong in segments like HPC, data analytics and in general-purpose virtualized enterprise environments. We are extremely focused on accelerating EPYC processor adoption in these targeted segments in the second half of the year.
Finally, I'm very pleased with our execution against our long-term roadmap. We received first silicon of our next generation 7-nanometer EPYC processor with Zen 2, code-named Rome, in the second quarter. And the silicon quality and bring-up has gone very well. I am happy to report that we've recently started sampling Rome to select partners for early validation and we are on track to launch in 2019, strengthening our already outstanding competitive position in the market. We remain focused on our near-term milestone of achieving mid-single digit server unit share by the end of 2018 on the path to our midterm goal of double digit market share.
Moving on to our Semi-Custom and Embedded businesses, Semi-Custom revenue increased year-over-year and sequentially in support of Sony and Microsoft game consoles. We are proud that Microsoft and Sony have collectively shipped well over 100 million AMD-powered game consoles in the current cycle. The game console market continues to be an important segment for us in the long term, and we are well-positioned based on our strong partnerships and differentiated IP and design capabilities.
Embedded sales increased by double digit percentage year-over-year, driven by growth across the embedded gaming, industrial and medical imaging markets. We also saw strong initial design wins for our new EPYC and Ryzen-embedded product families following their launch last quarter.
In closing, we are very pleased with our second quarter financial results. We delivered strong revenue growth and margin expansion as demand for our new high-performance products continued to accelerate. Most importantly, we believe our long-term technology bets position us very well for the future. Several years ago, we made important decisions around our CPU and GPU roadmaps to drive leadership at the 7-nanometer node. We now have line of sight to those products coming to market and we see incredible opportunities ahead based on the competitive positioning and customer interest in our upcoming 7-nanometer products.
We are confident that with continued execution, we are on an excellent trajectory to drive market share gains and growth in revenue and profitability. We are focused on that continued execution as we make significant investments in our hardware and software roadmaps to deliver even more compelling products to our customers in the 2019 and 2020 timeframe.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our second quarter financial performance. Devinder? Thank you, Lisa; and good afternoon, everyone. Q2 was another strong quarter for AMD. Year-over-year, we grew revenue 53% and expanded gross margins to 37%, while significantly growing operating margin and earnings per share. Quarterly revenue of $1.76 billion was higher year-over-year, driven by strength across all product lines.
Gross margin was up 360 basis points year-over-year, driven by the ramp of new products. Operating expenses were $467 million or 27% of revenue, down as a percentage of revenue from 34% a year ago. We are delivering operating leverage while launching new products and making strategic R&D investment to support our multi-generational product roadmaps. R&D investments in the first half of 2018 increased 25% as compared to the first half of 2017 in support of our future product roadmaps. Operating income grew from $186 million from $23 million a year ago. Operating margin was 11% and both our business segments reported double-digit operating margin percentage.
Adjusted EBITDA was $228 million, compared to $58 million a year ago, and on a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted EBITDA has grown considerably to $666 million, resulting in gross debt leverage of 2.5 times. Net income was $156 million, a significant improvement compared to a loss of $7 million one year ago. This is our highest quarterly net income since 2011. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.14, using a diluted share count of 1,147 million compared to a loss of $0.01 per share a year ago.
Now turning to the business segment results. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $1.1 billion, up 64% year-over-year, led by strong sales of both Radeon and Ryzen products. Ryzen products accounted for approximately 60% of client revenue and we saw particular strength in Ryzen mobile processors in the second quarter as new notebook products continued to ramp.
Strong channel and data center demand drove year-over-year Graphics revenue increases. Sequentially Graphics revenue was down primarily driven by lower blockchain sales partially offset by stronger data center sales. We believe blockchain-related revenue declined from approximately 10% of our revenue in the first quarter to approximately 6% of our overall revenue in the second quarter.
Computing and Graphics segment operating income was $117 million or 11% of segment revenue compared to operating income of $7 million one year ago. The significant increase was due to strong revenue growth coupled with improved operating expense leverage. Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom revenue was $670 million, up 37% year-over-year, driven primarily by Semi-Custom and EPYC processor sales. These results include higher-than-anticipated Semi-Custom revenue in Q2 due to higher inventory with non-cancelable purchase orders in accordance with ASC 606. EPYC processor units and revenue grew greater than 50% quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by mega data center sales.
EESC operating income was $69 million, or 10% of segment revenue, up from an operating income of $16 million a year ago on higher revenue. Q2 2017 operating income for EESC also included a licensing gain of $25 million.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $983 million at the end of quarter. Free cash flow was negative $88 million in the second quarter due to working capital requirements in support of recent revenue growth. Inventory was $750 million, up slightly from the prior quarter. Total principal debt, including our secured revolving line of credit, was $1.7 billion.
Now turning to our financial outlook. For the third quarter 2018, AMD expects revenue to be approximately $1.7 billion, plus or minus $50 million. This would be an increase of approximately 7% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher sales of Ryzen and EPYC products, partially offset by lower sales of GPU products in the blockchain market. Sequentially, this would be a decrease of approximately 3% with higher Ryzen and EPYC processor revenue offset by lower GPU revenue. In addition, we now expect Semi-Custom revenue to be lower sequentially in Q3 following higher-than-expected Q2 revenue.
As a reminder, for comparative purposes, Q3 2017 revenue was $1.58 billion, adjusted for ASC 606 revenue accounting standard. In addition, for Q3, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 38%, up from 36% in the prior year, driven by the ramp of Ryzen and EPYC product sales; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $470 million, or 28% of revenue; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $35 million; and free cash flow to be positive. For the full-year 2018, we continue to expect revenue growth of mid-20s-percent, gross margin in excess of 37% and to be free cash flow positive.
In closing, Q2 was an excellent quarter and 2018 is expected to be a solid year. I am pleased with our business execution and financial results, driven by the strength of our high-performance products portfolio. We remain focused on executing our long-term financial model for revenue growth, margin expansion and improved profitability.
Now with that, I'll turn it back to Laura for the question-and-answer session. Laura? Thank you, Devinder. Operator, we're ready for our first question here in the room. Our first question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Lisa, for you, on the – it seems Intel seems to have pushed their 10-nanometer volume ramp-out into 2019. And I think a lot of people view your foundry 7-nanometer kind of the same ZIP Code as their 10-nanometers. So, I'm wondering if you could give us some context and/or color on what does this mean? If you're at parity with Intel, have you – has AMD ever been at parity before with Intel? And does that change the conversation with your customers in terms of their interest in your products? Thank you. Yeah, Mark. Thanks for the question. So, look, in terms of our roadmaps, both on the CPU and GPU side, we made some important technology decisions a couple of years ago. And we bet heavily on 7-nanometer. We thought 7-nanometer would be a big node for the industry and it would be important for us to be early in the adoption of 7-nanometer. So when you look at where we are today, especially on the CPU side, we have first silicon of our Rome product; it looks very good. We also have a good number of architectural improvements and enhancements in Zen 2 that will come with 7-nanometer technology.
So we're very pleased with where we are and where the competitive positioning is. And I would say, to your question about how is it perceived? I think customers are very interested in where we are. Clearly, we have to execute. But with our current generation, Naples customers have certainly gotten to understand our architecture. With the improvements that we have going into 7-nanometer with Rome, I think, there is enhanced interest, and from a competitive positioning standpoint, we do believe we have an excellent competitive position going into 2019. So we are very excited about that. Thank you. A follow-up, if I may. As we look at the double-digit bogey for next year on servers, is that – do you need EPYC 2 to get to that? And what are the risks on bringing that to market? Thank you. Yeah, so, Mark, we view the double-digit share goal as an important share goal. I think it certainly will come with the second generation of EPYC, so the Zen 2 product. But I view it as a journey, right? We have now sort of three generations that we have. We have Zen 1 that's in the market today. We have Zen 2 that's well into the productization phase, and then we have a very strong roadmap around Zen 3 as well. So we feel good about our competitive position and the path to double digit market share. I think this is all about rate and pace, and we're working very, very closely with our customers to accelerate that ramp.
And actually, I was very pleased. I mentioned in the prepared remarks earlier that in the second quarter, we saw some nice acceleration of the mega data center customers. So we saw units there more than double, and that's an indication that we're getting the right level of engagement and progress with our large customers. Very helpful. Thank you. Thanks, Mark. Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Yeah, Lisa, Devinder. Congratulations on the strong results. Lisa, I wonder if you could just give us a little bit more detail into the foundry strategy at 7-nanometers, and kind of how much flexibility do you have between your two foundry partners. And to what extent if one of them is having trouble on 7-nanometer, does the wafer supply agreement give you the ability to move capacity without having to pay for wafers? Yeah, sure, John. So a couple of years ago, we did amend the wafer supply agreement. It was a very strategic agreement for us as we look over the long term. So at 7-nanometer, we are engaged with both TSMC and GLOBALFOUNDRIES. I would say that we do have, on a product-by-product basis, the choice between the foundries and we make those decisions on a product-by-product basis. But in terms of our long-term roadmap and how we feel about it both on the GPU and CPU side, the main message is we don't believe process technology is going to be a gate for us. We have a lot of architectural work, a lot of architectural improvements, but we don't believe process technology is a gate for our roadmap. And then, Lisa, as my second question, can you help me better understand? Because one of the things I know you've been working on aggressively with the launch of EPYC 2 is your ability to cover a broader swath of workloads, and just increase the server TAM you can go after. So can you help quantify to me as you go from EPYC 1 to EPYC 2 what that growth in workload coverage looks like? And, importantly, as you continue to broaden out, how do we think about the R&D burden from here? Yeah, sure, John. So when we go from the first generation of EPYC to the second generation of EPYC, I do think that there are some improvements that we'll make in the architecture that will expand the TAM. But from a TAM standpoint, we are not limited. I view our coverage today as 80% of the TAM. And, yes, some workloads are really clean kills and other workloads are closer, but we are servicing a large portion of the TAM. I think the value proposition increases with some of the architectural improvements that we've made in the second generation of EPYC. But from the standpoint of TAM, I think we feel good about it.
From an R&D standpoint and Devinder made the comment in our prepared remarks that we did increase R&D by 25% year-on-year. But I think we've done it in a very responsible way. So we have revenue growth. We're seeing margin expansion, which is a very, very key piece of our business model. And then, we will increase R&D and go-to-market resources effectively. But I don't believe that we will ever increase our OpEx ahead of revenue. I think it's a balance between each of those lines.
So we have these – I think we have a strong roadmap at this point and we'll look for opportunities to increase R&D, particularly on the software side, actually. I think we have a lot of opportunity on the software side across CPUs and GPUs to accelerate some of our machine learning work. And so that's where incremental R&D would go. And then, if I could sneak one last one in, Lisa, just on the GPU side, I think this is the second or third quarter in a row that you've highlighted incremental gains inside of the data center. Can you help size what that represents as a percent of revenue today? And, I guess, more importantly as you bring to market the 7-nanometer GPU part, how are you thinking about exploiting that in the data center and the TAM expectations, or revenue expectations we should have over the next four quarters to eight quarters? Yeah, so on the GPU side, there's no question that the demand for GPUs in the data center are growing very quickly, even faster than on the CPU side for sure. And our data center engagements, our focus on the GPU side is very cloud-centric. So large customers, places where our GPU capability can be well-targeted. I would say, the size of the business is still small, so we are growing, but it is still small. But there's lots of interest in our current generation MI25 and there's even more interest in our 7-nanometer Vega GPU that's coming to market later this year.
So we expect an opportunity to grow that segment over the next four quarters to eight quarters. And as you can see in the market, overall, the GPU segment is growing quite a bit in data centers. And so we'll continue to invest heavily in this area. Appreciate it. Thank you. Thanks, John. Next question, please, operator? Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to just start with the clarification and then I have a follow-up. What's the assumption for blockchain revenue in Q3 and for the full year? And just if you have an updated view of overall 2018 sales growth? Yeah, sure, Vivek. So let me take that, and then Devinder can add if necessary. So for Q2, we were approximately 6% of revenue for blockchain. For Q3, we're planning very little blockchain. So we expected it to be down in the second half, but we're planning very little in Q3. So if you update that on a full-year basis for 2018 blockchain will be lower than what we had previously discussed in the last earnings call. So I would say previously we said mid- to high-single-digits. I think this would more on the mid-single-side. And we'll continue to watch the market develop over the next couple of quarters. All right. And then, Lisa, have you seen any competitive response from Intel so far in either PCs or servers. For example, some of your desktop parts saw some ASP decline. Was it just mix or price competition? Or anything else that we should keep in mind? Yeah, sure, Vivek. So let me take each of the segments separately. So if you look at the PC segment, what we have seen is basically a ramping of our product portfolio. Certainly in desktop, we had some mix here in the second quarter where we increased the percentage of the APUs that were being sold into the desktop channel segment. And so you saw a little bit of a mix to a bit softer desktop ASPs. But overall, when I look overall, I would say that the competitive situation is about what I would expect. There is product competition and we see that.
We do ensure that there is good transition of products. So when we moved from our first generation Ryzen to our second generation Ryzen, we had some channel programs to make sure that we managed channel inventory on the first generation. But we've seen nothing that I would call unusual.
On the notebook side, actually, I'm pretty please because we're really seeing the notebook side of the business pick up. And so mobile ASPs were up, the percentage of Ryzen units in mobile were up and we see that continuing into the second half of the year.
And then on the EPYC side, again, I would say that the competition is really product-based. And for us, there are some workload optimization that we do with customers. But I haven't seen anything that's unusual relative to the pricing environment. And, in fact, as EPYC ramps, our ASPs are going up. All right. And one last quick one, if I may. When should we expect to see the breakout quarter for EPYC, Lisa? Will that be Q3, Q4, what's the visibility around that? I think we are very focused on ensuring we deliver that mid-single-digit unit share at the end of 2018. I think as we go into the second half of the year, I would still see it as fourth quarter would be a real important quarter for us. I think we'll see ramps into third quarter. And the key is as you know with some of these cloud partners, it's actually important when they actually ramp these larger instances. And so lots of visibility into work being done and the exact timing will depend on our customers' ramps. Okay. Thanks very much. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Good afternoon. Thank you. Lisa, a couple of questions on the server business and then I'll follow up on a couple of PC things. In server, you guys have laid out the mid-singles unit share number by the end of this year. And maybe you could walk us through that with a little bit of granularity, like how do you balance what seems to be really high demand within the cloud customer base for Rome versus pushing volumes in the near term of Naples? And I think some folks have asked a couple of questions around process node, and you're obviously sampling already with Rome. So maybe could be explicit about where you're manufacturing that? Thank you. Yeah, sure. So a couple of different questions here, Matt. On the EPYC, your question is Naples versus Rome and how we manage that. Look, our focus from a sales and go-to-market standpoint right now is on Naples. First generation EPYC, we have a lot of platforms in market, over 50 platforms in market. There are a lot of customers that have systems in their labs, going through various stages of qualification, and we're very focused on supporting that and ensuring that we see that ramp into the second half of the year.
Rome is really a 2019 story. I think the good part about it is I expect that customers perhaps took a little bit longer in their initial qualification and work around Naples. And our hope is that as we go into Rome, you see those qualification timelines tighten up a little bit. But no question that for 2018, it's a Naples story, and there's a lot of customer interest around Rome. And we will manage that. But we want to make sure that we also do as much of the validation work on our side before we sample too broadly. I think the good news is there's a lot of interest, and it's really just on us to execute cleanly through the next couple of quarters.
And Matt, you had some other questions? Or... Yeah. The last there on server was about manufacturing for Rome. And then, just talk about one thing on the PC side, particularly notebooks, one of the questions I'm getting most often from investors is as the product portfolio from AMD improves dramatically, and I think well, again, as you guys go to 7-nanometer, it seems like winning sell-in share with OEMs is something that you guys have a bit of control of.
But I wanted ask a little bit about sell-through and consumer adoption and mind share around your client products. Intel has wound down some of the Intel Inside marketing program, and I know maybe you have some opportunities there. Maybe you could talk about some of the steps that their marketing team is making to maybe change and refresh some of the consumer perception of the products relative to how quickly they've improved fundamentally? Thank you. Yes. Absolutely. So, Matt, on your first question relative to the manufacturing of the second generation of EPYC, so as I said earlier, we are working with both the TSMC and GLOBALFOUNDRIES in 7-nanometer. As for the 7-nanometer Rome that we're currently sampling, that's being manufactured at TSMC. And then your second question about where we are in the PSPC market, sell-in versus sell-out share, actually it's a great question. It's a great question. And when I look at the PC market, we have great relationships with the OEMs.
You can see it from the number of platforms that we have out there. But there's no question that there's opportunity for us to get the consumer perception and the commercial enterprise perception up. And so we've been very focused on that. And that comes with additional investment in go-to-market expenses.
So getting the Ryzen brand out there, getting the Radeon brand out there, it includes additional training at some key retailers to ensure that they know how to sell Ryzen and they know what the value proposition is. And what we see is some clear signs of early momentum in sell-out. So as our platforms launched here in the month of June, we actually saw quite a few of the outlets that they actually sold out of our product. And we've had to restock that here quickly.
And as we go into the second half of the year, I think you'll see in both back-to-school and in holiday globally that we have a larger presence of assortment than we have had in the past. So that's a clear focus for us in the PC market. Okay. Thank you very much. Thanks, Matt. Thanks, Matt. Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I wanted ask about Ryzen share. I thought I heard you say that Ryzen was 60% of your CPU revenues in the quarter. I thought that's what you said it was last quarter as well. So how do I reconcile that with the other color around the sequential growth of Ryzen into Q2? Yeah, so, Stacy, it was approximately 60%. And when you look at it on a quarter-on-quarter basis, we had more units overall in desktop and notebook. Particularly, in notebook, we saw an acceleration of Ryzen mobile units in the notebook. So it's an approximate number, it's not an exact number, but it's approximately 60%. We also saw some legacy business increase, and that's why you see that. Okay. So basically, it was maybe like a little below 60% before and like a little above 60% now but kind of around 60%? In that range, exactly. Okay. For my second question, you said you had EPYC up more than 50% sequentially. So I think it doubled last quarter; it's up 50% this quarter. But is there any – I think you're still running, call it, 1%, maybe a little – kind of in that ballpark of share. So if you're going to get 5% exiting the year, you got to probably triple or more the current run rate by Q4. And I know you had mentioned earlier that Q4 was going to be a kind of like an important quarter. Is that the kind of, I guess, ramp rate or run rate you're actually thinking about this EPYC business into the back half of the year in order to meet your targets? Yes, Stacy. I think we view an acceleration as we go into the second half of the year, particularly as some of these guys go into larger production. But yes, there are significant number more units. I think we just see a pipeline that can accomplish that. Got it. Just one quick housekeeping. Just why did the accounts receivable go up so much? Devinder? I didn't get the question, Stacy? I'm sorry. Accounts receivable and why did they go up so much. Accounts receivable. Yeah, it went up – primarily it's higher revenue and timing of collections, so that's the main reason. In addition, there was an increase in this, associated with unbilled AR for Semi-Custom revenue which, as you know, is recognized under ASC 606. Those parts have not shipped, but they get recognized as revenue. And that sits as unbilled AR under the AR line. Got it. Thank you, guys. Thanks, Stacy. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Great. Thank you. Wondering if you could talk a little bit about the Chinese JV and the product that's being developed there that you've licensed. Can you talk about when you expect to see that product emerge? And how do you think about that sort of AMD proper competing with the JV within those Chinese customers? Are you agnostic to who wins, or just how should we think about that? Sure, Joe. So we did start this Chinese JV a couple of years ago, and the whole idea was to get more share in the domestic China market. The partnership has gone well. The product development is going well. We view the product as complementary to our current portfolio. So I think from that standpoint, we will continue to sell AMD EPYC into the China market. And then, for certain domestic China applications, I think the China JV product will be available. They have not yet announced the exact timing of that. So I'll wait until the official announcement of it. But so far, it's gone as expected. And I think the product development has gone quite well. Great. Thank you very much. Thank you, Joe. Next question? Our next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann with Rosenblatt Securities. Please proceed with your question. Thank you. Lisa, a couple of questions. The timing of the Ryzen version of 7-nanometer after EPYC, when will that happen in 2019? Is that the quarter after or six months? Just the timing. And then the second question is how many of the mega data center guys are you actually engaged with at the moment? Thanks. Yeah, okay. So, Hans, on the timing of the 7-nanometer Ryzen, I would just keep it as it's after the 7-nanometer EPYC. So we'll launch 7-nanometer EPYC first. I wouldn't say, it's very far out, but I would say it's after. And then, in terms of mega data centers, we are engaged with all of them in some way, shape or form across CPU and GPU. On the CPU standpoint, I would say, we are heavily engaged with five. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Question. Just again, on EPYC, you were very clear that it was going to be about four quarters in qualification before your customers would start deployment. With EPYC 2, are there any programs in place? Or can we expect that it'd be a shorter amount of time before that could be deployed? Yes, Kevin. So I believe – and, of course, we'll have to see how this plays out. But I think with EPYC, there were some customers who waited for us to completely qualify before they started, let's call it, their own evals and that's to be understood because we were returning to the market. I think with the second generation of EPYC, one would expect that there would be some customers who would do, let's call it, parallel qualifications with our own qualifications.
And so I think there is an opportunity to overlap some of that work and certainly that's part of the reason that we've started early sampling as early as we have to try to parallelize some of that activity. Okay. Great. And on the GPU traction you're getting in the data center, is there a high attach rate with your EPYC processors? Or is that just an independent traction? I would say, at the moment for 2018-type revenue, they are independent engagements at the moment. I think as we move into the 7-nanometer node with both EPYC and our Vega 7-nanometer, there will be more of an attach rate and there is more interest, frankly, in that attach. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Yeah, thanks for taking the question. How should we think about OpEx growth over the next several quarters? It seems like you've been growing OpEx in the 20%-plus range. Should that moderate going forward? Or should we expect that to stay relatively stable? I think the first thing is if you look at our model that we've laid out, we've set the long-term target model to stay within the range of 26% to 30%. This year, with the revenue guide that we've given in the mid-20s, we are guiding to about 28% OpEx to revenue. Year-over-year basis, you're right, we have increased it and largely those increases have been in R&D.
If you look on the first half of 2017 to the first half of 2018, OpEx is up, but is largely weighted towards the R&D side. We are pleased with the operating leverage that we are getting from a company standpoint with the increase in revenue, but at the same time targeted investments vary heavily in the product roadmaps. And some of the things that you heard Lisa just talked about from the products and all of the multiple levers that we have to increase revenue, we are definitely investing in those areas. Great. And as a follow-up, Lisa, it's been a little bit over a year since you laid out your long-term financial model. I realize crypto has been sort of a tailwind since then. But is it fair to say that you guys are on track to hit the $0.75 and above EPS number, ex-crypto? Yes. I think, Tosh, if you look at the long-term financial model and put aside temporal things, we feel that we are on track towards that long-term financial model. In some places, we are ahead. In some places, we are on track. But, overall, I think we feel good about where we are towards the long-term financial model. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Hello. This is Wayne Loeb for Chris Danely. Thank you for taking my call. What kind of performance improvement will 7-nanometer EPYC have over the current one? Yeah, Wayne, I think we're not yet getting into details of what the performance improvement is of the 7-nanometer EPYC. So I think we'll have more details on the architecture and where we are in performance later this year. Okay. As a follow-up, you talked about your goal of mid-single-digit share for EPYC by the end of the year. Exiting the year, what do you think your share would be in desktops and notebooks? I think we'll continue to make progress in desktops and notebooks. In particular, I think, we expect that the notebook share will increase as we go into the second half of the year. Obviously, the PC market overall is doing a little bit better than most people expected. And so we'll have to see how the market does. But from our standpoint, we don't have a specific share target out there for end of this year. We believe we'll continue to gain share based on what we see in design wins at this point. Thank you very much. Thanks, Wayne. Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital. Please proceed with your question. Hi. Thank you very much, Lisa. I had a – and I'm sorry if you addressed it earlier on the call. What is the timing for the 7-nanometer GPU? And then my related question on GPU is could you just update us on what's the progress on the software ecosystem? Specifically, in competition with the moat, seemingly huge moat than NVIDIA has built with CUDA. Thank you. Sure, Ambrish. So our 7-nanometer GPU started sampling here in the second quarter and we will launch it later this year. So it will launch – we expect it to launch in 2018.
As it relates to the software ecosystem, we're making good progress. We're making incremental progress each quarter. And the important thing and the reason – our strategy right now in GPUs in the data center is to engage with large cloud guys who have the ability to work with us, and in some sense we're focusing our software efforts on their needs first. And that allows us to do this vertical by vertical. So I think we're making good progress. It's a multi-year effort and we are very clear that it's a multiyear effort. But we have seen some initial positive momentum and we're going to continue to invest in this space. So it's the number one investment priority for us. So in data center, Lisa, sorry, just a quick follow-up. What areas have you been able to gain traction within the – and it's a pretty large area within machine learning, where specifically have you been able to let yourself in? Thank you. Yes, again, we're working with several cloud vendors on key applications in their data center. Thanks, Ambrish. Operator, we have time for two more questions, please. No problem. Our next question comes from line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Yeah. Thank you for taking questions, also congratulations on the quarter. I apologize to continue to go back to EPYC. But just curious as we think about the ramp, you've mentioned that you have over 50 platforms now in the market. I'm just curious if you were asked to characterize how many of those were shipping in volume, and what your expectation would be through the course of the remainder of this year in terms of those turning into true meaningful volumes? Yeah. So I'm thinking about that. I would say, a number of those platforms, a large majority of those platforms are shipping to multiple customers. So volume, of course, is all relative. And the way we count platforms are obviously platforms from the OEMs as well as platforms from ODMs and a number of the cloud guys are doing their own platforms, more specific platforms.
So I would say, a large number of those, the majority of those would have our shipping to multiple customers, and production sort of the scale of the production is what is customer-dependent. So some of them are in hundreds of units, some of them are in thousands of units, some of them are in tens of thousands of units and different scales of numbers. Okay. Fair enough. And then, as a quick follow-up. As we think about the ramp of some of your new platforms going forward, and we tie that to your long-term gross margin target of – I think it was 40% to 44%, can you just remind us again of how we can think about the mix in terms of the margin profile of some of the new businesses ramping? And how quickly maybe we should consider that 40%-plus targeted gross margin? Well, we're guiding the third quarter to 38% gross margin. That's largely on the strength of new product portfolio. I think what we said before, and which still holds is our Ryzen, our EPYC, our Radeon data center products are all in aggregate over 50% from a gross margin standpoint. So they're well above the corporate average. I think we're starting to see the mix and that margin accretion of the new products. And so we'll continue to do that over the next couple of quarters. So I guess, it's fair to assume... Did that answer your question? Yeah, I guess, I'm just trying to – I guess, given the commentary around the fourth quarter and EPYC really that being an important quarter, could we assume that gross margin from here continues to trend higher? Well, I think it's fair to say that as we go into the second half of the year, our new products will be a larger percentage of our overall product revenue. And that is positive from a margin standpoint. Great. Thank you very much. Our final question comes from line of Tim Arcuri with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Thank you. I had two. I guess, when I look at the stock, there is no – I'm not sure there's a lot of data about the share gain targets this year. But maybe there is some question about the ability to sustain those targets next year and the year after. So I guess, the question – first question is what are you doing differently this time that was not done in the Opteron cycle? Are you giving your customers more visibility to your roadmap? Thank you. Tim, I think the major thing that we're doing differently as a company and certainly around EPYC is we are doing what we said we were going to do. We laid out a five-year roadmap for what we wanted to do in servers. We told them what first-generation EPYC would look like. It came out a little bit better than they expected.
We told them when to expect second generation EPYC and what we were trying to do that. And I'm really pleased to say that we are exactly on track to what we said we were going to do. And we have a third-generation behind that. So our focus is to execute really, really well and provide customers a differentiation in the value proposition to consider us as a long-term partner. We are not after what happens over the next two quarters. This is extraordinarily – it's a journey for us with EPYC. And I think we feel good about what we've done. And the entire team is focused on delivering what we said we were going to do. Got it, Lisa. Thank you for that. And then, I guess just the last question is really around the strategic foundry roadmap beyond 7-nanometer. Clearly, you have a lead now that because Intel is going to really I think functionally skip over 10-nanometer, which is great, and maybe it's a little bit unexpected given when you began development of these parts. But how do you think strategically beyond 7-nanometer as you move to 5-nanometer with your partner? And where Intel will be at that time? Thank you. What we see in the foundry roadmap is actually a very nice cadence of technologies. So we do believe 7-nanometer will be a large node. There will be derivatives of 7-nanometer, 7-nanometer, 7-nanometer plus. We have seen the first view of 5-nanometer, and we think 5-nanometer is very competitive as well. So again, our goal is to use the best the process technology can offer in the foundry market, and then differentiate on architecture, and product positioning, and those kinds of things. Thank you very much, Tim. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the call back to Laura Graves for closing remarks. Thank you, operator, and everyone who joined our call today for the Q&A, thank you very much. We appreciate your time, and we'll speak to you again soon. This concludes today's teleconference.

Participants on today's conference call are Dr. Lisa Su, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Devinder Kumar, our Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer. This is a live call, and will be replayed via webcast on our website.
I would like to highlight some important dates for you. AMD's next Horizon event is scheduled for Tuesday, November 6, 2018, where we will discuss innovation of AMD products and technologies, specifically designed for the datacenter on industry-leading 7-nanometer process technology. Dr. Lisa Su, President and Chief Executive Officer, will present at the Credit Suisse 22nd Annual Technology Media & Telecom Conference on Tuesday, November 27. And our 2018 fourth quarter quiet time will begin at the close of business on Friday, December 14.
Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions, and expectations; speak only as of the current date; and as such, involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations.
We will refer primarily to non-GAAP financial measures during this call except for revenue, gross margin, and segment operational results, which are on a GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures referenced today are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in today's press release posted on our website. Please refer to the cautionary statements in our press release for more information. You will also find detailed discussions about our risk factors in our filings with the SEC and, in particular, AMD's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2018.
Now, with that, I will hand the call over to Lisa. Lisa? Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. We executed well in the third quarter. We continued to build momentum for our new products as strong sales of our Ryzen and EPYC processors offset soft GPU channel sales, and drove our fifth consecutive quarter of year-on-year revenue growth, increased profitability and margin expansion.
Third quarter revenue was $1.65 billion, an increase of 4% from a year ago. Looking at our Computing and Graphics segment, third quarter CG segment revenue increased 12% year-on-year, driven by significant growth in both client processor and OEM GPU sales that offset a larger-than-expected decline in channel GPU sales.
Ryzen processor sales increased to more than 70% of our total client revenue in the quarter. We delivered our highest processor unit shipment in nearly four years, and believe we gained desktop and notebook client processor unit share in the quarter, driven by growth with both OEMs and in the channel. In desktop, we had strong demand for our higher end Ryzen 7, Ryzen 5 and Ryzen Threadripper processors, helping to drive a double-digit percentage year-over-year and sequential improvement in client processor ASP.
We expanded our desktop offerings in the quarter, bringing our Zen processor core and Vega Graphics to the entry level part of the market with the Athlon APU, and launching our flagship 32-core Threadripper 2 processor. With these new introductions, we now have a top to bottom lineup of client processors, based on our high-performance Zen architecture.
In notebooks, Ryzen mobile processor unit shipments doubled sequentially for the second straight quarter as OEMs ramped production of their latest AMD-based notebooks. 54 of the 60 Ryzen processor-based notebooks planned for 2008 [ph] have launched with the final notebooks expected to go on sale this quarter. Based on the success of first-generation Ryzen mobile notebooks, the expanded breadth of our customer engagements and our design win momentum, we are on track for an even larger assortment of AMD-powered notebooks in 2019.
In graphics, the year-over-year revenue decrease was primarily driven by significantly lower channel GPU sales, partially offset by improved OEM and datacenter GPU sales. Channel GPU sales came in lower than expected based on excess channel inventory levels, caused by the decline in blockchain-related demand that was so strong earlier in the year. OEM GPU sales in the third quarter increased by a strong double-digit percentage year-over-year as new design wins began to ramp, including first shipments of our mobile Vega GPUs to support new premium notebooks launching this quarter.
In professional graphics, revenue increased by a double-digit percentage from a year ago driven by datacenter GPU sales, as we continued to gain traction in this important part of the market. We launched the Radeon Pro WX 8200 GPU for workstations in the quarter, delivering the world's best workstation graphics performance under $1,000 on real-time visualization, VR, and photorealistic editing workloads.
We remain on track to launch the industry's first 7-nanometer datacenter GPU this quarter. Customer interest in the product is strong based on its performance and differentiated feature set, and we have already secured multiple datacenter wins with shipments expected to begin in the fourth quarter. We continue to increase investments in GPU hardware and software to deliver industry-leading products that we believe will drive growth in the gaming, professional, and datacenter markets.
Turning to our Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom segment, third quarter revenue decreased 5% year-on-year, primarily based on semi-custom sales declining, as expected, as current generation consoles enter their sixth year. In server, we delivered our third straight quarter of strong double-digit percentage sequential revenue and unit shipment growth. We are seeing the largest demand for our top of the stack 24 and 32-core EPYC processors, which combine industry-leading core counts and I/O to deliver performance advantages across cloud, virtualization, and HPC workloads.
We continue to accelerate engagements with our cloud service providers, highlighted by yesterday's announcement that Oracle launched new AMD-powered instances that offer significant TCO and performance advantages on general purpose cloud workloads in Oracle applications. We expect additional Tier 1 cloud service providers to announce availability of new EPYC processor deployments this quarter.
We secured multiple new customer wins on the HPC front, including Microsoft's announcement, they would offer an EPYC processor based supercomputing instance; and that Haas Racing has chosen Cray to build an EPYC-powered supercomputer to improve their computational fluid dynamics modeling for future cars.
Turning to enterprise adoption, we continue to build a strong pipeline and accelerate the ongoing ramps of EPYC-based offerings from the major OEMs, including Cisco, Dell and HP Enterprise. In the third quarter, we added dozens of new end customers across oil and gas, healthcare, aerospace, banking and other industries, based on the superior performance of EPYC processors in both data analytics and general purpose virtualized workloads.
We began sampling our next generation Rome server chip broadly across our customer base in the third quarter. And the feedback on this leadership product is very strong. As a result, cloud and OEM customers are engaging earlier, deeper, and more collaboratively with us on both Rome, and our long-term data center roadmap. We remain on track to exit the year with mid-single-digit server unit market share based on cloud customer adoption. And based on our strong competitive position and broad customer engagements, we believe we can achieve double-digit server unit share with Rome.
In closing, 2018 remains an inflection point for AMD, as we expect to exit the year with well over 50% of our revenue coming from new products, driving significant margin expansion. The foundational changes we have made across the business to strengthen our execution and the investments we have made to deliver a leadership Computing and Graphics roadmap are paying off.
Our current generations of high performance CPUs and GPUs are doing very well in market, putting us on track to increase profitability, grow revenue and expand margin for the second straight year. We see significant opportunities to build on this momentum as we transition to our next generations of high performance products and launch the industry's first 7-nanometer x86 CPUs and discrete GPUs over the coming quarters.
Demand for our high performance computing offerings remains strong, and our product portfolio and competitive positioning are getting stronger. We remain focused on executing our strategy and delivering our leadership product roadmap.
Now, I would like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our third quarter financial performance. Devinder? Thank you, Lisa. Good afternoon, everyone. Q3 was a good quarter for AMD, as revenue, operating margin and earnings per share grew year-over-year. Gross margin was 40%, highlighted by the continuing ramp of our new Ryzen and EPYC products. We strengthened the balance sheet, reduced long-term debt by $97 million and further improved our gross leverage.
Quarterly revenue of $1.65 billion was up 4% year-over-year, driven by higher Computing and Graphics segment revenue, with higher client revenue more than offsetting lower graphics revenue. Third quarter revenue, including (sic) [included] (11:26) IP-related revenue, of which $86 million was related to our THATIC joint venture.
Gross margin was 40%, up 390 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by the ramp of new products, including Ryzen and EPYC processors. On a sequential basis, gross margin was up 280 basis points, primarily driven by IP-related revenue and the ramp of new products. Excluding IP-related revenue and memory and inventory-related adjustments, third quarter gross margin would have been 2 percentage points lower.
Operating expenses grew 12% year-over-year to $476 million, driven by R&D investments in our product roadmaps and incremental go-to-market investments. Operating income grew to $186 million from $148 million a year ago. Operating margin was 11%, and both business segments recorded double-digit operating margin percentage. Net income was $150 million compared to $100 million a year ago. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, using a diluted share count of 1.177 billion, was $0.13, compared to $0.09 per share a year ago.
Now, turning to the business segment results. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $938 million, up 12% year-over-year. Revenue growth was driven primarily by strong Ryzen product sales as we expanded our client compute offerings in the quarter. Ryzen products accounted for more than 70% of client revenue, up from approximately 60% last quarter, as we saw strength in both desktop and notebook offerings across OEM and channel partners. In graphics, channel GPU sales were down year-over-year, partially offset by strong Radeon, datacenter and OEM GPU demand.
For comparative purposes, third quarter 2017 blockchain-related GPU sales were approximately high-single digit percent of overall AMD revenue, while blockchain revenue in the third quarter of this year was negligible.
Computing and Graphics segment operating income was $100 million or 11% of segment revenue compared to operating income of $73 million a year ago. The increase was primarily driven by a richer client product mix and IP-related revenue, partially offset by lower graphics revenue.
Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom revenue was $715 million, down 5% year-over-year. The year-over-year revenue decrease was driven primarily by lower semi-custom product and IP-related revenue, partially offset by higher server sales. For the third quarter in a row, EPYC processor units and revenue grew by strong double digits percentages quarter-over-quarter. EESC operating income was $86 million or 12% of segment revenue. This is up from operating income of $74 million a year ago, primarily due to a richer server and semi-custom product mix.
Turning to the balance sheet, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $1.06 billion at the end of the quarter, and we generated free cash flow of $62 million. Inventory was down sequentially from $750 million to $738 million. Total principal debt was $1.6 billion as we reduced our long-term debt by $97 million in the quarter. Term debt due in March 2019 is down to $66 million, and beyond that, there are no term debt maturities until 2022.
Adjusted EBITDA was $227 million compared to $184 million a year ago, and on a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted EBITDA was $709 million, resulting in gross debt leverage of 2.2 times.
Now, turning to our financial outlook, for the fourth quarter 2018, AMD expects revenue to be approximately $1.45 billion plus or minus $50 million. This would be an increase of approximately 8% year-over-year driven by sales growth of Ryzen, EPYC and datacenter GPU products. For comparative purposes, Q4 2017 revenue was $1.34 billion, adjusted for the ASC 606 revenue accounting standard, and included blockchain-related GPU sales of approximately low-double digit percent of overall AMD revenue. Sequentially, the midpoint of third quarter revenue outlook would be a decrease of approximately 12% driven primarily by lower semi-custom sales.
In addition, for Q4 2018, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 41%, up from 34% in the prior year, driven by the ramp of Ryzen, EPYC and datacenter GPU processors. Non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $465 million. Non-GAAP interest expense taxes and other to be approximately $30 million and free cash flow to be positive. For the full year 2018, we continue to expect annual revenue growth of mid-20s percent and to be free cash flow positive, and we now expect non-GAAP gross margin in excess of 38%.
In closing, the third quarter was a good quarter as we continued to ramp our new products. This momentum is driving improvement in our financial results against a backdrop of expanding customer demand as we prepare to ship and launch our first 7-nanometer GPU products before the end of the year. We are executing on our strategy and investment in financial priorities as we continue making excellent progress towards our long term target financial model.
With that, I'll turn it back to Laura for the question-and-answer session. Laura? Thank you, Devinder. Operator, we're ready for our first question. Certainly. Our first question today is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First question, if I may, Lisa, as you look into the fourth quarter and maybe discuss also the third quarter, can you just review the important puts and takes on the revenues, on the microprocessor and GPU side separately? And I know you don't like to discuss the competition, but I think there's some unique things going on in the competitive environment. I think there's a view that Intel's capacity constrained and with Nvidia's new product launches, how is that impacting how we should be thinking about the revenues? Thank you. Yes. Hi, Mark. Thanks for the question. So, let me take those in order here. So, if we just look at the third quarter revenue, I would say that we did see a shift in our revenue mix as we went through the third quarter. Looking at the individual product lines, we had expected that the client business would be strong as we were ramping quite a few new notebook OEM systems as well as we had strong desktop product portfolio. And we saw the client business was strong. It was actually probably a bit stronger than we expected. The server business also performed quite well.
In the graphics business, we had our OEM and datacenter compute business performing well, but we did see the softness in the channel that was larger than we expected, and that was due to some of the channel inventory comments that I made earlier.
Now, as you shift into the fourth quarter, I think what we see is that our fourth quarter revenue mix really mixes towards the new products. And so, what you see in the product lines are, you'd see that client business continue to grow. And client is usually seasonally down into the fourth quarter, so we're doing better than seasonality with the client business. We expect the server business to grow as well as we get more traction with our EPYC products, especially in the cloud.
And then, we would expect, with our graphics business, that that will also grow sequentially, primarily on the strength of new products around our datacenter GPUs. And the semi-custom business actually will decline sequentially. The semi-custom business always declines in the fourth quarter. I would say this fourth quarter is a bit more pronounced; it gets a bit more pronounced as we get later in the cycle, as well as the fact that the ASC 606 accounting regulations tended to pull some of the revenue earlier in the year. But hopefully, that gives you a view of sort of the puts and takes around revenue. That's very helpful. And a follow-up, if I may, I think I heard Devinder say that you're expecting to ship EPYC 2 before the end of this year. And if I think back to a dozen years ago, when you had the second generation of server product, that kind of signaled an opportunity an inflection in the revenues. How should we think about EPYC 2 as we go into early next year? And what does EPYC 2 bring to your customers that EPYC did not? Thank you. Yeah. So, Mark, maybe just a correction. I think Devinder's comment was that our 7-nanometer GPU would ship here in the fourth quarter. We're on track to launch that here shortly. The second generation of EPYC, our 7-nanometer CPU, will ship in 2019. We are broadly sampling it now. I think from what we see, the performance is very competitive. And also many of our customers have had a chance to really spend time with the first generation of EPYC, get to learn our architecture and do much of the platform bring-up.
So, we're excited about what the second generation of EPYC can do for us. We're going to talk a little bit more about that in a couple weeks at our datacenter event, but we believe that our competitive position gets stronger as we get into 2019. Thanks for the clarification. Thanks, Mark. Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Hans Mosesmann from Rosenblatt Securities. Your line is now live. Thanks. Hey, Lisa, can you give us the puts and takes – or Devinder or both – on the gross margin dynamic in Q3? And also in Q4, is there an IP component in Q4? And I have a follow-up. Thanks. Sure. Maybe let me start, and then Devinder can add. So, on the gross margin for the third quarter, I think we were up 4% year-on-year. We did have an IP component in this year as we had an IP component in the third quarter of last year. The majority of the improvement though was due to the positive product mix, sort of the client and server business really growing year-on-year, and with that, improving the product mix.
As we go into the fourth quarter, there is no IP-related revenue that's planned right now. So, with the guide at 41% margin, we really are at the, let's call it, the low end of our long-term guidance. And, again, that's on the strength of the product mix. It's a very positive product mix for us. The processor business, as we've always said, the new products are accretive to margin. And so, the client business is expected to grow. The server business is expected to grow. The datacenter GPUs are expected to grow. And then, there is a portion of that, that is the semi-custom business declining sequentially. But I would say that's a smaller portion. It's really the positive product mix that's going into the Q4 guide.
Maybe, Devinder, is there anything you wanted to add? No. I think you covered it, Lisa. Thank you. Great. And then, the follow-up – if you don't mind a follow-up, as we look into early 2019, what can we expect in terms of seasonality for the semi-custom part of the business and on the PC side, just because there's some constraints out there from Intel and so on? Thanks. Yeah, so, look, if you – Hans, our typical seasonality is the second half of the year is stronger than the first half of the year. As we go into 2019, you would expect that the semi-custom business will be down relative to this year. And then, you would expect that we're still going to need a bit of time to work through some of this graphics channel inventory that we have. But on the positive side, we do see strength in our processor business in both the client and the server side.
As it relates to the current supply environment, we did see some pockets of constraints in the supply chain around PCs. We saw that towards the end of the third quarter. We are increasing our production such that we can satisfy some of that demand. And I think that's a short-term statement. But I think on a mid-term statement, it's an environment where we're partnering very closely with our OEMs to make sure their requirements are met. Okay. Thank you. Thanks, Hans. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Matt Ramsay from Cowen & Company. Your line is now live. Thank you. Good afternoon. Lisa, I wanted to follow up a little bit on the last, I guess, couple of sentences in your prior answer there. There is a lot of things moving in the model near term, but as we think about how you're positioning the company in the client business over the next, I don't know, 24 months or so, with some supply constraints at Intel and some changes in their marketing support for OEMs for some of those programs and their spending. How do you think about how you're positioned with the key top five or six OEMs in terms of both PC and, I guess, desktop and notebook over the next 24 months? And sort of what are the puts and takes of how much you're really willing to lean into that business in order to gain unit share? Thank you. Yes, Matt, thanks for the question. So, on the PC business, particularly around client processors, I am bullish on that business. It's a good business for us. Our products are very well positioned, when you look at both the desktop and notebook segments. It was important for us to get these new platforms out into the market, and so we have 54 new notebook platforms out in the market with a few more to go, as we finish up here the fourth quarter. I think the traction that we see in terms of unit shipments, the metric around Ryzen being 70% of our client business, over 70%, and we expect that to continue to accelerate. So, we're bullish on the client business as a good business for us to grow over the next 12 to 24 months. Got it. That's helpful. And just as a follow-up, I understand in a couple weeks you'll probably be talking a bit more about the datacenter GPU portfolio. But I guess there has been a lot of movement in software ecosystem as you've been working, and the team has to develop the MI-Open product in terms of software. Maybe you could give us a little bit of an update on how you feel that's positioned for Caffe and Tensor, which I guess are the two key development environments for AI, and what do you think the long-term prospects for that business are over the next couple of years. Thank you. Yes. So, on the datacenter GPU business, this will continue to be an area of investment for us. I think we've made very nice progress this year. I think as we finish up the year, we expect it to again make good progress. We have invested in both the hardware and the software side, so I think the 7-nanometer GPU starting shipments here in the fourth quarter is important for us. And on the software side, yes, we will also be updating the status of our software environment.
I think the nice thing is, as we said, the datacenter is just an enormous opportunity whether you're talking about CPUs or GPUs, and we're engaging deeply with cloud customers, who are spending the time and the resources to optimize to our architecture. So, again, I think a datacenter tends to take longer from design win to revenue, but we're starting to see some nice signals there. All right. Thanks very much. Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Mitch Steves from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I had two of them really quick. The first is actually on the CPU side, the server side. So, is there any reason why a 10-nanometer chip wouldn't be able to outperform your 7-nanometer product, given that you've already been able to do some of the testing on the server side? Maybe I would answer the question this way. When we look at our 7-nanometer product and its positioning in 2019 across the server landscape, we feel very good about the positioning. I think it's not just 7-nanometer, 7-nanometer is important, but we've also made some significant changes to the architecture as well as how – sort of the system. So, I think, overall, we feel with the design and process capabilities, that our 7-nanometer products will be quite competitive. Got it. And then, secondly, in terms of production, I know you guys kind of gave out the mid-singles and double-digit market share opportunity in the server side. So, is that due to capacity constraints at TSMC or is that due to your own estimates of what type of share you think you can get? Well, we have a great relationship with TSMC. I think they're very supportive of our roadmap in 7-nanometer. So, it's not due to any supply constraints. It's just due to the time that we believe it will take for vendors to really qualify new systems. Got it. And just one last really small one for me, the graphics business, the highest blockchain or cryptocurrency quarter was Q1 of 2018, is that correct? The highest – it was between Q4 and Q1. They were pretty close. Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrell Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Thanks for taking my question. For the first one, Lisa, can you help us kind of quantify how much of a headwind was that excess graphics inventory in Q3 and maybe also in Q4, so we can reconcile some of the differences between what you're reporting and guiding versus some of the consensus expectations out there? Yeah. Sure, Vivek. So, the best thing I can say is when we look at the CG segment as a segment, we're down about $150 million here in the third quarter. We had expected the segment to be down, but we probably expected it to be down about $50 million or so. And if you look at that difference from when we started the quarter, that's entirely the GPU channel. We had some other puts and takes in there, but it's basically the GPU channel.
As we go into the fourth quarter, we do expect graphics to be up, and that's primarily on the strength of the datacenter GPU business. And we're modeling the channel, let's call it, roughly flattish. It's seasonally about flattish, but given some of the inventory in the channel, that's how we're modeling. Does that help you? Yes. So, basically, you're saying this problem kind of goes away in Q4 or you're done with it by now? Or can it continue to be a headwind in Q4? We are expecting that it might take a couple quarters to completely get back to, let's call it, a normal channel. However, it is factored into our Q4 guidance. All right. And then the second one, Lisa, is on the server business. You outlined the target to get to mid-single digit exiting this year. Is the next 5% share easier or tougher to get? How do you think your competitor will respond? And how important is it to ramp your 7-nanometer product next year to get towards that – to make that jump from the 5% to the next target of 10% share? Yeah, so the way I look at it, Vivek, is it's really a continuum, and the continuum is we have a number of customers that are very actively working with EPYC. I think the first 5% does include some cloud customers ramping, and that's important. And then, as we go beyond that, we would expect that they're more used to our architecture. Our architecture is socket compatible between the first and second generation. We're sampling it now. And so, I think the idea is we would like to see some acceleration in that, as we bring in the 7-nanometer product, but we'll certainly have to go through that process. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your line is now live. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I wanted to ask about graphics trajectory in the next year. I mean, given my math – I know you talked about maybe $100 million light versus your expectations, but my math suggests it might have fallen as much as $250 million sequentially, if you're going to get it at least to the level that it was last year. And if I look at what that trajectory means going forward, if I asked you whether or not you thought graphics revenues could be down 20% year-over-year in 2019, like how would you feel about that? What's your response to that? Yeah. Stacy, let me make sure I clarify the first comment, and then I'll certainly answer your comment. My comment was at the segment level. So, at the segment level, I said we were about $100 million light. And I also said that client performed a little bit better than expected. So, I think you can say that it was probably – if you – that should help quantify sort of Q3. When I look at it going forward, I would not expect that type of decline on a year-on-year basis. I think what you'll see is some funky seasonality, right? So, the first half of the year was very strong for graphics. I think the first half of 2019 will not be very strong for graphics.
But we have a number of product launches coming up, and we're pretty excited about some of those product launches. And so, I would view that – we need to work off some of this channel inventory that's in place, and then go back to sort of a more typical seasonality, which would see the second half stronger than the first. Does that help? Okay. That does help. Thank you. For my follow-up, I want to ask about the datacenter GPU. So, you've been talking a lot about that. You've actually been calling it out as driving, like, some of the growth in the current quarter and going forward. How big is that today? I mean, you're calling it out, but can you give us an order of magnitude? I mean, is it more than $20 million in the quarter at this point? Where do you see that going into Q4? Like, what are your expectations, as you ramp the 7-nanometer product into next year? You always have a way of asking the most granular questions. I would say... I don't think it's that granular. It is more than $20 million. We do see it as a driver. We do see it as more of a driver as we go into 7-nanometer. And this is one of those cases where typically the datacenter products ramp slowly, but as you know, the deployments can sometimes be lumpy. And there's good traction on some early design wins. And so, we expect it to be a meaningful contribution in Q4. Got it. And just, one more really quickly, how do you feel about your $0.75 in 2020? Are you still holding to that? There are no changes to our long-term financial model at this point. Yeah, not today. Not today. Okay. Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live. Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I just want to go back to the IP side of things. You gave some color about the fact that it's not contributing anything in the fourth quarter, and that's helpful on the gross margin side. But one other detail, Devinder or Lisa, is I think the $86 million you talked about, you said that was a portion of the IP, and then you had some other inventory related changes. Can you just give us a little bit more color on the size of those different buckets? How big was IP overall? Anything there would be helpful. Yeah, on the IP, I think as we talked about, there's $86 million that's associated with our THATIC joint venture. There was some other IP, call it, about approximately about $35 million in the quarter, and that is why we talk about it in two parts. Great. Thank you. And then as my follow-up, as I'm looking at the GPU side of things, not to kind of beat the dead horse there too much more, but the ASP side of that equation or pricing side, is the channel inventory clearing dynamic something that also manifests itself on pricing pressure? Or is it just a matter of time to absorb that inventory which, Lisa, I think you said was going to be a flat dynamic in the fourth quarter, but it sounded like it was going to be returning to a headwind in the first half of next year? Yeah, no, if that's how it sounded, that's not what I meant. So, I would say that the GPU – let's call it, the weakness in the GPU channel or primarily in the sell-in, is, let's call it, for – we might see that for the next quarter or two. But as you look through the overall business, I think gamers are still buying GPUs, and so this is really a matter of just absorbing some of the first half let's call it oversupply as it relates to GPUs. And that's translating into a bit weaker sell-in. But we are still tracking the sell-out and the sell-through through the – to the end customers. And if I could sneak in one quick one, just OpEx intensity. I know you're not going to guide for OpEx for 2019. But the 26% to 29%, how do we think about where you are in the investment stage where whether it's the EPYC or the other new products – EPYC 2, I should say or the other new products, where you kind of get over the hump and you don't need to invest as much? Is that a framework we should think about? Or do you believe the opportunities are big enough and the competitors are spending enough that, that OpEx intensity in that range is likely to persist? Well, I think, Ross, if you look on an annual basis for 2008 (sic) [2018] (40:48), we'll be approximately 28% of OpEx to revenue. And I think what we said in the past is we will grow OpEx, but we will grow it slower than revenue growth on an annual basis. And that's still our philosophy. Great. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Great. Thank you. If you said this, I may have missed it. But can you talk about how much servers grew sequentially in Q3? I guess you were fairly specific on that point in Q2. I think you said double digits this quarter. Do you expect to be sort of – as you talk about mid-single digit next quarter, are you kind of halfway to that target this quarter? Just help us calibrate where server is. Yeah, I think, Joe, it would be fair to say that with strong double digits this quarter, and we'd just say we're about halfway, I think that's reasonable, plus or minus. Okay. Great. And then with regards to the 7-nanometer, I know you're going to talk more about this as at the product launch. But can you talk about what 7-nanometer itself gives you? Do you expect there to be a higher sort of clock speed on the microprocessors and the GPUs? Is it a better transistor budget? Is it a better cost per transistor? Obviously, there's a lot of writing on you guys being early in both segments on 7-nanometer. Can you just talk about the benefits of that? Yes, and we will go through this in a lot more detail on November 6. But at a high level, I think 7-nanometer gives us better density. So, for a given system, we can put more cores on it. It gives us better power, so that gives us total cost of ownership. And it does give us better performance as well. Great. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question is coming from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live. Yeah, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Lisa, congratulations on the strong gross margin results. I just wanted some clarification. The calendar fourth quarter guidance, does that include IP revenue in the gross margin? And clearly, gross margin's being helped in December by the growth in new products, but it's probably also being helped by the sharp falloff in semi-custom. Should we think about kind of the gross margin level in December as being the new floor off of which you can continue to grow sequentially, even as semi-custom comes back seasonally? Or how do I think about that? And I have a follow-up. Yes. So, on the gross margin, [Technical Difficulty] (43:25) Q4 guidance, there is no assumed IP-related revenue. So, that's all product. We do have, as I said earlier, a very positive product mix within the processor side of the business, so the client, the server, as well as the data center GPUs. We are helped somewhat by the fact that semi-custom is down. But I would say the much larger piece of that is the product related growth in new products. Is this the new floor, Lisa, or is it too hard to tell? I don't know if I would say it's the new floor. I would say that we're very pleased that we're at the lower end of our long-term guidance. And certainly, we'll see what the puts and takes are as we go from a quarterly standpoint into 2019. But on a full year basis, in 2018, I think Devinder mentioned this in his prepared remarks, we're now over 38%. We've really grown margins every quarter over the last number of quarters and we're happy with that. I think that's the strength of the model. We've always said that the strength of the model is improving the product mix and I think that's what we see here today. And then, Lisa, I apologize, if I missed it, but just relative to your Q4 guidance, given some of the capacity issues that your competitor's having, is there any share gain – incremental share gain assumptions based upon shortages of CPUs? Is that something that should be a tailwind in Q4? Or does that take longer and might be something we don't see until the calendar first quarter? Any commentary around that would be helpful. Yeah, we do see pockets of shortages. We are ramping up production. I do believe we see some incremental benefit here in the fourth quarter. But I don't want to take away from the fact that we have a strong portfolio, and we have a lot of platforms ramping. So, the client business was always going to be up for us in Q4 and, are we benefiting a bit from let's call it some of the pockets of shortages? Perhaps. Thanks. Thank you. Thank you. Our next today is coming from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Yeah. Thank you for taking the questions. I have two, as well, if I can. I wanted to go into the semi-custom segment. And we've talked about kind of an elongated or near the end of the life in some of these gaming platforms. I was just kind of curious as to how you guys think about that piece of the business as we start to look into 2019? And is there a point in time where we can start to think about product cycles as driving reacceleration of growth in that segment? Yes. Sure. So again, without commenting on any specific design wins, what I would say is, in 2019, we will be in the seventh year of the game console cycle, and so we do expect it to be down. And if you look at the cycles, you'll see that it's very consistent with previous cycles. When we look forward, when I look at what happens beyond 2019, I like our semi-custom business. I think it's a good business for us. I think it continues to be a place where we differentiate ourselves because of our ability to customize for various customers. And I do see it growing again beyond 2019, and it will continue to be an important part of our business. Okay. And then on the channel inventory dynamic, there's a lot of kind of moving parts right now in the market, and we've seen obviously with the U.S.-China tariff situation, there's been some questions around demand pull-forward or any kind of elements around the tariff situation that's impacted demand. I'm just curious, have you seen anything from your customers that has suggested that there's been any kind of demand pull-forward and any effects on your business as it relates to U.S.-China, especially as we start to look into next year and the potential for increased tariffs further? Yes, so, we're monitoring the tariff situation very closely. There's a lot of activity around that. I would say from what we see today, we don't see anything material as it relates to the tariffs, whether it's pull-ins or just the overall impact of tariffs. But we are doing quite a bit to adjust our supply chain, as I'm sure many others are. We already had a supply chain that was highly multi-sourced, and so that's very helpful. And we're adjusting our supply chain to ensure that we have further options such that the tariffs are not a significant impact on our business. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. On the weakness in the channel-based GPUs, I'm just wondering if some of the weakness is due to the gaming bans in China? It looks like China is hindering the introduction of new games, but not sure if it's impacting actual GPU sales, and sort of the enthusiast gamer's motivation to kind of move up the stack? I don't think we see that specifically, Harlan. I think what we're seeing is more just we had very strong demand in the first half of this year. And as the supply chain filled up, we're just seeing some excess inventory that needs to be worked through right now. We're not seeing anything specific relative to that China issue you mentioned. Great. Thanks for the insights there. And then, on the wafer supply agreement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES, now that they're not going to be supporting 7-nanometer, you'll be moving I think most of your 7-nanometer client products to TSMC. And as of right now, I think you guys still need to pay them a fee for every 7-nanometer product you produce at TSMC. Can you just give us an update on the new wafer supply agreement that doesn't include 7-nanometers? Obviously, this should be beneficial for your gross margins. Yes. So, look, GLOBALFOUNDRIES is a good partner. They continue to be a very important partner for us. We are in discussions with them about how to update our agreement post their strategy updates, and we're making good progress on that. So, we'll give you more detail as we get closer, but overall, GLOBALFOUNDRIES continues to be an important partner for us. Yeah, absolutely. Thanks, Lisa. Thanks, Harlan. Operator, we have time for two more questions, please. Certainly. Our next question is coming from Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Your line is now live. Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just a question and a follow-up on THATIC, the $86 million. My understanding is you had an original agreement. You were getting an OpEx offset, and then eventually if there was product revenue, you'd recognize that revenue with your portion of your ownership on those wafers. So, I'm just kind of curious, what's this $86 million? Is it additional IP? And any color as to what it's for, if possible? Yeah, Blayne, it is related to some additional IP with THATIC. And we've completed some technology milestones in this past quarter. And so that's what that was. Got you. And then I wanted to ask you – it's been well-known that there is graphics inventory. You mentioned that graphics pricing was down. Just kind of curious your expectation for that discounting as we get into the end of the year here. What have you seen? And what are your expecting as you look into December? Yeah, we're not expecting any significant changes from an ASP standpoint, if that's what you're asking. I think what we see is the inventory just has to be worked through, and it's working through the system. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Our final question is coming from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. Great. Thank you for taking the question. I did join a little bit late, so I do apologize, if you addressed this. Lisa, I just had a question on the client CPU business and how you think about market share versus profitability going forward. Given some of the shortages near term, I'm sure you have the opportunity to pick up share, if you wanted to but perhaps at a lower gross margin. So how do you think about the client business over the next year or two? How do you balance market share versus profitability? Thank you. Sure. So, the Client business is a good business for us from a margin standpoint. And as we look forward, we look at it as an end-to-end portfolio. So, we really do have an end-to-end portfolio across notebook and desktop, and our goal is to continue to improve the profitability of that business.
As it relates to unit share, I think unit share is certainly important. We look at revenue growth overall as important for that business, but I believe we'll be able to do that at good margins and to continue on our margin path. Thank you. Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments. Thank you very much for joining our conference call today, everyone. This does conclude our call. Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.

Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the current date and as such, involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We will refer primarily to non-GAAP financial measures during this call except for revenue, gross margin and segment operational results, which are reported on a GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures referenced herein are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in today's press release, which is posted on our Web site.
Please refer to the cautionary statements in our press release for more information. You will also find detailed discussions about our risk factors in our filings with the SEC and in particular, AMD's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 29, 2018.
Now, with that, I will hand the call over to Lisa. Lisa? Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. 2018 marked another year of strong financial performance, driven by our expanded high performance product portfolio despite near-term graphics weakness. We grew annual revenue by 23% with Ryzen, EPYC and datacenter GPUs product revenue growing by more than $1.2 billion for the year. Our new products gained share and significantly expanded gross margin, leading to our most profitable year since 2011.
Looking at the fourth quarter, revenue of $1.42 billion increased 6% from a year ago with approximately 65% of sales coming from our new products. We reached an important milestone in our business in the quarter as our high margin datacenter CPUs and GPUs accounted for a mid-teens percentage of overall revenue. While we expect our data center revenues to be lumpy, the ramp of our data center business is beginning to contribute meaningfully to our financial results.
Looking at our computing and graphics segments, we delivered our eighth straight quarter of year-over-year segment revenue growth. Sales of Ryzen desktop and notebook processors and datacenter GPUs offset lower GPU sales as the channel continued working through elevated levels of graphics inventory. Client processor unit shipments grew by more than 50% from the year ago period. We had our highest client computing revenue in more than four years, and we believe we gain client CPU unit share for the fifth straight quarter.
At CES, Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Huawei, Lenovo and Samsung, all launched notebooks powered by our new second generation Ryzen mobile processor with Radeon data graphics. The second gen Ryzen mobile processor delivers more performance, enhanced features and longer battery life than any mobile processor we have ever built, and is the fastest processor available for ultrathin notebooks.
The industry's first AMD based Chromebooks launched earlier this quarter from Acer and HP. We expect additional AMD based Chromebooks to launch later this year as we expand our participation in this growing portion of the PC market. Based on the competitive positioning of our Ryzen processors, we expect the number of Ryzen systems that will launched in 2019 to increase by more than 30% in 2018 with the number of Ryzen notebook systems planned to launch increasing by more than 50%.
In graphics, GPU revenue decreased year-over-year, driven largely by lower channel GPU and memory sales, partially offset by a significant increase in data center GPU sales. We saw an improvement in channel GPU sell out throughout the quarter as our partners continued to drain their inventories. There is still more work to do, but we remain confident and we're taking the right actions to further reduce channel inventory. We set a record for professional GPU revenue in the quarter, driven by multiple high volume wins for our Vega based data centers GPUs. We started shipping our new 7-nanometer Radeon Instinct accelerators in the quarter and introduced a major set of enhancements to our data center GPU software that make it easier for customers to deploy Radeon GPUs for AI and machine learning workloads.
At CES, we highlighted the significant gain in momentum we're generating for Radeon across consoles, PCs and the cloud. For gamers and creators, we announced our return to the high end GPU market with the new Radeon VII GPU. Powered by our second generation Vega graphics core and featuring 16 gigabytes of second generation high bandwidth memory, our new 7-nanometer Radeon VII GPU delivers leadership performance in content creation and compute workloads and is very competitively positioned when running the most demanding AAA games at 4k resolution.
In cloud gaming, we announced that Google selected Radeon Pro GPUs to power their game streaming initiative, Project Stream. The performance and differentiated virtualization features of our Radeon Pro GPUs enable Google to deliver an uncompromised High Definition gaming experience on virtually any PC.
Turning to our enterprise embedded in semicustom segment, revenue was flat from a year ago as a double-digit percentage decrease in semicustom revenue was offset by strong growth in EPYC processor sales. As expected, semicustom sales were down from a year ago based on where we are in the current console cycle. This console generation remains one of the most successful ever as Microsoft and Sony combined have now shipped well in excess of 120 million AMD powered consoles.
Fourth quarter server unit shipments more than doubled sequentially based on growing demand for our highest end 32 core EPYC processors with cloud, HPC and virtualized enterprise customers. As a result, we believe we achieved our goal of mid-single-digit server unit share exiting 2018. We had another strong quarter of cloud adoption, highlighted by industry leader Amazon announcing new versions of their most popular EC2 computing instances powered by EPYC processors. Businesses can easily migrate their AWS instances to AMD and save 10% or more based on the technology advantages of our platform.
Microsoft Azure also announced general availability of their AMD based storage instance in the quarter, as well as a new HPC instance powered by EPYC processors that is 33% faster than competitive x86 offerings. We secured multiple HPC wins in the quarter, including Procter and Gamble, the U.S. Department of Energy and one of Europe's largest supercomputers at the University of Stuttgart's High-Performance Computing Center. Lawrence Livermore Labs also announced a new supercomputer, featuring both EPYC processors and Radeon Instinct accelerators that will be used for machine learning and big data analytics workloads.
Customer interest in our next generation Rome server processor remains very high. Rome is expected to deliver four times the floating point performance and double the compute performance for socket compared to our current generation EPYC processors. We probably demonstrated a single 64 core next generation EPYC processor outperforming two of our competitors' highest end server processors in multiple workloads. Rome development is proceeding very well and we are on track to start shipments midyear.
I am also pleased to report that we concluded discussions with GlobalFoundries on the seventh amendment to our Wafer Supply Agreement. The amendment affirms the strategic partnership with GF for products built at 12 nanometers and above, and provide AMD with full sourcing flexibility at the 7-nanometer and below nodes. GF continues to be a critical supplier of AMD's current generation products and will play a key role in our next generation Ryzen and EPYC products with our chiplet strategy.
In summary, 2018 was another strong year for AMD. Increased adoption of our high performance products drove a second straight year of double-digit annual revenue growth, expanded gross margins and improved profitability. I would like to thank the more than 10,000 AMD employees whose dedication with building great products have made these results possible. While headwinds remain in the graphics channel and macro uncertainties are causing some caution in the first half of 2019, we believe we are well positioned to gain share throughout the year and accelerate growth as we ramp our next generation 7 nanometer products. As we entered 2019, we are preparing to launch our strongest product portfolio ever. In gaming, we will launch our high end Radeon 7 GPU in February, followed by our next generation Navi GPUs later in the year.
In client computing, we started the year with our second generation Ryzen mobile processors and we’re on track to launch our third generation Ryzen desktop processors in the middle of the year. And in the server market, we expect to deliver a significant step function performance increase with the launch of our next generation Rome processors in the middle of the year. I am very proud of what we accomplished in 2018 and even more excited about how our long-term investments are set to pay off in 2019.
Now, I would like to turn the call over Devinder to provide some additional color on our fourth quarter and full year financial performance. Devinder? Thank you, Lisa and good afternoon everyone. 2018 was a strong year for AMD. New product introductions drove the highest annual revenue since 2011, and a significant improvement in gross margin year-over-year.
Earnings per share increased from $0.10 per share in 2017 to $0.46 per share in 2018. Full year 2018 revenue was $6.48 billion, up 23% year-on-year, driven by strong performance in the computing and graphics segment with significant growth in Ryzen processor sales. Although, there was weakness in the graphics channel in the second half of the year, we saw strength in data center CPUs and GPUs.
Gross margin was 39%, up 440 basis points from the prior year. Gross margin improvements were primarily driven by our new Ryzen, EPYC and Radeon products. Operating expenses were 29% of revenue, an improvement of 2 percentage points from the prior year. For the full year, operating income was $633 million, up $409 million from $224 million in the prior year. Net income was $514 million, up $411 million compared to net income of $103 million in the prior year. On the balance sheet, we reduced principal debt by $171 million and improved gross leverage significantly from 4.6 times a year ago to 1.9 times at the end of 2018.
Let me turn to the details of the fourth quarter results, fourth quarter revenue, gross margin, operating margin and earnings per share all improved year-over-year. Quarterly revenue of $1.42 billion was up 6% from a year ago. Strong sales of Ryzen and EPYC processors and data center GPUs more than offset lower channel GPU and semicustom sales during the quarter. Fourth quarter 2018 revenue did not include any IP-related revenue and Blockchain-related GPU revenue was negligible.
Gross margin was 41%, up 740 basis points from 34% a year ago. Year-on-year gross margin improvement was driven primarily by the ramp of Ryzen and EPYC processor sales. Gross margin has increased year-over-year for seven consecutive quarters, driven by a higher percentage of revenue from new products. Fourth quarter 2018 gross margin excludes a $45 million write-down of older technology licenses that are no longer being used. Operating expenses grew 9% year-over-year to $474 million and remained approximately flat as a percentage of revenue from the year ago period. We continued to invest in our product roadmap and go to market activities as we gain market share in important markets.
Operating income was $109 million, up $90 million from $19 million a year ago. Operating margin was 8%, up from less than 2% last year. Net income was $87 million compared to $8 million a year ago. Q4 2018 net income excludes of withholding tax refund plus interest of $43 million related to an IP litigation settlement from 2010. Diluted earnings per share using a diluted share count of $1.180 billion was $0.08 per share compared to $0.01 per share a year ago.
Now turning to the business segment results. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $986 million, up 9% year-over-year. Revenue growth was driven primarily by continued strong Ryzen desktop product sales and the adoption of second generation Ryzen mobile processors, largely offset by lower channel GPU and memory sales compared to the prior year. Ryzen products continued to ramp and was greater than 80% of total client revenue, driven by OEM and channel momentum. In Graphics, sales were down year-over-year due to negligible Blockchain related revenue in the fourth quarter of 2018, as well as elevated levels of Graphics inventory in the channel. Total Graphics revenue grew sequentially, driven by strong Radeon datacenter GPU sales.
Computing and Graphics' operating segment income was $115 million compared to $33 million a year ago. The increase was driven primarily by strength in Ryzen product sales and significantly higher ASPs in both desktop and mobile compared to a year ago. Enterprise embedded and semi-custom revenue was $433 million, flat from the prior year. Server revenue growth was offset by lower semi-custom revenue. EPYC cost of units more than doubled sequentially, driving significant growth in datacenter revenue in the quarter. EESC segment operating loss was $6 million compared to a loss of $13 million a year ago. The improvement due to higher EPYC cross-sell revenue was partially offset by lower semi-custom revenue and continued engineering and go-to-market investments in the server business.
Turning to the balance sheet, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $1.16 billion at the end of the quarter. We generated free cash flow of $79 million in the quarter. Free cash flow was a negative $129 million for the full year, primarily due to growth in inventory related to new products and the timing of collections. Inventory was $845 million, up $107 million sequentially, primarily due to the ramp of new products. Total principle debt was $1.5 billion as we further reduce term debt by $60 million during the quarter, resulting in total debt reduction of $171 million during 2018.
We expect to pay off the remaining $66 million of 2019 term debt in March 2019, and beyond that there are no long-term debt maturities until 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was $152 million compared to $58 million years ago. And on a trailing 12 month basis, adjusted EBITDA was $803 million, more than doubling year-over-year. Gross leverage was 1.9 times as we ended 2018 and we are pleased to have achieved our long-term gross leverage target of less than 2 times.
Before turning to our financial outlook, let me discuss our Wafer Supply Agreement with GlobalFoundaries. Today, seven amendment of the WSA spans on January 2019 through March 2024. It establishes purchase commitments and pricing at 12-nanometer and above for the years 2019 through 2021. The amendment also provides AMD full sourcing flexibility at 7-nanometer and beyond without any one-time payments or royalties for products, purchase from other foundries.
Turning to the outlook for the first quarter of 2019, we expect revenue to be approximately $1.25 billion plus or minus $50 million, a decrease of approximately 12% sequentially, and 24% year-over-year. Sequentially, the decrease is expected to be primarily driven by continued softness in the graphics channel and seasonality across the business. The year-over-year decrease is expected to be primarily driven by lower graphic sales due to excess channel inventory, the absence of Blockchain later GPU revenue and lower memory sales.
In addition, semi custom revenue is expected to be lower year-over-year, while Ryzen, EPYC and Radeon datacenter GPU product sales are expected to increase. In addition for Q1, 2019, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 41%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $480 million, non-GAAP interest expense taxes and other to be approximately $25 million and we also expect to record $60 million IP licensing gain associated with the static JV in the first quarter of 2019, which will be a benefit to operating income and recorded on the licensing gain line of the P&L.
For the full year 2019 despite near-term business in the graphics channel and a cautious macro environment, we expect high-single-digit percentage revenue growth, driven by Ryzen, EPYC and Radeon and datacenter GPU product sales and as we ramp our 7-nanometer products throughout the year. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be greater than 41%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately 29% of revenue and a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 4% of pre-tax income.
In closing, we made excellent progress in 2018. We grew the top-line by more than $1.2 billion, expanded gross margin and significantly improved profitability. We continue to execute our long-term financial model, driven by our new high performance computing products that gained solid momentum last year. We are pleased to enter 2019 with a strengthened balance sheet and a strong portfolio of next generation products capable of driving continued financial growth.
With that, I'll turn it back to Laura for the question and answer session. Laura. Thank you, Devinder. Operator, we're ready for our first question, please. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is coming from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. You're line is now live. Lisa, I had a question on your full year 2019 outlook. You guys are guiding revenue growth in the high-single-digit range. Embedded in that outlook, what growth rates are you assuming for your core businesses computing, graphics, semicustom and server CPUs? And then on the gross margin side, 41% or greater. Is the improvement year-over-year primarily a function of revenue growth in mix or is the amendment in the WSA playing a role there as well? Thank you. So relative to the full year guidance of up high-single-digits, the primary growth drivers are Ryzen and EPYC or the two largest growth drivers with datacenter GPU. Also, we're expecting that to be up. And then we would expect that semicustom will be down. If you look at life cycle of semicustom will be in the seventh year of the console cycle. And so we expect semicustom would be down approximately 20% and then we would expect consumer graphics to also be down let's call it double-digits as we really burn off some of the channel inventory that we see in the first half of the year. So Ryzen and EPYC are the largest drivers of the growth, and that’s as we launch our 7-nanometer products throughout the year. And then your second question, Tosh, was… Yes, gross margins 41% or greater that's a 2 percentage point or greater improvement year-over-year. Is that primarily a function of revenue growth and improvement in mix given Ryzen and EPYC, or is the WSA amendment providing a tailwind as well? Yes, it's primarily due to the mix. So the mix of the higher margin new products Ryzen, EPYC and the datacenter GPUs. Our next question is coming from Matt Ramsay from Cowen & Company. Your line is now live. Lisa, I guess I wanted to attack Tosh's question on the full year a little bit differently. And maybe just talk about a little bit what share gain assumptions you guys are embedding for your 7 nanometer roadmap versus maybe some pragmatism or conservatism on the market. Just given the macro? I mean Intel talked about a flat PC TAM in terms of units and obviously is only I guess guided us to mid single-digit growth for their expansive server business for the year. And you guys are starting off down maybe 25% year-over-year in revenue for the first quarter given what's going on in the graphics business. So maybe you could just walk us through a little bit what you're thinking about the TAM growth of your two main growth markets for the year versus share gains you're embedding? Thank you. I think as it relates to the market, I don’t think we would have a very different view of the market as others may have stated. Our story really is a share gain story. And when you take a look at the progress that we've made in 2018 in the design wins that we have in 2018. As we go over the 2019 when we look at both Rome as well as Ryzen, we look at the breath of OEM platforms that we have, the customer engagements by workloads and how we see that progressing. We feel very good about the opportunity to gain share as we go through the year, particularly given how competitive the product set is. Similarly on the PC side, we've made nice progress over the last four or five quarters on Ryzen. We started strong on desktop. And then the last couple of quarters, we've made good progress on notebook. We see a broader portfolio with our OEMs as we go into 2019 and we also see a more competitive desktop product line as well as notebook product line. So that’s how we’re thinking about the year.
To your point about starting a little bit with lower guidance in Q1, I think that’s true. When we look at Q1, particularly on a year-over-year basis, there are lot of moving pieces but it's primarily due to the graphics channel. And that’s both the reduced demand, as well as the absence in Blockchain revenue on a year-over-year basis, as well as the semi custom business. But as we move forward, as we go into Q2 and beyond, we see a significant opportunity with the ramp of our new products and that’s how we see the year. Devinder, maybe just a couple of little things in terms of licensing gains and IP revenue, I got asked a few times and my associates want to clarify here that the gross margin outlook for the first quarter does not include any IP or licensing gains. And then for the full year, are you including any IP revenue in the revenue outlook? And how should we think about the rest of the Thatic licensing gains apply to timing for when those might get recognized? I know it’s a lot there, but lots of question on just the moving pieces there. Thank you. License gain essentially does not impact gross margin, that's on a separate line all together on the license and gain line of the P&L. So the gross margin is not impacted by that. As far as IP revenues is concerned in Q1 there is no contemplated IP revenue, so the gross margin at 41% guide is based on the products that we have. And for the year at this point outside of the Thatic JV IP licensing gain that we are expecting to record in Q1, while there might be opportunities from an IP standpoint, but nothing substantial contemplated at this point. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is live. Lisa, I'm curious as you look back at 2019 and the success you had with EPYC, the initial success with EPYC, what was the mix of cloud versus enterprise? And then how do you think it trends in 2019, because of all the concerns around slowdown in cloud CapEx and so forth. And as part of that, if you could share with us what your market share assumptions are as we exit the year on EPYC? So as we look through 2018, we were pretty pleased with our progress on EPYC. And coming off of the fourth quarter, actually it was a fairly strong fourth quarter for us and in fact that we doubled the number of units for our server business. And when you look at that mix, it is more cloud weighted. So we had some large deployments that went online here in the fourth quarter and that was positive for us. That being said that we’re making nice progress in the enterprise and HPC side of the business too. We've had a number of wins in the quarter, as well as going into 2019.
So as we look into 2019, I would expect that the early Rome deployments will also be cloud based. It will be the first ones, but we have a strong set of enterprise platforms. And as I mentioned earlier it’s the breadth of the OEM platforms that gives us good confidence that we were going to a broader set of workloads and having broader coverage in the market. In terms of share assumptions we will have to see how the markets and year play out. But I think what we've said before is that after reaching the mid-single digit market share in the fourth quarter of 2018, we would expect it would take another four to six quarters to reach 10% market share. And I think we're still in that range. And for my follow up, there were two things that came out on your competitors last few public discussions, which is one this concept of CPU shortages. And I’m wondering if that has had any positive or negative effect on your strategy or positioning? And then Intel has also mentioned being a little more tactical when it comes to pricing. And I’m wondering how that figures into your full year outlook. So both the impact of CPU shortages and pricing, any color would be very helpful. Thank you. On the CPU shortages, my comment is that there are some pockets of shortage, particularly at low end. However, our focus has really been on ramping Ryzen. And if you look at the Ryzen percentage of our overall business, Ryzen Devinder mentioned was 80% of our client business. So we are really actually improving our mix in the client business. I think that, again from my view, the shortages are temporary but we look at it as really getting consistent share gain. And as we've gone through each quarter in 2018, we've seen consistent share gain and we believe we gain share in the fourth quarter as well. So I think we are well positioned with the portfolio and we will certainly drive that into 2019.
And then relative to pricing, when we think about pricing and when we put together our long-term model, we have factored in that pricing and competition will be aggressive. I think we know that to be the case. What we've seen in the market is consistent with that. But we also believe that particularly as you go into the datacenter, the single largest factor from a buying decision standpoint is the performance and the total cost of ownership of the product. And we believe that Rome will be very, very well positioned in 2019. And so we are cognizant of the competitive environment but feel good that we have the right set of assumptions. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Thanks for taking my question and great to hit the mid-single digit milestone exiting the year. Lisa, as you start -- I just wanted to confirm, you expect to start shipping Rome mid-year. And as you do, what's the biggest risk for Rome? Is it execution on delivering the product, or is it the sales process convincing customers to take EPYC to in volume? So I think with Rome, our biggest opportunity/risk is adoption rate. I think from a competitive standpoint, the product is very solid, everything going through our development labs looks very good, as well as our customer engagements. And so this is just about getting customers to production as fast as possible. We do expect though that the adoption rate for Rome will be faster than the adoption rate for Naples. And the reason for that is we are in a socket compatible infrastructure. And so customers who don't necessarily need the newest features of the platform can actually use the same motherboard and system that they currently have with Naples and drop in Rome. And so I think that will help us accelerate some of the adoption. But right now, it's about helping customers in their environment. We are widely sampling Rome and there's a lot of work to be done but we feel good about the trajectory. And a follow up if I may for Devinder. So inventories, looks like they were up about $100 million going into a pretty healthy seasonal quarter that's declining. How should we read that Devinder? And was there just some opportunity to get some wafers more cheaply? Or are you trying to stockpile product in front of launches? And when can we expect that inventory to be a source of cash on the cash flow statement? Thank you. So the inventory growth is primarily driven by our new products and in preparation for the 7 nanometer next generation product launches later this year as you just mentioned. We overall expect to manage our environment revenue, but also in support of the new products that will be launching ramping throughout the year. Lisa mentioned a few of the launches at CES and also in the script. And we prepared to support that from an inventory standpoint and we'll see how the year progresses and then manage it from there. Our next question is coming from Stacey Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your line is now live. Around the Q1 guide, obviously, you mentioned the GPU weakness but you also mentioned seasonality across the businesses. Is my assumption correct that that means everything is basically down sequentially CPUs, GPUs, Servers? And can tell us is that true? And if so can you give us an idea of the magnitude like what is down most versus least sequentially, Ryzen versus GPU versus EPYC? So the largest driver as I said is the GPU channel situation on a year-over-year basis. On a sequential basis, typical seasonality for let's call it PCs and GPUs and datacenter is probably around 10% or so. We are forecasting or we believe that that will be a little bit -- down a little bit more than that. And in terms of the ranking, I would say GPUs are down a bit more than the other two segments that's the way we currently see it. For my follow-up, I had a question just in general EESC. So its revenues are flat year-over-year. The server revenues are up a bunch and still losing money. And I get it there's some incremental investments and everything. But I guess how do we think about the profitability of that segment? How big does EPYC or Rome in the server business maybe to get before it sustainably profitable, especially semi custom has going to continue to decline 20% in 2019? I think the key, Stacy, is going to be ramping the server business in 2019. You are right that year-over-year we look at it, it's lost little bit of money. But fundamentally, it's investing in the go-to-market programs and launching the new products, investing in the ongoing engineering work that's needed to make sure that customers bring up the product on time. And semi custom, given the fact that is in the seventh year of the cycle, we expect it to be down from 2018 to 2019. But we do expect to go ahead and ramp of our server business and that will definitely benefit the EESC profitability in 2019. Do you think it's profitable for the full year? Too early to tell, I don't predict profitability at the segment level. But we'll see how it evolves over the year. Our next question today is coming from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live. Lisa, a potentially different way to ask the same question on the full year 2019 guide. Late last year at a few different events, you talked about the server business being second half weighted. If I go through the remainder of this year, it seems like you have to grow better part of 20% plus sequentially in each quarter to get there. I know it's not going to be perfectly linear like that. But I guess my overall question is if the server side of the business is back half weighted. What sorts of businesses are helping the middle portion of the year? Is there some snapback on the GPU side? Is there something going on on the Ryzen side? Just trying to get somewhat of the shape of the year off of a base that's admittedly pretty low as your first quarter starting point? So I think it is fair to say that our quarterly progression will have a lot to do with our product launches. So you would expect that server will be more second half weighted than first half. In general, our business is more second half weighted though if you think about the consumer portions of our business. But think about it as we would expect sequential growth in PCs, we would certainly expect sequential growth in datacenter, although stronger in the second half. We're also as we see the GPU business right now, we see the first quarter as the low point in the business with the channel getting improving as we go into the second quarter. And we have additional product launches there as well. So that's the way we would see the portfolio. And semi custom, although it's lower on a year-over-year basis, we would expect it to also increase as we go from second quarter into third quarter as well. And then a question on the GPU side, your big competitor in that market obviously is having some current issues and mentioned that the new product at the high-end wasn’t selling through. Are you at all concerned that the competitive landscape in that market, whether it's because China demand being weaker as they cited or them having to be a little bit more aggressive on pricing would do anything to your ability to penetrate the market with either existing or new GPU products as the year progresses? So when we look at the GPU market and let's separate gaming and data center. I think on the gaming side from what we are seeing, we did see sell out increase in Q4 versus Q3. So gamers are still buying GPUs. They may be more discerning about price points. And so I can imagine that there might be a bit more softness at the high end versus in the mid range. But we believe that we have a good understanding of what's happening in the gaming side of the business, and it will be driven. Our gaming growth will be driven by new products. We would see that as we go through this year and with our Radeon 7 launch, as well as our Navi launches on the gaming side.
On the data center side, we're making good progress in GPU data center, obviously, from a low base. But the GPUs and the data center are very workload dependent. And there are some workloads that actually we do very well in things like cloud gaming and virtualization and we have some early HPC wins. And so we see this as customer acquisition need deployments. And so those are the sources of growth on the GPU side for us. Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Just two questions if I can, building on that last one. In your prepared remarks you noted that you've reached a milestone of which GPUs as well as data center CPUs reach a mid-teens percentage of your total revenue. I'm curious as you contemplated your full year guidance. Where do you think that mix of business can go? And is there a point in time where we actually, you foresee us giving granularity on how big the data center GPU business is trending? So, I think the mid-teens percentage revenue for us in Q4 was a good milestone. I mean I think that's a meaningful percentage of our revenue. And it was a contributor to our gross margin as we exited 2018. I think as we go into 2019, again, we will continue to give you visibility into where the data center growth is. To be fair of my expectation is that the CPU side of the data center business will grow faster than the GPU side just given what we see in terms of overall deployments. But I think both businesses will be meaningful for us and are a key part of the growth story for us in 2019. And we will continue to give color on how they develop as the year develops. And then just real quickly on the semicustom side, as you contemplated the guidance as well through the courses here in that 20% decline for the full year. Is your assumption that Q1 marks the bottom and we can grow seasonally off of that level? Or should we think about something differently from a progression through the quarters in '19? Aaron, that's the correct way to think about it. So, Q1 will be a low, Q2 will be higher, Q3 will be higher, and then Q4 will come down again. That should be the seasonality of semicustom. Thank you. Our next question is coming from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live. So notwithstanding that the macro is extremely uncertain making any predictions difficult. I’m just curious going back to Ross' question. How do you see the cadence of growth sequentially throughout the year? Because as he pointed out if you divide it up equally by quarter, you’re growing north of 20% in Q2, Q3, Q4 half on half growth would be somewhere around 50%. If you assume more seasonal and seasonal is a little bit difficult to get to, because of change in accounting, I think you can get half on half growth to 75%. So as you think about the full year growth, is this something that’s more like 50% half on half or 75% half on half? It might be a little bit early for us to go there, but what I would say is the following. When we look at the year-on-year compares from 2019 to 2018, Q2 2018 was still a very strong quarter for us, because we still had a significant amount of Blockchain sales in 2018. So I expect that we will grow sequentially into Q2, but I think that will still be, let's call it, a tougher year-on-year compare. But then when we get into the second half of the year, we expect to be fully ramped on the entire 7 nanometer portfolio. And so we would see a heavier weighting in the second half. So we see sequential growth into second quarter, but more heavily weighted into the second half. And then, Devinder, on the profitability front if you run the numbers from Q1 guidance to what you need to be exiting Q4 at to hit the full year number, you could see revenue up well over $1 billion Q1 to Q4. I’m a little bit surprised that despite that, the gross margin guidance isn’t a little bit better. I know you guided the full year to greater than 41 with Q1 at 41. But I’m curious if you look at Q4 run rate that’s north of a billion higher than the Q1 run rate. How should we think about gross margin and operating margin existing the year? If you look back the last many quarters I think seven quarters year-over-year, we have improved gross margin on the strength of the newer products. We ended the year quite well in 2018 and achieved gross margin in the fourth quarter that was nice, and now we start the year with 41%. And as we start the year, it's only we're guiding greater than 41%. I think you should expect that as the products ramp in particular with the 7 nanometer product that Lisa referenced, our margins should continue to improve and we will see where we end up by the end of the year. But we do expect that year-on-year margin goes up from where we ended in 2018 at 39% and greater than 41% for 2019. Our next question is coming from Mitch Steves from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live. First on the C&G side, I realized that there's going to be a lot of sequential difficulties there. But when I think about the long-term growth rate, I know you guys have talked to high singles to double-digit growth. Is that still essential where you think that business can grow at long-term? And then secondly in terms of the next EPYC 2. Is there any reason why it would underperform Intel 10 nanometer in a testing environment? And if so, why would that be? Let me take the second question and then maybe Devinder you can take the first question. So as it relates to our ROM product, when ROM was originally planned, we had planned that it would be competing against the 10 nanometer product. So that was our expectation when we started. I think we've shown some of the generational performance advantages in terms of double digit performance on a socket basis, 4 times performance on a floating point basis. And the other thing I would say is that with our second generation Rome, the customer set is now more used to our architecture and so some of the architectural and software improvements that we've also spent quite a bit of time on over the last four to six quarters are coming into play. So I think we feel very good about the competitive positioning of Rome. And the other thing to keep in mind is we are deep in development of our next generation Beyond Rome. So the Zen 3 product portfolio is deep in development as well. And so that our goal is to ensure that we have a consistent cadence of very competitive products. And then as far as your question on the segment growth is concerned relative to high single digits growth for the company level. In both of the segments, there are some factors that come into play. In Computing and Graphics, obviously you feel good about the datacenter side of GPU. But on a compare basis when you look at 2018 to 2019, we do have the impact of the Blockchain and some memory sales from 2018 that don't happen in 2019 from a standpoint of where the market is. And then on the EESC semi-custom in down obviously is a factor when you compare year-on-year for segment. But good growth on the datacenter piece of it in particular with the 7 nanometer Rome product launching in the back half, I mean ramping in the back half of 2019 and that's the way you look at it. It is still early in the year from an overall standpoint. And where we ended up in 2018, we're projecting high single digit growth at the company level for 2019 over 2018. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Your line is now live. Lisa, I just want to ask, you laid it out a little bit. But in terms of EPYC to thin socket but you have sampled it early in terms of getting over the finish line and getting the shift. I guess the customer still has the wafer production of silicon. And then in particular people talk about six to 12 months for those to test and make sure it does everything with the production of silicon. Can you walk us through that timeline, because obviously you're baking in a pretty steep ramp in the second half? Thanks. So we started sampling EPYC actually last year so the second half of last year to some of the top cloud vendors, as well as our OEM partners. We've had a significant amount of development with our ODM partners as well. So I think there is a good amount of overlap between the customer development cycle and our development cycle. Now as you said, production of silicon is very key and ensuring that the final certifications are locked in is work that we still have to do here in the first half of this year. But I think we feel good about it. We feel good about the platforms, the customer engagements, the current progress of developments. And so that is very much our plan from an execution standpoint. And then I just want to ask on the GPU side. It looks like your ASP was up substantially with the data center just kind of curious as we think about the mix of data center. How do you think about the trajectory of that business? I mean is that forced in lumpy as well or is this the go forward level after that pretty sharp initial shipments in December? So on the datacenter side we do expect that datacenter GPU business will be a growth driver for us in 2019. It will be a little bit lumpy, so I wouldn't say it's a straight line but I would say on a year-over-year basis, it's a important growth driver for us. And as it relates to the overall datacenter CPU ASPs affecting overall ASPs, I think that's true because the gaming ASPs are or the gaming business was lower than expected given the channel inventory situation. So I think it's also just weighted in terms of the units. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. It seems like the GPU datacenter business is doing pretty well. Can you give us some color if you look at mid-teens exposure overall between the two datacenter businesses, CPU and GPU? Can you give us some qualitative sense for how much of that is GPU at this point? And what are the main applications, is it mostly virtualization? What other applications are you seeing there? So for the mid-teens percentage of revenue in Q4 between CPU and GPU, it's actually roughly similar. And then in terms of the workloads on the GPU data enter side. We do very well in cloud gaming. We do very well with our virtualization solutions and we have some early traction in HPC. And then I guess just in terms of the business segmentation, I think you alluded to this earlier. But it seems like the conversation typically is around microprocessor graphics and semi custom as three different opportunities. Have you thought about moving the segmentation to more in line with that? And I realize it's easier to talk about and hard to implement. But what's your thought in terms of overtime migrating that more in line with the way you guys talk about the business? So we look at the business in all different cuts. As you can imagine, we look at it by segment our CG and EESG. CG is very much a PC driven segment and EESG with enterprise and semi custom. And we are, also based on some of the feedback, trying to be a little bit more granular in terms of how the various businesses fall underneath that. So I think as the datacenter business becomes a larger piece of our business, we'll continue to look for how do we give you guys more color and more transparency in how that is going. Our next question is coming from Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho. Your line is now live. Just in terms of the GPU gaming side, you mentioned higher inventory levels. I was wondering if you can give us some number on where normal inventory GPU levels are and where are they running currently? Thanks. So when we look at the GPU channel inventory, we do believe our channel partners reduce inventory in Q4 and they will reduce inventories in Q1. We still think the Q1 levels are elevated and there will be some spill over into Q2, and we will see some elevated inventory levels. We'll have to see how the sell-through really, really plays out. But my expectation is that in Q2 will have improved channel inventory levels and we will return to sequential growth in the gaming side of our business. And on the 7-nanometer side, is the 7-nanometer GPU and CPU as those ramp in the back half. Are they accretive to this 41% gross margin levels? Thanks. So the 7-nanometer GPUs on the data center side started ramping in Q4. So that was part of the data center GPU revenue that we've talked about. The 7-nanometer CPU will ramp middle of the year. And the 7-nanometer CPU and GPU are both above corporate average margins. So you would expect that they're above the 41 points and would be accretive to margin as that mix improves. Thank you. We reached end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments. Thank you very much operator. We appreciate everyone joining us here today. We're quite proud of the accomplishments in 2018, and look forward to seeing you all on the growth in 2019. Have a great afternoon. Thank you.

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Laura Graves. Please go ahead. Thank you, and welcome to AMD's first quarter 2019 conference call. By now, you should have had the opportunity to review a copy of our earnings release and slides. If you have not reviewed these documents, they can be found on the Investor Relations page of AMD's website, amd.com.
Participants on today's conference call are Dr. Lisa Su, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Devinder Kumar, our Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer. This is a live call, and will be replayed via webcast on our website.
I would like to highlight some important dates for you. In celebration of AMD's 50th anniversary on May 1, 2019, Dr. Lisa Su and members of AMD's executive leadership team will host a panel discussion, reflecting on 50 years of innovation by AMD. This will be held at the NASDAQ market site in New York City.
Dr. Lisa Su, President and Chief Executive Officer, will also be delivering a keynote address at Computex in Taiwan on Monday, May 27; Ruth Cotter, Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, HR and Investor Relations will present at the Bank of America Global Technology Conference on Tuesday, June 4; and our 2019 second quarter quiet time will begin at the close of business on Friday, June 14, 2019.
Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of this current date and as such, involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We will refer primarily to non-GAAP financial measures during this call except for revenue and segment operational results, which are on a GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures referenced on this call are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in today's press release, which is posted on our website.
Please refer to the cautionary statements in our press release for more information. You will also find detailed discussions about our risk factors in our filings with the SEC and in particular, AMD's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018.
Now with that, I would like to have the call over to Lisa. Lisa? Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. We had a solid first quarter. Revenue was in line with our expectations at $1.27 billion, down 23% year-over-year. Ryzen and EPYC processor and data center GPU revenue more than doubled year-over-year helping expand gross margin by 5 percentage points, and partially offsetting graphics channel softness and lower semi-custom revenue.
Looking at our Computing and Graphics segment, revenue declined year-over-year as higher client processor sales were offset by lower graphics sales to the channel. Client processor sales increased by a strong double-digit percentage from the year-ago period, as unit shipments increased significantly and our new products drove a higher client ASP. As a result, we believe we gained unit market share for the sixth straight quarter.
In the desktop channel, demand for our highest-end Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 5 CPUs was strong, with sales increasing sequentially and outperforming seasonality.
Ryzen mobile processor adoption continues to accelerate. Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and other OEMs have launched more than a dozen new Ryzen mobile notebooks so far in 2019, helping us deliver our fifth straight quarter of year-over-year mobile processor growth. Our customers are on track to increase the number of Ryzen notebook models by more than 50% from 2018. The majority of these new systems are planned to launch in the second quarter in advance of the seasonally stronger second half of the year.
In Graphics, revenue decreased year-over-year driven largely by lower channel sales, partially offset by a significant increase in data center GPU sales. Radeon Vega GPU shipments grew by a strong double-digit percentage both year-over-year and sequentially based on increased adoption across OEM, gaming, and data center customers. Apple introduced two new iMac systems featuring upgraded Radeon Pro Vega GPUs that deliver up to 80% faster graphics performance than the previous generation.
We believe we made good progress improving channel inventory levels. Sell-through accelerated sequentially driven by sales of both our mainstream Radeon RX GPUs and new high-end Radeon VII gaming GPUs. We are well-positioned to grow GPU revenue in the second quarter and through the second half of the year as we expect to introduce our first 7-nanometer Navi gaming GPUs in the third quarter.
We delivered another quarter of strong data center GPU sales based on increased adoption across large customers. Our progress was highlighted by Google's announcement that they selected high-performance Radeon GPUs and AMD's software development tools to power their upcoming Stadia game streaming platform. Stadia is a great example of how we are extending the depth and breadth of our data center customer engagements. We are seeing growing customer interest in our differentiated platforms for game streaming, machine learning, and HPC workloads that combine our high-performance GPUs with open source software tools.
Turning to our Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-custom segment, revenue decreased from a year ago as expected due to lower Semi-custom revenue as we entered the seventh year of the current game console cycle. Our Semi-custom business model continues to play an important role in our long-term growth as our strong IP portfolio enables the industry's biggest brands to create differentiated solutions. The latest example is Sony. We are honored that Sony has selected a custom AMD SoC based on our Zen 2 CPU and Navi GPU architectures to power its next-generation PlayStation console.
Our server CPU revenue grew significantly from the year ago period, as EPYC processor adoption across cloud, HPC, and Enterprise customers continued to grow. Overall, in the data center, our CPU and GPU sales accounted for a mid-teens percentage of quarterly revenue. Our work with cloud leader, Amazon, continues to expand as they rolled out AMD-based offerings to additional regions and launched three new EPYC processor-powered EC2 instance families, including the first T3 Series Instance.
Growing HPC and regional cloud service provider deployments resulted in EPYC processor channel sales increasing sequentially. In the Enterprise, we added dozens of new customers across the aerospace, health care, automotive, and telecom industries based on the superior performance of EPYC processors in big data and general-purpose virtualized workloads.
Turning to our next-generation Rome processor, we made excellent progress in the quarter achieving key production milestones with our largest OEM and cloud customers. We're very excited about the performance of Rome, which is on track to deliver four times the floating point performance and double the compute performance per socket compared to our current generation EPYC processors. We are on track to begin Rome production shipments in the second quarter to support a third quarter launch.
In summary, I am pleased with our first quarter financial results based on the strong execution engine we have built across the company. Tomorrow is an important day in AMD's history as we celebrate our 50th anniversary. This is a significant milestone for any company, but especially significant for a technology company.
2019 is arguably the most important year in our history, as the $75 billion market for high-performance Computing and Graphics products has never been larger, and our product portfolio has never been stronger. We are right where we plan to be with our multiyear roadmap, including our upcoming 7-nanometer Ryzen, Radeon, and EPYC processors that can drive our next wave of revenue growth and share gains. We remain confident in our ability to continue delivering on our ambitious leadership roadmap for the PC, gaming, and datacenter markets.
Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our first quarter financial performance. Devinder? Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. The first quarter of 2019 was a good start to the New Year. Revenue was $1.27 billion and gross margin of 41% was up almost 5 points from the prior year. This was the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin expansion, driven by the ramp of our strong portfolio of high-performance products.
Quarterly revenue was down 23% from a year ago. Strong sales of Ryzen and EPYC processors and datacenter GPUs were more than offset by lower graphics channel sales and lower semi-custom revenue.
Gross margin was 41%, up 470 basis points from a year ago, primarily driven by Ryzen, EPYC – Ryzen and EPYC processor sales as well as datacenter GPU sales. Operating expenses grew 12% year-over-year to $498 million, primarily driven by go-to-market activities and investments in our product roadmap.
Operating income was $84 million, down from $152 million a year ago, primarily due to lower revenue and higher operating expenses, partially offset by a $60 million licensing gain from the joint venture with Thatic. Operating margin was 7%, down from 9% last year. Net income was $62 million, compared to $121 million a year ago, and diluted earnings per share was $0.06 per share compared to $0.11 per share a year ago.
Now turning to the business segment results. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $831 million, down 26% year-over-year, as strong client processor and datacenter GPU sales were more than offset by lower graphics channel sales. Ryzen products continued to ramp, driven by strong growth across both desktop and mobile processors.
In Graphics, sales were down year-over-year due to lower Graphics channel sales and negligible Blockchain related revenue in the quarter, partially offset by strong Radeon data center GPU sales. Computing and Graphics segment operating income was $16 million compared to $138 million a year ago. The decrease was due primarily to lower revenue and higher OpEx.
In the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, revenue was $441 million, down 17% from the prior year. Server revenue growth was more than offset by anticipated lower semi-custom revenue. EESC segment operating profit was $68 million compared to $14 million a year ago. The improvement was largely due to an IP licensing gain of $60 million associated with the joint venture with THATIC.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable security totaled $1.2 billion at the end of the quarter. During the quarter, we received $448 million of cash related to Mubadala's warrant exercise. We used $64 million of cash to fully extinguish the 2019 term debt and $100 million of cash to retire other term debt.
The principal debt balance as of the end of the quarter was $1.4 billion as compared to $1.7 billion a year ago, and we have no long-term debt maturities until 2022. Free cash flow was negative $275 million in the quarter, primarily due to higher inventory and the timing of collections. We expect to be free cash flow positive for the full year.
Inventory was $955 million, up $110 million sequentially, primarily due to an increase in inventory of new products in anticipation of higher revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $130 million compared to $196 million a year ago, due to lower quarterly earnings and, on a trailing 12 month basis, adjusted EBITDA was $737 million. Gross leverage at the end of the quarter was 1.8 times.
Turning to the outlook for the second quarter of 2019. We expect revenue to be approximately $1.52 billion, plus or minus $50 million, an increase of approximately 19% sequentially and a decrease of approximately 13% year-over-year. Sequentially, the increase is expected to be driven by growth across all businesses. The year-over-year decrease is expected to be primarily driven by lower graphics channel space -- sales, negligible Blockchain related GPU revenue and lower semi-custom revenue.
In addition, for Q2 2019, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 41%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $510 million. As we invest in our new products and upcoming product launches, non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $25 million. For the full year 2019, AMD continues to expect high single-digit percentage revenue growth and non-GAAP gross margin to be greater than 41%.
In closing, the first quarter was a good start to the year. We remained focused on executing our plans for the remainder of the year, and look forward to unveiling a strong portfolio of next-generation products to drive financial growth and customer momentum throughout 2019.
With that, I'll turn it back to Laura for the question-and-answer session. Laura? Thank you, Devinder. Operator, we're ready for our first call? Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Matt Ramsay from Cowan. Your line is now live. Good afternoon. Thank you very much. Congratulations, Lisa, to you and your team on the 50th anniversary. I guess, the first question from me is, it was encouraging to see you guys reiterate the full year growth expectation.
Obviously, one of your large server competitors had a bit of a hiccup on some of the outlook and talked about maybe a bit of a softer server market for the full year. Maybe you could give an update on what you guys are seeing for the server macro environment and the confidence that you might have in your product’s ramping? Thank you. Sure, Matt. Thank you for the question. So, yes, as it relates to how the year is developing, it's developing largely as we expected when we started the year. So relative to our Q2 guidance, we are guiding up 19% sequentially and every business is growing.
That's coming from, if you look across the businesses, our client business is growing due to new platforms that are launching. Our graphics business, the channel inventory has improved since we started the year, and we have our Server business which is really starting some early shipments of Rome in the second quarter going into the second half of the year.
As it relates to the full year guidance and how we look at it, again, it's largely as we expected, as we're laying out the year. There certainly is some discussion with our customers about some inventory in the data center, especially here in the first half.
When we developed our plan, our data center business was always more second half weighted and continues to be so, because much of that is dependent on platforms that are launching around our Rome product portfolio.
So we're going to continue to watch the data center overall environment, but at this point, we're focused on our products. And our customers continue to have a very strong pull. There's a lot of interest in Rome. We're doing well on our qualifications, and so we feel good about how that's developing. Got it. Thank you. And as a follow-up, you mentioned the 19% sequential guidance for Q2. It seems like a bit of a transitional quarter for the company with a lot of things going on towards product launches that will happen to feed the back half of the year.
So maybe you could talk a little bit more granularly about the drivers of Q2 just given that it's a bit of a transition for a whole new portfolio rolling out? And if there's any kind of color on contributions from older or newer products in the second quarter guidance, that would be helpful. Thank you. Sure, Matt. So, yes, as we look at Q2, it is a bit of a transition in the product portfolio. It's an important quarter for us as we are preparing to launch our 7-nanometer products. In terms of the overall business, as I stated earlier, each of the business is growing for different reasons.
I think starting with server, again, it's the greatest percentage of growth, and And it really is the start of some shipments of Rome. We expect that Rome will launch here in the third quarter, and there are some preparations that need to be done for that.
As we look at the graphics business, again the channel inventory situation has improved, and so that we expect that the channel will be up here in the second quarter, and then into the second half as we launch Navi.
And in the client business, we have a large number of platforms with our OEM customers that are launching here in the second quarter around our second generation Ryzen mobile processors, and we're also in preparations for our third generation Ryzen desktop as well. Thank you, Matt. Operator, next question, please? Sure. Your next question is coming from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, first question, and I do have a quick follow-up is when you kind of layout Rome and the expectation of a ramp going forward, can you just remind us of how you currently see the set up with regard to market share opportunities or market share gains that you would expect? And where do you think you fell off this last quarter in terms of market share in the overall server space? Sure. Aaron thanks for the question. So look, as we look at the server market, we know very well that the data center market takes time to ramp with any new product. And so, that's the way we have sort of built our plans. What we have previously stated is that, from -- let's call it, at beginning of this year, we’d expect that over the next quarter to six quarters, we would continue to ramp our server market share with a goal of getting to double-digit percentage share.
As it relates to the Q1 quarter, again, we'll have to wait to see how the numbers come out. The data center business for us, on the CPU side, behaved as expected in Q1, but But we did see some product mix shift. So Q4 was a large quarter for us in the cloud business for our EPYC processors and Q1, the mix shift did more to Enterprise channel. And from that, the ASPs were higher, the units were lower, and so again largely as we would've expected. Okay. And then as a quick follow-up, congratulations on the announcement of Sony. I'm just curious I think last quarter you’d suggested that you expected that semi-custom business to decline by 20%-plus this year. Assuming that, that's still the case, number 1. Number 2, how do we now sort of think about the growth profile of that looking into next year? Thank you. Yes. So, yes, we are very pleased with our partnership and expanding our partnership with Sony on their next-generation consoles. As we see, the semi-custom business at this point, we still believe that it's going to be down substantially in 2019, let’s call it approximately 20%-plus. And then as we go into 2020, without talking about any specific customer, we believe that semi-custom will return to a growth business for us in 2020 and beyond. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Aaron. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. Hey, good afternoon. And thank you for taking the question. Lisa, we continue to hear about the CPU shortage, which is obviously primarily caused by your competitor. I'm curious, are you seeing any impact on your business in the near term? And more importantly, as we go into the second half and the ramp capacity, are you concerned at all that could disrupt your business, whether it’d be market share swings or pricing pressure? And I have a follow-up. Sure. So, as it relates to CPU shortages in the market. Look, we see a little bit of that, I would say, there are pockets per footage, mostly at the low-end of the market, frankly. So, from our standpoint, I don't believe it's a huge contributor to our business.
As we look at the PC business, those in the first half and the second half of the year, we believe that the PC business can be a growth business for us. From a market environment standpoint, we believe the market is not too bad. We call it flat to slightly down. When we look at our product portfolio in the notebook space with our secondary Ryzen platforms, we believe we have much stronger platforms that we are ramping through this year.
And then in the desktop space, we believe will be very competitive as we've launched the third-generation of Ryzen desktops. So, I view the PC business is an important growth driver for us in 2019 and we see that it's a good market for us. Thank you. And then as a follow-up, you mentioned that data center CPUs and GPUs accounted for about mid-teens percentage of revenue in the quarter. Last quarter, can you give us a rough split between the two and related to that, I was hoping you can help besides the game streaming opportunity long-term.
Obviously, they're involved with Google today. How does that business went down the ball over the next 18 months? And what your opportunity elsewhere in terms of broadening your customer base? Thank you. Sure. So, as we stated, the data center CPU and GPU business was about mid-teens percentage of revenue. Of course, both businesses were down as expected in Q1 and much of that was the strength of the Q4 quarter, especially around the cloud.
We mentioned in Q4 that the split between CPUs and GPUs was close. They were close. As we look longer term for data center GPUs, and your question about the cloud streaming opportunity, we're very pleased with our partnership with Google. It's a result of several years of effort, where we were optimizing both hardware and software together.
And so we think it's an important vertical for us. We're working with other customers in the cloud streaming area as well. So, again, I think it's an interesting and important market over the next couple of years. We also have a number of other workload that we feel good about as it relates to data center GPU, including HPC, especially when you combine our CPU and GPU portfolio together, we think HPC is a great workload for us as well as machine learning.
And working with -- and machine learning, with a couple of leading cloud customers to, again, optimize our software to their needs. So, again, the data center GPU market will continue to be an important driver for us over the next couple of years. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your line is now live. Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. I had a question on the gross margin guide; I'm a little confused why it's flat sequentially to Q2 on a pretty meaningful revenue lift? You talked about all business is growing, you mentioned a number of it, but you didn't mention semi-custom. Is this a matter of mix? A semi-custom driving a lot of the growth code, is there something going around about enter business mix or something quite? What's going on with the gross margins? Yes, Stacy, let me start and I'll Devinder comment. I should've mention semi-custom in that list as well. So, semi-custom is going through a seasonal build. So, although it will be down substantially year-over-year, it's still a seasonal build for us as we go from Q2 -- from Q1 into Q2. Devinder, maybe you want to comment as well? Yeah. So Stacy, rank order maybe like growth by business? Can I rank order the growth by business. That’s probably a bit more granular than I'd like to get, but it's fair to say that all businesses have to grow a decent amount to get to 19% sequential growth. That's right, Lisa. So fundamentally, Stacy, it's the product mix in the quarter, that's driving the flat gross margin. And I'd add the 41% guide, it's just improve for the four points year-over-year. As you know very well we have businesses that are higher than corporate average, gross margin and lower than corporate average and the mix of the businesses, semi-custom that we just talked about lower than corporate average is driving the 41% guide for Q2. Okay. You would also -- I'm sorry, Stacy. I would just add. You would expect -- graphic is also a bit lower than corporate average on the consumer side. Okay. So it's fair to say that a good amount of growth is coming from graphics and semi-custom as well as the other stuff? Yeah. It's with across all of the businesses. Okay. Thank you. For my follow-up I had a question on OpEx. You're guiding 29% for the year and you're $510 million in Q2, and obviously, high single digits for the full revenue. So if I have revenue of 8% for the full year that would imply OpEx in Q3 and Q4 of $510 million flat to Q2 levels. Do you think that's realistic? Because OpEx actually stays flat during Q2 levels? Or there's a need to go higher, and if it goes higher does that imply that the revenue growth embedded in your guide for the year has to be above 8%? Yeah. I think, Stacy, the way you want to look at it is the first half of 2019, we do have incremental R&D and go-to-market activities in the first quarter and even in the second. As you know, we are preparing for a strong series of significant 7-nanometer product launches this year and also share gains as we get in the back half of the year. And that's obviously driving the OpEx.
Overall, for the year, we are comfortable in the 29% for the year of overall revenue from an OpEx standpoint. And as you have seen us in the past, we do have a way of modulating the OpEx that need it. But right now, we are investing in the roadmaps, we're investing product launches and the go-to-market activities and very focused to make sure that we are well-positioned in the first half going to the second half where we see the revenue lift compared to the first half of year 2019. Does that apply OpEx -- you see OpEx coming up at the current levels for the rest of the year then? Or does it go down or stay flat? $510 million is the guide for Q2, and 29% for the year is the way I would say the model. Got it. Thank you guys. Appreciate it. Thanks, Stacy. Next question, please? Our next question is coming from David Wong from Nomura Instinet. Your line is now open. Thanks very much. Devinder, can you give us some idea of what gross margins are currently running at for the client the data center processors and what direction these gross margins are moving in? The client and data center businesses are higher than corporate average and the semi-custom business and graphics as we just said in the last quarter are lower than corporate average, especially graphics consumer side and the data center, GPU side obviously is better. Great. And our gross margins rising for your microprocessor businesses at the moment? I think earlier in the year this is the second quarter, we are getting the second quarter at 21% guide and our guidance for the year is greater than 41% on an annual basis, is what we have stated so far. Okay. Great. And Lisa, my last question. In 2020, do you expect meaningful semi-custom revenues outside the game console space? And if so, what type of applications will be semi-custom chips we used in? Yes, David, so as it relates the semi-custom business, as we go out in time, we do expect additional applications other than consoles, but consoles are a large piece of the business, and so you would expect that they would continue to be a large piece of the business. Great. Thanks. And your next question today is coming from Mitch Steves from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live. Just one quick historic one and then I'll queue. But the first in the historical side for March 2018, did you guys provide a rough break out of how your revenue was server related? No. We wouldn't have done that. No, we haven't done that. Not that specific. I think server is, if you're referring to the CPU side, it's within the EESC segment. Okay. And then if I look at the second half of the year, you guys tried to talk to for around 41%, 42% kind of gross margin rough level. So is it safe to assume that we should see a pretty big step function in September quarter on the gross margin? Or is that, I guess, is that incorrect, is that aggressive? I think you're looking at it from a viewpoint of the product mix. I'd say we are shipping, like Lisa said, run purpose for margin Q3. We have a couple of other new products that was not shipping in Q3, and we’ll see how the margin comes out when we come in and talk about Q3 about 90 days from now. Got it. Thank you. And your next question is coming from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Great. Thank you. I'm wondering if you can talk about gross margin in the consul segment, obviously, that's been pretty low historically. You also have customers funding for R&D but as you look to the next generation of consoles, do you see opportunity to improve the gross margin in that space? Yeah, Joe. I think it's a bit early to talk about margins for the next generation. As you stated, the gross margins of the console business are below corporate average. The operating margins are quite good because the customers are paying the engineering expenses for it. But I think the gross margins are below corporate average. We would expect though and I think you would expect us, as the company continues to grow, the percentage of the company that is semi-custom is lower than it has historically been. Yeah, that makes sense. And then if you look at the GPU data center opportunities, the gross margin there, how does that compare to, say, the discrete graphics portion of your business as a compressed the corporate average, things like that? The GPU data center business would be above corporate average and above our consumer graphics business. Great. Thank you. Thank you, Joe. Next question? Certainly. Your next question is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Hi, thanks for taking my question. I have a couple questions on the server strategy longer term. Can you help us understand ultimately what percentage of the workloads in the cloud, do you expect to target? And -- that's the first part of the question.
The second part of the question is, I was hoping you could provide some color on the customization strategy? I think Intel may argue that they're embedding that blocks for the customers, is that something that you do or you think about doing? Or to what extent your customization strategy fall under your semi-custom model? And I was wondering if your customers on the server-side asking you for like an APU kind of a product wit a microprocessor and graphics processor capabilities integrated together? Thank you. Yeah, absolutely, Mark. So, look, when we think about our server strategy -- and maybe let me generalize it to where it's data center strategy overall. It is a multi-year multi-generational roadmap. In terms of the workloads that we plan to address, we are -- in addition to the workload that we do very, very well on, like, big data, data analytics and virtualization, high performance computing, cloud workloads. I think we do quite well with general-purpose workloads to as we move generations. So as we look at, for example, the Rome generation, second generation of EPYC, we would expect to address well 80%-plus of the workloads.
As it relates to customization for server CPUs, there are varying degrees of customization that customers want, especially as you go through a number of the different cloud workloads that are out there. There are specific requirements that are there. We're very comfortable doing that. I think the customers have been deeply engaged with us since the first generation of EPYC. There is both software customization as well as some hardware customization that we go through. And we feel very comfortable with our ability to address that across the cloud and the Enterprise businesses. And then, as we go forward, I think we are also very excited about what we can do when we put our CPU and GPU portfolio together and really do system-level optimization for the data center. So we view that as an early opportunity for us, but one where there is a lot of opportunity to help customers really optimize for very high-performance computing applications. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now live. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the strong results and the pipeline. Lisa two questions for me as well. First, you have Naples now and Rome server shipping soon, Intel has Cascade Lake with Optane. What are you hearing from customers on the pricing versus feature comparison? And what I'm going with that is, how well is AMD prepared if your competitor decides to perhaps become a little more aggressive on the pricing side? At what point does pricing matter, and at what point does your feature list matter more? Yes, so Vivek, look, we understand that it's a very competitive market out there. It's always been very competitive and we are prepared for it to get even more competitive. When you look at our roadmap, I think we feel very comfortable with sort of our positioning. And the way we think about it is when it comes to the data center market, you know, price is on the one factor and it’s probably not the only most important factor when people are choosing their next-generation products. The most important factor is really the total cost of ownership, and the advantages that we have with our chiplet architecture and our 7-nanometer sort of process capabilities really have a great sort of power performance benefit.
So we are -- as you say, we're prepared for competitive environment, but we also feel that our products, from a performance standpoint and in a positioning standpoint will be positioned quite well in the marketplace. Got it. And as a follow up, Lisa, you mentioned your goal of getting to double-digit market shares and servers over the next 4 to 6 quarters. I assume that will require greater contribution for Enterprise customers, and that is right. What push backs are you seeing from them now? Is it just a matter of time that you increased your Enterprise attraction? In general, what do you need to do anything extra to attract Enterprise customers? Thank you. No, it's a great point. We certainly have deep engagements with both cloud and the OEMs. On the Enterprise customers, we sell-through our OEM partners. The pushback that we get, I don't know if I would call it push back, I would just say that the Enterprise tends to move a bit more slowly than cloud. There are longer qualification cycles because their qualifications cycles on both the OEM side as well as the end customer side. We are continuing to build out our direct sales force as it relates to facing the Fortune 1000 customers and CIOs in that area.
And I believe, we will make progress in Enterprise, and certainly, as we go forward from the Naples generation into Rome, we'll have more platform covered with our OEMs, and I think there will be more familiarity with our architecture as well as more software optimized to our architecture. So yes, we're very committed to the Enterprise market and we expect that we will make progress with time. Thank you. Thank you, Vivek. Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Your line is now live. Hey, thanks for taking my question. Lisa, just curious on the server product, you mentioned Enterprise was a bigger contributor in Q1. Just trying to think about the lifecycle of that big one, Enterprise takes longer to call, so just kind of curious where you are in terms of the rollout of that product that obviously Rome's going to come in at the end of the year. I'm just kind of curious, how you see the tail on EPYC 1 throughout the year? Yes, so Blayne, I think, as I've stated a little earlier, I think the data center business does tend to move slowly. So we would expect that there will be a good amount of time where we will have both Naples and Rome in market at the same point in time, and that just depends on qualification cycles, platform needs and some platforms are being refreshed right away, some platforms are going to take a little bit longer to be refreshed. And so, from my standpoint, I think that Naples will continue to be important for us in 2019, even as we ramp Rome with our launch in the second half of the year. Got it. And if I could just ask on the data center GPU product you had, the Google ramp, I think it started in Q4. Just kind of curious, your pipeline for that product and how you think about the slope of that business and the lumpiness given that large customer? Yes, so we do expect the data center GPU business to be a bit lumpy. We do have several sort of large customers that are ramping product with us, and there will be some ebb and flow as we go on a quarterly basis. But on an annual basis, I think 2019 will certainly be -- we expected it to be significantly up from 2018. And the pipeline is good. So when we look at the pipeline, as I mentioned, cloud streaming is a good workload for us. Google is one customer, but we're working with other customers as well, and we also see HPC and machine learning as additional workloads that will be good for us in that business. Got you, thanks. Operator, we have time for two more questions, please? Certainly. Our question is coming from Hans Mosesmann from Rosenblatt Securities. Your line is now live. Hey thanks. Lisa, regarding Navi, if you comment on it what is the positioning of that particular product relative to the -- your current 7-nanometer GPU? And regarding Navi, can you tell us if it's going to include rate tracing? Yeah, so, Hans, we are excited about Navi. Navi is a new architecture for us in gaming. It has a lot of new features, across the Navi architecture. Things are progressing well. We expect it to launch in the third quarter.
From a positioning standpoint, I probably won't go through it in great detail right now other than to say that it is 7-nanometer, Navi, but it will be positioned below where, for example, our Radeon VII's is position today from a price point standpoint.
And then, in terms of Ray tracing, again, we will talk more about our overall Navi roadmap as we get closer to the launch. Okay great. Thank you. Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Kevin Cassidy from Stifel. Your line is now live. Thanks for taking my question. And congratulations and as you're introducing the new generations of Ryzen, should we assume that ASPs will continue to go up or are some of this purpose built for lower price points? Yes, Kevin. So, as we look at the new generations of Ryzen, our goal is certainly to improve the mix of the products. And so we think, as we improve the performance of the product that we can improve that mix.
Now, the actual mix will vary of course depending on a number of things as we go through quarter-by-quarter. But certainly, as our goal is to continue to improve our penetration at the higher end of the PC processors. Okay great. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Kevin. Thank everyone for joining us today. This concludes our call. We appreciate your time, and attention to this earnings call, and certainly your support of our company. Have a nice evening. Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.","the first quarter 2019 Earnings conference call is being recorded . this is a live call, and will be replayed via webcast on our website . the conference call will be held at the NASDAQ market site in new york .",0.0

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Laura Graves. Please go ahead. Thank you and welcome to AMD's second quarter 2019 conference call. By now, you should've had the opportunity to review a copy of our earnings release and slides. If you have not reviewed these documents, they can be found on the Investor Relations page of AMD's website, amd.com. Participants on today's conference call are Dr. Lisa Su, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Devinder Kumar, our Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. This is a live call and will be replayed via webcast on our website.
Before we begin, I would like to highlight some important dates for you. AMD will officially launch our second-generation EPYC Datacenter CPU on Wednesday, August 7th. On Tuesday, August 27th, Forrest Norrod, Senior Vice President and General Manager of our Data Center and Embedded Solutions Group will present at the Jefferies 2019 Semiconductor Hardware & Communications Infrastructure Summit in Chicago. On Tuesday, September 10th, Devinder Kumar, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer will present at the Deutsche Bank Technology Conference in Las Vegas; and on Friday, September 13th, 2019, our third quarter quiet time is expected to begin at the close of business.
Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of this current date and as such, involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We will refer primarily to non-GAAP financial measures during this call except for revenue and segment operational results, which are on a GAAP basis.
The non-GAAP financial measures referenced today are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in today's press release, which is posted on our website. Please refer to the cautionary statements in our press release for more information. You will also find detailed discussions about our risk factors in our filings with the SEC and, in particular, AMD's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 30th, 2019.
Now with that, I would like to hand the call over to Lisa. Lisa? Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. We made history in the second quarter both as the first Company to simultaneously launch high performance CPUs and GPUs, and the first to ramp 7-nanometer high-performance processors across PCs, gaming and the data center. I am extremely pleased with our execution in the quarter as we ramped production on Ryzen 3000 CPUs, Radeon 5700 GPUs and early volumes of our second-generation EPYC processors in advance of their third quarter launch.
Looking at the second quarter, revenue of $1.53 billion increased 20% sequentially driven by growth across both of our business segments. Revenue declined 13% year-over-year in line with our expectations as clients and server processor revenue increases were offset by lower graphics channel and semi-custom revenue.
Turning to our Computing and Graphics segment, revenue declined 13% year-over-year, as significantly higher client processor sales were offset by lower graphics channel sales. Mobile client processor revenue increased by a double-digit percentage year-over-year and sequentially, driven by our highest quarterly unit shipments in five years. In desktop, we launched our industry-leading Ryzen 3000 processors, featuring our new Zen 2 core to overwhelmingly positive customer response.
Numerous third-party reviews highlighted the superior performance of our 7-nanometer Ryzen CPUs in both multi threaded and single threaded applications, while consuming less power than competitive offerings. Ryzen 3000 processor customer demand has been very strong with sales at global e-tailers and retailers outpacing our previous generations of Ryzen by more than three times at the same point following their respective launches. Based on the market response to our latest mobile and desktop processors and the growing number of AMD powered commercial and consumer PCs, we expect to gain share in the high volume back-to-school and holiday periods.
In Graphics, revenue decreased year-over-year, driven largely by lower channel sales, partially offset by a significant increase in data center GPU sales. GPU revenue increased by a double-digit percentage sequentially driven by increased channel sales of our RX 500 series GPUs and the launch of our Radeon 5700 family. The Radeon 5700 series with our new RDNA architecture delivers up to 1.5 times more performance per watt compared to our previous generation. Initial demand for our new GPUs has been strong as third-party reviewers have highlighted our leadership gaming performance at relevant price points.
We are well positioned for growth in the second half of the year as we continue to ramp our Radeon 5000 GPU family. We had another quarter of strong year-over-year data center GPU sales growth, driven largely by HPC and cloud wins.
We continue making progress expanding this margin accretive part of our business based on our strategy to focus on working closely with marquee customers.
We also announced a strategic partnership in the quarter with Samsung to bring Radeon graphics to their future smartphone and mobile SoCs. The partnership showcases our strategy to engage with industry leaders across the ecosystem to drive Radeon everywhere. We now have deep partnerships across the PC, game console, cloud and mobile markets that contribute to a growing developer ecosystem and installed base for our Radeon graphics architecture.
Turning to our Enterprise Embedded and Semi Custom segment, revenue decreased 12% from a year ago due to lower Semi Custom revenue. In semi custom, we have extended our game console leadership as both Microsoft and Sony have now both announced they will use custom AMD SoCs to power their next generation game consoles. We are very proud to power back to back generations of the world's highest performing game consoles.
As we look into the second half of the year, we are seeing additional softness in game console demand, which is now reflected in our full year guidance. In server, CPU revenue grew significantly year-over-year and sequentially driven by initial shipments of our next-generation Rome processors to lead cloud and OEM customers. First generation EPYC processor based cloud deployments continue to increase in the quarter.
Amazon expanded availability of its EPYC processor powered instances to more than 15 regions and dozens of new configurations. And Microsoft launched general availability of its Azure HB supercomputing virtual machines that for the first time ever enabled customers to run demanding HPC workloads in the cloud.
Turning to our next-generation Rome server processor, Rome is on time and exceeding expectations, delivering leadership performance and TCO across a significantly expanded number of cloud and enterprise workloads. Customer excitement continues to grow. Compared to our first-generation EPYC processors, we have more than twice the number of platforms in development with a larger set of partners. We also have four times more enterprise and cloud customers actively engaged on deployments prior to launch. As a result, Rome is on track to ramp significantly faster than our first-generation EPYC processor.
We are seeing particular strength in HPC where we offer leadership compute density and IO. We had multiple supercomputing wins in the quarter, including public announcements from Indiana University and Norway's National Research Network. Our supercomputing momentum was highlighted by the US Department of Energy and Oak Ridge National Laboratory selecting both epic CPUs and Radeon instinct GPUs to power their next-generation Frontier exascale supercomputer built by Cray. Frontier is expected to be the world’s fastest computer when it launches in 2021. We look forward to providing more details on Rome at our launch events on August 7th.
In summary, as we complete the first half of 2019, we have reached a significant inflection point for the Company as we enter our next phase of growth with the most competitive product portfolio in our history. We have seen some uncertainties across our supply chain driven by tariffs, trade concerns in the US entities list. In the second quarter we stopped shipping to customers added to the US entities list.
While we remain cautious given the fluidity of the situation, the impact to date has been limited and offset by growing momentum in other parts of our business. We are executing well to our plans and see a path to significant market share gains for our product portfolio across the PC, gaming and data center markets in the coming quarters.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our second quarter financial performance. Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon everyone. We are pleased with the financial results for the first half of 2019, which provide a solid foundation for the second half of the year. Second quarter revenue of $1.53 billion, grew 20% over the first quarter. Gross margin of 41% increased 4 percentage points from the prior year driven by the ramp of our strong portfolio of high performance products.
Quarterly revenue was down 13% from a year ago. Strong sales of Ryzen and EPYC processor and our new Radeon RX 5700 GPUs were more than offset by lower semi-custom sales and lower graphics channel sales associated with blockchain.
Operating expenses grew 10% year-over-year to $512 million driven primarily by go-to-market activities and new product introductions. Operating income was $111 million, down from $186 million a year ago, primarily due to lower revenue and higher operating expenses. Operating margin was 7%, down from 11% a year ago. Net income was $92 million compared to $156 million a year ago, and diluted earnings per share was $0.08 per share compared to $0.14 per share a year ago.
Now turning to the business segment results. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $940 million, down 13% year-over-year, as strong client processor sales were more than offset by lower overall graphics sales due to negligible blockchain-related revenue in the second quarter of 2019. Computing and Graphics segment operating income was $22 million compared to $117 million a year ago, primarily due to lower revenue.
In the Enterprise Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue was $591 million, down 12% from the prior year. Semi-custom revenue was lower and partially offset by significant growth in data center CPU revenue. EESC segment operating income was $89 million compared to $69 million a year ago. The improvement was largely due to growth in data center CPU revenue.
Turning to the balance sheet, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $1.1 billion at the end of the quarter. Year-over-year, we have reduced gross debt by $392 million and in the second quarter, we also replaced our asset-backed loan facility with a $500 million secured revolving line of credit. Free cash flow was negative $28 million in the quarter, while cash flow from operations was $30 million.
Inventory was $1 billion, up $60 million sequentially primarily due to increased inventory of our new 7-nanometer products in anticipation of accelerating product sales in the back half of the year. Adjusted EBITDA was $163 million compared to $228 million a year ago due to lower quarterly earnings. On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted EBITDA was $672 million and gross leverage at the end of the quarter was 1.9 times.
Turning to the outlook for the third quarter of 2019. We expect revenue to be approximately $1.8 billion plus or minus $50 million, an increase of approximately 9% year-over-year and 18% sequentially. The sequential and year-over-year increases are expected to be driven by Ryzen, EPYC and Radeon product sales, partially offset by lower than expected semi-custom sales. In addition, for Q3, 2019, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 43%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $525 million, non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $30 million and third quarter diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.21 billion shares .
For the full year, we now believe revenue will increase mid-single digit percent over 2018, driven by significant sales growth of our new Ryzen, EPYC and Radeon processors, partially offset by lower than expected semi-custom revenue. Revenue excluding semi-custom is expected to increase approximately 20% year-over-year. Full year non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 42%. In closing, we had a strong first half of 2019. We remain focused on executing to our plans for the remainder of the year and look forward to ramping our new Ryzen and Radeon products as well as the upcoming launch of Rome.
With that has done it back to Laura for the question-and-answer session. Laura? Thank you, Devinder. Operator, we're ready for our first question please. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Mitch Steves from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live. Yes, sorry. Yeah. So my question is really just two, first on the gross margin side. So you guys are talking about semi-custom coming down pretty materially and that's the kind of the entire reason for the -- I guess the mid single digit growth numbers, so why I guess aren't the gross margins expanding a little bit more, if you're seeing more traction on the server side? I think if you look at it from an overall standpoint ,in Q2, we did 41% in the third quarter in a row of 41% gross margin and in Q3 you're right, with the decline in semi-custom there is benefit to the margin and the margin guide for Q3 is approximately 43%. I can tell you that the richer product mix, especially with the new products ramping in Q3 are going to drive the gross margin, although there is a benefit from the decline of Semi Custom also. The margin benefit is more weighted towards the non-semi custom business and that's where we end up with 43% in Q3. We've also updated our guidance for 2019 and now are projecting 42% for the year 2019. All right. Yes, I guess just to follow up on that. So the assumption there is that by the end of '19 you guys have more share in the server side. So I guess just high level if I assume that 2020 gross margins are going to start going up as well, if you keep gaining share in server, is that a fair assumption for the next year or so? I think what I would say is we are very pleased with the progress we have made on the margin in 2019. The product mix continues to get richer and we'll see as we get closer to 2020 in terms of the specifics, but you are right, the product mix does get better, so -- and even in the other businesses, including the client business the product mix being richer benefits the margin. Okay, perfect. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Thanks for taking my question and good to see the traction and the new products. Lisa for my first question, I was wondering if you could give us some more color around the traction you're seeing and Rome, both from -- if you're able to quantify it somewhat, but importantly the traction you're seeing with customers whether there is any pricing pressure from your main competitor and I think in the past you had outlined targets to reach certain market share, just now that the product is out in front of customers, how are you seeing that traction, with both the cloud and the enterprise side? Yeah, absolutely Vivek. Thanks for the question. So look, we are very pleased with how Rome is coming up. We did ship initial shipments this past quarter and the second quarter to both cloud and enterprise customers. The feedback that we're getting from customers is that the performance is very compelling, both from a performance standpoint as well as a total cost of ownership standpoint.
We've gotten a number of wins on both the cloud and the enterprise side as well as HPC. From our standpoint, next week is a big week for us, obviously, we're going to officially launch Rome on August 7. But from a customer pull standpoint we see good customer pull. Your question specifically about the pricing environment, the pricing environment is always competitive. We expect it to be competitive. That being the case in servers price is not the first variable in terms of a buying decision. And so, we believe the value proposition that we have for Rome, from a overall standpoint is very strong and we see good a good pricing environment for that. Thanks, Lisa. And as, as my follow-up on the qualification side, I think in the last quarter you had given us some color around data center CPU and GPU kind of around that mid-teens as a percentage of sales. I was hoping you could give us some sense of what it was in Q2 and just what the outlook is for 2019 or the second half of the year? Thank you. Yeah, so in the second quarter the percentage is similar to the last few quarters in terms of percentage of our business. We were more heavily weighted towards CPU versus GPU in the second quarter. So we saw data center GPU sequentially declined as expected. The CPUs grew, as expected. As we go into the second half of the year, you should expect that the percentage of our revenue through the data center will increase as we ramp Rome. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. Great, thanks so much for taking the question. Lisa, obviously, it seems like you're making a lot of progress with Rome or at least the initial feedback continues to be very positive. That's said the overall hyperscale environment seems pretty slow based on commentary from your peers and your customers, I guess. Could that impact the ramp into the second half? Is that a concern for you going forward? Then I have a follow-up. Sure. So look, we certainly have heard the same conversation, especially around the cloud environment in the first half of the year. Our plan was always very heavily second-half weighted. And from our standpoint, we have seen a significant customer engagement and pull for the Rome product and we see a number of new installations that will come online over the next couple of quarters. So I believe that there is some cloud digestion that's happening out there. I also believe that given where we are from the product cycle standpoint, we are well positioned to grow. Got it and then as a follow-up. I was hoping to learn a little bit more about the partnership with Samsung, the IP win in the quarter and also Frontier on the EPC side, just from a modeling perspective, how should we think about those two deals if you will over the next couple of years and the accretion to the P&L? Thank you. Sure. So look, we're very pleased with both. They're both very significant announcements for us. On the Samsung side, it's a multiyear, multigenerational deal that we have across our graphics portfolio for mobile. In terms of 2019, the revenue is approximately $100 million, that would be added. This was not originally in our guidance and it offset some of the headwinds that we talked about in semi custom and in China. As it's not pure IP though, so the way you should think about it is, there is some specific development expenses that are being that are part of that that deal. And so those will be part of the COGS portion of that.
As it relates to Frontier, Frontier again very, very significant deal for us. It is NRE for the next couple of years to really get the software infrastructure. I would say that's not material. It's a relatively smaller number and then the actual deployment will be in 2021. So the bulk of the CPU and the GPU revenue will be in 2021 with a small portion of that perhaps in the second half of 2020. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Matt Ramsay from Cowen & Company. Your line is now live. Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Lisam I think we'll be hearing plenty about Rome next week. I wanted to ask some questions about your PC business going into the back half of the year. The desktop momentum seems there -- the notebook space, Intel is obviously going on to 10-nanometer for a portion of that portfolio and it seems that 7-nanometer refresh on your side is a little bit later.
Yet the SKU coverage you've talked about I think is 50% higher than it was last year for back-to-school and holidays. So maybe you could talk a little bit about the momentum in the PC business into the back half and the differences between what you might see in desktop and notebook? Thank you. Yeah. Sure, Matt. So look, we're pleased with the progress of our PC business. In the second quarter we had notebook perform very well. We saw a ramp of our second-generation mobile product and that is due to some of the additional platforms that we mentioned. Going into the second half of the year on the desktop side, our third-generation Ryzen products are very well positioned. We expect to ramp significant production here in the third quarter and we expect that to lead to share gains.
And we're also feeling quite good about the mobile products into the second half of the year. We've made progress on both consumer and commercial. We have always been strong in consumer, but on the commercial side, we have a number of new platforms as well. And those are ramping here into the second half of the year. So overall, I think the PC business continues to be a good opportunity for us to gain share through the second half of these. Got it. Thank you. And as a follow-up from me a couple of things for Devinder. I wonder if you might talk about the margin -- or gross margin differential between some of the new 7-nanometer products that you're rolling out versus some of the predecessor products that were either on 12 or 14, just so we can get an understanding of magnitude and before you take that just congrats on cash positive for the Company overall even if -- some of that [indiscernible] Okay. Yeah, so on the margin side, the new products, as we have said previously in aggregate are greater than 50% margin. And so as we launched the new products in particular on the 7-nanometer node, those are accretive and that's why you see us updating the guidance in terms of the margin, not just for the quarter in Q3, but also for the year. And from that standpoint if the product mix gets richer with more 7-nanometer products ramping, that should benefit the gross margin. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Hans Mosesmann from Rosenblatt Securities. Your line is now live. Thanks, guys, and congrats on the execution with the 7-nanometer. Hey, Lisa, are you guys constraints in terms of 7-nanometer at TSM? Hans, yes. So we do have a number of products ramping at TSMC in 7-nanometer and we are not constrained per se. I will say that cycle times of 7-nanometer or longer and so it just takes more time to ramp up, but we are not constrained TSMC has supported us quite well. Great, And can you give us a sense if you can on 7-nanometer high-end Navi and mobile 7-nanometer CPUs, if you can? Thanks. Hans, you asked the good product questions, I would say they are coming. You should expect that our execution on those are on track and we have a rich 7-nanometer portfolio beyond the products that we have currently announced in the upcoming quarters. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Hi, thanks for taking my question. Lisa, you have a lot of things working for you at. You got Rome, Ryzen, the GPU portfolio, where you seen the biggest upside surprise on the feedback that you were getting relative to your original expectations? Yes, so look, Mark, I think all products have really performed quite well. I think the third-generation Ryzen desktop, both in terms of the reviews -- third party reviews, as well as just the customer interest. What we see is, obviously, it's only been in market for three weeks. And so we watch the data points very carefully, but across the globe, we're seeing sort of significant uptick in our share in the desktop market. I think Navi has come out and positioned very well.
We're very pleased with our RDNA architecture. Navi is the first step and we have a couple of more steps going and then we'll talk much more about EPYC next week. I think the key thing is the products have been on schedule and at/or above the performance. So our goal is of course, to turn that into revenue growth in the second half of the year. That's great color. Thank you. And a follow-up if I may. You mentioned the Gen 5 game console wins at Microsoft and Sony. Can you give us a sense, when do these start to ramp? When they ramp, do you book the revenues as you build inventory, as you did the previous generation and is there going to be a -- should we think about anything differently on the gross margin profile? Is it going to be similar to what you've had in the past on these things. So, just some color on the Gen 5 game consoles? Thank you. Sure. So Mark, we're proud of the wins at Sony and Microsoft. Those are big wins for us and as you know over many years. We can't comment on specific customers and their ramp profiles. The only thing I will say is, you can expect that in general consumer ramps are second-half weighted, especially weighted towards the holiday season.
So you would expect that. And then as it relates to the gross margin profiles, with our semi-custom business model, I think the margins will be under the corporate average. However, our business model is actually quite different. If you look forward to our business model, the growth that we see across all of our other products Ryzen, EPYC, Radeon is actually quite significant. And so the percentage of semi-custom as a percent of the overall business will be lower than, for example, in the last few years. That's very helpful. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your line is now live. Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. My first one, I want to follow up on that second half gross margin question again. I want to put some numbers behind that. So you're guiding 43% for Q3. Your implied guidance for Q4 is 43% to maybe under, it's only up about 160 bps year-over-year and flat sequentially, but you're guiding Q4 revenue is up over 50% year-over-year and consoles have to be falling like 40% to 50% sequentially.
So the mix must be massively switching over to the new products, that in aggregate have gross margins over 50%. Why are gross margins only been guided up like a 160 bps year-over-year in Q4, given that kind of a revenue trajectory lighter than flat sequentially even with revenues growing over 20% sequentially, quarter-over-quarter into Q4? I just -- I don't understand. Yeah, Stacy. Let me start and then maybe Devinder can add to it. So look we guide approximately to the full margin points. What you should expect as we go from Q3 to Q4, is that the product mix will get better. So we will expect more new products and from the standpoint of semi-custom, semi-custom will be down sequentially Q3 to Q4. And so you should expect that we are not implying that the margin will be down in Q4, and we'll get to the Q4 guide as we -- as we get through the next 90 days. Okay. For my follow-up, the $100 million from Samsung, does your 20% year-over-year growth excluding the semi-custom, include that $100 million that wasn't in the prior guidance? And what is the impact on the gross margins of that Samsung revenue as well? Yeah, so the Samsung additional revenue is included as part of the 20% year-on-year and it offsets some weakness that we have in China. Due to the entities list. As to the gross margin profile, for that, you can expect that to be somewhat above corporate average. So somewhat over low '40s? Somewhat above corporate average. Okay. And it is in the 20%. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Yeah, thanks for taking the question. I have one question and a follow-up as well. Just building on that last kind of question. I think last couple of quarters, you've talked about your semi-custom business being down somewhere in the 20% plus range. It looks like, by my math, your assumption now is it that business declines, maybe as much as 40% plus. And so when you parse through that you kind of factor in the Samsung relationship and the incremental $100 million revenue. Has your -- has your estimate at all changed ex those items, meaning revenue ex the semi-custom decline and then also ex the $100 million Samsung? Yeah, so let me try to help you Aaron with that math. So look, originally, when we started the year we thought semi-custom would be down, let's call it approximately 20%. In the first half of the year, it was down more than that. And based on what we see today, we would expect the full year now to be down, let's call mid 30s, year-on-year.
If you talk about now the rest of the business, I think the rest of the business is close to where we thought it would be, close, plus or minus a couple of percent and if you think about all of the moving pieces, we do have some customers that we're not shipping to in China, that is offset by the Samsung upside and with the new products and how they're coming in. So I think we are pretty close, plus or minus two where we thought we would be ex those factors. Okay, that's very helpful and then, just looking at your product segmentation, I'm curious of how you think about the trajectory of the data center, GPU business going forward. Obviously, I can appreciate that could be lumpy, but I'm just trying to understand of how you see that. Is there a point in time where we can actually get some better visibility into that incremental growth driver, our revenue stream going forward? Thank you. Yeah, I think that's a fair comment. It is a little bit lumpy because of its size and it's fairly concentrated in a couple of customers. I will say that we're going to see very nice year-over-year growth this year and we see good customer momentum across both cloud as well as HPC. On the cloud side, it is both, let's call it cloud streaming, flash gaming as well as machine learning. And on the HPC side, the Frontier win is a public win, but we have a number of others that we're working as well. So I think we will give more color as we go forward, but it continues to be a business that we feel will be a good growth driver over the next few years. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question today is coming from David Wong from Instinet. Your line is now live. Thanks very much. One small clarification and then a second question. Clarification with Samsung $100 million, does that come in on the income statement as a revenue or is it on another line as a special item or something? It's revenue. So it's revenue and then offset by some specific development cost and also in COGS. And like Lisa said earlier, the margin, when you take the revenue and the COGS offset, is somewhat above corporate average. Okay, excellent. And can you give us any numbers in terms of, for the June quarter, your sequential unit growth in desktop and notebook processor units and the sales growth in PC GPUs? Let's see David. So the -- in the -- your question is about the second quarter. That's correct, yes. Yes. So in the second quarter, we saw sequentially mobile units up and we saw desktop units down. And the desktop units down is somewhat due to the seasonality in the second quarter as well as the fact that we were going through a product transition as we were preparing for the third generation launch which happened at the very end of the quarter. In terms of graphics, we were up double digits sequentially, and that's both units and revenue statement as it relates to, and that was driven primarily by the graphics channel. Great, thanks very much. Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Great, thank you. So your full guidance mid-single digit, if I sort of project 5%, you need to get to a $2.2 billion number for the December quarter. I guess how literally should I take that? Is there anything -- I understand there's a lot of product momentum, but that still seems like a big number, just anything we should understand in terms of seasonality or things that would kind of give you confidence in mid-single digit for the full year, still? Yeah, I think, Joe, our view is that we have significant amount of product launches to happen. So as we go through the third quarter and the fourth quarter, both on the PC side, the GPU side as well as on the server side. So yes, it is significant growth, and I think we feel good about sort of the drivers there. Okay, great. That's all I had. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question today is coming from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live. Yeah, good afternoon guys. Thanks for letting me ask question and congratulations on the solid results. Apologies if I missed this, Lisa. Just going back to the Samsung revenue is that $100 million all coming into the calendar fourth quarter or will there be some in the September quarter as well? Yes, John, that $100 million is approximately $100 million for the year. There was a little bit in Q2 and then the rest will be in Q3 and Q4? Is there a linearity you can talk about on that or is it -- should we just kind of evenly split it between Q3 and Q4. I think that's close. Okay and then just a similar question on bridging sort of the gap between your Q3 guide and your full year guide as it pertains to OpEx. If you look at kind of the full year guide you're giving on OpEx, it could imply that our OpEx dollars are actually flat to down sequentially in Q4 on pretty meaningful revenue growth, which is great leverage and understandable in the SG&A line, but I'm just kind of curious how we should be thinking or how you're thinking about the R&D spend as you start to see revenue begin to accelerate again? Look, I think you should expect that OpEx should be flattish as we go through the rest of the year. We have increased OpEx, obviously the first half of the year was higher OpEx as a percentage of revenue. We are investing in the right places and I think the product execution shows that. We will evaluate obviously in 2020 as we look through the overall revenue growth picture, what we'll do with OpEx. But I think we've made the right investments and we'll continue to do so. And John, if you're looking at additional data since you are doing the math, we expect OpEx to be approximately 30% for 2019, if you take Q3 and Q4 into consideration. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live. Hey guys, thanks for letting me ask a question. Lisa, maybe this is something you will address next week in the Rome launch, but in aggregate, now that we're this much closer to the launch in the second half ramp, which you sound very confident on. A year ago, you talked about the market share goals. I think it was double-digit market share four to six quarters after you hit the 5% market share, any sort of update on the timing and/or comfort around hitting that target? Yeah. So I think Ross we feel good about hitting the right target. I'm not ready to update that yet. I think we want to get through. There is a lot of platforms to launch here in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter. We'd like to get through some of that, but we feel that the target is the right target. The product is certainly performing well and now it's about helping our customers get their platforms to market as soon as possible. Got it. Thanks for that. A quick follow up. It was part of a prior question that I don't think I heard the answer to. But is the accounting for the semi-custom ramp, whenever it may occur next year the same in so far as, will you build it? You recognize the revenue. So even if the customer tends to ramp and consumer in the second half of the year, you guys obviously have to build and get the inventory stage etc., much earlier than that and therefore, that would be revenue or does something change accounting wise that that's no longer true? Yeah, that was asked earlier and I don't think I responded to it. But the accounting is the same. So I don't think the accounting changes. The only difference though is we tend -- we would not ramp a product prior to qualification. So there are some -- when you're doing a brand new product, there is a more involved qualification cycle. And so I think there would be more commensurate with the actual product shipments. [indiscernible] two things would happen more simultaneously is what you're saying? Correct. Great, thank you. Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now live. Hi, thank you. I also had a clarification. Lisa. I'm not sure I could understand. In the delta for revenues, you talked about semi-custom and then you also said that China is having an impact. What specific product areas are those and is that EPYC is also part of that? And then I had a follow-up for Devinder. Yeah. So we did have a small impact due to China. We have several customers that are now on the US entities list and we stopped shipping to those customers in the second quarter. And so it's a small impact, but there is impact that is offset by some of the positives in the rest of the business. So I'm assuming that CPUs, desktop and/or server both right? There is some PC business and there are some server business. Okay, thank you for that. And Devinder, my follow up his on free cash flow. The gap between free cash flow per share, earnings per share is massive. If I look at the first two quarters, roughly $300 million negative free cash flow, but you're guiding for positive. Can you put -- for the full year. Can you put some numbers around that? Is that tens of millions or what's the right way to think about that? Thank you. I think, if you ask me, Q3 we expect free cash flow positive and free cash flow are positive for the year. It won't be tens of millions from a year standpoint. I think it's the pull digit, but I'm not going to give you a specific number. Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. Thank you, operator. Two more questions, please. Certainly. Our next question is coming from Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Your line is now live. Hey, good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. Just curious on the notebook market and so talk about some pull-ins, but also short in the market, your ramping product. I was, wonder if you could parse those items out because notebook was pretty strong for you in June and I was just curious if that impact any seasonality into the end of the year? Sure, Blayne. From our standpoint, our notebook ramps were due to platform breath. We ramped a number of secondary Ryzen platforms as well as some new chrome platforms. I can't say that I can point to any particular pull-ins per se and I think we're still expecting that we see a seasonal uplift in the second half of the year. Thanks. And then maybe just a follow on to that. In your September guidance, if you are looking to win the Compute and Graphics segment, I'm wondering, between the three segments if you can just highlight, which one do you expect to be the strongest? So let's see, I think what I would say is that amongst the product lines and where they are in their ramp cycle, you would expect perhaps PCs to be the strongest and then graphics and server the next. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your line is now live. Thanks a lot. Lisa, so my first question. I just wanted to ask, how you think about semi-custom sort of over the longer term? And talk maybe about cloud gaming and sort of how you think about its long-term effect on you? Because on one hand, you've done quite well with some of these big launches coming up, but you're also exposed to some potential cannibalization on the semi-custom side. So I'm wondering how you think about those two factors? Yeah. So look, I think we like sort of gaming overall. So if you think about gaming overall, there is PC gaming, there is cloud gaming and there is -- then there is console gaming. We believe a rich ecosystem is important. We want to have our Radeon graphics architecture across all those three segments. I've been asked about the cannibalization question.
I think it's too early to talk about that, maybe in a few years. I mean, we think cloud gaming is going to be important, but it's too early to say whether it's really a cannibalization thing or is it an additive, getting access to more users overall. So our goal is to make sure that our architecture is a very friendly to all segments of gaming. Great, thanks. And then I just wanted to go back to the question that Ross just asked about, on the server share target. So it's not, that you are not reiterating that target here. It's more and you're going to update us on a target when you launch well. Is that the right way to think about it? No. Let me say it this way, I think, we do stand by the target. So the target being double digit sort of four to six quarters after the initial 5%. I think we feel good about that target. I'm not being more specific than that, until we get through more of the ramp. Perfect. Thank you so much. Thank you. We reached end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments. No, that was a good call. Thank you everyone for joining us for AMD second quarter call today. We look forward to speaking to you from San Francisco on August 7th and we appreciate your support of our Company. Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference.

Now with that, I’ll hand the call over to Lisa. Lisa? Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon to all those listening in today.
I’m pleased with our strong third quarter execution and results. We delivered our highest quarterly revenue since 2005, our highest quarterly gross margin since 2012 and increased net income significantly, all driven by our first full quarter of 7-nanometer Ryzen, Radeon and EPYC processor sales. Third quarter revenue of $1.8 billion increased 9% year-over-year and 18% sequentially, and we expanded gross margin by 3 percentage points year-over-year.
Turning to our Computing and Graphics segment. Revenue increased 36% year-over-year and sequentially. Demand for Ryzen desktop and notebook processors drove a significant increase in unit shipments and ASP, resulting in our highest client processor quarterly revenue since 2011.
We saw particularly strong demand for our top-end Ryzen processors, and believe we gained client processor unit share for the eighth straight quarter. In desktops, we are seeing strong demand for Ryzen 3000 and previous generation Ryzen 2000 processors. Both product families are consistently among the top sellers at leading e-tailersand retailers globally.
In commercial, HP and Lenovo announced new desktop PCs powered by our Ryzen PRO 3000 Series processors in the third quarter. We are continuing to expand our presence in the commercial market as more financial, retail, education, and healthcare customers purchase AMD-based PCs and Chromebooks to power their businesses.
We are on track to expand our desktop product offerings in November with the launches of the industry’s first 16-core mainstream desktop processor as well as our third-generation Ryzen Threadripper processor family. These products will offer unmatched combinations of core counts, performance, and energy efficiency for the most demanding high-end desktop and content creation applications.
In mobile, we had another quarter of strong double-digit percentage notebook processor revenue growth, driven by a richer product mix and increased unit shipments. The number of AMD-powered laptops from major OEMs has increased by 50% this year, including multiple premium notebooks like the first-ever AMD-powered Microsoft Surface laptop.
We collaborated closely with Microsoft over several years to develop the AMD-exclusive, 15-inch Consumer Surface Laptop 3, which includes a custom Ryzen Microsoft Surface Edition processor and multiple operating system and software optimizations that will benefit all AMD-powered Windows systems.
We are very pleased with our momentum in the client business this year and expect client processor revenue to grow sequentially in the fourth quarter, as we head into the seasonally strong holiday season.
In graphics, revenue increased year-over-year, driven largely by higher channel GPU sales. Shipments of our Radeon 5000 GPU family featuring our RDNA architecture increased sequentially, and we are seeing solid demand for the new products based on their competitive performance and features.
For mainstream gamers, we began shipping the Radeon RX 5500 GPU in the third quarter. Acer, HP, Lenovo, and MSI announced plans to offer the new GPU in their upcoming PCs, and multiple AIB partners plan to launch RX 5500 cards during the fourth quarter.
Data Center GPU sales were down sequentially and roughly flat year-over-year. We added multiple cloud and HPC wins in the quarter, highlighted by Microsoft’s announcement of a new remote desktop offering for graphics-intensive workloads powered by EPYC CPUs and Radeon Instinct GPUs.
We are making good progress growing this margin accretive part of our business, as we continue expanding our footprint with marquee customers and targeted data center workloads.
Turning to our Enterprise Embedded and Semi Custom segment. Revenue decreased 27% from a year ago, as significantly higher server processor revenue was offset by lower Semi Custom sales. We expect Semi Custom demand to further soften in the fourth quarter, now that both Microsoft and Sony have announced new AMD-powered consoles for holiday 2020.
In server, we had our highest quarterly CPU revenue since 2006, as strong second-generation EPYC processor demand drove a greater than 50% sequential increase in unit shipments and revenue. Second-gen EPYC processors are the highest performance server CPUs in the industry and have set more than 100 world records.
Our newest EPYC processors feature up to 64 cores and deliver a 25% to 50% TCO advantage versus competitive offerings. As a result of our clear performance leadership and differentiated feature set, we are building momentum with cloud, enterprise, and HPC customers.
In cloud, Amazon AWS, IBM Cloud, Microsoft Azure, OVHCloud, Twitter, and Tencent, all announced plans to deploy EPYC processors in their data centers. At our launch event, Google became the latest mega data center provider to adopt EPYC processors, as they announced second-generation EPYC processors have been deployed across their internal infrastructure production data center environment and will also be used to power the Google Cloud Platform.
In enterprise, Dell, HPE, and Lenovo more than doubled their AMD-powered server portfolio, as they launched new platforms featuring second-gen EPYC processors, helping us add dozens of new telecom, healthcare, financial services, manufacturing and energy customers in the quarter.
We also secured multiple new HPC wins in the quarter, including three separate U.S. Department of Defense supercomputers and what is expected to be the fastest scientific computer in the UK. We expect server revenue to grow sequentially by a strong double-digit percentage in the fourth quarter, as we continue ramping our second-generation EPYC processors. We remain on track to achieve our near-term goal of double-digit server CPU share by mid next year.
In summary, we are right where we want to be on our long-term strategic plan. We have the strongest product portfolio in our history. We executed our product launches and production ramps very well in the third quarter, as our new products drove higher revenue, margin expansion, and increased profitability.
We’re on track to exit 2019 with another quarter of significant growth, driven by the ramp of our 7-nanometer products and believe we are well-positioned to build on our momentum in 2020 and beyond, as we deliver an even stronger set of leadership products that can drive sustained growth and increase share of the $75 billion market for high-performance computing and graphics technologies.
Now, I’d like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our third quarter financial performance. Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased with our strong third quarter financial results with revenue of $1.8 billion, up 18% quarter-over-quarter and our highest quality revenue since the fourth quarter of 2005. The third quarter showcases our financial momentum and the strength of our business model with operating income and net income growing significantly year-over-year.
Quarterly revenue was 9% – up 9% from a year ago, as strong sales of Ryzen and EPYC processors and Radeon Gaming GPUs more than offset lower Semi Custom sales. Gross margin of 43% was up 320 basis points from a year ago, our 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year expansion.
Operating expenses grew 13% year-over-year to $539 million, primarily driven by increased R&D investments and support for our new product introductions. Operating income was $240 million, up $54 million, or 29% from a year ago, due to increased revenue from new higher-margin products.
Operating margin was 13%, up 210 basis points from a year ago. Net income was $219 million, up $69 million, or 46% from a year ago, and diluted earnings per share was $0.18 per share, compared to $0.13 per share a year ago.
Now turning to the business segment results. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $1.28 billion, up 36% year-over-year, driven by strong client processor and gaming GPU sales.
Computing and Graphics segment operating income was $179 million, compared to $100 million a year ago, driven by higher Ryzen processor sales. Enterprise Embedded and Semi Custom segment revenue was $525 million, down from $715 million the year – the prior year. As anticipated, Semi Custom revenue was low in the third quarter, as the market awaits next-generation AMD-power game consoles from Sony and Microsoft.
EPYC data center CPU revenue grew by over 50% sequentially, driven by shipments of our second-generation product in the quarter. EESC segment operating income was $61 million, compared to $86 million year – a year ago, due to lower revenue and higher operating expenses.
Turning to the balance sheet. I’m very pleased with the continuing improvement of our balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $1.2 billion at the end of the quarter higher than the gross debt of $1.1 billion, resulting in AMD being net cash positive.
During the quarter, we retired $206 million of debt, which resulted in a loss of $40 million recorded on our GAAP income statement. The reduction in debt included $126 million of convertible senior nodes in exchange for 16 million shares. Year-to-date, we have reduced gross debt by $441 million.
Free cash flow was positive $179 million in the third quarter and cash flow from operations was $234 million. Inventory was $1 billion, up slightly from the prior quarter in anticipation of higher revenue in the fourth quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA was $300 million, compared to $227 million a year ago, driven by higher quarterly earnings. On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted EBITDA was $745 million and gross leverage at the end of the quarter was 1.5 times.
Now turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter of 2019. We expect revenue to be approximately $2.1 billion, plus or minus $50 million, an increase of approximately 48% year-over-year and 17% sequentially. The sequential and year-over-year increases I expected to be driven by growth in Ryzen, EPYC and Radeon processor sales, offset by a further softening of Semi Custom processor revenue.
In addition, for Q4 2019, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 44%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $535 million; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $22 million; and fourth quarter diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.21 billion shares.
In closing, we had an excellent third quarter and remain focused on ramping our leadership portfolio of high-performance products to deliver strong revenue growth and gross margin expansion in the fourth quarter.
With that, I’ll turn it back to Laura for the question-and-answer session. Laura? Thank you, Devinder. Operator, we’re ready to go ahead and pull for our first question, please. Thank you. We’ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First one for Lisa. You had mentioned the total cost of ownership in your prepared comments. And I wonder, I guess, I could imagine that the total cost of ownership over a lifetime of a 7-nanometer server chip might be greater than the price of a server chip when compared to a 14-nanometer server chip.
And so, I’m wondering if you could maybe just clarify the comments you made on total cost of ownership and quantify if that is the case how you see it? And how many – what percentage of your data center customers actually look at total cost of ownership in evaluating the products? Is it – does everybody do that, or do some just look at the price? And I’m wondering like, what do you think that has – impact that might have on the competitive pricing environment? That’s the first question. Thank you. Sure. Thanks for the question, Mark. So, I mean, maybe let me give some context on sort of the data center business for us, and then I’ll answer your question. But I think from what we see, there is a very strong value proposition for Rome. When you look at just what we’re able to do from just the amount of performance, the power consumption, and then how that plays into total cost of ownership, we see it across all workloads.
So, whether you’re talking about a virtualized environment, or you’re talking about high-performance computing, or you’re talking about the enterprise sort of workloads, we see a strong performance as well as strong total cost of ownership.
To your exact question, I think, server purchases – or server purchasers are very, I would say, sophisticated. And so, in most cases, total cost of ownership is definitely in the conversation. And it’s not just about performance, but performance at a given power level and also in terms of given density. And that has played out in a number of our customer engagements.
And so, the overall point of – we think that Rome is very well-positioned. Price in and of itself is one factor, but I would say it’s not the primary factor. I think the performance, power, total cost of ownership are all important buying factors. And we’ve seen very, very strong engagement from customers across the Board, across all workloads for these drivers. Thank you. And a follow-up, if I may. On the – when you think about your share gain – that your potential to gain share as you look into 2020, can you talk about what you view as the biggest potential gating factors in that? And like how you’re managing those potential factors? And I’m hoping you can talk to your view on availability of 7-nanometer wafers or and engineering support for your customers who are trying to put together solutions? Thank you. Yes. Sure, Mark. So, a couple of different questions there. Let me try to get through it. I will say since our launch of Rome in August, we’ve had a very strong start. We had a full quarter of revenue here in the third quarter, and we saw that in sort of the ramp of units and revenue.
What we are seeing is that, the qualifications are going faster with the second-generation of EPYC than with the first-generation, so customers are familiar with our platforms. In some cases, customers are doing drop-in platforms, and so they can take virtually the same or a very similar platform that they had for first-gen and drop-in the second-gen, they’re familiar with our architecture.
And so, I think, from a market share standpoint, we feel good about the transition from Naples to Rome. I think the platform readiness across our OEMs and number of platforms that we have across the major OEMs is also very strong, and we’re pleased with the set that are – that have both new and existing platforms there.
And so, from the standpoint of where we are going in the fourth quarter into 2020, I think we feel very, very good about where we are with the data center customers. As it relates to customer support and all that stuff, like I said, customers are much, much more familiar with the architecture in the second-generation compared to the first-generation, and that is good for the ramp of Rome.
As it relates to, I think, you asked about the 7-nanometer ramp and the availability there, we had a very large ramp here in the third quarter with 7-nanometer. We essentially ramped three full product families; Ryzen, EPYC, as well as our Radeon Gaming product families in the third quarter, and it went very well.
We’re very pleased with it. It’s the fastest ramp that we have done certainly in recent memory. And going into the fourth quarter and into 2020, I think, we feel very good about the availability of Rome, as well as the rest of our products. Thank you. Very helpful. Thank you. Our next question today is coming from David Wong from Instinet. Your line is now live. Thanks very much. Can you give us an idea of what your revenues were from 7-nanometer products in the September quarter and what you reckon they’ll be in the December quarter? I think what I can say, David, and I’ll start, maybe Devinder has some additional comments. The ramp for 7-nanometer has gone very quickly in – here in the third quarter. When we look at overall new product revenue, certainly in the third quarter, we had a significant piece of that, the 7-nanometer. That will increase, again, as we go into the fourth quarter as well. And so, the way to think about it is for our major product lines. We’re transitioning very fast from 14 to 7. Okay, great. And within your Computing and Graphics segment, is that 36% sequential growth? So could you give us some idea of how – what client CPU sales grew sequentially? And separately, what the PC GPU sales sequential growth was? Yes. So, if you look at the CG segment from a sequential standpoint, we saw the client CPUs increase the most, and those were certainly the driver being both desktop and mobile. Desktop was higher than mobile, but both grew very nicely.
If you look at GPUs overall, they actually declined a bit sequentially, and that decline was primarily driven by data center GPUs, which declined just due to some of the buying cycles in the cloud. Overall, gaming did well, and we continue to expect that. As we go into the fourth quarter, you’ll see that the data center GPUs will increase, as well as I mentioned in the prepared remarks that client and graphics would also increase. Great. Thanks very much. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Matt Ramsay from Cowen. Your line is now live. Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Before I jump into questions, just congrats to Devinder on being cash positive. The – Lisa, a couple of questions on Rome. We’ve been tracking some of the strength at Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. But I wonder if you might comment a little bit about the server business in China, given some disruptions there just to overall CapEx, and also the OEM business that you’re now ramping with Dell, HP, and Lenovo, and how you expect those things to trend over the next couple of quarters? Thank you. Yes. So Matt, as we look – so let me answer the first question as it relates to the cloud customers. I think we are very pleased with the cloud adoption. We are engaged across all major Tier 1 and many of the Tier 2 service providers, and I think we’re making good progress there.
As it relates specifically to China, we are well engaged. There are in both cloud and enterprise. Obviously, there is a little bit of disruption due to some of the China customers that are on the entities list, and we follow that closely. But as it relates, overall, I think, we believe that there is strong pull for Rome both across cloud as well as enterprise.
On the enterprise side, what I will say is that, the HPC market has been really good for us. And so we have won quite a few of the bids and they tend to be early adopters of the technology. And so that’s one indication of the strong value proposition.
As we go into more general enterprise, the launch of HPE, Dell and Lenovo, as well as Super Micro and the other ODM platforms is broader than our – the first-generation of EPYC and we’re seeing that in the pipeline that we see. So a lot of activity going on right now. And we feel really good about how that’s going to develop over the next couple of quarters in terms of enterprise wins. Thanks very much for that. Just as a follow-up from me on the client business, obviously a lot of progress that’s been made with the results that you’ve just put up. And I kind of go back to some comments made by your primary competitor on their call, I think, talking about tightness in their own 14-nanometer supply, and also that they maybe not addressed some of the lower tiers of the market yet, your ASPs are up quite strongly. I wonder how much some of the supply tightness from your competitor might have led to these gains versus what sort of the merits of your own product? If there’s anything you could talk about that, Lisa, that’d be really helpful? Thank you. Yes. Sure, Matt. So the client business has really had a very strong year. I mean, if you look at how it’s played out over the last couple of quarters, I’ll say that, in our desktop portfolio, the third-gen Ryzen has done very, very well. It’s extremely well-positioned. And where we’re seeing the highest demand is at the highest tier sort of in the Ryzen 9 and the Ryzen 7. And so that’s why you see the ASP strength in the business.
Mobile is also ramping very nicely. And what we’re seeing, again, in mobile is the mix of Ryzen is now a predominant mix of the business. And we’re seeing actually very nice momentum in commercial, as well as our traditional consumer markets. So we also see good sequential growth in ASPs there.
There is some noise in the system as it relates to some supply constraints and all that stuff. I would view that as mostly, again, it’s pockets at the low-end. I don’t think it’s a significant driver of our business. Our business is driven primarily by our new platforms, the fact that we are in a number of premium platforms on both the notebook side, as well as just the strength that we’re having in the DIY channel is there, and that’s contributing to the positive mix, as well as the unit growth in the client business. Thanks very much. Our next question is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the strong growth and execution. I have two questions as well. Lisa, first on the data center business, I know you mentioned the target is still to be on track for double-digit kind of unit share sometime in the middle of next year. Could you help us level set as to where the share is in Q3 and what the target is in Q4? And if you have seen your competitor react to your server share gains in anyway through pricing or other means? Yes. So, Vivek, as you know, we don’t necessarily want to get ahead of ourselves in terms of server share. But what we will say is, our – the Q3 quarter was our highest units sort of with EPYC. And so we are seeing good strength and predominantly a very fast transition to Rome. We expect that to continue to go – grow as we go into Q4 and into the first-half of next year.
So this is about more platforms ramping and multiple platforms within a given customer. And you should see, we saw a number of announcements around our launches here in Q3, and you should see additional announcements as we go into the fourth quarter, as well as the first-half of next year.
Your question about, do we see any unusual activity from a competition standpoint? Look, our view is that the competition is aggressive. We’ll always be aggressive and we’re counting on that. It’s a very competitive market out there. That being the case, I think, we are feeling very good about how our product is positioned and also the readiness of the product.
So, the question earlier about, are the platforms ready? How is the customer support? I think, it’s very strong. And I think our OEM and ODM partners have done a phenomenal job with the breadth of platforms and that will help us continue to grow overall. All right. And for my follow-up, please. I had kind of a longer-term conceptual question, which is, it’s good to see gross margins improving and the cost discipline. But do you think this is the time to actually increase OpEx a lot and really go after maximizing footprint, right, adding more resources, more systems, rather than trying to optimize profitability? I’m just curious to hear how you are looking at the puts and takes around, whether you should be maximizing footprint rather than profitability at this level? Yes. Look, it’s a good question, Vivek. I get asked it from time to time. What you will see is, I think, we’re very cognizant of where we’re going. So in other words, the roadmap, and I mean, the long-term sort of financial roadmap, I think, we understand pretty well. We want to show leverage on both top and bottom line, and that’s certainly our goal.
We did spend a little bit more this year than we originally planned, and that was frankly, because the opportunities are very strong. And most of the additional spend is targeted at R&D with the notion of platform investments, software investments to ensure that we capture the opportunities that we have. I think we have the right balance, Vivek. And certainly, as we go into 2020, we’ll continue to look at that balance. But I think we are very well balanced between top line and bottom line growth. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question is coming from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live. Yes. Congratulations, guys. Thanks for let me ask the question. Lisa, I guess, my first question is, can you help me understand a little bit about the traction you’re getting in the enterprise market on both Ryzen and in EPYC? And kind of what milestone should we be looking at relative to that sort of vertical? Yes. So the – we’re very excited about the opportunities for us in the commercial space. And I will tell you, when we look at our go-to-market investments, we are putting a lot of feet on the street, as well as just general go-to-market around commercial.
Starting with Ryzen. I think, you have seen and you should have seen that the number of commercial platforms that we have continues to get stronger. And it’s not just the number of platforms, but the quality of the platforms. Certainly, Lenovo ThinkPad is a premium brand that is very key. We have a very strong HP commercial offerings. We have additional desktops coming out as well.
What we are seeing is good traction in the commercial space, and that is a stronger part of the PC market. And we’ll continue to talk about that as it relates to new platforms. Certainly, as we refresh our mobile platform going into next year, I think, you’ll see even stronger commercial offerings there. We’re investing heavily in security and manageability and all those other aspects that are important in the commercial space.
As it relates to EPYC in the enterprise, I’m actually very encouraged with what we see in the enterprise. We had originally said that, we thought we would be more cloud, sort of cloud would go first and then enterprise would take longer. I think, what we currently see is, cloud is certainly a big driver of our business, but our enterprise business is coming along very nicely. And I really would say that, the key metrics there are more top tier brands adopting EPYC and talking about that publicly.
We have had a number of engagements. I mentioned earlier that the pipeline that we see in enterprise across our top OEM has increased very significantly, just in the last sort of two months since we launched. So the awareness around EPYC, as well as the awareness around these new platforms, I think is strong and we’ll continue to build that out as we go forward. That’s helpful. Lisa, then may be from my follow-up, as really the analyst community look out to modeling 2020, the GPU/CPU is relatively straightforward relative to market share expectations we might have. I’m just kind of curious if you could give us some help on the Semi Custom business, it’s impacted by ASC 606 and also we’ve got a new gaming cycle next year. I know you don’t want to preannounce customer product. But how should we think about the Semi Custom business trending throughout 2020 in broad strokes? Yes. So I think it’s a good question and we will certainly give you more guidance as we get into 2020. But the way to think about it at a high level is, we are going to a product transition with Semi Custom now. And in 2019, for example, we’ve had the unusual cycle where the second-half of 2019 is pretty soft for Semi Custom compared to the first-half. And what you should expect in 2020 is that that would flip strongly.
So I think both of our large customers have said that, they’re planning a holiday 2020 launch. That would mean that the Semi Custom business would be quite heavily weighted in the second-half. So you should expect that revenue in the first-half will be, again, quite soft, with a strong recovery in the second-half of the year. And the way I look at it is, the gaming business, the console business is a strong business for us. And so it will be one of the growth drivers as we go into 2020 and beyond. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your line is now live. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I wanted to ask about gross margins. I mean, I guess, I’m glad to see them up. But given what’s going on with the mix, I mean, I think you said GPUs were down sequentially. We’ve got data center up more than 50%, Ryzen is growing, you have the Samsung IP in there. I guess, I’m just surprised not to see them up more, both in the quarter, as well as into Q4. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of more color about what’s driving that margin evolution, given the positive drivers of mix that I think should be there? I think if you look at it from a quarter-to-quarter standpoint, you were talking about Q2 to Q3, you’re right about the mix of the product, in particular, with the ramp of the 7-nanometer products and the margins are up. Last quarter, we had, call it, 41% and this time is slightly above 43%. And that is fundamentally due to the new product that are ramping and, obviously, some benefit from the Semi Custom business has been down slightly in Q3 compared to Q2. So that’s that.
And then as you get into the Q4 timeframe with the guide at 44% is driven by the new leadership products. Demand for the high-end of the product – of our products pack is driving a richer mix. And obviously, there’s a little bit of benefit, as Lisa said earlier, with the soft Semi Custom revenue. So I think, overall, it’s interesting. I thought those new products were supposed to have gross margins in aggregate of over 50%, and they’re driving like a massive mix shift and even we’ve got gross margins up a couple of points? I think that… …which seem like what am I getting wrong? I think the numbers are coming out to be a couple of hundred basis points up on a quarterly basis, with the ramp of the 7-nanometer product. I don’t think there’s anything wrong. You have to look at the mix of the product relative to the total revenue of the company at the $1.8 billion. And I think that that’s how it comes up, Stacy. I think, Stacy, maybe if this will help. In each of the product lines, we are certainly mixing up, and that’s why you see some of the ASP goodness. But you also have some legacy product, right, and we continue to sell some legacy product as well. And so that’s the – that’s perhaps the other piece.
But I think, as Devinder said, look, we’re very happy with the way the gross margin has progressed. I think, if you look at our long-term model, we had said 40 to 44 points and we’ll be exiting the year at 44. And I think very well positions us well as we go into 2020 and turnover more of the product portfolio to the new products. Okay. Thank you. For my follow-up, I wanted to ask about the EPYC server ramp into next quarter. So you’re up, you said more than 50% this quarter, so that might be what $80 million to $100 million maybe sequentially, which is, I guess, good. Your competitor added almost a $1.5 billion sequentially in data center this quarter.
So when you say next quarter that you’re, I mean, I guess you did gain share, you got 50%, your units were up 20%, but even so. So when you’re saying next quarter, you’re going to grow by strong double digits on EPYC. Do you think that that’s like better than the trend that we saw in Q3, it’s more stuff around? So I mean, if we were up 50% sequential in Q3, do you think we could be better than that in Q4? Is that what strong double-digit means, or do you have a different meeting in mind? Well, I think, we have in mind strong double digits. So I would say – no, and Stacy, I’m not being facetious. But, again, they’re all kinds of puts and takes. What I will say, though, is put in context, that the product has basically been in market since early August.
And if you put that in context and we’re saying that the transition is going quickly. And we have a number of new platforms that are – literally they’ve been in market four to eight weeks. With the way that server cycles goes, I’m actually pretty happy with how it’s ramping. And I expect, as I said, that Q4 will be another strong quarter for us. And it’s just a matter of continuing to diligently ramp the platforms. Got it. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I have a question and a follow-up as well. Sticking to the server or the EPYC ramp, I’m just curious of out of the gate, what kind of mix have you seen maybe skewed towards the 48 and 64 core solutions? And what I’m really getting at is, how do we think about the blended ASP trend on EPYC as Rome fully ramped? Yes. So Aaron, it’s fair to say that, as initially out of the chute, we are seeing a higher mix to the higher-end. So, more 48 and 64 cores as a mix. I think those are very attractive products and really taking the full advantage of the EPYC product line. We are seeing, as you might expect, with that mix that the Rome ASPs are showing lift versus the previous first-generation EPYC.
As we go forward, you would expect that to build out a little bit more. So, we have a full product portfolio for the server parts. But then you also expect that, you’ll get more enterprise in that and enterprise tends to have a higher ASP. So the net of all that is, I can say in the server market, we feel very good about where we’re positioned from an ASP standpoint. And from a sort of unit share to revenue share, I think, they’re actually quite close. Okay. And then just as a quick follow-up, maybe more of a model question. I think last quarter, you talked about the Semi Custom business being down in the mid-30% range. You also talked about Samsung contributions being around $100 million for the full-year. I’m just curious, is that still where we stand? And what was kind of the Samsung contribution this last quarter? I think on the Samsung base, if you look at the second-half, it’s approximately $100 million, slightly about half was taken in Q3 and the other half will come in Q4. So that’s absolutely right. And then on the… And then – yes. Yes. On the Semi Custom side, we had said last quarter that it would be down, let’s call it, mid-30%s. It’s probably when you look at it in aggregate for the second-half of the year, it’ll be down a bit more than mid-30%s, let’s call it high-30%s. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. Good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking the question. Lisa, I had a follow-up question on your server CPU business. And I guess, the question is, when you think about pricing and sort of the margin profile that you’re seeing in that business today, how does that compare with what you had planned for six or nine months ago? Is pricing and margins coming in pretty much in line with expectations, or are they coming in a little bit better?
And then as you think about the margin profile for that business going into 2020, given 7-nanometer potentially maturing into next year, given the mix and given the change in customer mix from cloud to enterprise, so those two dynamics serve as tailwinds for your margins in that business? Yes. So I would say that the margin mix, as we look here in the beginning of the ramp, is about what we expected. It’s about what we expected. So, the only thing I would say and I said it earlier, is the product mix is perhaps a little bit higher in the early part of the ramp. But overall, the margins are pretty close to what we expected. The pricing environment is pretty close to what we expected.
And as we go into 2020, I think, the other piece of it is that the business scale will increase as we grow the business. And so that actually helps to absorb some of the fixed costs as well. Okay. And then as a quick follow-up, your nearest competitor talked about pull-ins in their data center business, particularly in China. Was there anything in the quarter that you thought was kind of abnormal from a customer activity standpoint on the client side, or the server side? And if so, how big was that? And how should we think about kind of the implications into Q4 and potentially the early part of 2020? Thank you. Yes. When we look at, both the client and server business, I wouldn’t say that we saw any significant pull-ins due to tariffs or other reasons. We monitor sort of certainly, very closely the sell-in and sell-through trend. And we believe that what we’re seeing in terms of the growth of the businesses is actually just new platforms running – ramping. And given where we are in the product cycle that makes sense. And so I wouldn’t say that we saw any significance of pull-ins in the quarter. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mitch Steves from RBC. Your line is now live. Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. I just had two. I guess, first, for Devinder, I realized you don’t want to provide any kind of 2020 numbers, but you already asked a 100 different ways. So may as well save you guys sometime. So if I look at the first-half of 2020, is there any reason why the gross margins won’t be higher than they are in December quarter? I really don’t want to get into 2020. There are several product transitions and play as you guys you heard in the product questions. We have a Semi Custom business that’s in transition. We have obviously the rest of the business and transition the ramp in 7 nanometers. Lisa referred to some of the legacy product, so there’s a lot of puts and takes. And I think, we want to talk about 2020 once we get past 2019 and put it to bed and we can come back and talk about 2020 in about 90 days from now. Okay, gotcha. And then secondly, just for Lisa. There has been a lot of articles in terms of some firmware issues or some software bugs and things like that. Could you maybe just help us address all of them at once and just kind of talk about what you guys did to fix them? Because we’re still seeing kind of articles pop-up here and there, and just want to make sure there’s been no issues in terms of the software? Let me make sure I understand what you mean, Mitch, which product line are you referring to, or what are you exactly referring to? So there have been specific articles in Ryzen, right, saying that there’s issues with the BIOS and things like that, and performance metrics a little bit lower, but then you guys kind of really noted that you have improved them or fixed them. But we’re still kind of seeing them in the market even today, for example. So just wanted to know in terms of what happened, and then secondly, if everything’s been resolved? Yes. So your question was relative to the third-generation of Ryzen. Look, I think, overall, when you look at the third-generation of Ryzen in the platforms that we’ve put out, we’re very, very pleased with how that ramp has gone.
And when we look at the sales from a sell-through standpoint, we’re very pleased with where it is. There have been some platform, sort of optimizations that we’ve done through working with our ODM partners and the motherboard partners to try to sort of improve the optimization of the maximum boost frequency, which is, I think, what you’re referring to. And that has largely been addressed over the last couple of weeks. But I would consider that more of a optimization versus any type of major update, and we – we’re going to continue to improve the platform.
So you’re going to see that, as is normal with a new platform that will continue to improve the platforms over time. But I will say that, we’re very pleased with how third-gen Ryzen has done in the marketplace. And we’re excited with the launch of the 16 core, 3950X, as well as the Threadripper family in the next couple of weeks as well. Perfect. Thank you. Operator, we have time for about two more questions, please. Thank you Our next question is coming from Harsh Kumar from Piper Jaffray. Your line is now live. Yes. Hey, guys, just a quick one. As you look at your leverages for gross margins, what would you consider as your greatest leverage? Is it just sales growth as you take share, or is it more products going to 7-nanometer? I think if we look at the product definitely then the new product and the 7 -nanometers are very good tailwinds for the gross margin. But also the mix of the business comes into play, the more data center revenue we capture in terms of market share, obviously, helps our gross margin, the high-end of the stack, in particular, in the client PC business that helps the gross margin. So it’s basically, those are the things that have the gross margin as we go forward from 2019. And as you look out, where do you think margins can go? Well, we painted, as Lisa said earlier, when we painted our long-term target model, we painted 40 to 44 in the 2017 timeframe, that’s what we said. We exit and we add 44, and we’ll come back and update that sometime in 2020. Fair enough. Thanks, guys. Thank you, Harsh. Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your line is now live. Thanks a lot. I think in the past, you’ve given the percentage of total revenue that was data center CPU and GPU combined. Can you give us that number? Yes. I mean, as a percentage of revenue, it’s similar to what it has been in the past few quarters, although, the server portion was significantly higher, as we saw, as we said earlier, greater than 50%, sequential increase in server CPU revenue – unit shipments and revenue, so that definitely helps. Yes, got it. Okay. And I guess, just a bigger picture question. In terms of the kind of competitive edge you have, some of it relates to process technology. But, of course, your competitor could just go to TSMC to build CPUs as well. But I guess, there’s other parts that relate to your fundamental architecture, which is the chiplet memory density in your IPC advantage. So I guess, can you kind of break down, Lisa? Can you break down on how much of the advantage really is process-related versus how much is actually architecture-related? Thanks. Yes. So, Timothy, the way I would answer that question is, we’ve made a set of choices, and the set of choices include process technology, they include architecture, our chiplet architecture, they include sort of our overall system architecture. And I think we’ve made it set of good choices.
Going forward, we are not relying on process technology as the main driver. We think process technology is necessary. It’s necessary to be sort of at the leading edge of process technology. And so, today, 7-nanometer is a great node, and we’re getting a lot of benefit from it. We will transition to the 5-nanometer node at the appropriate time and get great benefit from that as well. But we’re doing a lot in architecture. And I would say, that the architecture is where we believe the highest leverage is for our product portfolio going forward. Got it. Thank you, Lisa. Thank you. We’ve reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I’d like to turn the floor back over for any further or closing comments. Thank you very much, operator, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call today. We do have a number of events planned here in the fourth quarter, and we look forward to seeing you all soon. Have a great evening. Thank you. That does conclude today’s teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day.

Participants on today’s conference call are Dr. Lisa Su, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Devinder Kumar, our Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. This is a live call and will be replayed via webcast on our website.
I would like to highlight some important dates for you. On the afternoon of Thursday, March 5, we will hold our Financial Analyst Day at our headquarters in Santa Clara, California and our first quarter 2020 quiet time is expected to begin at the close of business on Friday, March 13.
Today’s discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations speak only as of the current date and as such involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We will refer primarily to non-GAAP financial metrics during this call, except for revenue and segment operational results, which are on a GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures referenced herein are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in today’s press release posted on our website. Please refer to the cautionary statement in our press release for more information on risks related to any forward-looking statements that we may make. You will also find detailed discussions about our risk factors in our filings with the SEC and in particular, AMD’s quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 28, 2019.
With that, I will hand the call over to Lisa. Lisa? Thank you, Laura and good afternoon to all those listening in today. 2019 marked another major milestone in our multiyear journey. We delivered record annual revenue of $6.73 billion and significantly increased both gross margin and net income as we successfully introduced and ramped the strongest product portfolio in our 50-year history. We grew clients and server processor annual revenue by $1.5 billion in 2019 driven largely by the strongest demand for our 7-nanometer Ryzen and EPYC processors powered by our Zen 2 processor core. Looking at the fourth quarter, we ended the year very strong with quarterly revenue increasing 50% year-over-year to a record $2.13 billion, while also significantly increasing net income.
Turning to our Computing and Graphics segment, fourth quarter revenue increased 69% year-over-year to $1.66 billion. Ryzen processor adoption accelerated sharply in 2019 helping to drive significant double-digit percentage increases in client processor annual unit shipments, ASPs and revenue. We ended 2019 with our highest quarterly client processor unit shipments in more than 6 years based on strong demand for Ryzen desktop and mobile processors. In desktop, we had a very strong holiday season as our second and third generation Ryzen processors consistently held top sales spots at the largest global e-tailers and retailers. We launched our Ryzen 3950X processor and the 24 and 32 core versions of our third generation Ryzen Threadripper processors in November. Our 16-core Ryzen 3950X processor is the world’s fastest mainstream desktop processor, while our latest Threadripper CPUs offer unmatched performance for the high-end desktop market.
In January, we expanded our leadership position in the ATDT market with the launch of our flagship 64-core Ryzen Threadripper processor which is the world’s highest performance desktop processor. In mobile, we had our eighth straight quarter of strong double-digit percentage year-over-year revenue growth as we expanded the number of AMD powered laptops available for major OEMs. We began shipping our Ryzen 4000 mobile processors powered by our Zen 2 core at the end of the fourth quarter. These new processors doubled the performance per watt of our prior generation and delivered leadership single threaded, multi-threaded and graphics performance for thin and light notebooks, while enabling the industry’s first ultra-thin laptops with 8 cores. Initial systems featuring the Ryzen 4000 processors are expected to launch later this quarter and more than 100 AMD based consumer and commercial laptops are planned for 2020 from Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo and other major OEMs.
In Graphics, fourth quarter unit shipments grew by a strong double-digit percentage year-over-year driven by sales of our Radeon RX 5000 series GPUs, featuring our new RDNA architecture. We further expanded our portfolio of RDNA GPUs with the introductions of the 5500XT and 5600XT desktop graphics cards. Highlighted by strong third-party reviews that clearly established 5600XT as the most powerful gaming GPU available for under $300. We launched our Radeon 5000M mobile GPUs in the quarter as well and we are seeing solid design win momentum based on their strong performance and power efficiency. The first laptops powered by the new GPUs are available now, including the recently updated Apple MacBook Pro and we expect many more notebooks featuring our Radeon 5000M GPUs to launch throughout 2020.
Data center GPU revenue increased sequentially driven by cloud, VDI and game streaming deployments. We announced a major update to our open source GPU computing software stack in the fourth quarter featuring performance optimizations, expanded development tools and support for the most popular machine learning frameworks. We continue making strategic software investments to make it easier for developers to tap into the full capabilities of our Radeon Instinct accelerators for HPC and AI applications. For the year, data center GPU revenue grew by a strong double-digit percentage as we continue to make progress growing our presence in this important part of the market.
Turning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, revenue of $465 million increased 7% year-over-year as EPYC processor revenue growth offset declines in semi-custom revenue. Semi-custom sales continued to soften in the quarter in advance of the next generation console launches from Sony and Microsoft planned this year. For 2020, we expect first quarter semi-custom revenue to be negligible and the ramp of next generation semi-custom products to start in the second quarter with revenue to be heavily weighted towards the second half of the year. In server, revenue grew by a strong double-digit percentage as unit shipments and ASPs increased sequentially driven by demand for our second-gen EPYC processors. Our second-gen EPYC processors are ramping significantly faster than the first generation as we see particular strength for our higher core count models where our performance and TCO advantages are the most significant.
Cloud adoption with the largest providers continues to accelerate driven by the expanding use of EPYC processors to power their critical internal workloads as well as a significant increase in a number of AMD-powered instances publicly available. Shipments to cloud providers increased sequentially by a significant double-digit percentage to support expanding build-outs at Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Oracle and Tencent. Microsoft announced the availability of 4 new virtual machines and AWS announced 2 new EC2 instances powered by second gen EPYC processors.
In the enterprise, Dell began shipping their full portfolio of servers powered by our latest EPYC processors. We have doubled the number of EPYC processor platforms in market to more than 100 offerings in the quarter. These new platforms are driving increased enterprise customer engagements broadening our sales pipeline considerably. In HPC, we secured multiple large wins in the quarter based on our unmatched performance and scalability highlighted by French, German and UK national supercomputing center deployments as well as the San Diego supercomputing center.
We are pleased with the significant traction and momentum in our server business and remain on track to achieve our goal of double-digit percentage unit share by midyear based on the growing demand for our second gen EPYC processors. I am very proud of our 2019 accomplishments as the successful ramps of our latest Ryzen, Radeon and EPYC processors resulted in record annual revenue and substantial increases in gross margin and net income. I want to take a moment to recognize that more than 11,000 AMDers around the world whose focus and determination enabled us to achieve these results.
We entered 2020 well positioned to continue gaining share across the PC, gaming and server markets based on having an unmatched portfolio of leadership products spanning from desktops to laptops, data centers and game consoles. With more 27-nanometer designs in production or development, we are very excited about our next wave of products that can accelerate our growth in 2020 and beyond. We are still in the early stages of our journey and remain focused on meeting our commitments as we establish AMD as the high-performance computing and graphics leader.
Now, I would like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our fourth quarter and full year financial performance. Thank you, Lisa and good afternoon everyone. 2019 was an outstanding year for AMD. Our competitive product portfolio and market share gains drove the highest annual and highest quarterly revenue in AMD’s history. We achieved our highest annual gross margin percentage and annual free cash flow since 2011 and we improved non-GAAP earnings per share by 39% year-over-year. In short, we are very pleased with our financial performance.
Fourth quarter revenue was $2.13 billion, up 50% from a year ago and up 18% from the prior quarter driven by strong sales of Ryzen and EPYC processors and Radeon GPUs partially offset by softer semi-custom sales. Gross margin was 45%, up 360 basis points from a year ago driven primarily by sales of our leadership 7-nanometer products. Operating expenses were $545 million with increased investments in go-to-market activities and R&D compared to $474 million a year ago. Operating income was $405 million, up $296 million from a year ago driven by revenue growth and higher gross margin. Operating margin was 19% as compared to 8% a year ago. Net income was $383 million, up $296 million from a year ago and diluted earnings per share was $0.32 per share compared to $0.08 per share a year ago.
Now, turning to the business segment results. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $1.66 billion, up 69% year-over-year driven by Ryzen processor and Radeon gaming GPU sales growth. Computing and Graphics segment operating income was $360 million or 22% of revenue compared to $115 million a year ago driven by higher revenue. Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue was $465 million, up 7% from $433 million the prior year. The continued growth of EPYC processor sales was partially offset by softer semi-custom revenue. EPYC processor revenue grew by a strong double-digit percentage sequentially driven by robust shipments of our second generation EPYC processors. EESC segment operating income was $45 million or 10% of revenue driven by EPYC processor sales compared to an operating loss of $6 million a year ago.
During the quarter, we reduced gross debt by $524 million, which resulted in a GAAP loss of $128 million. These debt reductions result in an annualized interest expense saving of approximately $16 million. Free cash flow was positive $400 million in the fourth quarter and cash flow from operations was $442 million. Inventory was $1 billion, down 6% from the prior quarter. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $469 million compared to $152 million a year ago driven by higher quarterly earnings.
Now, let me cover the full year results. 2019 revenue was $6.73 billion, up 4% year-on-year driven by strong growth in Computing and Graphics segment and sales of second generation EPYC processors partially offset by a decline in semi-custom sales. Excluding semi-custom, revenue was up more than 20% year-over-year. Gross margin of 43% was up 420 basis points from the prior year driven by our current generation of Ryzen and EPYC products. Operating expenses were 31% of revenue as we increased go-to-market activities and investments in R&D. 2019 operating income was up 33% from a year ago to $840 million or 12% of revenue. Net income was $756 million, up 47% from the prior year.
Turning to the balance sheet, I am extremely pleased with our progress on the strengthening balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $1.5 billion at year end, while gross debt was $563 million. This represents our highest net cash position since the third quarter of 2006. Full year free cash flow was $276 million. We reduced principal debt by almost $1 billion in 2019 and entered the year with less than $600 million of gross debt. On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted EBITDA was $1.1 billion resulting in gross leverage of 0.5x down from 1.9x at the end of 2018.
Now, turning to the outlook for the first quarter of 2020. We expect revenue to be approximately $1.8 billion plus or minus $50 million, an increase of approximately 42% year-over-year and a decrease of approximately 15% sequentially. The year-over-year increase is expected to be driven by strong growth in Ryzen, EPYC and Radeon product sales. The sequential decrease is driven primarily by negligible semi-custom revenue which continues to soften in advance of the ramp of next generation products in addition to seasonality. In addition, for Q1, 2020, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 46%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $580 million, non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $18 million and the first quarter diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.22 billion shares.
For the full year 2020, we expect revenue growth of approximately 28% to 30% driven by strength across all businesses. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 45%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately 28% of revenue and a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 3% of pre-tax income.
In closing, we had an excellent fourth quarter and an excellent 2019. Our full year financial results highlight the strength of our business model. I look forward to what we have installed for 2020 as we expect to further expand and ramp our leadership portfolio of high-performance products to drive revenue growth, gross margin expansion, market share gains and financial momentum.
With that, I will turn it back to Laura for the question-and-answer session. Laura? Thank you very much, Devinder. Operator, we are ready to begin polling for questions. Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Your line is now live. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the strong growth and execution. Lisa, for my first one, you mentioned the goal to get to kind of this double-digit market share in servers by the middle of the year. I am just wondering how the visibility is around in achieving this target, what’s driving it, is it just more instances at existing cloud customers? And as part of that, do you also have a share target for exiting this year? Yes, Vivek, thank you for the questions. So look we are very pleased with how Rome is ramping. We have been in market now 4 to 5 months and the visibility that we have is with the cloud guys, we have visibility to the public facing instances as well as what they are doing in terms of internal workloads. And what we see is just the breadth of the overall workloads that they are using Rome with is expanding. And then on the enterprise side with the full portfolio of our partners, HPE, Dell, Lenovo and the ODM partners, we see just a significant increase in the overall enterprise pipeline that we have for Rome. So, we are very focused on continuing to grow share in the data center market and we feel good about our midyear market share targets. In terms of our market share targets, Vivek, I think we will talk a little bit more at our Financial Analyst Day about some of the longer term targets, but certainly for 2020, we are very focused on growing our overall data center share. Thanks. And for my follow-up, Lisa, how should we interpret the impact of capacity shortages at your main competitor? Have you seen any benefit from that? If not, why not? And then kind of part B is Intel did say that they plan to expand capacity later this year and will focus it more on the PC client side and try to reclaim market share, what effects will that have on the pricing in the market and does your full year outlook kind of bake any potential impact of that competition? Thank you. Yes. So, when we look at the PC market, we finished 2019 very strong in the overall PC market both in mobile and desktop. I think that’s primarily on the strength of the product portfolio and the expanding customer platforms that we have. There are some discussions abut, let’s call it pockets of shortages, but as I said before, I don’t believe – we have been on this steady increase in market share now for the last eight quarters and we believe we gained share in Q4 as well. So I think what we see is just the portfolio getting a lot stronger. As we go into 2020, I think we are again enthusiastic about our products in addition to the Zen 2 based desktop products. We have added Zen 2 now in the notebook portfolio and we will have that for the full year of 2020. So I think our outlook expects growth in all businesses, including the PC business and we remain very focused on expanding our market presence in both consumer as well as commercial PCs. Thank you, Lisa. Thanks. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. Hi, congrats on the strong results and thanks for taking the question. Lisa, this may overlap a little bit with Vivek’s question, but I was hoping to better understand some of the key assumptions behind your full year guidance for both your PC business as well as the serve business. Can you talk to some of the TAM assumptions that you are making and the market share assumptions for the full year? And I have got a quick follow-up? Thank you. Sure. So let me talk first about the market and then talk a little bit about how we are seeing the full year. So, if you look at the PC market, I think the discussion so far has been let’s call 2020 flat to maybe down slightly. There has been some concern raised about the second half of ‘20 perhaps be weaker than normal seasonality just due to some of the enterprise refresh cycles that are strong in the first half. We are viewing it as flattish, maybe down very slightly. That being the case back to the comment I made with Vivek, I think we feel very good our product portfolio. And especially when we look at sort of our notebook share and our relative opportunity to gain market share, the strength of our Ryzen 4000 series products is significantly stronger than previous generations and the platforms are also significantly broader. So, we feel good about that. In the data center market, again I would say that the growth of computing continues. From our standpoint, we see it as a good market environment for data center in both cloud as well as enterprise. When we look at our full year revenue guide of approximately 28% to 30% for the year, the highest growth from a percentage standpoint will obviously be server just given the expectations in that market, but we expect all of our businesses to grow nicely in 2020 and that’s just again based on where we are in the product cycle and the visibility that we have with customer design wins as well as just overall competitiveness. Great. And then I had a quick follow-up on gross margins, one probably for Devinder, you guys are guiding Q1 gross margins to 46% and then 45% for the full year. I appreciate your semi-custom business, is that a low point in Q1 and the ramp in Q2 and more so in the second half is probably dilutive to corporate margins, but if you can kind of walk through some of the puts and takes from a gross margin perspective for the year? That will be helpful. And then related to that, if you can compare and contrast the gross margin profile of your semi-custom business going into the next cycle versus the past cycle – product cycle? That would be helpful. Thank you. Yes, let me start and then Lisa can chime in. Overall from a margin standpoint, you got it right, we are guiding to the 46% in the Q1 quarter and then the semi-custom business as we have said typically is lower than corporate average. So as that product ramps in the second half, obviously we will have an impact on gross margin. The guide for the year is at 45%. So, we feel good about that having ended 2019 at the 43% level. And from a puts and take standpoint, it’s really product mix and Lisa talked about the businesses ramping and growing in 2020 with the 28% to 30% growth in revenue. Data center as we have said before is above corporate average. The client gross margin is around corporate average and some graphics and then the semi-custom business has below corporate average gross margins. And that mix of revenue as it ramps throughout the year will obviously have an impact on a quarterly basis. From an annual standpoint, we feel pretty good with the guide at 45% in particular with the 7-nanometer products ramping as we get to the year and that obviously benefits the gross margin. Semi-custom business, Lisa, you want to chime in on the difference between generation to generation. Yes. No, I think I just said Devinder, the semi-custom margins tend to be below corporate average on a gross margin basis although on an operating margin basis given the contribution from our customers for the R&D is actually quite good. As it relates generation to generation, the way to think about it is in the first year of a console ramp, you would expect the margins to be on the lower side and that’s true no matter what just because you are just starting the product ramp and you should expect that the margins will get better as that ramp continues over time. Thank you for the color. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Matt Ramsay from Cowen. Your line is now live. Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Lisa, I wanted to just start with a question about the – I guess comparing and contrasting a little bit maybe a little weaker than we had some of us had modeled and I guess due to the console stuff for Q1 in the guidance versus a really strong 28% to 30% growth for the year. Maybe if you could just sort of layout the year a little bit at a high level and just how you guys are sort of thinking about it coming together from the point of Q1? Thanks. Sure. So, look, we are pretty excited about 2020. It’s a strong year for us certainly with the expectations of being around 28% to 30% revenue growth. We do expect all of our businesses to grow. I think relative to the Q1 guide if you look at Q1 as an absolute number, it is up over 40% year-on-year even with semi-custom revenues very low in Q1. And so that should give you an idea of the strength of the rest of the business. From a sequential basis Q4 to Q1, it’s what we said on the call there is some bit of normal seasonality just as we are consumer focused in our PC portfolio. So, you expect that, that would go down from Q4 to Q1. And then we do have the factor that the semi-custom profile when we are doing a product transition has the revenue very low in Q1. It starts ramp in Q2, but it’s very heavily weighted in the second half of the year. So you should think about semi-custom for this year, again it’s a ramp year, so it’s a little bit different that over 80% of the revenue for semi-custom will be in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year. So overall we think a very good year, a little bit of re-profiling of revenue particularly as it relates to semi-custom and we look forward to executing it. No, thanks for that. As a follow-up, I guess for both of you but maybe for Devinder, I am just a couple of little pieces, for me, it looks like on the operating expense side you are going to be up in the neighborhood of mid 20s for the full year in the annual guidance that you outlined, maybe you could talk a little bit about the focus of that, is it branding and marketing in the PC and server spaces as you grow or is it in other areas in R&D? And then secondly, I think you guys had disclosed the data center revenue mix, so GPU plus server in prior quarters and if you have that number handy? That will be really helpful. Thank you. Yes, let me take the second one first. Data center, it’s as we said in the past, mid-teens of revenue and this quarter it is around the same mid-teens of the total revenue and I will point out there is record revenue in the quarter. So that’s pretty good and we feel pretty good about that having mid-teens revenue, the data center combined server and data center GPU on revenue of $2.1 billion. As far as OpEx is concerned, our guide for the year is about 28% of the revenue guide that we provided. And you are right, fundamentally the investments on R&D and go-to-market and obviously the business is growing. Obviously, there is investments needed to go ahead and grow the business from an absolute standpoint, but we feel we can manage it to about 28% of our revenue overall for the year. Matt, the only thing I will add to that is for the data center revenue, particularly in Q4, it was very heavily weighted towards server CPU just given some of the lumpiness of the data center GPU revenue. Thank you both. Congrats. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Great. Thanks for taking my question. I had one for Devinder and one for Lisa. For Devinder, I think it’s impressive that the cash that you generated 10 years ago, you were $4 billion in net debt and now you are net cash positive, I didn’t think back then we would expect you to be here, but how should we think about capital structure going forward and for the $440 million in cash flow from operations could – I had a challenge reconciling it? Can you share the biggest two or three sources of cash? And then for Lisa, the last time AMD had a product cycle in servers, I think you were gaining – once you hit 5% share, you started to gain share at 2% or 3% or 4%, 400 basis point clip per quarter, how should – what is the right kind of cadence or pace of share gains in servers this cycle and maybe you could just talk about structurally what gives your ability to – or the pace of your ability to gain share? Is it the capacity from your suppliers? Is it is your own engineering support infrastructure or is it your customers testing and importing workloads if you could give us a framework to think about that? I think that will be helpful. Thank you. Yes, let me get started. Mark, you do have a long memory and so do I. I do remember the days when we had the challenges on the balance sheet. And one thing we feel good as we end 2019 is the strength of the balance sheet and in particular, the net cash position. We haven’t been in many, many years as we pointed out in the prepared remarks. From a capital structure standpoint, the priority is investing in the business. The revenue is growing significantly in 2020 is what we are projecting at the 28% to 30% over 2019. And also we want to invest in the roadmap to go-to-market and everything that’s needed when the revenue ramps as significantly as it is going from year-over-year. So that’s really the allocation priorities. From a viewpoint of where the $440 million come from, higher revenue especially when you look at the revenue in Q3 and Q4 of 2019 compared to the first half of the year, we did go ahead and buy the inventory to go ahead and support the higher revenue. And as you know when you sell that revenue in particular, when it ramps up as it did on better margins it generates the cash and that’s why you have the $440 million plus operating cash flow from an overall standpoint. Lisa, over to you? Yes. So Mark as it relates to just server rate and pace, I think the most important thing for us is when we look at from time of announcement or time of shipment to how customers actually deploy and trying to shorten that cycle. So when I look at the difference between let’s call it Rome and Naples, we have seen that time to deploy actually significantly shortened with Rome. And so in terms of rate and pace of server share gain, it is primarily for cloud customers it is having them deploy not just sort of a set of instances, but ensuring that they get fully built out across all regions in the world and also adding additional workloads. So it’s just time is what I would say. And then as it relates to enterprise customers, I think the platform coverage that we have with Rome is significantly broader than it was with Naples and so I am quite encouraged actually by the strength of the pipeline that we see, the number of customers that are engaged and then just how they are deploying. So I think we are going at a good pace and we will continue to accelerate that as we go through 2020. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your line is now live. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I had first a question on gross margin, especially into Q1, you said consoles are negligible, gross margins are 46%, so that suggested that 46% is basically indicative of the business as it stands without consoles. So does that represent kind of the peak of the business on the current mix, I am little surprised it’s not higher given all the new products in aggregate we are supposed to have gross margins in excess of 50% in most of the mix today should be new products. So I guess how do we think about that Q1 gross margins in the context of that? And what are the drivers that take it higher from here, is it basically just server mix or is there something else that can help with that? Thank you. Let me get started and Lisa can add. But you know, Stacy as we talked about product transitions, the 46% guide in Q1, we recently introduced the next generation notebook products. And as product transitions go, you still have legacy product that you sell before you get converted over to the new technology and the new generation products. The desktop products were ahead of that from the environment that did benefit our margin in the 2019 timeframe. And you are right, the console being negligible revenue in Q1 of 2020 does benefit and then the margin is 46%. And from an overall standpoint for the year, it is 45% and that’s because the semi-custom business which is lower than corporate average does come back. And as Lisa said earlier, we are expecting 80% of that in the back half of the year, but by that time also the new generation products in the other businesses including datacenter and client reramping all on 7 nanometers and that should help the gross margin to offset some of the impact we have on the semi-custom business. Yes, I will just… Thank you. Go ahead. That’s okay, Stacy. I was just going to add to what Devinder said. So we don’t expect the client notebook mix to fully cutover to the new 7-nanometer products until later in the year. And in terms of opportunities to improve margins, it is definitely product mix, so higher mix of server as well as higher mix of let’s call it, Ryzen 7s and Ryzen 5s versus some of the legacy products. Got it. Thank you. For my follow-up, if I sort of squint at the second half, it seems to me you are probably guiding it implicitly call it $800 million to $1 billion over the second half of 2019. How much of that you think is console versus non-consoles, because it’s not hard to get a console number, especially in the beginning of a ramp that’s not that far off that number, which doesn’t leave all that much room to ramp the rest of the business? So is this just conservatism or like what else are you expecting here? How much of that second half do you think is consoles versus non-consoles? Well, I think as I perhaps answered to one of the earlier questions, when I look at the full year at 28% to 30% sort of revenue growth, expect server to be significantly above that and then the rest of the businesses are all going to grow nicely. And so you would expect significant double-digit growth in the client business as well as in the semi-custom business and overall we see the aggregate of it to be a very strong year. So it is not all console weighted if that’s what you are asking. Okay. Wouldn’t you get that just from the nature of the ramp that we saw in 2019 we will be doing the compare already, I guess I am trying to – that’s why I am trying to sort of normalize second half to second half? I think we get the strong double-digits in second half versus second half growth across all the businesses? I would say in aggregate you will see, so let me help you with this way. So what we said in 2019 is 2019 overall, we grew 4% on an annual basis, but excluding semi-custom we grew over 20% for all the rest of the businesses. If I do that same type of calculation, excluding semi-custom for 2020, we would still say the rest of the businesses would grow greater than 20%. Okay, thank you very much. Thank you. Our next question is coming from David Wong from Instinet. Your line is now live. Thanks very much. Devinder, you said the sequential decrease in the March 2020 quarter is driven primarily by the drop in game console chips, does that mean that you expect your microprocessor and graphics revenues will be flattish sequentially or if not roughly what does your guidance assume in terms of percentage sequential drop for say PC processes and GPUs? Do you server processor sales rising sequentially? I don’t think I’d say basically that Q4 to Q1 is all due to semi-custom. That obviously helps the margin, but there is a product mix underneath that, that helps especially with the notebook product that we talked about that are moving to 7 nanometers. And then I think your second question about sequential from Q1 outwards, is that right, David? I was talking about revenues from December into Q1, the sequential drop, can you give us some idea of, I mean, there is a big chunk that’s game consoles, right, but what about the non-game console parts of it? It’s seasonality, seasonality in the business. We have the consumer weight from a revenue standpoint in our CG segment and we go from Q4 to Q1, you do have the seasonality coming into play and typical seasonality is what driving the other portion of the decline in revenue from Q4 to Q1. Yes. David, I think what you are asking is we would expect that the Computing and Graphics segment would be down sequentially due to seasonality and we would expect that server CPUs should be up, because we are continuing to ramp those processors sequentially. Okay, great. And Lisa, can you give us some idea of what new GPUs you are expecting to launch through rest of 2020 for PCs and for data center? Yes. So, in 2019, we launched our new architecture in GPUs, it’s the RDNA architecture and that was the Navi based products. You should expect that those will be refreshed in 2020 and will have next generation RDNA architecture that will be part of our 2020 lineup. So we are pretty excited about that and we will talk more about that at our Financial Analyst Day. And on the data center GPU side, you should also expect that we will have some new products in the second half of this year. Great. Thanks so much. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Great. Thank you. Devinder, you had talked about consumer graphics as being below corporate gross margin, I guess, I was thinking that I know you have historically had a high cost structure because of high bandwidth memory, but as the product portfolio increasingly doesn’t use high bandwidth memory and so the prospect to improve that for a consumer GPU to be closer to where your competitors’ gross margins are? I don’t think I specifically said that. I think some of our graphics products are below corporate average from a gross margin standpoint in addition to the semi-custom being below average. And I think Joe, maybe just to answer your question in terms of what we expect in consumer graphics, I think look we are investing in consumer graphics. We think gaming is a very important segment whether we are talking about consoles or discrete graphics. And the work that we are doing around the RDNA architecture in the future generations of RDNA architecture we believe will continue to improve our offerings for both consumer graphics as well as data center graphics. Okay, great. Thank you. And then with the new console builds, you mentioned that, that starts in Q2, but is mostly in the back half of the year? I guess as you think about that opportunity from a unit standpoint, is it the right way to look at it sort of a similar number of units to what we had in the first year of the current console cycle or is there just the compatability that you bring when you have an x86 CPU still and there is probably a little bit more similarity between the consoles, because that points to a sort of a better console unit market in 2020 that we saw 6 years ago like how are you thinking about it just to size that opportunity? Yes. So we do think there is some pent-up demand for the next generation of consoles. Without forecasting what our customers are planning, I would say they are both, we are planning for strong first year and we will have to see how things develop as we go through the ramp, but the overall sentiment is that there has been let’s call it a lull in console sales in the second half of 2019 going into 2020 sort of for some of this anticipation of the next generation. Great. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Your line is now live. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just follow it up on Joe, just want to make sure I heard you right, I thought you said the semi-custom as well, we grow double-digits just want to confirm that? And then just following on, I don’t know what the units are going to be, but is there a content or ASP story to layer on top of that equation as well? Yes. So I did say that semi-custom should grow double-digit as well. And again, it’s a strong year for us. And then as it relates to content, again, it’s fair to say that there is additional content in this generation versus previous generation. Got it. And then maybe just on the gross margin equation, is there way to talk about the mix of 7 nanometer that’s a big tailwind still seems early days at least across a couple of your products? Is there a way to kind of think about the whole company and what the mix of 7 is? Yes. So we just completed the fourth quarter and it was a very strong quarter for us, record revenue for the company and I would say about half of that revenue was 7-nanometer based and the other half not yet. And so there is still a significant ramp as we go into 2020, but we are pleased with how quickly we ramped in 2019. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question is coming from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live. Yes, good afternoon guys. Congratulations on solid results. I just want to go back to the gross margin bridge from Q1 to the full year, I just want to make sure I understand, the drop from Q1 to the full year, is that 100% being driven just by gaming coming back more aggressively in the back half of the year or have you baked in anything for either pricing, competition from the number one guy out there or some share shifts, how do we think about that, is it all about gaming? I think if you – maybe Devinder… No, go ahead. Alright. So I think if you look at it the predominant factor if you are talking about Q1 guided 46 versus full year at 45, it’s just as we wrap those consoles, there is some impact of that. As it relates to the pricing environment and what we are expecting, we are expecting a competitive pricing environment and that’s the way we have built our model. So I mean we have always expected that the competition will be very aggressive on both the CPU as well as the GPU side. And that is part of the inherent model for the company. That’s helpful, Lisa. And then you guys have a ton of goodness on your immediate plate on the server side and the data center side, just with the workloads you are going after, but I am kind of curious you answered an earlier question saying expect more GPUs for the data center. I don’t want you to preannounce product, but how should I think about your positioning for AIs and workload and acceleration? And just given some of the heavy lifting that NVIDIA had to do around CUDA, how do I think about the investment there? Is the scenario that you think you have some unique IP you can bring to or how do I think about that over the next couple of years? Yes. So I think that’s actually a good way of talking about the opportunity, John. I think the CPU opportunity is very immediate and in front of us as we look at the opportunities with Rome and the expanding opportunities. I think the data center GPU market continues to be an important growth vector for us and now I call that over the several year horizons. So when you look at the opportunities that we have, when we combine our CPU and GPU IP together, they are very, very strong. I mean, for example, this is the reason that we won the Oakridge National Lab Supercomputer with Frontier, which are actually both the CPU and the GPU win and some of the optimization that we have done with that overall system. We think that there are additional opportunities like that as well as machine learning and AI opportunities. Our focus there has been to work with large cloud providers to optimize the machine learning frameworks and we had some key milestones that we completed in the fourth quarter that will continue to be a focus for us in 2020 and beyond. Is it fair to say some of the GPU data center announcements this year go beyond just the cloud gaming market? Yes. I think you should expect that we will have additional sort of customer announcements outside of cloud gaming. Okay. Thanks guys. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your line is now live. Thanks a lot. I guess I had another question just in relation to gross margin, you said of the years, revenue in the semi-custom will be in the back half, but does that breakout between September and December, I guess I asked that because I am just trying to see what the gross margin will be exiting this year if you strip out semi-custom, could it be 50% exiting the year? Thanks. I think it’s hard to break it down that way. We are in the initial stages of our planning for the ramp and you are asking about Q3, Q4 we are projecting about 80% of the semi-custom revenue growing double-digits year-over-year in Q3 and Q4. And typically when we have this new game launches, our peak quarter from a revenue standpoint in semi-custom will be Q3, but Q4 when you talk about the ramp of the product especially in the first year of the ramp, it’s hard to project how much it will be and then what the impact will be exiting 2020 from a gross margin, excluding semi-custom. Maybe as we get closer to that in talking about 3 to 6 months, we can probably give you a better idea of that. Got it. Okay. Thank you. And then can you just talk about what your share targets are for the year in PC, I think you are 17, 18 in notebook and you are maybe 14 in desktop, can you just talk about how much share you think that you can gain this year given all the moving parts with the shortages and whatnot? Thank you. Yes. So I am going to forecast a share target for 2020. I will say though if you take a look back at the last eight quarters, we have been on a fairly steady share gain in PCs, somewhere between depending on the quarter, let’s call it, 50 to 100 basis points per quarter. And that changes between desktop and notebook. I think we grew somewhere on the order of 4 points a share. So we believe that we still have additional opportunities and particularly our focus is going to be both notebook as well as commercial. And those are good opportunities for us and play well to our new Ryzen 4000 mobile processors. Okay, Lisa, thank you so much. Thanks, Tim. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mitch Steves from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live. Hey, guys. Most of my questions have been answered and it kind of lines up with the model we got here. But I just want to make sure I got a couple of quick questions. And so basically for Q4, it looks like semi-custom was probably down 50% sequentially or somewhere around that range, is that – am I at least in the ballpark? And then secondly, from a server perspective, I am not expecting here to give numbers on this, but maybe qualitatively how much of your revenue is going to be cloud versus enterprise? I think that’s one of the bigger debates and I don’t expect specifics, but anything you can do to help us and see what should be the mix between cloud and enterprise for calendar ‘20? Yes. Sure, Mitch. Well, I think you are right when you look at the semi-custom business in the fourth quarter, it was a bit softer than originally anticipated. So we had originally said last quarter that we thought the second half of the year would be down high 30s and we were actually down more than that for the second half of the year and for Q4. And as it relates to mix of cloud versus enterprise for 2020, I mean, it will move around from quarter to quarter but I think the best guess at this point is let’s call it roughly even between the two. Perfect. Thank you. Operator, time for one more question please. Certainly. Our final question today is coming from Srini Pajjuri from SMBC. Your line is now live. Thank you for squeezing me in. Lisa, maybe on the supply side, you are guiding for pretty strong growth here, I am just curious have you already logged in the supply for 7-nanometer and as we go into second half of the year especially as you ran the game consoles, I believe that those die sizes tend to be very large. I am just curious if you were to get upside and how you are feeling about your supply situation? Thank you. Yes. So PSMC has supported us very well through the first couple of quarters of our 7-nanometer ramp here in 2019. I think as we go into 2020, there will certainly be a significant growth for us in 7-nanometer. Our current visibility supports the revenue guide that we gave you. It is fair to say that wafer supply is tight and so it’s really important for us to be planning with our customers and that’s what we are working on. Thank you. Good luck. Thank you. Thank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I’d like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments. Thank you very much everyone for joining us today. We do look forward to having you join us on Thursday, March 5 for our Financial Analyst Day which will also be broadcast from our website. Thank you very much. Have a great day and we will talk with you again soon. Thank you. That does conclude today’s teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
It’s now my pleasure to introduce Ruth Cotter, Senior Vice President, Worldwide Market, Human Resources and Investor Relations. Ruth, please go ahead. Thank you, and welcome to AMD’s first quarter 2020 financial results conference call. By now, you should have had the opportunity to review a copy of our earnings release and slides. If you have not reviewed these documents, they can be found on the Investor Relations page of AMD’s website, amd.com.
Participants on today’s call are Dr. Lisa Su, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Devinder Kumar, our Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. This is a live call and will be replayed via webcast on our website.
Before we begin today, please note that our Annual Shareholder Meeting will be held on Thursday, the 7th of May as a virtual event accessible from amd.com. We will also be attending several virtual Wall Street events during the second quarter, including the Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference on Thursday, May 28. And our second quarter 2020 quiet time is expected to begin at the close of business on Friday the 12th of June.
Today’s discussions contain forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations speak only as of the current date and as such involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.
We will refer primarily to non-GAAP financial metrics during this call, except for revenue and segment operational results, which are on a GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures referenced are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in today’s press release posted on amd.com.
Please refer to the cautionary statement in our press release for more information on risks related to any forward-looking statements that we may make. You will also find detailed discussions about our risk factors in our filings with the SEC and in particular, AMD’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the year ended December 28, 2019.
Now with that, I’d like to hand the call over to Lisa. Lisa? Thank you, Ruth, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. Before covering our quarterly results, I wanted to provide some comments addressing our response to COVID-19.
First, I want to recognize the toll that pandemic has taken on the world. The breadth and speed at which COVID-19 has changed the world since our last earnings call has been staggering. I want to thank the countless healthcare professionals and essential workers serving on the front lines everyday.
At AMD, our first priority has been to protect the health and safety of our employees. We have transitioned the vast majority of our more than 12,000 employees worldwide to working from home, while ensuring we maintain focus on reliably supplying our customers with the products and services their businesses depend on.
We’re also supporting the communities we call home through financial and personal protective equipment donations and providing our technology to accelerate medical research. More than ever, the pandemic has placed technology at the forefront of how we work, learn, shop and connect. And we are proud to be providing many of the components powering these essential technologies.
Against that backdrop, we performed well in the first quarter. Revenue increased 40% year-over-year to $1.79 billion, as demand for 7 nanometer Ryzen, Radeon and EPYC processors drove record first quarter revenue and our highest gross margin in eight years.
I’m pleased with our execution in the quarter, as we quickly adopted our global operations to navigate pockets of supply chain disruption and addressed geographic and market demand shifts caused by COVID-19.
Turning to our Computing and Graphics segment. First quarter segment revenue increased 73% year-over-year to $1.44 billion, driven by increased Ryzen and Radeon processor adoption.
We saw some softness based on the COVID-19 situation in China that impacted PC-related sales in the first quarter. While both component and system demand were relatively strong at online vendors, offline channel sales were weaker-than-expected as many retail locations across China were closed for much of the quarter. PC demand in the rest of the world was strong, offsetting the softness in China.
Client processor revenue grew significantly year-over-year, as strong Ryzen processor demand resulted in significant double-digit percentage increases in unit shipments and ASP. As a result, we believe we gained client unit market share for the 10th straight quarter.
In desktop, overall demand for our latest Ryzen 3000 and prior generation Ryzen 2000 processor families were strong, both of which continue to top retailer bestseller lists and have more than 50% share of premium processor sales at many top global e-tailers.
In mobile, unit shipments increased by a strong double-digit percentage year-over-year. We set a record for quarterly notebook processor revenue, driven by sustained demand for our previous generation offerings and the ramp of the first Ryzen mobile 4000 design wins.
Initial consumer notebooks featuring our new Ryzen 4000 processors launched to strong demand, based on reviews that demonstrated their performance and battery life leadership for ultra-thin and gaming notebooks.
We also gained momentum in the commercial market, winning multiple large-scale deployments as Lenovo announced new ThinkPads and HP launched commercial class ProBooks powered by our latest Ryzen 4000 mobile processors.
We are on track to accelerate our mobile growth this year, as Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo and other OEMs are expected to launch more than 135 new Ryzen-powered consumer and commercial notebooks over the coming quarters.
In graphics, first quarter unit shipments and revenue both grew by a double-digit percentage year-over-year, driven largely by sales of our Radeon RX 5000 series, desktop and notebook GPUs. Desktop channel sales increased based on solid demand for both 7 nanometer RDNA graphics cards and previous generation Radeon RX 500 series GPUs.
In mobile, demand for notebooks powered by our Radeon 5000M mobile GPUs, including the latest Apple MacBook Pro and other gaming notebooks, drove a richer mix, as customers transition their platforms to our new RDNA mobile offerings.
Development of our RDNA to GPUs continues to progress well. We are on track to launch our next-generation gaming GPUs later this year, with a 50% performance per watt increase compared to our current offerings.
In the data center, Microsoft Azure introduced new virtual machines, optimized for visualization workloads, powered by our Radeon Instinct MI25 GPUs. Microsoft is using our differentiated virtualization technology to partition a GPU for the first time in the same way they partitioned multi-core CPUs, allowing customers to tailor the GPU capability to meet the needs of their specific workload.
Turning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. Revenue of $348 million decreased 21% year-over-year, as lower semi-custom revenue more than offset a significant increase in server revenue.
As expected, semi-custom product revenue was negligible in the quarter, as Sony and Microsoft, both reduced inventory in advance of next-generation console launches. We expect semi-custom revenue to increase in the second quarter and be heavily weighted towards the second-half of the year, as we ramp production to support the holiday launches of the new PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consoles.
In server, unit shipments grew by a double-digit percentage sequentially and more than tripled year-over-year, as we continue gaining momentum across cloud, enterprise and HPC customers. We saw particular strength with cloud providers, introducing new instances and accelerating current deployments.
Microsoft Azure, Google and IBM all announced new offerings powered by second-generation EPYC processors, highlighted by Google launching multiple general purpose VMs and Microsoft rolling out an all AMD virtual desktop offering that also includes Radeon Instinct GPUs.
Several cloud providers accelerated their infrastructure deployments to address rising demand from the growing number of users working and schooling from home. For instance, one of our large cloud customers was able to deploy 10,000 2nd Gen EPYC servers in less than 10 days to support the surge in demand for their collaboration services.
In the enterprise, we expanded our 2nd Gen EPYC processor portfolio with new high-frequency processors that expand our performance leadership to advanced modeling, database and hyper-converged workloads. With these new offerings, our 2nd Gen EPYC processor family now includes both the highest performance per core and performance per socket processors in the industry.
We continue winning in HPC, highlighted by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories, announcing they selected next-generation AMD EPYC CPUs and Radeon Instinct GPUs to power their El Capitan supercomputer, which is expected to deliver more than two exaflops of computing performance when it is deployed in early 2023.
We are incredibly proud that two of the three publicly announced U.S. exascale supercomputing systems will exclusively use AMD CPUs and GPUs, clearly positioning AMD as the exascale computing leader based on our high-performance computing and graphics technologies and software capabilities.
In closing, our long-term strategy and growth drivers remain unchanged. Although there are some near-term uncertainties in the demand environment, we are well-positioned to navigate through this situation. We have a solid financial foundation and our product portfolio is very well positioned across the PC, gaming and data center markets.
While demand indicators across commercial, education and data center infrastructure markets are strong, we expect some softness in consumer demand in the second-half of the year depending on how overall macroeconomic conditions evolve.
We remain on track to launch our next-generation Zen 3 CPUs and RDNA to GPUs in late 2020 and believe we can deliver another year of strong revenue growth and margin expansion based on the strength of our product portfolio and the diversity of markets we serve.
Now, I’d like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our first quarter financial performance. Devinder? Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. We performed well in the first quarter as we navigated a challenging environment as a result of the ongoing impact of COVID-19. First quarter revenue was $1.79 billion, up 40% from a year ago and down 16% from the prior quarter. Year-over-year growth was driven by strong sales of Ryzen and EPYC processors and Radeon products, partially offset by lower semi-custom sales.
Gross margin was 46%, up 490 basis points from a year ago, driven by Ryzen and EPYC processor sales. Operating expenses were $584 million, compared to $545 million a year ago, primarily due to increase investments in R&D and go-to-market activities.
Operating income was $236 million, up $152 million from a year ago, driven by revenue growth and a greater percentage of Ryzen and EPYC processor sales, while operating margin increased to 13%, as compared to 7% a year ago. Net income was $222 million, up from $62 million a year ago and diluted earnings per share was $0.18 per share, compared to $0.06 per share a year ago.
Now turning to the business segment results. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $1.44 billion, up 73% year-over-year, driven by Ryzen processor and Radeon product channel sales growth. Computing and Graphics segment operating income was $262 million, or 18% of revenue, compared to $16 million a year ago, driven by significantly higher revenue.
Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue was $348 million, down 21% from $441 million in the prior year, due to the expected decline in semi-custom sales, partially offset by strong data center growth. EESC segment had a loss of $26 million, compared to operating income of $68 million a year ago, which included the benefit of a $60 million licensing game.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $1.4 billion. In addition, in early April, we took the precautionary step to draw down $200 million from our $500 million revolving line of credit. Inventory was $1.1 billion, up 8% from the prior quarter.
On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted EBITDA was $1.2 billion, resulting in gross leverage of 0.5 times. Free cash flow was negative $120 million in the first quarter, an improvement of $155 million from the prior year. Cash flow from operations was negative $65 million, an improvement of $148 million from a year ago.
Let me turn to the outlook for the second quarter of 2020. Today’s outlook is based on current expectations and contemplates the current COVID-19 environment and customer demand signals. We expect revenue to be approximately $1.85 billion, plus or minus $100 million, an increase of approximately 21% year-over-year and an increase of approximately 4% sequentially.
The year-over-year increase is expected to be driven by strong growth in Ryzen and EPYC processor sales. The sequential increase is driven primarily by EPYC processor and semi-custom sales.
In addition, for Q2 2020, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 44% due to higher semi-custom revenue; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $600 million; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $20 million; and the diluted share count in the second quarter is expected to be approximately 1.23 billion shares.
For the full-year 2020, despite expectations of weaker COVID-19-related consumer demand in the second-half of the year, we expect annual revenue growth of approximately 25%, plus or minus 5 percentage points. In addition, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 45% unchanged from prior guidance and non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately 29% of revenue.
In closing, while the market environment has become more challenging given the impact of COVID-19, our first quarter results demonstrate the strength of our business model. Notwithstanding some near-term demand uncertainties, our long-term strategy is unchanged and we are well-positioned with our competitive products and the strength of our balance sheet to navigate today’s environment.
As I finish, I would also like to take this opportunity to thank all our employees for their dedication, flexibility, and focus in these extraordinary times.
With that, I’ll turn it back to Ruth for the question-and-answer session. Ruth? Thank you, Devinder. And, operator, if you could poll the audience for questions, please? Thank you. We’ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Matt Ramsay from Cowen. Your line is now live. Thank you. Good afternoon, everybody. And I hope everyone at AMD is doing well, considering the interesting times where they’ve been. Lisa, I wanted to start with a couple of questions on the server business. I guess, one of which is, how do you – the EESC results in the quarter that you just printed were a bit below, at least, where I had modeled them. So maybe you could talk a bit about how you feel the EPYC business is tracking towards that sort of 10% target you guys had set for the second quarter?
And I noticed in Devinder’s comments on the June quarter guidance, most – some of the upside is going to be driven – I guess, upside sequentially is going to be driven by EPYC. So how are you tracking against that?
And then the last little piece is, I keep getting more and more questions still about the timing of Milan, And I know you guys reiterated that would be this year at the Analyst Day. And if that’s still the case, just let us know. Thanks. Yes. Absolutely, Matt. Thank you and I appreciate the question. So look, we are very pleased with the progress in our server business. I think, if you look at sort of the progress we’ve made, there were a number of key things that we wanted to see happen. What we saw in the quarter that we just finished in the first quarter, we actually saw a very nice acceleration of the cloud business as we went through the quarter.
I think, as we go into the second quarter, there’s an additional significant ramp of the server business. And so, we expect to continue to gain share as we go through these next couple of quarters.
I think, what we’re seeing from the current COVID-19 environment, obviously, there’s a lot of puts and takes. But as it relates to data center, it’s positive for the data center market. Certainly, we’ve seen some of our largest customers ask us to accelerate some of our deployments. And we look forward to continuing to ramp our server business. I think you asked about Milan. And yes, we are expecting to be launching that at the end of this year. Got it. Thank you. Just wanted to switch quickly into the PC business. One of the things that stood out to me from your commentary in the prepared script was the contrast between strength in the PC business globally versus the weakness in China. I imagine that weakness in China was both on the PC side – on – and on the AIB graphics business. If there’s anyway that you could help quantify that? And we’ve heard some commentary about the economy restarting in China. Have you seen some of those trends start to improve into the second quarter? Thank you. Sure. So, the PC business has actually held up pretty well. So if we look at the PC business in the first quarter, we saw the rest of the world PC business actually get some benefit from some of the acceleration in demand sort of towards the end of the quarter. We did – some – see some weakness in China as China was shutdown in the months of February and early March. We saw that primarily in the channel business, so in offline channels.
Now, we have seen that pickup as we’ve gone through the month of April. And what we’re seeing in general in the PC business is, the first quarter and the second quarter is actually relatively strong with accelerated notebook demand. And desktops sequentially lower just based on sort of the preference around notebook versus desktop in this framework. So those are the key dynamics for the PC business. Thank you very much. Thanks, Matt. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, as a reminder, please ask one question and one follow-up to return to the queue. Our next question is coming from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Great. Thank you. You guys are one of the few companies kind of giving a full-year guidance. And I just wonder if you could talk us through how you’re thinking about the second-half? Obviously, you guys have OEM visibility into a bunch of new sockets and new designs, but your customers don’t seem to have visibility. So what – just a little bit more color maybe on how you are thinking about forecasting beyond the visibility that you have in Q2? Yes. Sure, Joe. So, look, we understand that, there’s a lot of questions about visibility as we go into the second-half of the year. The way we look at our business is, we have sort of a lot of positives in terms of just market drivers that – we do have good visibility, too. I think our progress in the data center market is a positive. We see that with a number of platforms ramping and the number of customers that we have coming on Board. So we see that as a positive for us, as we go through this year.
Console gaming is a positive for us. There’s lots of anticipation around the consoles. It’s one of the largest launches, I think, of the year. And from that standpoint, there’s no change in our view, as it relates to COVID-19 just given what we see today.
Now, as you look at the range, we have increased the range of our guide. And sort of the biggest sort of question mark in my mind is kind of the shape of the PC market this year. As I mentioned earlier, the first-half actually looks a little bit stronger than expected, particularly on the notebook side.
We are potentially expecting some weakness in the second-half due to consumer spending. You sort of have the two – the two forces are there. I mean, one is, there is a pull with the strong work from home trends. But then there’s also the view that from a macro standpoint, will be weaker in the second-half of the year. So that’s the primary variance in our model is what happens to the PC market.
I will say, though, that underneath the market trends, we’re very pleased with our portfolio. I mean, the notebook portfolio that we have in PCs is the strongest we’ve ever had. And we have a good opportunity to gain share throughout the year even as the market may be a little bit weaker than originally expected. So that’s the reason for the guidance to try to give the puts and takes and, of course, we’ll see how the year plays out. That’s helpful. Thank you. And then in terms of data center GPU, I know you talked a lot about the Analyst Day about the newer products and penetration of new workloads in the second-half. Can you talk about the workload that you’ve been addressing so far, cloud gaming and whatnot? And how is that business progressing before we get to the CDNA launch? Yes. So the data center GPU business is an important strategic business. In terms of size, it’s still relatively small compared to the data center CPU business. We are making progress – good overall progress in a number of workloads. Cloud gaming is one that has been a good one for us and we continue to see opportunity in that as we go through this year with the current product set.
We also just launched the VDI instance with Microsoft Azure, which we feel will be a good workload for us. And then we have a number of the HPC wins that we – that we’ve talked about that are going to be based on the CDNA architecture, which is an important strategic area for us, as well as continued focus on improving our machine learning and overall machine learning frameworks and capabilities. So those are the key workloads that we’re going after. And I do think it’s a – it’s an important business for us as we go forward. Thank you. Thank you. The next question is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Your line is now live. Thank you for taking my question. Lisa, for my first one, I just wanted to go back to your EPYC server business. So very strong units in Q1, but it appears that the mix was very kind of cloud heavy. So perhaps ASPs were lower than we are used to seeing. I was wondering if you could just give us some sense of how we should think about server ASPs going forward?
And importantly, if you think of server sales for you for this year versus what you taught 90 days ago, how is that looking like? Because I think your competitors said that they expected some kind of digestion of cloud capacity in the back-half. So I was just hoping to get some more color around ASP and just what you thought of your overall server business for this year? Sure, Vivek. Yes. So the – that is correct. There was a mix shift towards cloud in the first quarter and that did have an impact with ASPs lower. That being the case, the ASPs are very healthy. So, I think from the standpoint of how our business evolves, it’s within the plus or minus of the business model.
In terms of where we believe demand will be versus 90 days ago, it’s pretty similar. And the way I would say it is, we see cloud being strong. What we see is not just putting on more capacity, but really the ramping of new platforms and so we view that as a positive. We have strong enterprise adoption as well. When we look at our pipeline in enterprise, it’s continued to grow, and continue to grow in the first quarter and continue to grow in sort of the first month here of the second quarter.
We do expect perhaps at the transactional business sort of the SMB type of business may be more impacted by COVID-19. But that was never a large piece of our business to begin with. So we feel good about the server business. And it continues to be a very strategic focus for us. I think the relationships with our partners and our customers are getting closer as we go through sort of the process of ramping volumes. And so we continue to view it as a strong growth driver for us on a year-over-year basis. Very helpful. And then maybe a follow-up for Devinder on gross margins. So first off kind of tracking towards your 45-ish percent target for the year, but Q2 is 44%. And I recall, I think, either Lisa or Devinder, you said that second-half will be more semi-custom weighted, but that suggests some more pressure on gross margin. So I was just hoping you could walk us through how we should think about gross margins in the back-half, given all the puts and takes of mix that you are expecting? Thank you. Yes. Thanks, Vivek. I think the key puts and takes, as you said, continued ramp for the semi-custom, which has margins as you observed lower than corporate average, but they are offset by the strength in the data center revenue. So semi-custom brands in the back-half, and that does impact the gross margin being lower than corporate average.
But data center strength, as Lisa just referenced, that we are pleased with the ramp in the data center business. And data center business, the margins are significantly higher than corporate average and that has the offset to help us deliver as we guided for 2020 the 45% gross margin for 2020. Yes. Maybe, Vivek, I can just add to that. Sure. So in addition to the data center mix that Devinder mentioned, we also expect to see the console gross margins improve as we go through the year. And that’s the reason for the full-year guide at 45%. So usually, what happens is in the very first – second quarter is our very first quarter ramp for the consoles, and so the margin starts a little bit lower and continues to ramp as we go through the year. Okay. Thanks very much. Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. On the – first question on the client side, I guess, AMD has historically had a good presence on the consumer side, but it sounds like you’re making great progress on the commercial side with HP and ThinkPad design wins. Can you give us a sense roughly like what is the split between consumer and commercial on the notebook side? And like how it – how does that play going forward? Does commercial just continue to go faster than the consumer side? And is there an impact on the gross margin between if commercial does grow faster? That’s the first question. Thanks. Yes, Mark. So our PC business does tend to be much more consumer weighted. I mean, we’ve made progress in commercial. Commercial has grown nicely, but it’s still consumer weighted. We expect to continue to gain a commercial share as we go through this year. As that happens, I think, there’s two things in the PC margins that affect PC gross margins. Heavier weight of commercial is certainly positive for the overall gross margins.
I think the other pieces we should expect that education will be strong and that tends to be lower in the mix, and so there are lots of mix dynamics. But overall, I think, our confidence level in notebooks being a strong growth driver for us as we go through this year is good, and we continue to work on the commercial versus consumer mix. Great. That’s helpful. And then on the server side, if you look at cloud instances versus cloud internal versus cloud – versus enterprise versus HPC, can you give us a sense of the split today, if not by percentage in like a rank order? And what you would expect to drive going forward? Our own field work had indicated that your instances were growing nicely on EPYC 2? I wondered to what extent is that being deployed internally on the cloud guys also? Thank you. Sure, Mark. So when you look at our cloud instances, I would say that our cloud – some of the cloud acceleration I referred to was acceleration of internal workloads at some of our top cloud customers.
So I think that is – that’s an area actually where we get more visibility. Cloud instances in terms of numbers for external usage has grown. We announced the GCP platform. We announced the IBM platform, as well as additional Microsoft platforms. You will see more cloud instances roll out over the next quarter or so. But the – much of the growth that we’ve seen has been around internal deployment of the cloud companies.
And then as it relates to enterprise, it is more heavily weighted towards HPC. We’ve done very, very well in HPC. We’re pretty excited about our new high-frequency SKUs that were just launched here in April. They’re actually very well suited for large enterprise applications and financial sector, as well as some of the technology sectors. And so that’s a key focus for us in terms of growing those other pieces of the enterprise business. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your line is now live. Hi, guys, thanks for taking my questions. First, I harp a little bit again, on the server business, I guess, I don’t quite understand why a big shift towards cloud mix will drive HP down sequentially. I mean, your mix has been mostly cloud all along. So why all of a sudden is that driving ASPs down?
And I know you said units were up double digits. I guess, in that context, what did revenues do sequentially? And maybe what were data center revenues CPU plus GPU as a percentage of total in the quarter? Like if you could give any color on any of that, that’d be really helpful? Sure. So we did have a positive cloud mix. But I would say that, the Q4 to Q1 mix had significant improvement in cloud or significant growth in cloud. So that was the ASP sort of shift that we talked about. As it relates to data center overall, we were in the high-teens this quarter. And you had one other question, Stacy? I said what did revenues do sequentially across double-digit… Oh, yes. Yes, yes, so revenues were also up sequentially. Okay. Not as much as units, but revenues were up sequentially. Yep. Got it. Thank you. So my follow-up, again, I want to talk a little bit about the share target. So I know you’d said 10% share give or take by the middle of this year. If I just – if I even just take your entire EESC revenue and I take Intel’s data center revenue this quarter, you’d be about 5% on revenue share. And I know you’re guiding for growth next quarter. But I mean, just given the magnitude, it doesn’t feel like that’s going to double in the quarter. So just how are you feeling about that 10% guide in the middle of this year? Is that getting pushed out? Are we defining it wrong? Like how should we be thinking about that? Yes. So the way we define the share target, and it very much is sort of the view of – we expect about 20 million units a year in terms of single socket and dual socket servers. That’s about 5 million units a quarter. So 10% share is about 0.5 million units. From where we look today, we look to be on track to that. Q2 is actually our… That’s about Q2? Yes. Q2 is actually our strongest backlog quarter that we’ve seen. So, I think that’s our current visibility today. Is that $20 million an appropriate number, though, given you’re now playing in comp, whereas maybe when you gave that target before you weren’t playing in comp? Isn’t the total target at the total market is more like $30 million or even more, right? Well, again, I think, not to go back on how we define the target. I think, I’ve given you how we define the target and I think that’s an appropriate way to define the target. I think our comps exposure is very, very early, and I would say is not a significant part of the revenue at this point. Got it. Thank you, guys. Thank you. Thank you. The next question is coming from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. Hi. Thank you so much for taking the question. Lisa, I wanted to go back to your full-year guide. I appreciate there’s a wide range of outcomes here. And you did put up a – an updated number. But if we take the midpoint of your updated guidance and we compare and contrast that with your old guidance, you are lowering the midpoint of your revenue outlook by about $250 million, maybe a little bit more.
In response to Joe’s question, I think you focus is very much on the notebook business. Is that sort of the primary part of your business where you’re lowering numbers, or is it a little bit more broad-based across GPU and perhaps the game console business as well? Yes. So I would say from the full-year standpoint, the biggest variable is the PC business in its entirety. So that’s notebook and desktop. And like I said, it’s a variable. If I – you can model various scenarios as to what it can be. And I think from our standpoint, when we started the year, we had the expectation of a pretty normal PC environment. I think we would all say that the environment is different than when we started. And given the size of that market, we have, given ourselves a wide range.
As it relates to what we thought before, it’s primarily PCs. And when you look at the other markets, game consoles, data center, we’re about what we expected and the signals continued to be positive in those areas. Great. And then as a quick follow-up… And by the way, I should – I’m sorry, if I can just finish off. On PCs, I would say, though, that I think we’re all waiting to see some of the data as we go through the second-half of the year.
So, I want to say that, like I said, there’s those two competing forces. One is, there’s a strong pull for work from home trends. And the other is just, what is the impact on macro going to be for discretionary consumer spend? And so I think that’s the place where we lack full visibility and we continue to talk to our customers. And I think we’re all trying to make sure that we are well prepared for any of the scenarios as they come about. I appreciate that. And then as a quick follow-up, Lisa, I wanted to ask about the competitive landscape. Your nearest competitor continues to grow wafer capacity, as you know, and they talked quite a bit about accelerating the RAM for 10 last week on their call. Are you seeing any changes in how they compete in the marketplace, either from a pricing perspective or from a marketing dollar perspective relative to how you saw the market 90 days ago? Thank you. It’s – the PC market is always a competitive market. And from that standpoint, I don’t think the environment has changed substantially from a – either a capacity standpoint or marketing dollar standpoint.
From our view, it’s all about ensuring that the platforms that we launch actually ramp into production smoothly. And so, we’ve been working on that. And we feel very good about that.
I think we mentioned that we have a significant number of platforms over 135 mobile platforms that are coming to market here in 2020. And they’re very, very competitive. They’re some of our best platforms from a – from just an overall performance and capability standpoint. So, we’re bullish on our ability to turn that into revenue growth. Thank you Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live. All right. Thanks for letting me ask you question. Lisa, not to kind of go back to the same well as everybody else, but I wanted to hit on the EPYC side of things. I guess, the good news is, you guys are growing very rapidly and taking share, and your reiterated that 10% market share goal for the June quarter.
But overall, it seems like the number has not really upsided anybody’s expectations over the last few quarters, despite the market accelerating from a demand perspective, your primary competitor upsiding their data center group or even their cloud segments within that for three to four quarters in a row.
So I just wanted to get your feeling on, is there something that is capping the growth there? Is it the ASPs going down because of who the customers are? I’m just wondering why if the market is as strong as it seemed to be for the last three or four quarters, you’re doing really well, but not actually upsiding our expectations? Yes. Ross, the way I look at it, and I mean, this was very, very similar to the ramp that we saw in the PC business. The ramp in server is something like, steady as she goes. And each quarter, we had platforms. Each quarter, more platforms are qualified. Each quarter, they ramp. It’s a little bit different from a pure market phenomena. And again, I mean, I understand that there are market phenomena and then there are growth expectations based on platform launches, as well as software being qualified and so on and so forth.
So as it relates to our expectations, it’s actually going quite well. As it relates to the acceleration of cloud, I think, we’re pleased with it. We’re not ready to upside numbers at this point. I think we want – we already had very aggressive growth assumptions in what we went through.
I think you’ll see us a little bit less market-specific and a little bit more AMD-specific as it relates to our customers and their qualification plans. So I think we are confident that our data center business is doing well. And we need to continue to demonstrate that over a number of quarters. Thanks for that answer. Just for my follow-up, one that switch gears over to the computing and graphics side. Could you just give a little bit of color on what you expect for that in the second quarter? And then as you look into the second-half, I know you mentioned that the area of greatest uncertainty for many logical reasons. But any sort of difference between the computing and the graphics side, both in your second quarter expectations and then the puts and takes in the back-half of the year? Yes. So we are expecting that computing and graphics business will be down sequentially. So it’s offsetting some of the growth on the EPYC and semi-custom side. Within the computing and graphics business, we see notebooks up strongly as a result of the launch of our new Ryzen 4000 platforms and some of the other trends that we’ve talked about. We see desktop down sequentially and we see graphics down sequentially.
Q2 is normally a sequentially down quarter for the channel business for us, so that’s not unusual. And we – that’s – those are the dynamics in the second quarter. And as we go through the second-half of the year, as I mentioned, we’ll have to see how consumer spending holds up against the other demand environment. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question today is coming from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live. Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Lisa, just my first question. I wonder if you could just help me kind of better understand in this current environment of shelter in place, how does that impact sort of new customer, new workload in engagement?
And I guess, to better kind of underscore that, just given that you’re expecting pretty good share gains in the back-half of the year, given your second-half guidance, notwithstanding the gaming cycle. Are most of those wins already in your back pocket, and so you’ve got high visibility or how do I think about that dynamic? Yes. So I think there are many that are already in progress. And that would be our sort of our typical view of how long it takes to ramp a customer from beginning of engagement to actual ramp can it be anywhere from six to nine months if that’s a good number.
As it relates to what we see with the, as you call it shelter in place, look, we see pretty strong activity. I mean, the activity level continues to be high on both the cloud, as well as the enterprise side. The only place where perhaps we see a little bit of a slowdown is, as I said, on some of the transactional business, which we had a plan to grow as we go through this year, and that might grow more slowly just as people aren’t focused on new infrastructure right now.
But in terms of cloud and large enterprise, there continues to be good activity on both current already one design platforms, as well as new pipeline engagements. That’s helpful, Lisa. As my follow-up, as you guys are painfully aware, one of the metrics that we probably focus probably too much on is just gross margin and gross margin progression. And given the gaming sort of ramp coming, it sort of convoluted the issue. So I was kind of hoping maybe you would quantify both of your Q2 guide and your full-year guide. What impact the gaming console business is having on gross margins? I.e., what would gross margins be trending to right now ex gaming for both June and the full-year? I think if you look at it… I think, John – go ahead. Go ahead, Devinder. So if you look at Q2, if you’re asking the specific Q1 to Q2, Q2, we came in at the 46%. Q2 is down. And fundamentally, primarily is due to the ramp in the game console revenue. As Lisa said earlier, we mentioned that the margins and the initial ramp of semi-custom revenue are typically lower and they do improve over time for semi-custom.
But also from a company standpoint, when you look at the corporate average gross margin, it’s lower. And therefore, it is having an impact in terms of sequentially as the margin is going down from Q1 to Q2. But I guess – my question is the non-gaming gross margins continuing to move higher sequentially every quarter this year? And i.e., is it more than 100 basis point impact from gaming in the June quarter? I think… Go ahead. Go ahead, Lisa. Sorry. Devinder and I are not in the same room. So the answer is yes, John. The impact of the sequential decline of 2 points is semi-custom. If you take semi-custom out, the rest of the portfolio would be – what you would see in the rest of the portfolio is, you would see server up and you would see desktop offset some of that. But the sequential decline is all semi-custom. Okay. Thanks, guys. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your line is now live. Hi. I had two. I guess the first question, Devinder, I think you said that data center was high-teens of revenue. So that would put it sort of in the low to mid-3s for March. Can you break out how much was CPU versus GPU? And I guess on the GPU side, that can be pretty lumpy. So anything to call out that’s assumed for June? Yes, it’s weighted towards the CPUs. If you take the data center CPUs and GPUs together, the revenue in Q1 is high-teens of revenue in Q1, but primarily weighted towards the CPUs, because that’s the area of growth from a server CPU business standpoint. Okay. And then I guess, bigger picture question. So Lisa, I think, there’s some new regulations in China that come into effect on June 1 around additional cybersecurity review for critical information infrastructure. And I would think that maybe you could fall under that. So any thought on how that could impact demand for you? And maybe, if you could sort of tell us how much of your revenue on a consumption basis you think right now is in China? Thanks. Yes. So we’re looking at that new regulation. So I don’t have any specifics at this point in time, we’ll continue to look at that new regulation. As it relates overall, I would say, the majority of our business in China is consumer or let’s call it consumer-related cloud. Thanks a lot, Lisa. Thank you. Operator, we’ll take two more questions, please. Certainly. Our next question is coming from Mitch Steves from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live. Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. I’ve got one follow-up. But the first one, just kind of on the bookings you guys are saying. So I’m less worried about kind of the near-term revenue number you guys put up for server. But if you’re sitting here today and you compare that to a quarter ago, what are the bookings look like for backlog? Has that changed at all? Is that improving? Is it getting better? Or is it pretty much in line with what you guys expected in terms of the overall backlog? Yes. I think it’s – I think I said earlier, but, Mitch, it is certainly better. So we have better visibility a month into the quarter versus 90 days ago. Okay. And then the second one I had is just more broad. It’s on China actually. So one thing we’re picking up is that a lot of the Chinese companies are supposedly buying a lot of semiconductor chips ahead, just in case they get banned from the U.S. and China relationship deterioration.
So since you guys are not really involved in that, you’re more exposed to the hyperscale. Do you guys have any comments on what do you guys think is actually happening there? And people are actually trying to build up, I guess, build up an inventory level for semiconductor chips that they may get banned? Or do you think that’s kind of just noise and it’s not really occurring right now in that geography? Yes. Mitch, it’s a little bit hard for me to generalize. I would say from what we see and we track both sell-in and consumption pretty closely. It looks like it’s normal patterns, but we don’t have exposure to some of the markets you’re talking about. Got it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Your line is now live. Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. Maybe, Lisa, just looking at the fiscal guide guide, I’m kind of curious if you look at first-half or second-half, it seems like you still would require growth in computing and graphics. I want to just make sure that was right. And then I’m just kind of curious how you think of the server, obviously, your share gain or – I think cloud and enterprise get intermingled together, particularly with this work from home.
So I’m kind of curious as you look at that business, first-half and second-half. Do you – I think Intel was talking about some weakness in enterprise and government. It’s not a big exposure for you, but just kind of curious how you’re thinking about is there any headwind as that work from home spend rolls off the server as well? Yes. So as it relates to first-half, second-half, I mean, as we said, there’s a – the $8.4 billion, plus or minus 5% is a wider than normal range for us. I think you can see outcomes within that range that would have computing and graphics up, as well as you can see outcomes with it more flattish. So that being the case.
So I think the trends that I talked about are likely the right trends, which is the consumer spending perhaps a little softer; enterprise and commercial, a positive for us; notebook share gain, a positive for us; and we want to see how sort of the desktop channel behaves as we go into the second-half of the year.
And then your second question? Just kind of, as you look at the server business, first-half, second-half, you had seen some – you saw some strength in cloud in March and June. I’m kind of curious how you’re thinking about, is there any work from home benefits within that, that would then turn into a headwind in the second-half? Yes. Look, I think from what we see, we see mostly platforms ramping. And so that’s how we’re thinking about the data center business. Of course, we’re in this COVID-19 environment. And so we’ll have to actually play out the next couple of quarters.
But within the ranges that we see, we see an opportunity to continue growing in the second-half of the year, given the visibility that we have with customers, the platforms that are ramping. And I still feel very much like we’re in the early stages of our 2nd Gen EPYC ramp. And I know it’s been a couple of quarters, but that’s just the way servers ramp.
So we’re in the early stages of the ramp, lots of customer activity, significant pull from the customers to get up and running as soon as possible. And as you said, we don’t have as much exposure to some of the other end markets, which may have a – have more volatility in the second-half of the year. Thanks. Thank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I’d like to turn the floor back over for any further closing comments. Thank you, Kevin. That concludes today’s call. We appreciate everybody participating and stay safe. Stay well, and we’ll look forward to engaging with you throughout the quarter. Thank you. Thank you. That does conclude today’s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.

Now with that, I'd like to hand the call over to Lisa. Lisa? Thank you, Ruth and good afternoon to all those listening in today.
For the last five years, we have built the technical, operational and financial foundation required to drive our long-term growth strategy. We consistently executed on our product road maps, established deep partnerships with an expanded set of customers, ramped multiple products in leading edge manufacturing technologies and significantly strengthened our balance sheet.
Our strong second quarter results and increased full-year revenue guidance demonstrate how we are successfully scaling our business through our consistent execution. Looking at the second quarter, revenue grew 26% year-over-year to $1.93 billion, driven by strong demand for our leadership server and client processors.
We accelerated our server and mobile processor businesses significantly in the quarter, resulting in Ryzen and EPYC processor revenue more than doubling year-over-year. Importantly, we met our double-digit server processor market share goal, as data center products accounted for more than 20% of our second quarter revenue.
Turning to our Computing and Graphics segment, second quarter revenue increased 45% year-over-year to $1.37 billion as growth in Ryzen processor sales more than offset lower graphics sales.
We delivered our highest client processor revenue in more than 12 years. Increased working and schooling from home due to COVID-19 resulted in a strong PC market in the quarter, although, we believe our growth was largely driven by our 11th straight quarter of market share gains.
Desktop processor sales decreased sequentially as anticipated, while revenue in ASP increased year-over-year, as demand for our higher-end Ryzen processors drove a richer mix. In mobile, we had record quarterly notebook processor unit shipments and revenue.
Sales of our latest Ryzen 4000 series processors grew significantly in the quarter, resulting in mobile revenue growing by a strong double-digit percentage sequentially and more than doubling from a year ago as both unit shipments and ASP increased significantly.
Multiple third party reviewers have consistently highlighted that our latest notebook processors deliver superior performance and longer battery life, compared to the competition. As a result of this strong performance, I'm pleased to report that Ryzen 4000 processor revenue has ramped faster than any mobile processor in our history.
There are now 54 Ryzen 4000 powered notebooks in the market. We expect to continue accelerating our mobile processor business in the second half of the year as HP and Lenovo ramp their first commercial notebooks powered by Ryzen PRO-4000 Series processors and the second wave of more than 30 ultrathin, premium and gaming consumer notebooks launch from multiple OEMs.
In Graphics, second quarter revenue declined year-over-year, as a strong double-digit increase in mobile GPU sales was more than offset by lower desktop channel sales. While desktop GPU shipments were lower year-over-year, channel sellout accelerated in the quarter. Mobile GPU revenue growth was driven by adoption of our RDNA GPUs, highlighted by the launches of new Apple professional and Dell gaming notebooks, featuring our Radeon 5000M series mobile GPUs.
Data center GPU revenue decreased year-over-year. We expect revenue to increase in the second half of the year, as additional cloud-based visual computing wins ramp and we launch our new CDNA data center GPU architecture optimized for next-generation exascale and machine learning workloads.
Turning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, revenue of $565 million decreased 4% year-over-year due to lower semi-custom sales. Sequentially, revenue increased 62%, driven by record quarterly server processor sales and increased semi-custom product revenue.
In semi-custom, we passed an important milestone in the second quarter as we began initial production and shipments of our next generation game console S0Cs. We expect strong second half semi-custom growth as we ramp production to support the holiday launches of the new PlayStation 5 and Xbox series X consoles.
Turning to server, our focus since launching our EPYC processors has been on building a solid foundation to drive long-term growth. Our strategy is grounded in driving broad, high volume adoption with widespread support from industry-leading cloud and hardware providers.
We passed a significant milestone in the quarter, as we achieved our double-digit server processor unit share goal, based on broad adoption across cloud, enterprise and HPC customers.
In cloud, multiple hyperscale customers ramped second generation EPYC processors into high-volume production in the quarter to power both their internal infrastructure and publicly-available instances. Microsoft announced they have added EPYC processors to power their Office Online applications used by more than 200 million monthly users.
Tencent ramped up multiple millions of EPYC processor-powered virtual machines to support enhanced collaboration services. Google announced that EPYC processors were being used exclusively to power their unique Confidential Computing VMs that encrypt data while it is being processed. And AWS launched global availability of new compute-optimized EPYC-based EC2 instances. In enterprise, we have significantly expanded our TAM as the number of AMD platforms has increased by more than 40% so far this year.
Recent additions include Dell and HPE introducing multiple hyperconverged infrastructure solutions, Lenovo launching dual socket servers for financial, retail and manufacturing markets and Nvidia selecting AMD EPYC processors to power its latest DGX AI platform.
We also secured new HPC wins based on the leadership performance and scalability of second Gen EPYC processors. Public highlights include new wins with leading research institutions including Indiana University, Purdue and CERN, as well as Amazon, IBM, Microsoft and Oracle all announcing cloud-based HPC offerings powered by EPYC processors.
We are pleased with the momentum in our server business and expect to continue gaining share as additional 2ndGen EPYC platforms and cloud deployments ramp to volume in the second half of the year. We remain on track to begin shipping our next-generation “Milan” server processor featuring “Zen 3” late this year.
In closing, I want to thank our employees and partners for the strong execution during this unprecedented time as we continue to focus on delivering on our commitments. While there continues to be some macroeconomic uncertainty and pockets of demand softness, our product portfolio is very strong and our markets are resilient. We are on track to deliver strong growth in the second half of the year, driven by our current product portfolio and initial shipments of our next-generation “Zen 3” CPUs and RDNA 2 GPUs that are on-track to launch in late 2020.
I am very proud of the progress we have made over the last few years, placing AMD on a long-term growth trajectory. I am even more excited about the opportunities in front of us as we enter our next phase of growth driven by accelerating our business in multiple markets. We remain focused on consistently gaining share across the $79 billion market for our high-performance products. We are investing significantly and have added resources to further extend our leadership IP and go-to-market capabilities, as we pursue our ambitious goal to make AMD a best-in-class growth franchise.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our second quarter financial performance. Devinder? Thank you, Lisa and good afternoon everyone.
We executed the second quarter very well. Amidst the COVID-19 backdrop, we delivered strong financial results, introduced industry leading products and gained CPU market share. The second quarter results and increased full-year revenue guidance highlight our ability to consistently deliver on our commitments as we continue to drive long-term financial growth.
Second quarter revenue was $1.93 billion, up 26% from a year ago and 8% from the prior quarter. Year-over-year growth was driven by strong Ryzen and EPYC processor sales. Gross margin was 44%, up 330 basis points from a year ago, driven by client and server processor sales. Operating expenses were $617 million, compared to $512 million a year ago, primarily due to ongoing investments in the business.
Operating income more than doubled year-over-year to $233 million, up $122 million from a year ago, driven primarily by revenue growth. Operating margin increased to 12% as compared to 7% a year ago. Net income was $216 million, up $124 million from a year ago and diluted earnings per share were $0.18 per share compared to $0.08 per share a year ago.
Now turning to the business segment results. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $1.37 billion, up 45% year-over-year, driven by significant growth in Ryzen processor sales. Computing and Graphics segment operating income was $200 million or 15% of revenue, compared to $22 million or 2% of revenue a year ago.
Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue was $565 million, down 4% year-over-year due to lower semi-custom sales, which were largely offset by higher EPYC processor sales. EESC segment operating income was $33 million, or 6% of revenue compared to operating income of $89 million a year ago.
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.8 billion, including $200 million from our revolving line of credit, which was fully repaid in the third quarter. Inventory was $1.3 billion, up 25% from the prior quarter in anticipation of the revenue ramp in the second half of 2020 and new product launches.
Free cash flow was $152 million in the second quarter. I am very pleased with our cash performance in the quarter, which resulted in the first half of the year being free cash flow positive.
Let me now turn to the outlook for the third quarter of 2020. Today's outlook is based on current expectations and contemplates the current COVID-19 environment global economic backdrop and customer demand signals.
We expect revenue to be approximately $2.55 billion plus or minus $100 million, an increase of approximately 42% year-over-year and approximately 32% sequentially. The year-over-year and sequential increases are expected to be driven by higher Ryzen and EPYC processor sales and next-generation semi-custom products.
In addition, for Q3 2020, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 44%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $660 million, non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $25 million and the diluted share count in the third quarter is expected to be approximately 1.23 billion shares.
For the full-year 2020, we now expect higher annual revenue growth of approximately 32% driven by the strength of our PC, Gaming and Datacenter products. We continue to expect gross margin of approximately 45% for the full year, up two points from the prior year.
In closing, while there continues to be global economic uncertainty due to COVID-19, we have significant opportunities ahead of us with strong product demand across multiple markets. We are in a good position to accelerate our financial momentum, expand gross margins and generate significant cash.
With that, I'll turn it back to Ruth for the question-and-answer session. Ruth? Thank you, Devinder and operator please poll the audience for the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies. Your line is now live. A question for Lisa. You've said in the past that your customers - they don't buy CPUs but they buy roadmaps and I was hoping that you could tell us about your roadmaps particularly in servers going forward, how it compares to your competition and does your - as part of that is your view of the competitive environment change after your biggest competitor last week noted a pushed a 7-nanometer process. Thank you. Hi, Mark. Yeah, thanks for the question. So look, we've been very focused over the last couple of years on our road map and our strategy. And for sure when we talk to our customers, it's about ensuring that they understand we have a consistent road map that is pushing the leading edge performance and ensuring that we deliver the performance improvements that we promise.
As you know with these road maps, many of these decisions are made years in advance and so we look at process technology, as well as designing architecture and leading-edge packaging. So we feel good about our road map, we just - we updated our road maps at our Financial Analyst Day in March and we continue to be very focused on executing to our road maps. And on the - when you talk about the - your focus bodes on your transistor or the process and the architectural lead. Can you give us a sense to what extent the share gains that you're taking right now are driven by one or the other or both in would you expect to maintain a lead in both as you launch Milan and further on to in ' 21 and '22? Well, I would say that the road map is dependent on all of those factors. So you have to get the process technology and manufacturing right. We feel good about our road map there and our partnership with TSMC. And you also have to make the right design and architectural decisions and we feel good about our CPU roadmap.
So right now we are on Zen 2 with Rome, we saw a very nice acceleration of our data center business due to some of the key customers that have launched. We are on track or we expect to start shipping Milan here late this year. And then we're also working in development on Zen4 which is slated for 5-nanometer. Our next question today is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the strong growth despite all the headwinds. Lisa, for my first one, when I think back to the last time AMD was really big in the server market was in that 2004 to 2006 timeframe, when market share went from 7% to 26% and kind of that 3-year or so period. How would you contrast the current environment right from whether it's from a competitive perspective or just a customer willingness to adopt your platform. What will it take for your market share to kind of approach those peaks, what are the puts and takes and how different or similar is their experience now? Yes, sure, Vivek, thanks for the question. So look, the server market we've said is very strategic for us. We think there is a high demand for - so we're pushing the leading edge performance. When I look at our roadmap right now, I feel very good about our roadmap. I think we have executed well to our roadmap. I think we are differentiated in terms of the performance that we're offering in the server market.
We've always said that the datacenter market is a bit of a journey. And so this is about putting together multiple generations of strong execution. So we're pleased with where we are with Rome and the progress that we've made this year. I would say, we're still in the early innings of what we believe we can do in the server market.
I think Rome is a very, very competitive product. I think as we go into, Milan we see that as also a very competitive product and our goal is to really satisfy a broad swath of the server workloads and we think we have the capabilities of doing that. For my follow-up Lisa, so you raised full year growth outlook to 32% or so, I believe from 25%. Could you give us some more color on what's driving that upside, how much of that is coming from PCs, how much from server, how much from semi-custom and I noticed that you kept the gross margin outlook kind of steady. And I'm wondering how do we think about gross margins going forward how sensitive is that to your success in the server market? Thank you. Yes, so we did update full-year guidance. When we look at sort of what's changed over the last 90 days, when we were sort of talking to you in April, we were actually expecting that there might be some COVID-19 related weakness in the second half due to macroeconomic factors or other things like that. What we see now is better visibility into the second half of the year.
And so we had originally assumed that the PC market would be down in the second half and we now expect that PCs that we will grow in the PC - in PC processors for the second half compared to the first half. We also see datacenter growing from the second half to the first half.
And then we have our game console ramp that is a strong ramp here in the second half. So I think it's a number of factors, we do believe that the market is a little bit better than we thought 90 days ago, but we also believe that our product traction is strong and we're seeing that come through with our customer demand. So those are the reasons for the guidance. Anything on gross margins? Oh, I'm sorry, yes. On gross margins, I think that depends a lot on mix, that depends on certainly your question was about server. Server is certainly accretive to margin. I think in the PC business, the second half of the year tends to be a bit more consumer-focused and notebook focused. And so that's some of the mix relation there.
And then we said that the consoles are decretive to margin. We expect that consoles will be very strong in the third quarter. And although the fourth quarter will be lower for consoles, it's still going to be a very strong - strong second half of the year. So those are the puts and takes there, but we feel that the mix is about right for the annual guide at 45%. Our next question today is coming from Matt Ramsey from Cowen and Company. Your line is now live. Lisa, I wanted to ask about the PC market and you just gave some comments about maybe some stronger trends and you might have anticipated 90 days ago in the back half, but pretty remarkable for the notebook business to more double than and for the second quarter to be your record client sales. I wonder if you might talk about the momentum particularly in the notebook market of the 4000. And then how are you feeling the pull of the enterprise notebook market and what's the traction like there so far into of the back half? Thank you. Sure, Matt. So the PC market was strong for us and the PC business was strong for us in the second quarter and as we look into the second half. What we saw was that desktops were down as expected, but the COVID-19 type phenomena has increased overall the PC market and we see a strong shift from desktop to notebooks. At the same time, I think our notebook portfolio particularly the Ryzen 4000 has done extremely well.
We've seen strong adoption. We have over 50 platforms in market. We watch the sell-through and the consumption of those and I would say it has been very strong even exceeded our expectations for the early ramp. And our view is that the second half will continue to be good for notebooks and PCs overall and that's part of this idea that PCs are now essential.
And so we see strength in consumer, we see strength in gaming notebooks, which we had previously been underrepresented. We have a nice commercial ramp and we do see good pipeline around commercial PCs, as well as the education market is quite strong as well. So you put that together and I think the PC business has performed well for us. As a follow-up maybe a piece of the business that's been asked about a little less frequently over the last few quarters is your gaming GPU business. And I'm interested if you could just put into context what the expectations are for improvements and new opportunities for big Navi as you launch later this year and maybe size those opportunities from a data center perspective versus what you might expect in the gaming channel. Thanks. Yes. So I think the graphics as we mentioned in the prepared remarks was down year-over-year. We saw a nice ramp of mobile as we launched some of the Navi based mobile products. But the desktop channel was lower. This was somewhat as expected from the standpoint of the second quarter is usually a lower quarter for the desktop channel. What we did see is that sell-through was pretty good.
So I think gaming overall is good. We are in the process of a product transition. We are on track to launch RDNA 2 or as you call it big Navi late this year. We're excited about the RDNA 2 architecture. I think it's a full refresh for us from the top of the stack through the rest of the stack. And so I think that will be more of a contributor here as we go into later this year and into next year. Your next question today is coming from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. Good job on the quarterly execution. Good to see the team hit the double-digit percentage market share targets and a broadening out of the end market penetration with EPYC. Lisa just given your customer and design win pipeline and roll out of “Milan” in the back half of this year, how are you thinking or how should we be thinking about further EPYC share gains over the next 12 to 18 months? Sure, Harlan. So, look, we are optimistic about our product positioning in the server market, much of what we've been doing up through now frankly is making sure that our customers were ready to take advantage of Rome and EPYC. And so we saw some nice traction here in the first half of the year, particularly in the second quarter around some top cloud accounts that have started to ramp in good volume.
As we look forward to the second half of the year, there are more platforms coming with Rome. We have a number of OEM platforms that are in the process of being launched and we have additional cloud platforms as well. So I think Rome is going to continue to be a strong driver of our growth into the second half of this year, as well as next year.
We're excited about Milan. Milan is looking good in the labs. We're working with our customers on Milan and we expect to start shipping that later this year. So I think the way to think about our server business is again it's a journey and we're pleased with where we are today, but there is a significant opportunity for us if we continue to execute well over the next, I would say, more than 12 to 18 months. But really we see this as a multiyear opportunity. Absolutely. And then as a follow-up, we do an annual CIO survey here at J.P. Morgan. For the past three years, we've been asking Global CIOs, are thinking about or planning to use EPYC based platforms for on-prem. And then the most recent survey that we did in June, we actually saw a 60% year-over-year increase in the number of CIOs that are thinking about using EPYC for on-prem our interpretation is that interest level and mind share is growing quite rapidly. I guess my question to you Lisa is the AMD - what is the AMD team seeing from an actual adoption perspective and what's your sense of your enterprise mix sort of two to three years from now? Yes, actually Harlan I saw that data and I thought it was good data. So the - what I would say is that we are making progress in the Enterprise business and that comes from a number of different factors. But first is the availability of platforms and we have a very diverse set of platforms from our OEM partners that are now in market. We've also done quite a bit on the ecosystem and ensuring that we have the partnerships with the ISVs. And then just basically feet on the street where we're talking directly to some of these enterprise customers.
So, I feel good about the progress that we've made. Again, I would refer to the fact that mindshare is a leading indicator, but there is a lot for us to do to convert that into market share and revenue growth, but we feel like we're on a good path and we're going to continue to focus on both cloud and enterprise growth. And I'll also mention HPC is another key vector for us where we're very focused on showing a strong value proposition for those sort of toughest, more scientific workloads. Our next question today is coming from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. As a segue from the previous question, can you talk a little bit about your enterprise prospects on PC client side. Can you give us a sense for how much at this point your business is skewed to consumer and how much progress you're making there in terms of penetrating enterprise business? Sure Joe, no question. Our business is more consumer-weighted today. I will say, we're growing nicely in commercial PCs. I think the strength of the Ryzen 4000 product has been good for us. I think there is a lot of positivity around the performance, the battery life, the capabilities there. We continue to expand our go-to-market efforts there, we're partnering very well with our top OEM partners. So I would say that we're still under-represented in commercial, but no question that commercial notebook is a big focus for us and we're going to continue to invest and hopefully make progress in that sub-segment. Great. And then as a follow-up, there's been a bunch of press about console builds getting revised up meaningfully by several million units coming from Nikkei and yet your upside for the year seems fairly balanced across the segments. Can you give us just color on what's happening in that console segment, is there that much upside and could your numbers prove conservative as we move through the back half? Yes, so I will say that our upside is balanced across the segments. There is no question that there is a strong ramp in the second half of the year for consoles. We're continuing to increase supply to meet - to meet that demand. But overall, I view it as again consoles are multi-year cycle. And the first year I mean there is a lot of pent-up demand for consoles, but we should think about this as really a multi-year cycle and this is just the beginning of the ramp. Our question today is coming from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your line is now live. I wanted to follow up on that capacity point What is your capacity and supply situation look like? And is any of the full-year raise related to capacity freeing up at your foundry partners and maybe put another way, are you supply rather than demand limited at this point, what is that capacity situation look like? Yes, sure, Stacy. So look, we have a strong supply chain. There is no question, it's been a very dynamic year if you just think about all the puts and takes over the last four or five months. I've said before and I'll say again, 7-nanometer is tight and we continue to partner closely with our - with TSMC - to ensure that we can satisfy our customer demand.
When you ask about the full-year raise, the full-year raise is because demand has gone up from our initial expectations and some of that is due to the market and some of that is due to the strength of our product traction. We are increasing capacity to meet those needs, but it is tight and I would say that as we continue to increase capacity, we see opportunity there. So from that standpoint demand is strong. So my follow-up, your competitor was talking about data center, potential for data center digestion in the second half. I understand you're coming from a different place with the new product launch ramps and everything. So I understand why you are growing into the second half where they are not, but what are you seeing just broadly with your customers, are you seeing signs of the market within hyperscale entering the digestion phase even if it's not impacting you for the well understood reasons? Yes, Stacy, I think it's a bit hard to generalize and from our visibility what I would say is we have some customers that we see demand increasing in the second half versus the first half. We have some customers who are a little bit lower. The main thing for us and I think you said it, it's about the ramping of our platforms.
And so I'm not sure I would point to a particular digestion phenomena. I would say it's very customer-dependent and depending on how much they built out in the first half and some customers will be up and some customers will be a little bit down, but overall we see an opportunity to grow in the second half. Is that the same across like hyperscale and enterprise or is it mostly hyperscale driving it? So my comment was hyperscale comment and that's what you are asking about. When I look at enterprise, what I would say about enterprise is, it’s also different things happening. I would say in terms of enterprise and HPC, we continue to see build out. And as I said, we have new platforms ramping that I mentioned in the prepared remarks. There is a bit of softness in SMB or some of the transactional business. And again, we were not very exposed to that portion of the market.
So I don't see it as it's going down. It's just perhaps not increasing as fast as we wanted it to. But overall, it really depends on customer-specific stuff and we don't see sort of this large scale people slowing down, I would say that way. I think there is a need for infrastructure and we see people continuing to invest in infrastructure. Our next question today is coming from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Congratulations on the quarter. I wanted to ask about the data center GPU business. I know you talked about the past for the CDNA product going forward. I'm just curious as you look to your cloud opportunities, how do you gauge or how are you thinking about the ability to kind of participate in some of the AI opportunities in the data center GPU business. And do you have any update on kind of ROCm- and how that has opened up opportunities or what we should expect from a software platform perspective? Yes, sure. Aaron. So look, I think the data center GPU business is a - it's sort of a mid-term growth vector for us. This year I mentioned in the second quarter that revenue was lower year-on-year, but the second half we expect it to go up modestly. I think the - the view is, we have good design wins in cloud gaming, we have good design wins across sort of cloud VDI type instances, very strong in supercomputing and HPC, around Frontier and El Capitan as sort of our anchor supercomputing wins.
As it relates to machine learning and AI, we continue to invest in ROCm, we continue to work sort of our strategy around machine learning is partner deeply with a couple of large cloud vendors who can invest in the software with us and we see that as a multi-year opportunity, but it will, it's not a big revenue contributor here in 2020. But we see growth opportunity as we go into 2021 and beyond. And then as a quick follow-up, we talked a lot about kind of just ramping EPYC in a roadmap. I'm just curious of how you've invested in the support organization to support this expansion. How has that progressed, has that been at all a limiting factor to some of your ability in the server CPU market? Yes, I think in server CPUs, it just takes time. There is a - there is a customer qualification process that takes time. What we have, we've been very pleased with sort of the efforts on both the part of our customers, as well as sort of our own support teams. We're continuing to invest. So if you look at our OpEx, we're continuing to invest.
One of the key areas is building out not just that support infrastructure, but just overall sales and go to market for the enterprise business. So, I feel good about where we are, our strategy was always to go through some of the top cloud customers first and I'm really pleased to see some of those get to high volume production and we'll continue to build out that infrastructure in both cloud, as well as enterprise. Our next question today is coming from Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your line is now live. I guess, Lisa, I wanted to ask maybe in the past month or six weeks or even two months since it's become probably more apparent to the customers that your competitors having some manufacturing issues. Can you speak a little bit to the tenure of the customer conversations? Has it changed at all? Have you felt them incrementally more willing to adopt products? Thanks. Yes, I don't think I would say, I mean, four to six weeks is kind of a short time. I think I would back up a little bit and say over the past couple of quarters what have we seen? And I think over the past couple of quarters, what we have seen is - they've seen our performance capability and we feel very good about where our products are positioned. I think what we've also said is, look, you can count on us for consistent roadmap and we're going to show you each of those data points.
I think the Milan point is an important point for us and that's why we're very focused on ensuring that that ships here later this year. I think the Zen 4 general point, we've already started engaging customers, customers are very eager to understand what the long-term roadmap is. And so what I would say is it's not sort of a short-term thing, it's more the notion of we feel that customers are very open across cloud, OEM enterprise, it's on us to execute and we think about that every day.
But in terms of where the roadmap is, what are we trying to accomplish, where the customers are, there is a pull from customers to engage with us across a number of workloads, we feel well positioned. And then I guess also in data center, I think you've highlighted before that a potential bottleneck might be to build out your software capabilities. And can you - are there any metrics you can give us in terms of your ability to attract talent, has that improved recently, sort of in terms of the number of software engineers you've hired anything like that to help? Thank you. Yes. So I think if you're talking about software, it's more of a GPU data center GPU statement versus a CPU statement. I think we feel actually that our CPU tools infrastructure and all that stuff is actually pretty well built out. There is some work that we do with some of the applications in the ISPs to optimize and tune our software, but I think that's going very well. As it relates to the data center GPU, yes, I think there is more mindshare. I think the supercomputing wins in the data center GPU side have really helped raise the profile of our GPU capabilities and our software capabilities.
So I think we are in a good position there. And from our standpoint, again this is about building out sort of multiple vertical applications and doing that very well. So we continue to invest in the datacenter, it is a very strategic part of our business, but we're making good progress. Our next question is coming from Mitch Steves from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live. I wanted to focus on a little bit on a different topic, kind of comparing x86 and ARM. So I'm sure you guys saw the announcement that Apple is displacing Intel with its own ARM-based chip and historically the reason why you couldn't really use an ARM-based chip because there was no real developer around it. So I guess is there any risk or how do you guys think about ARM-based service becoming a potential competitive threat in the future? How would that impact the x86 market and Intel as well? So do you have any comments on that in terms of Apple's potential entrant in developing an ARM-based ecosystem? Yeah, I think what I would say is, no, there are going to be some people who develop their own chips, Apple announced it in the MAC space and there are some who are building their own in the datacenter space. I still believe this is not about ARM versus x86, I think it's more about what performance do you offer, what capabilities do you offer? Where the overall ecosystem is?
And in that sense, I think we still feel quite confident that both the PC market, as well as the server processor market are predominantly x86. I think there is a very good set of offerings out there that are available. And it's on us, frankly on us, to make sure that the performance that you get, the power that you get, the performance per dollar, the capabilities are very, very competitive, so that we're offering, sort of the best in class processors in the market. And just one small one follow-up just on the data center comment 20% of revenue, is still the data center graphics piece still a small part of the business or was that better this quarter, just trying to get a qualitative understanding what happened there? Yes, Mitch. So we did say that overall data center revenue was over 20% of revenue this quarter and it was predominantly CPUs. So the GPU portion of that is still relatively small. So just to be clear, GPUs were not or basically flat sequentially or were they up? There were actually down sequentially. Operator, we'll take two more questions, please. Certainly. Our next question today is coming from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live. Thanks for letting me ask a question and congrats on the strong results. Lisa, I had one short-term question and one long-term question for you. On the short-term side of things, you have some significant moving parts with new product launches et cetera in both the third and fourth quarters. So I was hoping on the 32% sequential guide if you can give a little color by the two end markets, the C&G and the EESC side. And then similar sort of thing when you go into the fourth quarter, you said semi-custom will be down sequentially which is kind of typical seasonality, but the ability for you guys to still grow sequentially. What's really driving that? And then I'll follow up with the long-term question. Sure. So let's see let me try to do that. So I think, so when you talk about the Q3 guide, so 32% sequentially, there is a large component of that which is game consoles, so the game console revenue was relatively modest in the second quarter and it's going to become larger here in the third quarter, but we do see PCs growing sequentially, as well as server CPUs growing sequentially.
And then as we go into the fourth quarter, I mentioned earlier that we expect that semi- custom will be down a bit, probably not as much as it's historically down frankly because it's the first year of the launch, but it should be down a bit. And then we do have product launches that we stated around sort of the Zen 3 product families, as well as the RDNA 2 product families that would drive some of the sequential growth in the fourth quarter, does that - did I answer that? Yes, that's exactly what I wanted, thank you. And then maybe this one, I'll be a little clear on the long-term side of things. An earlier question was asked about OpEx and expanding your capabilities et cetera and you gave a thoughtful answer to that. But generally speaking it seems like your opportunity is to take share in aggregate just improved due to your competitor's missteps.
So when you look at that opportunity, how do you think about organic investment with OpEx staying at say 29% of revenues like you're talking about for this year be a good way to capitalize on that opportunity as opposed to going down to the 26% or 27% you mentioned at your Analyst Meeting or within that would you keep that a little bit tighter in line with your Analyst Meeting and maybe even consider going inorganic and tapping into the M&A market now that you have some cash in a very attractive currency to use as well? Yes, so yes, let me - let me answer it this way. So look, we are very excited about our organic growth opportunities. I think we want to stay sort of at that sort of very significant growth in that over 20% CAGR for the next couple of 3 or 4 years. I think the way we manage the business is the prudent way to manage the business. And so OpEx will grow, OpEx will grow and you've seen it in the dollar numbers, but it's going to grow little bit slower than revenue.
And we think that's the right thing to do just to make sure that we do see some leverage. That being the case, because the business is growing so much, I mean we are - we are investing quite heavily in OpEx across the business in both R&D and go to market. So what was the second part of your question, Ross? With just the inorganic way, would that be an avenue to broaden your offering to some of your customers? Well, yes, look, I think we have been focused on the organic growth path, because there is so much opportunity there. We'll look - we'll always keep an eye open for other opportunities to enhance the portfolio or do some skills acquisition, if that makes sense. But I think we're very focused on executing the organic growth path. Our final question today is coming from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live. Thanks for squeezing me and congratulations on a strong quarter. Lisa, it's really great to see embedded and the implied fourth quarter guide, a gross margin that needs to go up about 200 basis points sequentially to meet your full year guidance. And especially with gaming consoles being down less than seasonal, I'm wondering if you could just help me unpack that a little bit. When you think about the gaming console cycle, is there gross margin improvement available to you as that cycle ramps and matures? And I guess more importantly when you look at both the PC market and the server fleet, where are you relative to optimal product mix vis-à-vis kind of longer-term gross margin aspirations? Yes, sure. So, obviously there's a lot to happen between now and the fourth quarter, but I think from the guide what you get is, we see the server and PC growth generally positive. If you think about what we have planned from now through the rest of the year, we do have some significant new products that will start shipping, that will be positive from a gross margin standpoint.
On a console basis, it is true that the console margins typically improve over the first sort of four to six quarters because you would expect that as we ramp into higher volume that there are improvements in manufacturing costs and so on and so forth.
So those are the factors that are in there. A lot will depend on mix and the mix of the business being, what is the mix of consumer versus commercial on the PC side and then on the datacenter side, the mix between cloud and enterprise. And so we have to see how some of those things play out as we go out through - through the end of the year. But overall I think the trend is such that you should see sequential growth in the gross margins as we go into the fourth quarter for some of the reasons that I mentioned. That's helpful. Then Lisa as a follow-on, you've always talked about this being a marathon more than a sprint. And you guys have had a pretty methodical strategy to which you've executed to. But I just - given the revelations of Intel's missteps last week, what might you do differently from here to try to take advantage of it? Well, John, I think the most important thing for us is to execute to our commitments to customers and that by the way, that's been the same focus for us over the last few years and it will continue to be the same focus for the next few years. I think consistency in roadmap, consistency in performance, expectations being capable of ramping across basically what we're asking is for people to trust us with their most important applications.
And so our focus is very much execute on the roadmap that we've committed to and that's, that's key for us. And no question there is a lot of, a lot of things to do in engineering to get that - to make that happen, but I think we're very clear on what we want to deliver and we're excited, frankly, about the roadmap we have in front of us. Thank you everybody for joining the call today, we appreciate it and we look forward to seeing many of you virtually throughout the quarter. Operator, if you can close the call please. Certainly, that does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.

Now, with that, I'd like to hand the call over to Lisa. Lisa? Thank you, Ruth, and good morning to all those listening in.
Today marks a significant milestone in our journey to establish AMD as the industry's high-performance computing leader. Before going into details on our strategic acquisition of Xilinx, I'd like to start with our very strong financial results.
Our business accelerated in the third quarter, resulting in record quarterly revenue with net income and EPS more than doubling year-over-year. Revenue grew 56% year-over-year to $2.8 billion, driven by strong demand for our Ryzen, EPYC and Semi-Custom processors.
Turning to our Computing and Graphics segment, third quarter revenue of $1.67 billion grew 31% year-over-year as higher Ryzen processor sales more than offset lower graphic sales. Our client processor business is performing extremely well. Desktop and notebook processor ASPs increased and total unit shipments grew by a strong double-digit percentage, both on a year-over-year and sequential basis. As a result, we set a record for quarterly client processor revenue and believe we gained client CPU share for the 12th straight quarter.
In mobile, we set records for both quarterly notebook processor unit shipments and revenue as OEM sell-through doubled year-over-year. We have the strongest notebook processor portfolio in our history. More than 105 AMD-based notebooks have launched in 2020 as we expand our presence in segments like gaming, commercial and education, where we have traditionally been underrepresented.
In commercial, the number of AMD-based business notebooks for major OEMs has doubled year-over-year and we are building significant momentum based on the superior performance and battery life of our Ryzen Pro processors. Our progress in the third quarter was highlighted by winning multiple large-scale deployments with Fortune 1,000, automotive, banking and pharmaceutical companies.
Earlier this month, we announced our upcoming Ryzen desktop processors would be the first to feature our newest Zen 3 core. I'm incredibly proud of what our CPU team has achieved with Zen 3.
We have significantly enhanced nearly every aspect of the core to deliver a 19% increase in Instructions Per Clock compared to Zen 2. As a result, our Ryzen 5000 desktop processors deliver absolute performance leadership across gaming, productivity and creative workloads and are positioned to drive the biggest shift in the PC landscape since we launched the original Ryzen processor in 2017.
In Graphics, revenue declined year-over-year, and increased sequentially as we prepare to launch our next generation Radeon GPUs this quarter. Mobile GPU sales grew by a double-digit percentage year over year, led by solid demand for our Radeon Pro 5000 M series powering Apple's MacBook Pro.
We are very excited about our RDNA 2 graphics architecture launching later this week that delivers significant generational increases in both performance and performance per watt. Our next generation Radeon RX 6000 graphics cards powered by RDNA 2 are by far the most powerful gaming GPUs we have ever built and will return AMD to the high end of the graphics market.
Data center GPU revenue increased sequentially and year-over-year based on new cloud-based visual computing wins. Our Radeon Instinct accelerators continue gaining momentum in the HPC market. Recently announced wins include Australia's most powerful supercomputer, as well as the new LUMI supercomputer in Finland that is expected to deliver over 550 petaflops of peak performance.
Turning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, revenue of $1.13 billion increased 116% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in both Semi-Custom and Server processor sales.
In Semi-Custom, we ramped production and shipments of our next generation game console SoCs to support the November launches of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and Series S consoles. We now expect Semi-Custom shipments and revenue to increase sequentially in the fourth quarter based on strong demand.
Turning to Server, we set a record for quarterly Server processor revenue as sales grew a double-digit percentage sequentially and more than doubled year-over-year, driven by growing cloud and enterprise adoption. In cloud, the largest hyperscale customers expanded their second-gen EPYC processor deployments across both their internal infrastructures and publicly-available instances.
In the third quarter, Microsoft Azure expanded their AMD offerings to 18 regions and nine availability zones and launched new data analytic services powered by second-gen EPYC processors that deliver 30% better performance than competitive offerings. Amazon rolled out multiple new high-performance AMD instances and Google announced general availability of their cloud confidential virtual machines powered exclusively by second-gen EPYC processors.
Enterprise data center adoption continue to accelerate as well. We added multiple Fortune 1000 customer wins in the quarter across key verticals, including financial services, automotive and EDA, based on the performance and TCO advantages of EPYC processors.
We are on track to begin volume shipments of our next generation Milan server processors with Zen 3 to cloud and select HPC customers this quarter. We expect Tier 1 OEM platform availability to follow in the first quarter of 2021. Customer interest in Milan is very high.
We are seeing hyperscale HPC and OEM customers engage deeper and broader for Milan than they did, prior to the launch of our second-gen EPYC processors. We believe we are well-positioned for continued share gains based on our expanding cloud engagements, strong supercomputing wins, and the more than 100 new or refreshed Milan platforms in development.
In summary, our strong third quarter results and fourth quarter outlook demonstrate the acceleration in our business. We are successfully executing our strategy to drive best-in-class growth based on delivering leading edge CPUs, GPUs and differentiated solutions for the PC, gaming and data center markets. We feel very confident our next generation Zen 3 CPUs, RDNA 2 GPUs, and CDNA accelerators can drive further share gains and growth in 2021 and beyond.
Now, let's turn to the transaction. Looking out over the next decade, high-performance computing is increasingly at the center of nearly every major trend shaping the future. Whether in the cloud, at the edge, or across the growing number of intelligent end devices, we are seeing increasing demand for high-performance computing, which enables a host of new experiences and services.
While our CPUs and GPUs will remain critical engines for those devices in a world where algorithms are always advancing and new standards are continually emerging, we see demand growing for adaptive computing capabilities that can accelerate evolving workloads.
That is why, today, I'm excited to outline the next leg in our journey with the strategic acquisition of Xilinx. Together, we will create the industry's high-performance computing leader and the partner of choice for the largest and most important technology companies. Xilinx is the ideal match for AMD.
As the industry's number one provider of FPGAs and adaptive SoCs, they are the market leader. Xilinx is successfully executing multi-generation hardware and software roadmaps to extend that leadership. Xilinx is a technology leader. Beyond their core innovation in FPGAs and associated software design environments, they have industry-leading capabilities in SoC design, serdes and high-speed IO, mixed signal RF, advanced 2.5 and 3-D silicon integration and packaging, as well as targeted software stacks for key verticals.
Xilinx has also built deep strategic partnerships across a diverse set of growing markets. In 5G communications, datacenter, automotive, industrial, aerospace and defense, Xilinx has established themselves as a strategic technology partner to a broad set of industry leaders. Lastly Xilinx has a very strong business model characterized by long product lifecycles with the best-in-class gross margin profile and significant free cash flow generation.
As we bring AMD and Xilinx together, there are considerable product technology market and financial benefits. AMD will offer the strongest portfolio of high-performance and adaptive computing products in the industry spanning leadership CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs and adaptive SoCs. This will enable us to take a leadership position, accelerating a diverse set of emerging workloads from AI to smart networking and software-defined infrastructure.
And while our product portfolios are highly complementary, our approach to technology development is actually very similar. Both companies are laser-focused on developing leadership products based on multi-generation architectures, modular SoC designs, leading-edge manufacturing and advanced packaging technologies. In manufacturing, we will be able to apply learnings from AMD's early adoption and high-volume production ramp of advanced process nodes across Xilinx's products.
In packaging, Xilinx has demonstrated leadership and significant IP in the 2.5-D and 3-D die stacking technologies that are becoming increasingly important as Moore's Law slows.
Looking beyond hardware, we see opportunities to combine our open source software offerings into a unified stack, optimized to accelerate computing at the platform and the system level. By combining our efforts, we bring together two world-class engineering teams with the technology capability and scale to build even stronger products and solutions.
From a market perspective, we will cover the most important markets and customers in the world. We will have a combined TAM of $110 billion, building on AMD's $80 billion dollar TAM, with an additional $30 billion of very attractive Xilinx TAM. As we look at growth drivers in the three to five-year timeframe, we see significant revenue synergy opportunities that can build on AMD's strong organic growth.
In the data center, our EPYC processors have a strong foundation with the largest hyperscale cloud providers. We're also gaining significant momentum with enterprise customers and playing a leading role in supercomputing where our products are powering the world's most powerful exascale computers.
Xilinx has also invested significantly in the data center with leadership networking computing and storage technologies, notably with significant SmartNIC wins with global hyperscalers. Together, we will be a stronger strategic force powering the next-generation data center.
To drive longer term adoption of our processors in the telecom, edge, industrial and networking markets, where we have a nation presence today, we can offer solutions that combine our CPU and GPU compute engines with Xilinx's flexible accelerators, SmartNIC products, software stacks and domain expertise to unlock additional levels of performance on critical workloads.
In Telecom, for instance, where Xilinx has solutions capabilities and relationships with industry leaders, including Samsung and Ericsson, we will now have an accelerated path to market to better address the largely untapped $5 billion market opportunity for our EPYC processors.
Financially, the acquisition diversifies our revenue streams and is expected to be immediately accretive to margins, EPS and free cash flow generation, all while delivering industry-leading growth.
Finally, I would like to talk about culture. For the last several years, AMD has collaborated with Xilinx as a close partner and I've had the chance to get to know Victor and his leadership team. I can unequivocally say that the Xilinx team is one of the best in the industry and I'm thrilled to welcome them to the AMD family. Both AMD and Xilinx share a common culture, focused on innovation, execution and collaborating deeply with customers.
From a leadership standpoint, Victor and I have a shared vision of where we can take high-performance and adaptive computing in the future, and I'm extremely happy that he will be joining AMD as President responsible for the Xilinx business and strategic growth initiatives after the deal closes.
Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our third quarter performance and some specific financial details of the acquisition. Devinder? Thank you, Lisa.
Let me start first with our third quarter results. Third quarter revenue was $2.8 billion, up 56% from a year ago, driven by very strong Ryzen and EPYC processor sales and the ramp of our new Semi-Custom SoCs. Gross margin was 44%, up 1 percentage point from a year ago, driven by server and client processor sales.
Operating expenses was $706 million compared to $539 million a year ago, driven by increases in R&D and marketing as we accelerated investments in the business to drive future market growth and higher variable compensation-related expense. Operating income more than doubled year-over-year to $525 million, up $285 million or 119% from a year ago, driven primarily by significantly higher revenue.
Net income was $501 million, up $282 million or 129% from a year ago, and diluted earnings per share was $0.41 per share, more than double the $0.18 per share a year ago.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $1.8 billion. We reduced principal debt by $365 million in the quarter, including $200 million of our revolving line of credit and $165 million of convertible senior notes. Conversion of the senior notes resulted in a $38 million non-cash GAAP charge and the issuance of $20 million shares with no impact to diluted share count. Total principal debt outstanding was $398 million at the end of the quarter.
Free cash flow was $265 million. In addition, our senior unsecured credit rating was raised to investment grade by Moody's investor service in the third quarter, reflecting our strong financial results and outflow.
Let me turn to the fourth quarter guidance. Today's outlook is based on current expectations. We expect revenue to be approximately $3 billion plus or minus $100 million, an increase of approximately 41% year-over-year, and 7% sequentially. In addition, for Q4 2020, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 45%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $750 million, non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $30 million, and the diluted share count in the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately 1.23 billion shares.
For the full year 2020, we now expect higher year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 41% driven by the strength of our PC gaming and data center products. We continue to expect gross margin of approximately 45% for the full year, up one percentage point from the prior year.
Now I'd like to turn to today's announcement. We have signed a definitive agreement to acquire Xilinx in a strategic transaction valued at $35 billion. This is a very compelling transaction from a financial perspective. Xilinx has a strong business model characterized by long product life cycles, best-in-class margins, and strong cash flow, all of which are significantly additive to AMD's financial model.
The acquisition is expected to be immediately accretive to gross and operating margins, EPS and free cash flow generation, and the combined company is expected to continue to deliver industry-leading growth.
In addition, we believe we can achieve approximately $300 million of overall cost savings on an annualized basis within 18 months of closing the transaction. Based on the trailing 12 months, the two companies combined would have had revenue of $11.6 billion, gross margin of 51% operating profit of approximately 21% and generated approximately 1.8 billion of free cash flow.
Turning to the capital structure. The balance sheet of the combined company will be very strong with low leverage and an investment grade profile. On a combined basis, as of the most recent quarter of both companies, the total cash balance is $4.9 billion and the debt is $2.4 billion with a gross leverage of 0.85 times.
Now let me cover some details of the transaction structure. At close, Xilinx shareholders will receive 1.7234 shares of AMD for each common share of Xilinx. This represents approximately $143 per share of Xilinx based on AMD's Vitis for the 10 trading day period up to and including October 8.
The pro forma ownership would be approximately 74% for AMD shareholders, and 26% for Xilinx shareholders. We currently expect the acquisition to close by the end of calendar year 2021 subject to required approvals and other customary closing conditions. Until then, the two companies remain separate and will operate independently.
Today is an exciting day for AMD on many fronts. We are very pleased with our market and financial momentum. Our strong lineup of products continues to drive strong revenue growth, margin expansion and improved profitability. Our acquisition of Xilinx is additive to our financial model and is expected to result in meaningful revenue synergy opportunities over the longer term.
Let me now turn it over to Xilinx CEO, Victor Peng for some remarks. Victor? Thanks Devinder.
Let me start by echoing Lisa's enthusiasm about the combination of two premier semiconductor companies, and the many opportunities that will create for our customers, our employees and for our shareholders. The exponential growth of unstructured data, the rapid expansion of connected devices, and the plethora of data-intensive applications with embedded AI are driving the need for more efficient high performance computing solutions.
AMD and Xilinx together will accelerate our ability to define this new year of computing by providing the most comprehensive product portfolio and computing solutions. Our products will power a wide range of intelligent applications from the largest data center to the edge and to the smallest end point. This extended product portfolio together with our industry-leading engineering capabilities, and market expertise will enable our customers to deploy differentiated solutions to market faster.
Our companies share the same vision for transforming people's lives through high performance computing. As Lisa mentioned, we have very similar cultures of innovation, execution excellence and collaboration that make this an exciting new chapter for Xilinx employees. I'm excited about the future of the combined company and accelerating our opportunities to grow the business and lead the new era of computing.
And on a personal note, this is my second time joining AMD and to do that with the Xilinx's team just couldn't be more thrilling for me. The Xilinx shareholders, this transaction provides a great opportunity for long-term value creation given the significant diversification benefits they will receive to exposure to a broader, a much larger growth business when this transaction closes. So I very much look forward to bringing our great companies together.
Let me now turn it back to Lisa. Thanks Victor.
To sum up, we are very pleased with the acceleration of our business in the third quarter. We are on track to deliver significant annual revenue growth this year and have never been more confident in our trajectory. Our strategic acquisition of Xilinx is compelling for all stakeholders with significant value creation for AMD and Xilinx shareholders who will benefit from the future growth and upside potential of the combined company.
We have always been very ambitious in our goals. The acquisition of Xilinx is a natural next step in our journey. Xilinx is an ideal match for AMD combining a highly complementary set of products, customers and markets with differentiated IT and world-class talent.
With that, let's go to questions please. Ruth? Thank you, Lisa. And Kevin, if you could poll the audience for questions please. And we request that the audience stick to two questions, one, as it pertains to the third quarter and one on today's news of the acquisition. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Matt Ramsay from Cowen. Your line is now live. I know a lot of folks who will probably say congratulations but Lisa, Victor I really mean it from our end. I think a great outcome from all everybody, stakeholders. I guess my first question, Lisa, on the deal, I noticed in the slides that you guys put together, obviously, a pro forma model that combines the companies as of the end of the third quarter. But you also mentioned as you did at your Analyst Day back in February a 20% growth CAGR for the business.
I wonder if that might apply to the two companies after you put them together post-close and how confident you are in that growth rate given that in the recent times maybe Xilinx growth has been a little bit slower than the core AMD business growth, but obviously, there is revenue synergy potential as well. So any comments there would be helpful. Thank you. Yes, absolutely. Matt, thanks for the question. So first of all, we feel we're really excited about today. We feel great about our base business. I think you can see that in the strength of our results in the third quarter and our full-year updated guidance, that strategy is playing out very well as we expected with very strong products driving market momentum.
As we look forward at our Financial Analyst Day we talked about 20% CAGR as the right target for our company. I think all of that stays on track. We are a high growth business and we want to remain a high growth business. I think Xilinx brings them a lot of opportunities that are additive to that model, when you look at the markets and the capabilities and just the margins in the free cash flow generation. So a 20% CAGR is the right target for the combined business, I think we feel very good about the organic growth and we feel very good about the growth initiatives that Victor has started. Yes. Thank you for clearing that up, I appreciate it. My question on sort of the results in the core business, you guys put up server revenue sales that more than doubled year-over-year. Your competitor had some rather interesting set of results, some pretty disappointing results I think from their enterprise and government segments, and they guided for their combined data centric business. I know that's not exactly the same as server, but they guided for that to be down I think 25% year-over-year in the fourth quarter.
You guys have some momentum you're going to launch Milan, and I think you mentioned in the release some progress on the enterprise side as well. But maybe, Lisa, you get back up and give us your context of where the server market is overall right now and how it might mean - what it might mean for your revenue into the fourth quarter. Thank you. Sure, Matt. So look the data center business particularly on the server side is very important to us. We performed very well here in the third quarter, as you said double from a year-over-year standpoint, sequential double-digit growth. We see good momentum across the cloud hyperscalers as well as in the enterprise business. We have more platforms that continue to launch here in the third quarter.
As we look forward from a data center environment, I would say that the overall data center environment is actually good. As we go here into the fourth quarter, we are starting to launch Milan in terms of shipments to cloud, as well as some HPC customers this quarter. OEMs are preparing to launch Milan platforms in the first quarter. And I would say it's very much a customer specific message. Some of our cloud customers are going to continue to ramp Rome in the fourth quarter. Several are also preparing for our transition from Rome to Milan.
But overall, we believe that the demand environment is good and the thing that excites us is Milan is just very, very strong. It's coming in as we expected. Zen 3 we previewed some of that performance on the desktop side, but we see strong translation into TCO benefits and performance benefits for our server products.
So, again we look forward to talking about that more as we go through the quarter. But, yes - overall, I think the data center business continues to be very strategic and performs well for us. Our next question today is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the strong results. I'll actually just focus on the core business. Lisa for my first question, you're raising second half sales growth by nearly - I think about $600 million or so. Could you help us dissect and quantify how much of that is coming from the main areas of PCs and EPYC servers and semi-custom and GPU, I mean this is a significant guide ahead and I'm curious what created this level of surprise. Yes. So, Vivek thanks for the question. Our core business is doing very well. I think if you look at some of the components of that - the PC market environment is strong. If you look at all the work from home, schools from home trends, I think that has certainly helped this year. On top of that, our Ryzen 4000 series notebooks are doing very, very well.
So we are seeing strong traction in areas that we hadn't been - that present before like gaming and commercial. So that's one big element. We are ramping our game consoles here in the second half of the year. Those are very highly anticipated launches that are coming up shortly, and demand for that has been quite strong, and our server business has also performed well.
You will see us start with the - you asked about graphics will see gaming graphics here grow sequentially in the fourth quarter as we launch our Radeon 6000 series. So we just have a combination of a lot of product momentum product cycles. I will also say that our supply situation has also improved, as our demand environment has gotten stronger. We've worked closely with our suppliers to ensure that we can satisfy as much of that is possible. And so those are all of the elements for the strong second half. And for my follow-up Lisa. You're now at the 10-ish percent server share mark of the TAM that you have identified. Does the next 10% get easier or more difficult? You mentioned you're launching Milan soon, your competitor is launching their Ice Lake. So from the outside it looks like a lot of hand-to-hand combat every quarter in the server business. How do we think about the journey for your server business from here again as the next 10% become more easier or difficult and why? Thank you. Well, I would say it this way Vivek. I think we have made a tremendous amount of progress in the server business. I think the - if you look at the leadership performance and TCO that we have with Rome we've seen broad adoption across cloud, as well as enterprise and we've done very, very well in HPC.
We think that Milan is even better and our mantra to our customers has been strong road map, you can count on us, we will be there when you need us. I think the traction from Milan is stronger than for Rome. I think we continue to work hard with our customers to ramp as fast as possible, but you'll see broader cloud adoption, I think you'll see faster cloud adoption.
And I think you'll see broader enterprise platforms. Especially with Zen 3, we talked about some of the single threaded performance improvements that really round out the server portfolio. So I think we're very focused on the data center and will continue to be that as a combined company as well. Our next question today is coming from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. Thanks for taking the question and congrats to both teams. Lisa, as a follow-up to the first question I wanted to get your view on some of the markets within Xilinx. You mentioned in response to the first question that you're comfortable with the 20% growth rate for the combined business. We've heard from Victor and his team over the past couple of years in terms of how they're thinking about their opportunity set in 5G data center and the core businesses, but how are you thinking about sort of the three to five year CAGR for data center coms and some of the core markets, and then I've got a follow-up? Yes, sure Toshiya. Thanks for the question. So clearly, when we look at our core business through the AMD core business, I think we feel very, very good about the growth in our core markets across PC gaming and data center. I think the product portfolio is very strong. As we add Xilinx to the portfolio, I think, we both chosen data center as our strategic focus. I think the investments that Victor and the Xilinx team have made are very strategic investments in the data center for us. We have the CPU and GPU strength, Xilinx brings the accelerator capability and very strategic SmartNIC technology.
I think that's a strong growth vector for the combined company. I think the broader markets in communications, in automotive, in industrial and aerospace and defense, those are all very attractive markets, that can use CPUs and GPUs, and so I think the market presence that Xilinx has and the leadership in those markets also help sort of have the ability to bring some of the base AMD technology in there.
So, I think together. There are a lot of opportunities, I want to be clear though, first and foremost, both businesses are executing very well. And Victor and I intend to keep it that way. So I think the base growth profiles of both businesses are very strong. And then, we do see significant revenue synergy opportunities as we look out into the three to five year timeframe as we bring these portfolios together. And then as a quick follow-up just on market share trends in both the client business and the server CPU business based on what you're guiding to for Q4 and based on what your competitors guiding to where do you feel like. Where do you see you guys - yourselves lending from a market share perspective in both the client business in the server business exiting this year?
And more importantly, based on the design wins that you've already secured and where do you see yourselves kind of in the middle part of 2021 or exiting 2021? Thank you. Well, what I would say is based on our performance in the third quarter and our view for the second half year. We do believe, we'll gain share in both markets. And I think, I've always said this is a journey. So, the key for us is to continue to execute very well. I think, the customer momentum is definitely there and - our goal is to continue to delight our customers and execute well. So I do think we're making progress on that journey for share gain and we'll continue to do that. Our next question is coming from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your line is now live. For my company question or business question in Q4 you’re up 41% year-over-year. The guidance, do you think you can keep that kind of magnitude of growth into the first half of next year. Especially as the PC market maybe comes under - more pressure just given the potential pull-forward from the work from home dynamics. How should we thinking about that trajectory? So Stacy sorry we made you wake up early this morning I think. No worries, no worries. So look, I think there's no question. It's a very strong demand environment for us right now. As we look into the first half of the year. It's a little bit early to be specific about 2021. But what I will say is that, we believe there is some market phenomena here, but there is also very of AMD specific product - gains that we're seeing. I think our notebook portfolio has never been better. And if I look at the strength of the new platforms that are coming up and what we see into 2021.
I think we're really excited about that, our desktop products with our recent launch of Ryzen’s 5000 very strong. This is the first year of the console cycle. So the console cycle is a little bit different in the first year. I think you’ll see some very, very strong demand there and then we're right in the middle of launching Milan and EPYC. So, I think we feel good about the growth prospects into 2021.
We'll get into a little bit more of the quarterly dynamics as we finish up this year, but I think there is market and then there is just what our product portfolio is doing right now. Got it, thank you, that's helpful. So my Xilinx question, so I gave a CPU company buying an FPGA somebody obviously has been tried before your competitor tried this as well. It was not terribly successful to the point. How would you say your vision for what you can do with Xilinx is different, maybe from what Intel might have a view with Altera? And maybe what lessons have you potentially learned from the issues that they've had with that deal? Yes absolutely, Stacy, I'll make a few comments and then, I'm sure Victor will have a few comments. Look, we've been thinking about this for some time and I think it's actually a very different situation Xilinx is the market leader. I mean if you look at how their business has grown over the last few years. Their market share has continued to grow. I think both companies are executing really well.
So you ask why now I mean, why now is actually we feel very good about our base businesses. I think the people look at our businesses and say they're complementary and they are very complementary from a product and market standpoint. But we have sort of important intersections around the data center focus and then also around the technology sort of strategy, right.
I mean where we're both leading-edge technology users. We both have partnered with TSMC. We both have really leaned into this modular design environment and Xilinx is a leader in some of that - some of the 2.5 3D integration. We’re both invested in software and open source. So there are a lot of synergies that are sort of under the covers that we see and we see very strongly. And I think you'll see as the road maps execute.
And then I think the last point I'll mention is, I think our cultures are very, very aligned and we're both Victor and I are both engineers at heart. We love the technology we have a common vision, I'm really, really happy that he is joining me on this journey. I think, we have a bold vision of what we think we can do for the industry and for our joint companies. And I think that's, that's what we see as the - what's different and as you know, Stacy.
I mean I haven't been big on M&A. We're not doing M&A for M&A sake. I mean this is such a unique opportunity there actually is no better match in the industry for us then Xilinx. So Victor, you want to add some comments. Yes, I think you put it very well Lisa. I think this is completely different than that transaction. And I guess, I'll just lean into the fact that as Lisa said. We have very common vision for the transformations that are happening, not only in the data center. But I would say at the edge and even endpoint applications. And I’m super excited about joining back with AMD and with the Xilinx team.
And I think we really do have very similar cultures, very focused on innovating very focused on execution and strong teamwork culture for both within the company and also with customers. And I think this is what it's all about. We're going to create tremendous value for customers. And I'm really excited to bring some of the underlying technologies that Lisa talked about to the fore and you'll see that over time, so. Yes, and clearly, I personally I'm, all in so. We’ll make sure that we integrate well. Our next question today is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on the announcement. I guess, I would like to pick up on Victor’s point about the computing at the edge. It seems like there is a lot of talk edge computing and it seems like base stations are a logical place for that to happen, especially as 5G is deployed. And as you think about delivering joint solution, joint AMD, Xilinx solutions?
Does the architecture of the compute platform at the edge, is it different from, does it differ from the kind of what we think about today is the core datacenter. And is the - value proposition for AMD and Xilinx together is it is a particularly advantaged or unique from other solutions, other kind of architectural relations that have been proposed out there? That's the first question, I have a follow-up to? Yes sure, Mark. So look, we’ll have a very strong portfolio if you look at all of the elements between CPUs, GPUs the traditional FPGAs as well as the adaptive SSCs that that Xilinx has been investing in. I think that portfolio lends a lot of solution capability when you look at specific workloads. So on the accelerator side, as we've been investing on the GPUs with Radeon Instinct and the focus there has been on training and has been on HPC environments.
Victor’s focus has actually been quite a bit at the edge. I think we share the idea that a common software environment is so important to try to accelerate the usage of those solutions in the market. And so, I think we'll have sort of a basket of technology that can be used very well from the infrastructure cloud side to the edge and endpoints. I don't know Victor, if you'd like to add anything there. Yes, sure I mean, I think there is a lot that we can leverage from a technology and architecture perspective. But I think some of the differences are obviously and primarily the workload and also there is more element for needing more real-time kind of responses low latency. I think, the fact that the workloads are different, you want to customize some of those things that's where I think the combination of AMD and Xilinx is very powerful.
Because we can handle a lot of the customizations and optimizations and fast real-time response, but then for some of the really very heavy compute-intensive things, there is a lot of great technology out of AMD. And putting the two together seamlessly also with software really makes that a powerful solution. And I think that's what this is about comprehensive powerful solutions, right tailored to the workloads whether it's at the edge, even endpoints and of course in the cloud. That's very helpful and insightful. Thank you. As the follow-up is, obviously, there is going to be a level of integration with AMD and Xilinx products together. Can you help us understand to what extent is the integration happening on the hardware side in your kind of vision versus the software? Is it FPGAs and CPUs and GPUs integrated on monolithic or with interposers or is there - you have an architecture with - you demonstrated success for architecture with infinity fabric and you are stitching together that way and then you have a software layer also that's integrating these things. If you can provide any color on that vision that would be helpful. Thank you. Sure, Mark. Look, I think the days of monolithic integration are probably over. We've been on this triplet methodology because it's the right thing to do, you get the right compute for the right workloads. Xilinx team is also very advanced and thinking on this area.
I think there will be some, let's call it opportunities for us to do things on the hardware side, but I view it more as market specific optimization as we think about what customers need, and then certainly on the software environment, we are very, very focused on doubling down on the software environment because that's really the key to accelerate adoption. So, lots of opportunities for us to bring the portfolios together, but really I think the opportunities at the solution level with customers and the important workloads. Our next question today is coming from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. On the deal, you talked about $300 million in cost savings 18 months out. Can you talk about where that might come from, and what are the priorities in terms of - I assume you want to keep the sales force and tax and things like that. Just how are you going to approach that cost savings? Yes, sure. Joe. So the majority of those cost savings are really on - just the scale of bringing the two companies together. So if you think about our opportunities on the COGS side, as well as some of the public company functions and those kinds of things, our intent on R&D is, we've been growing and we're going to continue to grow R&D. I think what it allow us to do is actually there will be some synergy on some things that we're both doing like some of the IPs that are just sort of necessary IPs, but it allow us to invest more in things like AI and software and so on so.
We're not counting on any major changes at all to either business from the running of the business. I think the emphasis here is that both companies are executing extremely well and we're going to continue to keep it that way, and so Victor will continue to run the Xilinx business and obviously we have a lot to execute on the AMD side, but these synergies are really more from COGS and just public company type stuff that go on. And then in terms of the business, could you talk about data center GPU, you mentioned HPC opportunities, can you give us just a short update on cloud gaming and then the timing of CDNA? Thank you. Yes, so you'll hear more about CDNA later this year, so in the - here in a couple of - month or two, so as we look at the data center GPU space, I think the cloud opportunities that we have are continuing to ramp I would say, but the large HPC opportunities really come into play in 2021. So we should see a significant ramp in our data center GPU business in 2021 as some of those wins are publicly announced and we'll ramp next year. Your next question today is coming from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live. Yes, good morning, congratulations Lisa and Victor, both on the deal, and Lisa on the solid results. My first question is just on the core business and gross margins, and I apologize if you have been bouncing around a couple of call this morning. But Lisa, I'm wondering how much - there were some news presses in the calendar third quarter that perhaps the ramp on the gaming side had occurred some more costs than originally expected. But I guess importantly, when you look at gaming as a percent of mix and the fact that Q3 is kind of the first gaming quarter which is tends to be the lowest gross margin quarter. It strikes me that September should be a gross margin bottom for the overall business, and I'm wondering if you just help me understand if that's a fair comment on how I should think about improvement in gross margin in gaming over time? Yes. Sure, John. So certainly we ramped heavily the console business here in the third quarter. I think we were right at our margin guidance as we go sequentially into the fourth quarter. We see increase in margins from 44% to 45%.
I think there are couple of aspects there. So we do have the console business growing sequentially. And so that is a bit margin decretive. However, we also have our other business is growing as well that offset that.
It is true that the early parts of the console ramp are typically - we're working through some ramp issues, I would say the ramp is going quite well and the demand environment is very strong overall and we continue to work on satisfying all of the demand. That's helpful. And then going back to the deal, the rationale around both the data center and wireless wireline is fairly straight forward and obvious. I'd love to get your view kind of on the broader industrial and auto buckets that Xilinx plays in today distribution channel, which is not necessarily something that you guys deal within your core business. And specifically on the auto side, is there incremental silicon opportunity for core AMD on the auto side with Xilinx? Yes, absolutely, John. So clearly there is a lot of synergy on the data center in the com side as you mentioned, but that core markets business - Xilinx’s core market business is a beautiful business. I mean if you just look at the product life cycles the customer, the customer diversity and just how those go, so we're very happy with adding that to the portfolio.
I think it adds sort of a different rhythm to the rest of our business, and as I said earlier, we're very cognizant that it's a different business. It will be - continue to run as it runs today. I've had some experience in the embedded business before. So we expect that to continue to be a very important driver of the overall financial model that we're putting together. And if I could add to that, I definitely see opportunity for AMD's products in the auto business. We do a lot there, but if you look at the amount of computing that's being done in domain controllers, central units, there is a lot of need for some very, very powerful computing and we handle lot of the sensor fusion a real-time kind of applications.
And so, I absolutely think that there is opportunity there and there certainly things. Of course, we've learned through the more than two decades of servicing the auto business that we can help - have some mutual learning back and forth and how to go to market and support those customers. Yes absolutely, Victor. That's a great point I think automotive is a long-term opportunity for us with the technology that we have. Helpful guys, and congratulations again. Thanks, John. Operator, we'll take two more questions, please. Certainly. Our next question is coming from Hans Mosesmann from Rosenblatt Securities. Your line is now live. Congrats guys good stuff here. A question on capacity, Lisa you mentioned that it got better here in the back half of 2020. But as you look at 2021, 7-nanometer and I assume 5-nanometers specifically towards the end, I suppose? How is that capacity looking like and then I have a follow-up? Thanks. Yes thanks, Hans. So, look our second half has certainly been very strong and it was stronger than we originally planned. And so, we've worked closely with our suppliers to improve the supply availability. And I would say that even with that demand still exceeds supply in certain segments.
As we go into 2021, I think we are planning for success. And so, we're working very closely across the supply chain to ensure that we have enough wafer capacity, as well as back-end capacity. And we're going to continue to work on that, but certainly there are areas where we would like to supply to be higher and we're working on that. And that’s for both seven and five just as a general comment that you're saying? Yes, I'm not making a specific technology statement, but other than to say that we believe we will have the ability to support our strong growth objectives. Okay, that's helpful. And then my question on the Xilinx part of this deal. They have, as you know, a very good kudo like software compiler platform Vitis. And I believe that anything would benefit from that, but how do you see that kind of being woven into AMD and does AMD have something like that in the works, how would that play out? Thanks. Yes, we both have been investing in the software environment to really make our products easy to use. I agree with you, I think Xilinx has a very strong software platform. We've also been investing in the ROCm platform for our GPUs. And so, those would be some of the things that we bring together over time. Yes, I just like to point out, many people may not be aware that we've been collaborating on ROCm and some other - the HSA in the past and a lot of the other initiatives that AMD has been driving in sort of this open development environments. Your final question today is coming from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your line is now alive. Yes, thanks for taking the question. I have one on the business and then one on the acquisition as well. Just real quickly on the business as we think about the EESC segment for the guide into this current quarter, I'm just curious if you can help us appreciate how you are looking at the semi custom business relative to the EPYC server business and what you are necessarily seeing in the competitive landscape right now. And then I have a quick follow-up? Yes, so I think - as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're seeing a strong semi-custom environment here in the first year usually Q3 is the peak for us in semi-custom. And this year we'll see sequential growth into Q4, just given the strong demand environment. But, I think - that's the result of the product space. I think - when you talk about the competitive environment. I think the competitive environment I mean it's about the same - I mean I think it's, it's always a competitive environment, but our focus has been on our product strategy and working with our customers.
So, I wouldn't say I've seen a change in the dynamic, I think there is a lot of excitement in our server business around Milan. And bringing Milan to market even ramping that even faster than we ramped Rome, and so that's where the focus is. And then on the acquisition side, I'm just curious of how you see or envision the role of SmartNIC and how quickly you see the kind of the portfolios combined with regard to the SmartNIC category with regard to the Xilinx. And then embedding some of the core AMD compute capabilities, along with that SmartNIC, I'm just curious on what do you see happening datacenter architecture wise, around that evolution? Yes, look - the SmartNIC technology and just the overall acceleration technology in the data center, we think is very important. I think Xilinx has made significant investments there that's additive to our data center portfolio today. I think both of us have been very engaged in the top hyperscalers and we will continue to do that. We also see opportunities over time in the enterprise segment as well.
So, I think the relationships that we have across all the top customers can help accelerate some of that solution development, and that will be a key focus for the combined company. And if I could add, just maybe getting a little bit on the technology side. AMD has been leading in core density and with SmartNIC’s offloading of the cores and improves the overall throughput and TCL for the data center. And again, we've also both have very high interconnect leadership. So I think - it really - that is a good example of delivering a better overall solution for the data center customers. Thank you. We reached end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over for any further or closing comments. Yes now, I was just going to say, so thanks all for joining today. I know we covered a tremendous amount of material across our business and the acquisition. We look forward to - really look forward to bringing these two companies together. I think it's a very special and unique moment for us and we look forward to talking more about it as we go forward. Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.","a live call will be replayed via webcast on our website, amd.com . we will refer primarily to non-GAAP financial metrics during this call . today marks a significant milestone in our journey to establish AMD as the industry's high-performance computing leader.",0.0

Now with that, I'd like to hand the call over to Lisa. Lisa? Thank you, Ruth, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. 2020 marked an inflection point in our long-term journey as we made significant progress establishing AMD as the high-performance computing leader. We significantly accelerated our business and exceeded our aggressive growth goals for the year while navigating industry-wide challenges caused by COVID-19.
We built substantial momentum throughout the year as we successfully ramped volume production of more than 20 7-nanometer PC, gaming and data center products. Annual revenue grew 45%, setting a new record at $9.76 billion. We also expanded gross margin for the fifth straight year and more than doubled net income from the prior year. While the PC market grew approximately 13% in 2020 to surpass more than 300 million units for the first time since 2014, our annual client processor revenue grew by more than 50% as AMD Ryzen processor adoption increased.
We delivered record client annual processor revenue as we gained significant share in 2020. Adoption of EPYC processors across cloud, enterprise and HPC customers also accelerated significantly in 2020. We set a new all-time record for annual server processor revenue. Server processor sales more than doubled year-over-year, and our overall data center sales are now a high-teens percentage of our total annual revenue.
Looking at the fourth quarter, we ended the year very strong. Revenue grew 53% year-over-year to a record $3.24 billion, while net income increased 66%.
Turning to our Computing and Graphics segment. Fourth quarter revenue increased 18% year-over-year to $1.96 billion. Desktop CPU revenue grew by a strong double-digit percentage year-over-year and sequentially driven by strong demand for our Ryzen processor family in both OEM systems and the channel. Sell-through of our new Ryzen 5000 processors featuring our Zen 3 core was particularly strong, more than doubling the launch quarter sales of any prior generation Ryzen desktop processor.
In mobile, CPU shipments increased by a double digit percentage, both sequentially and year-over-year. We set records for both quarterly and annual mobile processor unit shipments as Ryzen 4000 notebook shipments continued to ramp in support of the 100 notebook design wins launched in 2020.
At CES earlier this month, we launched our Ryzen 5000 mobile processors for ultrathin, gaming and commercial notebooks. These new mobile processors featuring our Zen 3 processor core, extend our performance and battery life leadership, delivering up to 23% higher performance compared to our previous generation and 17.5 hours of battery life. We are on track to increase the number of notebook designs powered by our new Ryzen 5000 processors by 50% compared to our prior generation, positioning us well for further growth in 2021.
In Graphics, revenue declined year-over-year and increased sequentially. Desktop GPU sales increased significantly from the prior quarter, driven by the ramp of our new Radeon 6000 series GPUs, featuring our RDNA 2 architecture that deliver up to twice the performance and 65% more performance per watt than our prior generation.
We are seeing very strong demand for our new GPUs. The Radeon 6000 series are our fastest-selling high-end GPUs ever with launch quarter shipments 3x larger than any prior AMD gaming GPU priced above $549. We continue to ramp production to meet the strong demand, and are on track to expand our Radeon 6000 GPU portfolio in the first half of the year with the new RDNA 2-based desktop and mobile GPUs.
Data center GPU revenue decreased year-over-year but increased sequentially, including initial shipments of our AMD Instinct MI100 accelerator. MI100 features our new CDNA data center GPU architecture and is the industry's fastest HPC accelerator for scientific research, and the first Data center GPU to break the 10 teraflops barrier. We are making strong progress on our data center GPU hardware road map and expanding our software ecosystem in preparation for the launch of the first exascale supercomputer in the United States, the all-AMD powered Frontier system planned to go online later this year at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
Now turning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. Revenue of $1.28 billion increased 176% year-over-year driven by strong growth in both semi-custom and server processor sales. Semi-Custom sales increased year-over-year and sequentially based on strong demand for the next-generation Sony and Microsoft consoles. Our Semi-Custom SoC sales are ramping faster than the last console cycle, and we expect sales to be better than typical seasonality in the first half of this year based on the current strong demand.
Now turning to server, we had record revenue in the fourth quarter as both cloud and enterprise sales grew sequentially. Cloud adoption remains strong as Google, Microsoft, Tencent and others continue expanding their use of EPYC processors to power larger portions of their critical internal infrastructure, and the number of AMD-powered cloud instances expands. 28 new public cloud instances launched in the fourth quarter from Alibaba, AWS and Oracle, while Google expanded general availability of their confidential computing VMs powered exclusively by EPYC processors to 9 regions.
For the year, the number of AMD-powered instances available from the largest cloud providers doubled to more than 200. In the enterprise, adoption of AMD-powered servers grew as Dell, HPE and Lenovo secured new end customer wins with Fortune 1000 accounts across key verticals, including manufacturing, financial services and automotive. In HPC, the number of AMD-powered supercomputers on the November top 500 list increased to 21 systems including 2 of the top 10 and the fastest supercomputer in Europe.
We expect our data center business to accelerate in 2021 as we further extend our performance, efficiency and TCO leadership with the launch of our next-gen server processors, code name Milan. Milan production began in the fourth quarter as planned, with initial shipments to cloud and HPC customers. We are very pleased with the performance of Milan.
We conducted the first public preview of Milan at CES, highlighting 68% better performance compared to 2 of the highest-end dual-socket processors from our competition when running a compute-intensive weather modeling simulation. We're on track to publicly launch our 3rd Gen EPYC Milan processors in March with very strong ecosystem support.
In summary, our strong 2020 results and 2021 guidance demonstrate the growing momentum for our leadership product portfolio and the robust demand for high-performance computing. In the last year, we have all seen firsthand the essential role high-performance computing now plays in our daily lives, and we expect adoption to accelerate over the coming years as we enter a high-performance computing mega cycle, driven by the growing adoption of cloud computing services, accelerating digital transformation of industries and experiences, the transition to exascale supercomputing and the mainstream adoption of AI.
Against this backdrop, we are very confident we have the right long-term strategy and capabilities to deliver a strong cadence of leadership products and make AMD the premier technology growth franchise. Longer term, our strategic acquisition of Xilinx further strengthens our technology capabilities and positions us well for growth across a broader set of markets. We passed several important regulatory milestones to date, and remain on track to close the transaction by the end of 2021.
I am very proud of what AMD has accomplished over the last few years as our talented and dedicated employees established a new pace for innovation in the high-performance computing industry. I'm even more excited about what we can accomplish over the coming years based on our road maps and the strong opportunities we see to play an even larger strategic role with our customers and partners.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our fourth quarter and full year financial performance. Devinder? Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. 2020 was an outstanding year for AMD. Our industry-leading product portfolio and market share gains drove record annual and quarterly revenue with full year revenue growth of 45%. We also achieved record annual net income and free cash flow. We are pleased with our strong performance and the leverage in our financial model.
Fourth quarter revenue was $3.24 billion, up 53% from a year ago and up 16% from the prior quarter driven by strong sales of Ryzen and EPYC processors and semi-custom game console SoCs. Gross margin was 45%, approximately flat year-over-year. Operating expenses were $789 million, up 45% year-over-year driven by increased investments in R&D go-to-market activities and higher variable employee compensation-related expenses.
Operating income was $663 million, up $258 million or 64% from a year ago driven by significant revenue growth, and operating margin was 20% compared to 19% a year ago. Net income was $636 million, up $253 million or 66% from a year ago, and diluted earnings per share was $0.52 compared to $0.32 per share a year ago.
Now turning to the business segment results. Fourth quarter Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $1.96 billion, up 18% year-over-year primarily driven by significant Ryzen processor growth. Computing and Graphics segment operating income was $420 million, or 21% of revenue compared to $360 million a year ago driven by higher revenue.
Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue was $1.28 billion, up 176% year-over-year driven by strong semi-custom product sales and continued EPYC server processor momentum across the cloud and enterprise markets. EPYC processor revenue grew sequentially, including early shipments of third-generation EPYC Milan processors. EESC segment operating income was $243 million or 19% of revenue compared to an operating income of $45 million a year ago driven by higher revenue.
Turning to the balance sheet. We had record free cash flow of $480 million in the fourth quarter. Inventory was $1.4 billion, up 8% from the prior quarter in preparation of 2021 sales. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $753 million compared to $469 million a year ago, driven by higher quarterly earnings.
Before I turn to the full year financial results, let me address a GAAP tax item. Based on our financial results and strong outlook, we released a significant portion of our tax valuation allowance totaling $1.3 billion which had a GAAP EPS benefit of $1.06 in the fourth quarter and a benefit of $1.07 for the full year.
Now let me turn to our full year financial results. 2020 revenue was $9.76 billion, up 45% year-on-year driven by strong growth in both business segments. Gross margin of 45% was up 190 basis points from the prior year driven by Ryzen and EPYC products, partially offset by semi-custom and Radeon product sales.
Operating expenses were 28% of revenue, improving from 31% in 2019. 2020 operating income was up 97% from a year ago to $1.66 billion or 17% of revenue. Net income was $1.58 billion, up 108% from the prior year.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $2.3 billion at year-end and full year free cash flow was $777 million as compared to $276 million in 2019. We reduced principal debt by $225 million in 2020 and ended the year with $338 million of gross debt. Now turning to the outlook for the first quarter of 2021. We expect revenue to be approximately $3.2 billion, plus or minus $100 million an increase of approximately 79% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. The year-over-year increase is expected to be driven by growth in all businesses. The sequential performance is driven primarily by better than normal seasonality in our PC and semi-custom businesses and strength in our data center business. In addition, for Q1 2021, we expect: non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 46%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $830 million; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $105 million, including an effective tax rate of 15%; and first quarter diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.23 billion shares.
For the full year 2021, we expect revenue growth of approximately 37% driven by growth in all businesses; we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 47%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately 26% of revenue; non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 15%; and we expect the company's cash tax rate to be approximately 3%.
In closing, I'm very pleased with our 2020 results, which demonstrate the strength of AMD's product momentum, customer traction and market share gains. As we enter 2021, and continue to invest in the business and execute our long-term strategy, we are well positioned to drive gross margin expansion, increase profitability and deliver strong shareholder returns.
With that, I'll turn it back to Ruth for the question-and-answer session. Ruth? Thank you, Devinder. Operator, please poll the audience for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is coming from Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Congrats on the very strong results. But maybe first, just on the annual guide, obviously very robust. You said all segments up. But I was wondering if you could provide any color either by segment or by product, which ones would be better or worse than that very robust 37%. Sure. So thanks for the question, Blayne. Look, we're excited going into 2021. Obviously, 2020 was quite a strong growth year for us. As we look at the annual guidance, we really do see strength across all of our businesses. So the -- it's led by our larger businesses. So significant growth -- we expect significant growth in server, growth in PCs as well as growth in the semi-custom console business. But we also see growth in our graphics business across consumer and data center graphics as we ramp the full product lines there as we go through 2021. So overall, I think we're seeing the strength of the new product portfolio as well as a positive demand environment. And then maybe as just a follow-up, I'm curious on how you think about the shape of the year. Obviously, March seems to be much better than seasonal across several product lines. I'm just curious how you're thinking about the overall PC market. I think Intel talked about for being first half weighted. And then obviously, semi-custom, you probably didn't as much in December as you did the first 3 quarters of 2020. Kind of curious how you just think about first half, second half within that. Yes. So you saw that a little bit in our Q1 guidance. I think our Q1 guidance is better than normal seasonality. We normally see as the first half weaker than the second half just given the consumer bent. What we see this year is a little bit of a different shape. The shape is -- from a market standpoint, we see PCs and gaming better than seasonal. There's some pent-up demand coming into the first half of the year, and that's baked into the guidance.
But we're also seeing a strong data center environment. So we see server up sequentially in Q1, and that's on the strength of both our current products or our Rome products as well as the Milan ramp. So a little bit different shape than normal, but I think we see strong demand across our PC gaming and data center segments. Our next question today is coming from Matt Ramsay from Cowen. I wanted to start with server, and I've modeled a much bigger dollar contribution in 2021 to the growth than there had been in prior years. And I picked up in the prepared script, Lisa, that you mentioned accelerating growth for your data center franchise in 2021. I think that's probably off a business that doubled last year. So do I have that right that it will accelerate in percentage terms? And maybe you could break down a little bit. I saw Alibaba in the slides announced. There's a Milan launch coming that I think could push you into enterprise a little bit more than you've been in the past. Some drivers of that server growth would be really helpful. Yes. Sure. So Matt, thanks for the question. We are happy with the progress in the data center business. I think 2020 was a strong year for us. We do see a significant growth into 2021.
I think there are a number of drivers. First of all, I think we're seeing the cloud business strengthen for us. So going into the first half of the year, and as I said, that's both on the current-generation Rome as well as the next-generation Milan. The reception to Milan is very strong. So we're pleased with the performance. We started shipments in Q4. That's continuing into Q1. You'll see -- we expect to see sort of more customers, sort of new customers adopt Milan than perhaps that had been on our previous generation. You'll also see a very strong enterprise portfolio. So I think we have a very strong time-to-market platforms with the key OEMs, and that's part of our launch plan later this quarter. So overall, I think we are optimistic about the data center in 2021. I think there's a lot of need across cloud and enterprise, and we think Milan is very well positioned. My second question, I wanted to ask a little bit about supply. It's no secret that the industry is supply constrained, both due to growth and because of some of the challenges with COVID, and your company is no different. Maybe you could characterize for us the magnitude of supply constraints. And how much they might have been hindering what was obviously really strong growth as it was. But that's number one.
And then number two, I noticed that a lot of folks had maybe thought that the big CapEx increase from TSMC might have been something to do with Intel. And I think the incoming CEO there has maybe clarified some of those thoughts. But I wonder as you look forward through this year, how your guidance incorporates increasing supply coming online. And if you've guided to an assumption of better supply or what you have line of sight to with your partners. Yes, sure. So certainly, when I look at the semiconductor environment in 2020, it was very strong. So we saw a strong revenue ramp in our business as well as across some of our peers. It's fair to say that the overall demand exceeded our planning. And as a result, we did have some supply constraints as we ended the year. Those were primarily, I would say, in the PC market, the low end of the PC market and in the gaming markets.
That being said, I think we're getting great support from our manufacturing partners. The industry does need to increase the overall capacity levels. And so we do see some tightness through the first half of the year, but there's added capacity in the second half.
And then as in terms of how we think about these things. So for our full year annual guide, we do have good visibility on both the demand side and the supply side. And that was the basis for the guidance across the businesses. Our next question today is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America. And congratulations on the strong outlook despite all the industry constraints. Lisa, just one question to go back to a prior one. I was hoping you could help us dissect Q1 and the 2021 outlook with and without your semi-custom business, so we get a sense for the different moving drivers of the business, both in Q1 and for the full year. Yes. So let's see. Let me start with Q1. So as I said in the -- earlier that we do see the PC market and the console business a bit better than seasonal. Normally, consoles would be seasonally down quite a bit, double digits. You would expect consoles this quarter will still be, let's call it, modestly down. We do see a sequential increase in the server business as well as in the graphics business as we ramp new products there.
And then as we go into 2021, I would say we're now at the place where we have, let's call it, three businesses at scale. And so the guidance really encompasses very significant growth across our data center business in the service space, growth in PCs, just given the visibility that we have around platforms and platform launches on both the notebook side and the strength of our channel portfolio. And then we do see growth in the console business as well as there's a lot of demand for the new consoles.
So I think those are the three big drivers for the full year. And I would say it's well balanced between the three. And then in addition, we also have growth in our consumer and data center GPU business as a result of some of the new products launched there. So it's a fairly, let's call it, broad based set of drivers, particularly around the product launches. Got it. And for my follow-up, it's interesting that as you're launching Milan, your competitor is also launching their data center server. And so both kind of a near term and then a '21 question. So in the near term, there has been some discussion of cloud digestion. I know you're talking about your business actually growing sequentially. So I was hoping you could address what demand environment you were seeing in the very near term from your cloud and enterprise and HPC customers.
But looking out to 2021, both you and your competitor will actually be on very -- almost the same manufacturing node. So how do you think that will play a role in your decision-making of your customers. Because I think a lot of times the discussion kind of becomes one dimensional on who is at which manufacturing node. So talk to us about, even if you are on the same node as your competitor, what's your ability and confidence and visibility to take market share in the server CPU business. Yes. Thanks, Vivek. That's a very good question. So in the near term, what we're seeing in the cloud is actually a period of strong demand. And so that's -- we saw it strengthening as we went through the fourth quarter, and we see demand environment robust in the first quarter. So I think that's a -- those are good signals for us.
I think for the year 2021, we're excited about Milan. I mean it's a very strong product. You've already seen a bit of what Zen 3 can do in just our desktop and notebook portfolio. I think it builds upon what we did in Rome. So I completely agree with you. I think manufacturing technology is one aspect of what makes a product competitive, but we have been very focused on overall performance, overall system performance, how it performs in the cloud and enterprise environments. I will say that I think Milan is the most balanced product that we have. Both for, let's call it, enterprise applications as well as for the broad set of cloud applications.
And in terms of visibility, I would say that we have better visibility starting this year than we've had in the past years because this is our third-generation with EPYC. So we're now on, let's call it, deep customer relationships. Many of the decisions have been made earlier as they were testing out our product. And we have good confidence that we're going to ramp well. So exciting year for the data center. But certainly, we're pleased with how Milan is performing and the interest in the marketplace. Our next question is coming from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. I wanted to start on margins first. So in the quarter, you had record server revenues, you said high teens, I'd put it to something like $550 million or $600 million which looks pretty good. At the same time, like gross margins sort of barely came in line with guidance. I mean they actually missed by a few kind of tens of basis points. I guess I'm just a little surprised, is that all console mix? And was consoles like that much better-than-expected relative to servers that you wouldn't see gross margin upside in the quarter? And I guess the same comments on the guide a little bit of upside. But at the same time, we've got consoles down. We've got everything else growing, and yet we've only got a little bit of upside in gross margins. So I guess if you could help me square that or square that with what you're seeing, that would be helpful, please. Yes, sure, Stacy. Be happy to do that. So first, on the fourth quarter. I think we saw strength across a couple of different businesses relative to what we had guided. So we saw strength -- a little bit of strength in the console business, some strength in servers as well as some strength in PCs. And PCs in the fourth quarter tend to be a bit more weighted to the consumer side of the business. So those were some of the puts and takes. But from an overall sort of margin expectation standpoint, I think we were right where we expected to be.
And then going into 2021, if you're talking about the first quarter guide, I think my commentary was that we see PCs and consoles a bit better than seasonal. So consoles would normally be let's call it, down double digits, and that's not the case in this particular quarter. We have server up. And so again, these are just a few puts and takes, but we do see the sequential increase into Q1. And then for the full year, as we see the mix of business. Got it. I guess for my follow-up, just to push on that a little bit. So what are you seeing on the pricing environment, especially in servers. I mean your competitors actually talked quite actively about a more competitive environment for servers. We're actually starting to see some impacts on their ASPs and their margins. What are you seeing -- I guess what did you see in terms of server pricing specifically on those kinds of trends in the quarter. And what are you incorporating in your guidance for price -- the pricing environment in data center in 2021. Yes. So in the quarter, we saw ASPs in the server business actually up sequentially, and that was mostly because of mix, just mix between customers and the ramp of Milan. So as we go into 2021, again, I would say the environment's competitive. So I don't know that it's gotten more competitive. I think it's about as competitive as it's always been. Our focus has not been to compete on price, but to compete on overall value and total cost of ownership.
As we go into 2021, again, I think for us, ASPs are primarily determined by the mix between cloud and enterprise in any given quarter. We're still cloud weighted, and I would expect us to be cloud weighted as we go into 2021. But overall, I would say the ASP environment is about what it's been for the last year. Got it. And just one last thing is just high teens data center, that's in the quarter or that was for the -- for Q4, was high teens percent of revenue data center. It was high teens for the year. For the year. Okay. What was it in the quarter? It was -- given the strength... I think it's similar. Yes. Thanks, Devinder. What was that, Devinder, I'm sorry? It's similar. Similar. Similar. Yes. You've got to remember the data center GPU is a little bit lumpy, and the server business is where we've had strength in 2020 compared to 2019. Our next question today is coming from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. And congrats on the strong results. Lisa, I'm sorry if I missed this, but can you speak to your expectations for the PC market. This year, obviously, there's a bit of concern following the very strong year in 2020. What's sort of embedded in your full year guidance for the PC market. And then as sort of a second part to that question, if you can give us an update on your traction on the commercial side of the market as opposed to consumer, that would be helpful. Yes, sure. Thanks for the question. So 2020 was a very strong year for the PC market. I think you've heard that from a number of the OEMs in the market. 2021, most people are saying, let's call it, mid-single-digits type growth. We see something similar to that. This shape is perhaps a bit different than normal in the sense that the first half is a bit stronger than it would normally be.
Our focus in the PC market, though, is -- has been very clear on sort of the subsegments where we could actually move up the stack. So if you look at our focus on gaming, particularly gaming notebooks and desktops, premium consumer as well as commercial. And we made very nice progress on the commercial side. And I think that business tends to also develop over a number of quarters.
So overall, I think our expectations are -- the PC market will continue to be strong as we go into 2021. That being the case, it's one element of our growth. And particularly, we're focused on growth in commercial, growth in gaming as well as sort of in the premium consumer segment. And the Ryzen 5000 series that we just launched in both mobile and desktop have actually gotten very strong reception from the OEMs in terms of overall platforms. Got it. And then as a quick follow-up on OpEx. The rate at which you're spending is very consistent with your long-term target. But that said, I mean, you are growing -- spending at a very fast clip. Can you remind us where the focus is today in terms of your spending profile? And how do you see that translating into future growth over the next couple of years? You have this 20% top line growth target out through 2023. You just grew 45% last year. You're guiding this year to up 37%. Is 20% still the right number? Could we envision something better? Yes. Sure. So I don't think we're going to change our long-term growth rate just yet. We set that in March, and I think it's the right long-term growth rate. That being said, we're very happy with the growth of the business. And from our standpoint, this is a great time to invest in the business. So the model has always been, let's invest in the business, let's call it, at a rate slower than revenue growth so that we get leverage in the model. And so we're doing that. Yes, you can see the percentage of OpEx as a percent of revenue has come down over the last couple of years and will come down as well in 2021.
But the overall dollars have allowed us to expand considerably, and really just build out the foundation of the company. So our investments are really across R&D, expanding our product portfolio. We've leaned in hard on both the CPU, foundational IP, the GPU foundational IP as well as on the GPU side, we have split out the architectures between gaming and compute, so that we have very competitive offerings in both spaces.
As we go forward, more investment on some of the system IPs that link the CPUs and GPUs as well as investments on the software side and then investments in go to market. So across the board, I think we're becoming, let's call it, a company of scale. And that helps ensure that we have sort of the breadth and depth of road map as well as customer support to support the long-term growth objectives. Your next question today is coming from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. And congratulations on the quarter as well. I want to go back to the Milan processor commentary. I think at the Analyst Day, you talked about just continually expanding your ability to address workloads in the enterprise market. As we think about the positioning of Milan, how would you compare that relative to Rome? And how should we possibly think about the -- is there a potential ASP uplift that one should consider with Milan as it starts to ramp? Yes. So definitely. So we do see sort of the expansion of, let's call it, our competitiveness across the enterprise set of workloads as well as the broad set of cloud workloads. Our goal in life is to make sure that we're offering improvements in total cost of ownership to our customers. So as the performance goes up, we do expect some ASP lift as well. But overall, from a customer standpoint, it's so important that the TCO really improve generation to generation.
Particularly with Milan, some of the single-threaded performance is very, very helpful. And we expect on some of the enterprise workloads that perhaps can't use all of the cores for -- that we have -- we'll be able to benefit significantly from Milan just given the uplift in overall performance. So we're excited to tell you more about it. Like I said, we'll be launching that later this quarter. But overall, we feel very good about the positioning of Milan. And then as a quick follow-up on the data center side as well. On the GPU side, I know it's been lumpy, and it looks like it might continue to be a lumpy business. But is there a point in time over the next couple of years that you foresee that actually being a consistent incremental revenue growth driver? What should we be thinking about to kind of get us to see that as a key additional growth driver for the company. Yes. Absolutely. Look, I think the data center GPU business is definitely coming into its own. And it will still likely be lumpy quarter-to-quarter just because the number of customers is not that large. But in terms of as a growth driver for the company, we see 2021 as a growth year for data center GPU, especially as the CDNA architecture comes into manufacturing and production and goes into some of the larger HPC installments as well as some work that we're doing in the cloud, around machine learning and AI. And more importantly, we see it as a multiyear growth driver over the next couple of years.
So we feel very good about the CDNA architecture. It's positioning. I think this is an important year for the data center GPU business, and it will be an important growth driver for us over the next few years. Our next question is coming from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Congratulations on the really strong quarter and year. Lisa, I just had a question competitively on the GPU side of things, more so on the traditional client side of the equation. You've done a great job taking a ton of share in the CPU side. It sounds like you're optimistic about what the client GPU business is going to do in 2021. Can you just walk us through some of the differences, some of the opportunities and/or challenges of taking share in the GPU market versus where you've already succeeded so much and will continue to on the CPU side of things? Sure, Ross. So the graphics business, I think, has really been focused on ensuring consistency in road map, very similar to the CPU side. So we launched the first generation RDNA architecture that had a 50% performance per watt improvement. We launched second generation of RDNA 2, just a few months ago, and then we're going to fill out that portfolio here in the first half of the year. And I think that consistency is important in the road map. There is a lot of pent-up demand for graphics cards and gaming. And we see that, and we see it as an attractive market. So I do see that the consumer graphics business will grow in 2021. We expect to continue to make progress, both with the OEM business as well as the add-in board business.
And over the coming years, there's -- the team is working very hard on the next-generation RDNA 3 architecture as well. So I think the consistency in the road map, the top to bottom stack and really using sort of the depth and breadth of our customer relationships is sort of our strategy there. And I guess as my follow-up one for either you or Devinder, on the gross margin. You gave the shorter-term answer for the fourth quarter and the first quarter, but I wanted to ask one about 2021 as a whole. It's good to see that it's rising again up to that 47% target. I just wanted to walk through the puts and takes on that. And I guess the core question is if the semi-custom business is going to grow substantially as a percentage of your revenues, what's offsetting that to have the gross margin rise year-over-year. Is it mix between segments, so server, for example, is going to keep up with that? Or is there something within the segments that is also improving, whether it be in semi-custom or graphics or some area like that? Yes. Maybe let me start... Let me start and then Lisa -- go ahead. Go ahead, Lisa. Go ahead, Devinder. You start. So if you look at the businesses, we've been pretty consistent. Server and client up in 2021, obviously, helped the gross margin. And you are right, semi-custom in 2020 is the initial ramp in a couple of quarters, and then it grows in 2021. And with the guidance that we gave, we are talking about going from 45% to 47% as overall for the year on a year-on-year basis. And semi-custom, obviously, lower than corporate average with higher revenue full year in 2021, does have an offset there from client and server. Right. So maybe just to add to that, Ross. So the -- I think the answer that -- to what you asked is, yes, consoles are, let's call it, below corporate average margin, although quite reasonable operating margins. Server is above and server is growing substantially in 2021. And also the PC business within the PC business, we do see some mix improvement as we focus on, let's call it, the more premium part of the stack. And those are some of the drivers for the margin in 2021. Our next question today is coming from John Pitzer from Crédit Suisse. Lisa, maybe I can ask Ross' gross margin question a little bit differently. I would kind of argue, given the mix in the December quarter and the fact that it was the first quarter of the console ramp, that the gross margins you were able to put up were quite good. And I'm kind of just trying to understand how we should think about gross margins ex console. And as we think about '21 unfold, typically in the console business, gross margins start relatively low, but there is good improvement over time. And so what's kind of the exit rate of gross margins in your 47% full year guide? And I guess why isn't it higher? It might just be that you guys are being conservative, but it seems like you got a lot of tailwinds as the year unfolds. Yes. So again, maybe, Devinder, I'll start and see if you'd like to add to this. John, I think it's early in the year. So let me state that. We have good visibility into sort of the puts and takes in the various places. But obviously, there's a lot to unfold over the next 11 months. I do think all the statements that you made are accurate. So the console business does have a history of improving over time. I do think, though, that we'll just have to look at the mix of all the businesses, again, as it plays out.
And from an exit velocity standpoint, we're guiding to 46% for Q1 and then 47% for the overall year. So we will see improvements over the year. And the key is what is the mix amongst the businesses in any given quarter. That's helpful. And then, Lisa, as my follow-up, it's pretty clear that semiconductors are becoming much more strategic to nation states and world governments. And there's a lot of speculation that your chief competitor is lobbying Washington pretty hard to get some incentives for domestic manufacturing. I'm just kind of curious how you're trying to be part of that conversation? Because clearly, given the IP portfolio you have, given the share that you're taking, I would argue you're as much a national champion as anyone in semis, but it does seem like the focus is on manufacturing. So how do you kind of get the ear of Washington to make them understand how important you are in this whole mix? Well, I think the overarching point that you make, John, is the right one, which is semiconductors are becoming increasingly important and increasingly strategic. And I think we all believe that. As it relates to what's important, I think the focus on manufacturing is certainly well documented. I think there's also a focus on leading-edge research and making sure that the leading edge research is also very well supported in the overall conversation. So we participate in many of the industry associations and the conversations. And the key is to continue to invest at both the leading edge in both research and manufacturing to sort of push the envelope on sort of the next 5 to 10 years. And that's one of the reasons we're investing as much as we are, and we continue to also agree that it's important as an industry that we continue to invest. So Lisa, do you think you'll be a direct beneficiary of any incentives that come out of Washington? Or will it be more indirect through your foundry partners? Well, I think much of that is still playing out. So I think we'll see how that plays out. But in terms of the manufacturing side, it would be through our foundry partners in terms of the research side as some of that plays out. We've certainly been very involved in some of the research, and we'll continue to do so. Our next question today is coming from Mitch Steves from RBC Capital Markets. Mitch, are you there? Can you hear me okay? Yes, we can hear you now. Yes. Okay. Perfect. Yes. So there's two questions. The first one's actually on the manufacturing side, I feel like people are poking about on the gross margin. But when you look at the company, you guys are driving 3 products ramp up. So the question I kind of want to pose here is what would the gross margin look like if you didn't -- if you had yields similar to what you had about 2 years ago, meaning that are the yields per TSMC and your -- I guess your overall foundry partners improving at the same rate as a normal environment? And then I have a follow-up after that. Yes. Well, Mitch, maybe let me start by level setting the conversation with gross margins. I mean we're right where our road map says we would be, right. Our long-term road map says, given the mix of the business, we set out a target to be greater than 50%. I think we're right on track for that. I think as we go through each of the product ramps, there are the ebbs and flows. But that being the case, I think the yields are right on track with where we expect them to be as well.
And the most important thing is we're now seeing growth across, let's call it, 4 -- I'd say, 4 or 5 large businesses. And so again, there are some ebbs and flows between them, and sort of the mix between cloud and enterprise, the mix between consumer and commercial and then just the mix between consumer and data center graphics.
So put all that together, and like I said, I think we're pleased that we grew margins 2 points last year, and we're again, guiding to growing margins 2 points this coming year, and it's right in line with our overall road map. Okay. Perfect. Yes, that makes complete sense to me. I think it's very difficult to grow the gross margin line with so many yields ramping up right now. The second one I just had, in terms of the overall addressable market, I realize you guys don't guide by segment. But I think that one of the big things that happened last year is PC surprised me as on the upside. So maybe you could level set us in terms of the 3 major markets you guys serve. GPUs, CPU PC side and servers. Just what do you think the total industry is going to do? This way, maybe you can give us at least an idea of what you guys view as a full year, and then we can kind of come to our conclusions -- our own conclusion, sorry, on what that means for AMD. Yes. So I think my commentary was PCs, if you just look at what various sources are saying, we would say, sort of mid-single-digit growth, and I think we would agree with that. I think server as a market, if you take a look at enterprise and cloud, again, they have different growth rates, but let's call it, modest growth. And then gaming is hard to call because, again, it's a different cycle.
Within that sort of market backdrop, I think we see, let's call it, 37% growth. And much of that is because of the product ramps and the product portfolio that we have. So we're pleased with the growth. We think we're growing significantly ahead of the market. That being the case, we'll have to see what happens in 2021 because, as you said, the 2020 market was stronger than most projected at the beginning of 2020. Our next question is coming from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. I wonder if you could talk about your cloud business for server. And maybe give us a sense. You've talked about in the past about the need to sell twice. You're sort of selling to the cloud service provider, and then they're selling it to the enterprises that they service. How are you doing with that? And where are you with sort of internal cloud workloads that they're internally focused on versus enterprise-facing workloads within the cloud? Yes. Thanks for the question, Joe. Yes. So if you look at the cloud environment, we call it both internal as well as sort of the external-facing workload. I would say we've done very well with internal workloads in the last couple of quarters, Joe. We've seen a number of applications just ramp here in the second half of this year and going into next year. So we're pleased with the performance on the internal workloads.
We see that carrying over to Milan. And sort of the -- let's call it, the move from Rome to Milan is not too heavy a lift. And so we expect that, that will continue going into 2021. And in terms of the external-facing workloads. We've spent quite a bit of effort sort of building our, let's call it, sort of the business development engine that sort of, let's call it, sells along with the cloud vendors as well as, frankly, enterprise OEMs. And so our conversation with large enterprises is usually a hybrid conversation. It's -- if you want to buy on-prem, let me tell you what AMD EPYC can do. If you want to use cloud instances, we have a wide variety of cloud instances across all of the largest cloud vendors. And that's actually progressed very nicely. So I think, overall, that's leading to some of our positive commentary in cloud is that we have seen both progress on internal as well as the external sale with motion. Great. And then I wonder, in terms of data center GPU, you've talked about some of the emerging applications. But cloud gaming has been an investment that some of your customers have made. What's the status of that? And how big a portion of your data center GPU business do you expect to be driven by cloud gaming in 2021? Sure. So I think the cloud gaming portion of the business was a larger portion of the business in sort of past years for the data center GPU. In 2021, we do have additional cloud gaming engagements that will ramp. But I would say it would be the smaller portion of the business. And HPC would become, let's call it, the larger portion of the business in 2021. Our final question today is coming from Timothy Arcuri from UBS. So I guess my first question, Lisa, based on your commentary on data center revenues and your splits, and you mentioned a question before about ASPs in Q4. It sounds like server CPU share is running like 12.5% on your $20 million TAM base that you use. So you have Milan ramping and you're talking about a lot of visibility on that ramp this year. So I'm sort of wondering if maybe you can give us what your guidance implies or sort of what the next milepost to think of would be in terms of server CPU share as you sort of exit the year and maybe look into next year. Yes. So Tim, thanks for the question. What I would say is I don't have a new market share target. And I think just given all of the variance in the market. But what I will say is, we've given you a good view of the business through sort of the percent of revenue it is. And as I said in the prepared remarks, the data center business was high-teens percentage of annual revenue, and it was predominantly server. So the data center GPU was a very small piece of that, and it was predominantly server.
As we go into 2021, again, we see significant growth. I would say it's one of the key growth drivers for the company. And we'll give you updates as we go along the way in 2021 in terms of how it's growing as a relative size of the business. Okay. Got it. And then just quickly on data center GPU. It looks like it was maybe flattish this year, year-over-year. And obviously, it's going to grow this year as Frontier comes in midyear. Can you just sort of maybe give us some sense in terms of how much you think it could grow. I mean could it double year-over-year? I understand it's not big from a dollar point of view. But could it double year-over-year? Maybe just talk about how big Frontier could be as a contributor to that business. Yes. So I think -- as I previously stated, the data center GPU business is still relatively small for us. It was actually down year-over-year. So from 2019 to 2020, it was actually down year-over-year because some of the cloud gaming ramps in 2019 paused in 2020.
In terms of what it could do in 2021, we see it as a growth driver in terms of relative size, yes, it could double. I think the way to think about it, though, is we said that we would like to get that business to, let's call it, $0.5 billion as sort of the first milestone. And I think we're making good progress towards that milestone. But that's what I would say about it. Great. Operator, that concludes our call. Thank you. Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.","this conference call is being recorded . it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Ruth Cotter . this is a live call and will be replayed via webcast .",0.0

Our business continued to accelerate significantly in the first quarter, driven by the best product portfolio in our history, strong execution and robust market demand. We delivered our sixth straight quarter of double-digit percentage year-over-year revenue growth, and record quarterly revenue and profitability. First quarter revenue increased 93% year-over-year to $3.45 billion with growth in all of our businesses.
Turning to our Computing and Graphics segment. First quarter revenue increased 46% year-over-year to $2.1 billion, led by growth in both Ryzen and Radeon processor sales. In client computing revenue grew by a significant double-digit percentage year-over-year and increased sequentially as we set records for client processor revenue and ASP. Against the backdrop of strong overall PC demand, our revenue is growing significantly faster than the market, particularly in the ultrathin, gaming and commercial segments.
As a result, we believe we gained client processor revenue share in the quarter. Our revenue share has doubled over the last two years as we have expanded in the premium products. In notebooks, we delivered our sixth straight quarter of record mobile processor revenue, based on sustained demand for Ryzen 4,000 series processors and the launch of our new Ryzen 5000 series processors. Ryzen Mobile 5000 series processor revenue has ramped twice as fast as the prior generation.
We expect continued growth in 2021 as the number of notebook platforms powered by our new processors is on track to increase by 50% compared to our prior generation. We’re also making good progress in the commercial market as unit shipments of our Ryzen PRO processors grew by a strong double-digit percentage sequentially.
We secured multiple high-volume wins across Fortune 500 aerospace, automotive, electronics and engineering companies in the quarter, and we’re well-positioned for further growth as we have tripled our commercial notebook design wins with the largest OEMs this year.
In graphics, revenue increased by a strong double-digit percentage year-over-year and sequentially, led by channel sales growth as revenue from our high-end Radeon 6000 GPUs more than doubled from the prior quarter. We introduced our Radeon 6700 XT Desktop CPU with leadership 1440p gaming performance in March, and are on track for the first notebooks featuring our leading edge mobile RDNA 2 architecture to launch later this quarter. We expect Radeon 6000 series GPU sales to grow significantly over the coming quarters as we ramp production.
Data center graphics revenue grew year-over-year and sequentially, driven largely by adoption of Instinct accelerators across cloud and HPC customers. We are making great progress on our data center GPU roadmaps and expect revenue to grow in the second half of the year as we begin the production ramp of our next generation AMD Instinct GPU to support multiple HPC wins, including Frontier, the first U.S. exascale supercomputer.
Frontier will use next generation AMD CPUs, GPUs and software to deliver unprecedented scientific computing and AI capabilities, creating a blueprint for scientific, cloud and enterprise customers to enable exascale class computing and AI performance over the coming years.
Now turning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-custom segment. Revenue increased 286% year-over-year to $1.35 billion, driven by strong growth in both semi-custom and EPYC processor sales. Semi-custom revenue declined by a single-digit percentage sequentially, which is better than typical seasonality. We expect semi-custom sales to remain strong throughout 2021, driven by significant demand for the latest generation Sony and Microsoft consoles.
In server, we delivered another quarter of record server processor revenue as EPYC processor sales more than doubled year-over-year and grew by a strong double-digit percentage sequentially.
Sales of both our second and third gen EPYC processors increased sequentially as growing adoption of our second gen offerings was complemented by third gen EPYC processors successfully ramping into production across multiple cloud and enterprise customers. Third gen EPYC processors offer 25% more performance per watt compared to our previous generation, and deliver both, per-socket and per-core leadership across database, ERP, data analytics, Java, virtualization, cloud and supercomputing workloads.
Cloud demand was particularly strong in the quarter as Tier 1 providers expanded their EPYC processors deployments to power more of their internal infrastructure and introduced 11 new AMD powered instances.
We expect the number of AMD powered instances to double by the end of the year to 400 as Microsoft Azure, Amazon, Google, IBM, Oracle and Tencent significantly expand their offerings with third gen EPYC processors.
For the enterprise, Cisco, Dell, HP Enterprise, Lenovo, and Supermicro all announced plans to expand their AMD-based offerings, with more than 100 new third gen EPYC processor powered server platforms that deliver superior performance and total cost of ownership.
In HPC, we built momentum with new high-volume wins, including the National Center for Atmospheric Research, Sweden’s Institute of Science as well as a unique on-prem and cloud solution for the United Kingdom’s national weather modeling service that will be the world’s most powerful weather and climate forecasting supercomputer.
Taking a step back, I’m very pleased with the progress we have made in our data center business over the last several years as each new EPYC processor generation has ramped significantly faster than the previous generation.
We have established AMD as a trusted strategic partner to the largest cloud enterprise and HPC customers, based on developing and consistently delivering a leadership multi-generation CPU roadmap.
2021 marks an inflection point in terms of the scale, ecosystem support and customer adoption of our EPYC and Instinct processors.
In the first quarter, data center product revenue more than doubled year-over-year and represented a high-teens percentage of our overall revenue. We expect data center product revenue to grow significantly as we go through the year, driven by our strong pipeline of new cloud, enterprise and HPC wins.
We significantly accelerated our business in the first quarter and now see higher growth for the year, driven by increased customer adoption for our products, overall market strength and additional supply from our supply chain partners.
We also passed another major milestone with our pending acquisition of Xilinx in the quarter as shareholders voted overwhelmingly to approve the transaction. We remain on track to close the strategic acquisition by the end of the year.
In closing, we have entered a high-performance computing mega cycle with the strongest products and the deepest customer relationships in our history. Our success is built on delivering a consistent cadence of leadership products. We are increasing our R&D investments and aggressively driving our roadmaps to continue setting the pace of innovation for the industry and deliver best-in-class growth over the coming years.
Now, I’d like to turn the call over to the Devinder to provide some additional color on our first quarter financial performance defender. Devinder? Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone.
AMD had excellent execution and very strong financial performance in the first quarter. Our multi-generation product roadmap is driving significant revenue growth, and we delivered record financial results and free cash flow. Driven by this momentum, we delivered first quarter revenue of $3.45 billion, up 93% from a year ago, and up 6% from the prior quarter. Year-over-year growth was driven by strong increases in sales across all businesses.
Gross margin was 46%, flat from a year ago, despite significantly higher semi-custom product revenue. Operating expenses were $830 million, compared to $584 million a year ago, as we continue to invest in our business. Operating income was $762 million, up $526 million from a year ago, driven primarily by revenue growth. Operating margin increased from 13% a year ago to 22%.
Net income was $642 million, up $420 million from a year ago, excluding $15 million of Xilinx acquisition-related costs. Diluted earnings per share was $0.52 per share, compared to $0.18 per share a year ago. Current quarter results include a 15% effective tax rate compared to a 3% tax rate a year ago. We continue to anticipate a cash tax rate of approximately 3% for 2021.
Now, turning to business segment results. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $2.1 billion, up 46% year-over-year due to the significantly higher client processor and graphics revenue. Computing and Graphics segment operating income was $485 million, or 23% of revenue compared to $262 million a year ago.
Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-custom segment revenue was $1.35 billion, up 286% from $348 million the prior year. The revenue increase was driven by the ramp of semi-custom product sales and very strong growth in EPYC processor revenue, which more than doubled year-over-year. EESC segment operating income was $277 million or 21% of revenue compared to an operating loss of $26 million a year ago. The higher operating income was driven by higher revenue.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $3.1 billion, up from $2.3 billion at the end of the prior quarter. Inventory was $1.7 billion. Free cash flow was $832 million in the first quarter compared to negative free cash flow of $120 million in the first quarter of 2020. Principal debt was $314 million, including a $24 million reduction in our 2026 convertible notes, which have only $2 million remaining.
Let me turn to the outlook for the second quarter of 2021. Today’s outlook is based on current expectation and contemplates the current global supply environment and customer demand signals.
We expect revenue to be approximately $3.6 billion, plus or minus $100 million, an increase of approximately 86% year-over-year and an increase of approximately 4% sequentially. The year-over-year increase is expected to be driven by growth in all businesses. The sequential increase is expected to be primarily driven by growth in data center and gaming.
In addition, for Q2 2021, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 47%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $900 million; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $130 million; and the diluted share count in the second quarter is expected to be approximately 1.23 billion shares.
For the full year 2021, we now expect revenue growth of approximately 50% over 2020, driven by growth across all businesses, up from the prior guidance of approximately 37%. We continue to expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 47%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately 26% of revenue, non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 15%, and we expect the Company’s cash tax rate to be approximately 3%.
In closing, we had an excellent start in 2021 with very strong year-over-year growth in both segments. We continue to invest in the business and drive strong financial returns.
With that, I’ll turn it back to Ruth for the question-and-answer session. Ruth? Thank you, Devinder. And operator, if you’d like to poll the audience for questions, please? [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Your line is now live. Thanks for taking my question. Lisa, you’re guiding -- you’re increasing the full year guidance by almost $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion. Could you give us some sense of what has changed in the last three months? Because your competitor was recently talking about cloud digestion, and you’re raising guidance by $1.3 billion. So, I’m curious what changed in the last three months. And if you could help us parse which products or end markets are contributing to this increase, how much from servers or PC or semi-customer, or if there is any crypto impact? So, any color on what’s driving this really strong guidance and increase for the year would be very helpful. Yes, absolutely, Vivek. Thanks for the question. So, we are -- we started the year very strong, very pleased with the first quarter performance and what we see overall for the year. So, we are increasing our full year guidance. We exceeded in the first quarter, we guided up in the second quarter, and then that’s carrying through to the second half of the year.
What we’ve seen is the following. We came into the year with an overall strong demand picture, and that was certainly true. What we’ve seen over the last 90 days is consistent strong demand, very strong visibility from our customers on what they need throughout the year. Particularly, you asked about data center. I think, we saw actually strong signals in the first quarter that it would be a strong data center year for us.
We’re on a product ramp cycle. We launched new products in PCs on the mobile side with our Ryzen 5000. We launched new products on the graphics side with Radeon 6000. And then, the launch of the third-generation Milan has actually gone very, very well.
So, in terms of what we see, we see very strong demand for our products. We see good customer ordering patterns and strong backlog. And then, we have also seen that the supply chain has been tight overall for the semiconductor industry. And we’ve been working very closely with our supply chain partners. And so, we also have good visibility to additional supply as we go throughout the year. So, with all of that in place, I would say, we feel very good about how the year is shaping up.
In terms of where you see the strength overall, I would say it’s strength across all businesses, but particularly the strength in data center is good, and we also see just, again, very good visibility and very close working relationships with our customers.
You asked about crypto. We do not -- we have negligible crypto in here. So, this is really the foundational business, really the new products and just seeing the customers adopt and ramp quickly. Got it, very helpful. And Lisa, for my follow-up, should we assume that now you are getting adequate supply, so you’re kind of caught up from a supply perspective and supply is no longer a constraint, or is that still a constraint? And if it is, in which end market? Because you’re keeping full year gross margins steady at 47%. So, I was curious if there is any impact from supply or rising input costs that could be impacting your gross margins, which you decided to keep to kind of flat versus your last outlook? Yes. I would say, Vivek, it’s still early in the year. So, the entire semiconductor supply chain is very, very tight. I think, you hear that from all of our peers in the marketplace. That being said, we’ve been working very closely with our supply chain partners. We have seen improvements that have led to the improved full year guide. We’re going to continue to work on that because right now, I would say the channel -- the inventories are very low throughout the entire supply chain, whether you talk about at our customers or in the channels. And so, there’s quite more that we would like to be able to do. That being the case, I think, we continue to work well with our partners and take lots of actions there.
As it relates to overall costs and things like that, we are watching those things, I think, from logistics and some of the component costs and things like that. So, there’s -- mostly the gross margin guidance is reflective of the fact that we do have ramping of our new products. And we also have some ramp of the gaming products, which are a little bit below corporate average. But, we’ll see how things progress as we go throughout the year. Next question is coming from Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Your line is now live. Hey. Thanks for taking the question, and nice results. Maybe just following up on Vivek’s question. I was just curious, the semi-custom business obviously is not following any sort of seasonality, but there’s a lot of talk about supply constraints there as well. You basically saw no seasonality in March, and it seems like it’s not growing much in June. So, just maybe just, is that still impacted by maybe not your shortages but other shortages, and just any perspective on that business for the year? Yes. So thanks, Blayne, for the question. I think, the semi-custom business, if you look at the console launches that happened last year, I mean they were phenomenally good launches, right, very, very good products. So, you’re right. Seasonality is completely different this year than sort of a typical year. We had a strong first quarter better than seasonal. We were down but down single digits. There’s a bit of growth as we go through the year, but it’s just starting from such a high point in the first half of the year.
So, the way I would say it is, I think there is a strong secular demand for gaming. And whether you’re talking about consoles, or you’re talking about PC gaming, or you’re talking about the overall sort of gaming ecosystem, there’s a significant demand. And so, we believe there’s strong demand, and we’re continuing to ramp supply to meet that. And then, I just want to ask you on the competitive landscape on the client side. You clearly gained a couple of points of share in March. Intel was talking about they’re being more aggressive on their percent of 10-nanometer product. Maybe just talk about the competitive landscape as you look through the rest of the year? And are you seeing any change to that landscape as they ramp 10-nanometer? Yes. So, Blayne, I think, the PC business has certainly -- had a very strong second half of last year and is strong this year. I think, within that, we feel very good about our progress, particularly in notebooks and particularly in the premium segments of notebooks. So, we had a strong record quarter for our notebook business. Our ASPs were up sequentially and year-over-year. I think, we’re seeing traction in sort of the premium ultrathin, gaming and commercial. We feel very good about the platforms that we have and the platforms that we have throughout the year. Ryzen 5000 is a very competitive product. I will say that there are lots -- a bit of low-end units have come into the market, but our focus on the premium segments have done very well. So overall, pleased with the PC environment and feel that we’re very competitive. Our next question is coming from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Yes. Thanks for taking the question, and congratulations on the quarter. I wanted to ask a little bit about the server CPU cycle. I know, you’ve talked about kind of an expanding footprint with the cloud guys. But, I was curious of where we stand today, as far as more of the traditional OEMs, the progression of their systems. I think you said 100-plus systems. When do you think that those will all be shipping in the market? And how would you put the context of Milan relative to Rome on that front? And I have a follow-up. Sure. So, Aaron, the data center business obviously is a very strategic focus for us. And with EPYC with each generation, we’ve really tried to expand the reach. I think, here in the first quarter, what we saw is very strong results, doubling year-over-year. It is on the strength of cloud. But, what we saw was both Rome ramping, so we saw Rome units up sequentially, and we also saw Milan ramping. And what that says, this is what we expected. We actually expected that we had a good footprint in Rome and that that would continue to be well deployed as we come into the first half of this year, and that’s played out. And then, Milan is just a very, very good product. I mean, it’s extremely well positioned. Not only do we have per-socket leadership, but we have per-core leadership, which again expands the footprint.
So, in terms of your question about cloud versus enterprise, we were more cloud weighted in the first quarter as some of those instances, both internal and external, ramped. We would expect that enterprise, both enterprise as well as HPC deployments will increase as we go through the next couple of quarters. But we’ll see Rome and Milan in the market together all through this year, and we expect strong adoption on the enterprise side. Yes. And then, the other question kind of dovetailing off that is, you talked in response to a couple of different questions. You talked about visibility. Our visibility is very strong. It’s improved, et cetera. So, how would you characterize your visibility today relative to, let’s say, what it was three months ago? And what gives you the confidence? Has there been something that’s happened as far as discussions with the cloud guys, that’s given you more confidence in the visibility of the growth through the remainder of this year? Yes. So, Aaron, I mean we -- when we started this year, we expected to have a strong product cycle, just given everything that we saw in terms of platforms, design wins, sort of customer engagements and process. But, in the last 90 days, I think we’ve seen that really firm up. So, from the standpoint of just the consistency in all of the schedules that were supposed to be met, I think customers are liking what they see. We are having multi-quarter conversations. Just given the tightness overall in the supply chain, I think everyone is wanting to be clearer and more transparent about their needs. And that’s very helpful for us, frankly. That’s very helpful for us in a tight environment. It gives us the ability to plan several quarters out. And so, I think that’s the differences. We have strong visibility into what customers want and what we can deliver. And so, that gives us confidence that we have the right signals in place. Our next question today is coming from Matt Ramsay from Cowen & Company. Your line is now live. Lisa, I wanted to ask a question about the enterprise notebook business. And I noticed you highlighted in the release and in the slides where you are in several different verticals in design wins on enterprise notebook in the Fortune 500. And I wonder if you might speak a little bit about the relationships that you’re building with the big enterprise customers? Do you have FAE support, software support, firmware support, et cetera? Do you have the right people in place to really ramp that business more materially going forward? Thanks. Yes, definitely, Matt. It’s been a high focus for us to ramp our enterprise notebook business as well as the enterprise server business. And they actually share many of the same customers and IT departments.
And so, yes, we’ve made very good progress on the enterprise notebook business. I think, we have a great set of platforms with our OEM partners. We’ve also ramped up our field application support and our customer engagement models for deployment. Overall, I think, we’ve gotten some very nice commercial notebook design wins.
And again, in this environment, for us, the important thing is to stay very focused on the longevity of the business that we win. And so, a lot of focus is on those commercial pipelines and how they develop, both on the notebook side as well as on the server side. And I think we’ve made good progress, but we still have a lot of opportunity to grow as we go through the coming quarters. Thanks for that. For my follow-up, it’s a bit unrelated. One of the businesses that maybe you’ve not had supply or there’s been other parts of the business growing much more quickly, I wanted to ask a bit about gaming. The new RDNA 2 architecture I think brings some new features, but obviously there’s a strong incumbent competitor in the gaming market. Maybe you could just talk about where you are competitively right now, how you see supply coming online that might support that gaming franchise a bit better, and just maybe the lay of the land in gaming right now? Because it’s one piece of the business that everything else is going so well, I think there are some opportunities there. Yes. So, the consumer graphics or the gaming graphics business, as you talk about, has actually done well for us. It grew double digits this past quarter. We had a very deliberate strategy here with the launch of RDNA 2. We started at the top of the stack with our big Navi product. And then, we’ve now introduced a couple of additional products. And you’ll see that both from the channel, sort of adding board cards into more OEM systems and notebook business as well as additional variants. So, it’s an important market segment for us. We’re happy with the progress. I think, gamers really appreciate the product.
It’s fair to say that the graphics demand is very high across the marketplace. So, we’ve actually put quite a bit of product into the market, but the demand still exceeds supply. You’ll see that increase as we go through the second half of the year. And overall, I think, the progress that we’ve made with RDNA 2 is fantastic, and we continue to believe that gaming overall is a great secular growth story. Our next question today is coming from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. Lisa, I wanted to ask about the data center GPU business. I realize it’s still a relatively small percentage of the overall business. You talked about production ramping in the second half of this year. You talked a little bit about Frontier as well. But, what kind of customer pull are you seeing in your data center GPU business? And then, I got a quick follow-up. Yes, Toshiya, thanks for the question. We’re making very nice progress in the data center GPU business. It’s in the investment mode now, so we’re investing heavily in the business. We launched the CDNA architecture or the compute optimized architecture last year. You’ll see updates to that this year as we bring out the next generation with our Frontier systems. The revenue is, albeit, on the lower side in terms of just size of the business relative to the rest of the business, but we will see growth into the second half of the year.
And the business here is actually very strategic, right? It’s the idea of really putting together heterogeneous systems and bringing our CPU technology with EPYC together with our GPU technology with Instinct with the software capabilities that we have been investing in, and really getting strong HPC systems as well as AI and machine learning capabilities. So, we will see growth in the second half this year. It will still be a smaller business, but we see it growing in this strategic time frame over the next couple of years. And it is very much that end-to-end story of what you need to really satisfy sort of the key workloads in the data center. Great. And then, as my follow-up, I wanted to ask about the potential threat from ARM longer term. Within x86, obviously you’ve got significant runway from a market share perspective. But, how are you thinking about the potential threat from ARM-based processors, both in your client business as well as your server business? You’ve got Apple obviously internalizing some of their CPUs on the client side, hyperscalers talking about internal solutions. And your closest GPU competitor launched -- or introduced rather ARM-based CPU multiple years out. So any thoughts on ARM versus x86 and how you address that would be helpful. Yes, so, absolutely. I think the key point here is you really have to have a very, very strong product roadmap, and that is really what we’re focused on. I think the overarching trend that computing is becoming very important. And so, there are additional entrants trying to address different aspects of computing, I think is to be expected. And when you look at the data center in particular, I think the trend that computing is becoming more workload optimized is also an important trend. These are the things that we’ve been thinking about for a long time, and we’ve been looking at ensuring that we address that in our roadmap.
So, our focus is to continue to optimize solutions across the data center and across the PC ecosystem, make sure that what we have is very competitive, addressing what customers’ needs are. And we also have the ability to customize solutions as well with our strong IP portfolio. So, all that being the case, I think the answer is very competitive market, but we feel very good about the roadmap that we have in front of us. Our next question today is coming from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live. Congratulations on the solid result. Lisa, maybe another way to ask that last question of x86 versus ARM. I’m wondering if you could address it from the perspective of general purpose compute versus semi-custom and ASIC. Because clearly, as Moore’s Law is coming up with some issues the move towards semi-custom and ASIC is much more prevalent. I know to the answer to Toshiya’s question, you said that you’re doing -- or you have the ability to do semi-custom. Do you actually have engagements? And how do you see sort of general purpose compute versus semi-custom ASIC playing out over time? Yes. So John, the way I would address that is I think there’s a whole range of computing solutions that you need. And this is back to a few years ago, our conversations about heterogeneous compute being you need to have the right compute for the right workload. I think that’s the overarching aspect of it.
No question that for our business, general purpose compute is the largest piece of our business and will continue to be so. We are doing -- we certainly do optimizations for specific customers today. And I think that’s -- that for large cloud customers, they expect that, and we are doing that. We do have the ability to optimize on a more specific basis. And if you look at the evolution of our architecture, I think that when we do these chiplet architectures and things like that, it really allows that. So, lots of good engagements going on with customers overall, and I think the key is to be able to have the right IP building blocks. And that’s what we’re focused on, right, having the best CPU cores, the best GPU capability, having great interconnect, and then, with the bringing on of Xilinx, having the adaptive computing solutions there as well, gives us a lot of options to optimize solutions with customers. That’s helpful. And Lisa as my follow-up, you’re still relatively early in this new gaming console cycle. And typically through those cycles, your products gross margins had some pretty good uplift. I’m wondering if you can just help characterize where you think you are in sort of the gross margin cycles for the gaming console business. And if you want to tell us kind of how dilutive you think it is to overall margins and where that might go by the end of the year. That would be helpful. Yes. John, I would say that we’re still very early in the console cycle. And from -- if you think about it, we’re only a couple of quarters into it. So, I think this is a big cycle, and there’s a lot of momentum in the cycle. We’re going to continue to work on improving costs and improving margins and things like that. But, I would say that we still have a ways to go and lots of opportunity there as we go through the next couple of years. Our next question today is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Lisa, I guess, you had indicated you believe -- I believe you said you thought you gained share in the server market. My back of the envelope calculation suggests you gained at least 2 points of share in service, which is an acceleration on my estimate of about 1% share gain a quarter over the previous four quarters. So, I guess, can you tell me if my math is materially off? And if not, what is -- is this a new higher rate of share gains? And what would you chalk this up to? Are you guys at a tipping point? Are your customers at a tipping point for embracing AMD as a supplier? Do they have increased comfort, or is your ecosystem for support? Can you just maybe just give us the higher level picture about where you think your customers are and really embracing and ramping up your server offerings at a higher rate. And I have a follow-up, if I may. Yes, sure. So, in terms of our data center performance in the first quarter, it was quite strong. And when I look at the drivers of that, we saw cloud in particular quite strong. And when I look at the drivers underneath that, there are a couple of things that have come together. I mean, first of all, I mean we’ve been very, very deeply engaged with our customers the last number of quarters in qualifying new instances, qualifying new internal workloads, really expanding the regional capability of our coverage. And so, all of those things, I think, have led to some lift overall in the data center business.
And then, going forward, I think the other piece of it is, if you recall when we did the Naples to Rome transition, that transition was pretty much people switched from Naples to Rome. What we’re seeing in this cycle is a bit different. What we’re seeing is that Rome has a set of very strong coverage in terms of applications that they’re in, that are ramping very nicely, that are having good demand. And then on top of that, we’re adding Milan, which is just a very strong product on top of that.
So, I think those are some of the things that are perhaps a bit different about what we’re seeing right now. That being this case, things move around from quarter to quarter. So, I would say that the data center signals that we’re seeing are positive. We’re excited about what we’re seeing. It’s a lot of engagements with customers. And the main thing for us is as important as the current year is we’re also very focused on the long-term road map. And so, we’re engaging now on Zen 4 and beyond. So, it really is a multigenerational discussion with our top customers. Great. That’s very helpful. And then, a follow-up on -- just coming back to ARM, you answered the previous questions with kind of talking about embracing the idea of having heterogeneous architectures in semi-custom and working with your customers to develop solutions. If I go back, AMD had an ARM server offering before. Can you give us an update on the state of that ARM server IP? Is that something that you can resurrect, or have you been keeping it, the development, working on that? And can you discuss -- are your customers asking for your help in delivering semi-custom solutions that have an ARM component to it? Because from what I can tell, it looks like three cloud service providers have ARM server offerings in their platform, and -- but there’s a lot that don’t and don’t have quite the development capabilities. So, I was hoping if you could just talk more specifically about the IP that you had? And are you bringing that back if your customers are asking for it? Yes. Sure, Mark. So, look, we know the ARM architecture well. Certainly, our engineers know it well. And we consider ARM a partner in many respects. We use ARM IP in various aspects of our devices.
In terms of that specific custom ARM design, we don’t have that in plans right now. In terms of whether we would do custom ARM designs, I think the answer is yes. That’s the whole idea of the semi-custom business. And so, I think it’s less about ARM versus x86 and much more about having the right IP in the right sort of combination to satisfy sort of the customer solutions. And that’s the way we look at it. It’s really what problem are you trying to solve? And let’s look at sort of the collection of IP that we have and the capabilities that we have to help address that set of sort of issues. Our next question is coming from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live. Hi. Thanks for letting me ask the question and congratulations on the strong results and guide. Lisa, I wanted to ask you a little bit of a conceptual question. In your full year guidance, you clearly raised the revenues to a very strong number, but you kept the margins the same. I think, people understand the operating margin side of it that you have an opportunity to invest and great opportunities in front of you to grow. But, on the gross margin side of things, I’m just a little surprised, given the strength that you’re talking about in the data center business, the HPC, Frontier, those things kicking in the back half of the year. I’m a little surprised that it didn’t go up. Now, you’ve delivered very consistent guidance and increases improvements over time, and I can’t recall the last time you missed your gross margin guidance. But, I’m just wondering what the puts and takes are that would keep that gross margin guidance flat for the year. Yes, Ross, sure. So, let me perhaps start, and then Devinder may have a few comments. So, I think from an overall revenue standpoint, I think we are very comfortable with the guide up, just given the visibility that we have on the customer demand front and on the supply front. On the overall margins, we are guiding up sequentially as we go from Q1 to Q2. And then, I think for the second half of the year, what we would say is look, it’s early in the year. And it’s a very dynamic environment, Ross, I mean a very dynamic environment. And so, we’re watching the puts and takes, and there’s always product mix things that come into play in terms of the puts and takes.
But, I think we’re confident that we’re in a good place. And as we go through the year, we’ll give you more updates on that. But, there isn’t anything more than that. I think, it’s just where we are in the year. And given the dynamic environment we have in the marketplace, that’s what gives us approximately the 47% guide. I don’t know, Devinder, you want to add to that? The only thing I’ll add, Ross, I think as you know, the situation is pretty tight, as we talked about the overall global supply situation in semiconductors. So, we are seeing some increases in component costs, but overall we are managing it. On the higher revenue by more than $1 billion, we are maintaining the 47% guide for 2021, which is up from last year. And last quarter was 45, this quarter 46, guiding 47. The trend is very good, and we are very, very happy with that. Thanks for the detail. That’s really helpful. For my follow-up, I want to be a little more tactical, but it will somewhat fold into your answer to the first question. That is for your second quarter guide from the midpoint of up roughly 4%, could you give us a little bit of puts and takes between your two main segments? And I guess, the slightly longer-term question part of that would be, data center being high teens in the first quarter was great sequential growth, doubling year-over-year. Any sort of color on how you think that percentage changes throughout the rest of the year, given your 50% growth guidance for the entirety of the year? Sure, Ross. So, in terms of the second quarter, as we look at sequential growth, we do see sequential growth in the data center business, so on the server side as well as on the data center graphics side as well as some growth on the gaming side.
As we look at the full year, our expectation is that the percentage of the company that is sort of the data center percentage of the company will increase as we go through the next couple of quarters. And that’s just the dynamic of some of the strength in the consumer businesses in the first half. So, that’s not normal seasonality. And just the acceleration or some of the growth that we see in the data center business as we go throughout the year would lead to a higher percentage of revenue in data center on higher revenue. Next question is coming from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your line is now line. I first had a question on data center in the quarter. So, the EESC was up almost 100 million. EPYC was up, and semi-custom was down, which means EPYC was up even more than that. Can you -- I know it was both Rome and Milan grew. But how much of the actual growth -- the 100 million plus sequentially that must have been EPYC, how much of that growth, how did that split out between Rome and Milan? Was it like the majority of the growth of that was Milan? And how do you see Milan as a percentage of a data center CPU mix in Q2? Sure, Stacy. So, if I look at the first quarter, we shipped Milan as well in the fourth quarter, right? So, we shipped a good amount of Milan in fourth quarter, a good amount in the first quarter.
I would say, in terms of growth, it was probably more Rome weighted in the first quarter compared to Milan, but there was good growth in both. And then, as we go into the second quarter, we would still expect to see growth in both Rome and Milan, with Milan growing faster, as that ramps. And we would expect by the third quarter that it would cross over and Milan would perhaps be higher than Rome. Now, obviously, these things change a little bit as customers go through their ramps, but that’s sort of what we see.
So, the meta point is Rome demand is robust and will stay a good part of the revenue for this year in its entirety. And then, Milan is ramping quickly, and customer adoption is strong. And so, we expect it will ramp quickly as we go through the next couple of quarters. Hopefully, that answers your question. That does. Thank you. I have a follow-up, if you don’t mind. I actually do want to ask a question about OpEx. So, I know, the model you gave at the Analyst Day had a midpoint for OpEx revenue of 26.5%. And I know you’re running ahead of revenue and everything right now. But, if I sort of back out the second half implied guidance for OpEx, it actually is at that 26.5% run rate in the second half, to get to 26% for the full year. Should we think about -- I guess, it’s like as we go into 2022, do you think you’re sort of at the model OpEx run rate, that sort of like more than 26%, 26.5% on whatever the revenue is? Is that the right way to think about the OpEx trajectory going forward? And I guess, like -- do you think you’re actually spending enough at this point, given where you’re taking the roadmap? Are you spending at the right levels right now to ensure that, that roadmap is actually cemented and firm? Yes. Stacy, very good question. I think we are -- the revenue is well above our long-term model. And certainly in this year, it’s well above our long-term model. Last year, it was well above our long-term model. And we’re taking the opportunity to invest. And from that standpoint, our investments in R&D really, as you say, cementing roadmap, our investments across sales and field support and all of the customer-facing support. And frankly, we’re making investments in sort of some of the infrastructure surrounding the company as well since it’s just a much larger company than it was a few years ago. So, I think the answer is yes. We’re investing enough. And I think we’re taking the opportunity to be very aggressive with those investments to -- given the strength of the revenue growth. Maybe, Devinder, you want to add to that or... No, I think that’s good. I think you covered it. We’ve been very-disciplined, as you know, Stacy, over the years about managing the OpEx. It does scale with revenue. But, OpEx is growing lower than -- lower rate than revenue. And obviously, that shows up in the financial results from a model standpoint. The leverage, as you mentioned, the operating margin is going up for the Company. Our next question is coming from Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your line is now live. Lisa, I wanted to ask also about share gains. You’ve done a great job this year in both, client and in data center. At the same time as was referenced before, Intel’s tone is definitely changing. They use the word leveraging relationships. And they talked about other tactics to sort of stem or arrest some of their share losses. And they’re now offering x86 cores via foundry and things like that. So, I guess, the question is sort of beyond this year, because the competitive environment this year is pretty much set. So, do you think we can extrapolate the success you’ve had this year into ‘22 and ‘23, or do you think the competitive environment will intensify in the next few years? Thanks. Well, Tim, I would say that we have always expected the competitive environment to be very strong, and we still do. So, by the way, there are lots of competitors out there. From our standpoint, I think over the past few years and the past few generations, I think we’ve built a track record with customers, and we’ve built a set of deep relationships. And we’ve learned a ton about what’s important to customers, where to spend the time, the effort, and where we need a close partnership. So, I feel very good about where we’re positioned this year, but I feel very excited about what we have in the road map going forward. And I mean we’re not slowing down. So, there’s a lot in the roadmap. And we have more resources and more capabilities to bring to the market. And I think we’re going to be very competitive going forward. Totally, thanks. I guess, as my follow-up then, can you give just -- Devinder, maybe give some sense of what the loading is for semi-custom first half to back half? It seems like it’s going to be about even back half versus front half this year. Is that correct? We’re slightly up in the second half. Because the launch of product in the second half of last year started out strong because it’s a new console generation. And then, maybe slightly up in the second half as well I would say. Our final question today is coming from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. You talked a little bit about the supply constraints that you’ve been dealing with. Can you talk about where those are coming from? Is that a wafer constraint, substrate constraint, both or other stuff? And where -- when you talk about making progress and kind of getting more supply out, what’s the source of that progress? Yes. So, I think, Joe, I would say overall, the demand if we look at coming into this year, the demand has been sort of higher than our expectations. And there are sort of industry-wide types of things that are going on. We work very closely with our supply chain partners. So, whether it’s wafers or back-end assembly test, capacity or substrate capacity, we work it on a product line by product line level. So, I don’t know that there is a single thing that I would point out.
I would say that on a product line level what we’ve done and what we’ll continue to do is ensure that there are multiple sources for things, particularly in the back end, that gives us flexibility to move things back and forth. We continue -- on the substrate side in particular, I think, there has been underinvestment in the industry. And so, we’ve taken the opportunity to invest in some substrate capacity dedicated to AMD, and that’ll be something that we continue to do going forward.
We’re also -- I mean we also have fantastic engineering teams that are just looking at how we, together in the ecosystem, just get more productivity into the system. And we work very closely with TSMC to make sure that we’re forecasting well and getting the right support.
So, I think, it’s all of the above in terms of making sure that we have the capabilities. And the other thing I’ll mention, Joe, is just it’s not just about processors, but it’s included -- it’s also ensuring that they’re matched sets in the ecosystem. And so, our teams are also working very closely with our OEMs to make sure that we’re together ensuring that they’re the full system components necessary.
So, it is a complex supply chain environment. And I will tell you, given everything that I’ve seen, it is a complex environment because all markets are so hot. But I’m happy that we’ve been able to make progress. And by the way, we’re not done, right? There’s plenty more that we would like to do to get more capability in the supply environment. And so, we’re working closely with our partners across the board. Great. Well, definitely very impressive results in the context of everything going on. Thank you. Thank you. We’ve reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I’d like to turn the floor back for any further or closing comments. Thank you, Kevin. We would like to thank everybody for joining today’s call, and we’ll look forward to engaging with you throughout the quarter. Thank you, everyone. Thank you.

We will refer primarily to non-GAAP financial measures during this call. The full non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliations are available in today’s press release and slides posted on our website.
With that, I will hand the call over to Lisa. Lisa? Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. Our business performed exceptionally well in the second quarter. A strong execution in growing customer preference for our high performance product generated significant market and financial momentum. We saw a very strong demand across all of our businesses, which resulted in second quarter revenue growing 99% year-over-year to 3.85 billion.
We expanded our gross margins by 4 percentage points, doubled operating margin, and more than tripled profitability year-over-year. We also delivered record revenue for the fourth straight quarter and generated record free cash flow in the quarter.
Turning to our computing and graphics segment, second quarter revenue increased 65% year-over-year to 2.25 billion driven by significant growth in both Ryzen and Radeon processor sale. In client computing, we had another record quarter of processor revenue. Both desktop and notebook revenue increased by a strong double-digit percentage year-over-year, and we believe we gained revenue share for the fifth straight quarter.
In desktop, robust demand for our highest-end Ryzen processors drove a richer mix in the quarter as Ryzen 9 processor unit shipments more than doubled year-over-year. In notebooks, unit shipments and ASP increased sequentially and year-over-year. We delivered our seventh straight quarter of record mobile CPU revenue led by the steep ramp of our latest generation Ryzen 5000 Mobile Processors.
In the enterprise, Ryzen pro mobile processor unit shipments nearly doubled year-over-year as we won multiple high volume deployments in the quarter with Fortune 500 financial services, automotive, and pharmaceutical companies. In graphics, revenue doubled year-over-year led by demand for Radeon 6000 series, desktop, graphics cards in the channel, an adoption of our data center GPUs.
RDNA 2 GPU shipments grew by a double-digit percentage sequentially as the first notebooks powered by our Radeon RX 6000 M series GPUs launched, including the first AMD advantage notebooks that combine high performance Ryzen CPUs, Radeon GPUs, and AMD software with premium design features to deliver best-in-class gaming experiences. Asus, HP, MSI, and Lenovo announced plans to bring AMD advantage notebooks to market over the coming months as we further expand our presence in the gaming notebook market.
Data center graphics revenue more than doubled year-over-year driven by new deployment of our AMD instinct accelerators, including initial shipments of our next generation data center GPUs featuring our CDNA 2 architecture. CDNA 2 represents a major step forward in our multi-year data center GPU strategy, delivering more than twice the performance of our current generation and significantly higher performance than competitive offerings in HPC workloads.
We expect data center GPU revenue to grow in the second half of the year as we ramp production of our next generation AMD instinct accelerators, an open sourced ROCm software to support multiple leading edge supercomputer wins, including Frontier, LUMI, [and Pozzi].
Turning to our Enterprise and Embedded and Semi-custom segment, revenue increased 183% year-over-year to 1.6 billion, driven by strong growth in both semi custom and epic processor sales. Semi-custom revenue grew sequentially and year-over-year and we expect game console demand to remain strong throughout the year. We announced a new Semi-custom win earlier this month as valve chose AMD to power their steam deck handheld game console planned to launch this December.
In embedded, we're making good progress expanding our presence across key verticals, including automotive, networking, and storage. We ramped production shipments in the quarter of AMD Ryzen embedded CPUs and Radian RDNA 2 GPUs to power the in-dash infotainment systems in Tesla's latest Model S and Model X vehicles.
Now, turning to server, we delivered our fifth straight quarter of record server processor revenue. Sales grew by a significant double-digit percentage sequentially driven by higher unit shipments and ASP. We are seeing very strong demand across our full server portfolio with second gen EPYC processor revenue growing sequentially, and third gen EPYC processor sales more than doubling quarter-over-quarter.
Third gen EPYC processor revenue is ramping faster than the prior generation as customers and multiple third-party reviewers recognize the absolute performance and price performance leadership of our latest server processors. Cloud demand further accelerated in the quarter, led by growing internal workload adoption and nearly 50 new AMD powered instances by AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google, Tencent, and Alibaba.
Google announced it chose AMD EPYC processors to exclusively power the first offering in its new Tau VM family that delivers industry leading performance and value for scale out workloads versus other competitive x86 and ARM offerings. In enterprise, we see demand accelerating as more than 100 third gen EPYC processor platforms are now in production from Dell, HPE, Lenovo, Supermicro, Cisco, and others.
In addition, we are seeing a rapid expansion in the number of AMD powered solutions and appliances from our OEM and ecosystem partners targeting hyper converged and virtual desktop infrastructures, as well as workloads demanding the highest per core performance, such as EDA and computational fluid dynamics.
We secured multiple HPC wins in the quarter, including newly announced deployments by the National Supercomputing Center in Singapore and the French Atomic Energy Commission. Our substantial momentum in HPC was highlighted by the fact that the number of AMD based systems on the latest Top 500 list of the world's fastest supercomputers increased by almost 5x in the last year, and that EPYC processors power half of the 58 newly listed systems.
Looking at our overall data center business, revenue nearly doubled year-over-year and increased sequentially from a high-teens percentage of overall revenue in the first quarter to greater than 20% in the second quarter. We expect data center revenue to continue growing faster than overall revenue based on the strength of our EPYC processors and instinct accelerators, and the significantly expanded engagements we have built with the leading OEMs and largest MDCs.
Turning towards Xilinx acquisition, we passed additional milestones in the quarter and received unconditional regulatory approval in multiple jurisdictions, including in the EU and the United Kingdom. We remain on track to close this strategic transaction by the end of the year and are excited about the opportunities ahead.
In closing, I'm extremely pleased with our execution as our business accelerated considerably in the first half of the year. Based on growing customer preference for our products and strong supply chain execution, we now expect annual revenue to grow by approximately 60% year-over-year, up from approximately 37% growth we guided at the beginning of the year.
Our engineering teams are aggressively driving our product and technology roadmaps to continue setting the pace of innovation for high performance computing. We remain on track to launch next generation products in 2022, including our Zen 4 processors built with industry leading 5 nanometer process technology and our RDNA 3 GPUs.
We also recently demonstrated the next major advance in our triplet strategy with our differentiated 3D dissecting technology that enables significantly denser and more efficient connections between stack chips. Based on the strength of our long-term roadmap and the deep partnerships we have established, we expect to continue growing significantly faster than the market.
In summary, we're making great progress towards our ambitious goal of establishing AMD as a high performance computing leader and the best-in-class growth franchise.
Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our second quarter financial performance. Devinder? Thank you, Lisa and good afternoon everyone. AMD has another outstanding quarter. Our high performance computing product momentum is driving record revenue growth, record profitability, and significant cash generation. Second quarter revenue was 3.85 billion, up 99% from a year ago, and up 12% from the prior quarter. Year-over-year growth was driven by significant revenue increases across all businesses.
Gross margin was 48%, up 360 basis points from a year ago, driven by an improved revenue mix and higher margin contribution from all businesses. Operating expenses were 909 million compared to 617 million a year ago as we continue to invest in business growth and our long-term product roadmaps. Operating income was 924 million, up 691 million from a year ago, driven primarily by revenue growth.
Operating margin doubled to 24%, up from 12% a year ago. Net income more than tripled to 778 million, up 562 million from a year ago. Diluted earnings per share was $0.63 per share, compared to $0.18 per share a year ago. This includes a 15% effective tax rate in the second quarter of 2021, compared to 3% a year ago.
Now, turning to the business segment results, Computing and Graphics segment revenue was 2.3 billion, up 65% year-over-year, driven primarily by significantly higher client and graphic processor revenue with a richer product mix in both businesses. Computing and Graphics segment operating income was 526 million or 23% of revenue, compared to 200 million or 15% a year ago.
Enterprise Embedded and Semi-custom segment revenue was 1.6 billion, up 183% from 565 million the prior year. The strong revenue increase was driven by higher Semi-custom product revenue and EPYC processor sales. EESC segment operating income was 398 million or 25% of revenue, compared to 33 million or 6% a year ago.
Turning to the balance sheet, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were 3.8 billion, up from 3.1 billion at the end of the prior quarter. Free cash flow was a record 888 million, compared to 152 million in the same quarter last year. Free cash flow for the first half of 2021 of 1.7 billion was more than double 2020 annual free cash flow.
With our strong financial results and growing cash generation, we announced the $4 billion stock repurchase program in May, under which we repurchased 3.2 million shares of common stock for 256 million in the second quarter. Inventory was 1.8 billion, up from the prior quarter in support of higher revenue expected in the second half of the year.
Let me now turn to the third quarter outlook. Today's outlook is based on current expectations and contemplates the current global supply environment and customer demand signals. We expect revenue to be approximately 4.1 billion plus or minus 100 million, an increase of approximately 46% year-over-year, and approximately 6% sequentially. The year-over-year increase is expected to be driven by growth across all businesses. The sequential increase is expected to be primarily driven by growth in our data center and gaming businesses.
In addition, for Q3 2021, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 48%. Non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately 1 billion, non-GAAP interest expense taxes and other to be approximately 150 million, and the diluted share count to be approximately 1.23 billion shares.
For the full-year 2021, we now expect revenue growth of approximately 60% over 2020, up from our prior guidance of approximately 50% driven by growth across all businesses. We also expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 48%, up from prior guidance of approximately 47%.
Non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately 25% of revenue, down from previous guidance of approximately 26% of revenue. Non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 15% and we expect the company's cash tax rate to be approximately 2%.
In closing, we delivered another excellent quarter with very strong year-over-year growth, accelerated our business momentum, and delivered exceptional financial returns.
With that, I'll turn it back to Laura for the question-and-answer session. Laura? Thank you, Devinder. Operator, we're ready to begin the Q&A session now. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. Good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking my questions and congratulations on a very strong set of results. Lisa, you didn't really touch on the supply situation in the marketplace today that appears to be a pretty big focus for companies and also for investors. How would you characterize the current gap between supply and demand? And importantly, you know, as we look ahead to 2022, how comfortable are you from a foundry wafer capacity and [ABS sub-straight capacity] perspective, as you continue to grow the business strong double-digits? And then I've got a quick follow-up. Sure. Well, hey, thanks for the question. You know, I think it's fair to say that the semiconductor demand environment, and particularly the AMD demand environment has been very strong in 2021. You know, we've been working on supply for the past couple of quarters, I think I'm actually quite pleased with the progress that we've made in terms of increasing our supply.
You know, what I've said previously is, you know, certainly, you know, we do see, you know, some level of constraints, but we are making progress each quarter. And we made progress in the second quarter that enabled us to exceed the original guidance. And as we go into the second half of the year, you know, we're continuing to bring on extra supply each quarter, which is leading to, you know, the full-year of guidance raise that we have.
So, I think overall, you know, we continue to make progress. I will say that, you know, it's tight, like you've heard from many other companies, you know, through the end of this year, I think it improves in 2022. We've been planning for significant growth, you know, our model is one where we're going to drive significant growth.
So, we've been planning with that with our supply chain partners. And, you know, we do have confidence that we can continue to grow substantially as we go into the second half of this year and into 2022 with the supply chain. Great. And then as a quick follow up, I guess a multi-part question on your server, CPU business or data center business more broadly. I was hoping you could speak to, sort of the revenue construct in the second quarter. And if you can differentiate between second gen and third gen, Rome versus Milan, and then what you're seeing on the Cloud side versus Enterprise side of your business, and the outlook into the second half as you think about, sort of the different segments of that business? And then finally, you talked about data center being more than 20% of revenue, in Q2, what's embedded in your second half guidance? Thank you. Sure. Okay. Quite a few questions there. So, let me try to work through them. So, in terms of the makeup of our data center business, I mean, our, you know, our server business was very strong. I think the product capability, and, you know, sort of just, you know, sort of the performance and the total cost of ownership for Milan has proven out very well with our customers. So, we're very happy with that launch.
In the second quarter, we did see significant growth with Milan, that being the case, so Rome was still a larger portion of the revenue. And I would say, in the second quarter, it was more cloud weighted. So, we saw, you know, cloud tends to ramp faster on new generation, and that was the case in the second quarter.
So, you know, cloud grew faster than enterprise. You know, as we go into the second half of the year, we expect that Milan will ramp very quickly and, you know, crossover, you know, third gen will crossover second generation in the third quarter, and what we're seeing actually is, you know, continued strength across cloud and HPC, which have been traditionally strong for AMD, but we're actually seeing very good momentum in enterprise. And I think, you know, with the breadth of the platforms that we have out there, and, you know, just the coverage, and then, you know, sort of the per core performance, as well as the overall socket level performance.
We're getting a very strong traction and, and we're pleased to see that. So, I think as we go into the second half of the year, I think enterprise will be a stronger component for us than it was in the first half of the year. And that's, you know, the balance that we want, but, you know, overall, we're pleased with that. And then in terms of your question about, you know, server was, I’m sorry, data center was greater than 20% of our revenue in the second quarter. We believe that the data center business will continue to be a strong driver for us into the second half of the year. And so it'll be a larger percentage of our overall revenue in the second half of the year. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Aaron Raikers from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Yeah, thanks. Thanks for taking the question. Congratulations, as well, on the quarter. I wanted to ask about, kind of the trajectory of gross margin, if we take the full-year guidance now guiding up 100 basis points, with the 3Q guide into consideration, it looks like you're actually pushing towards a 50% gross margin, you know, how do we think – maybe you can unpack, you know, how we should think about the segment gross margin levels? And, you know, do you think that that if we're hitting 50%, that's a new, you know, threshold that we can consider modeling going forward? You know, I think on the gross margin, first of all, I'd say we are very pleased with the progress we have made. And as you observe, we have taken up the guidance for the year from 47 to 48. And in our long-term target model, we have plans to get to greater than 50%. And I think the descent of the businesses that Lisa just talked about, especially in the data center, help us get there.
You know, the product mix is important, the ramp in the data center and the client PC business, as we gain revenue share is going to be important to drive that. And we are confident that we can continue to improve the gross margin, given the mix of the business and also the revenue ramp in the businesses that are higher than corporate average gross margin. So feel very good about getting to the greater than 50% over time. Yeah, and maybe… Maybe this was a… I'm sorry. Oh Aaron, I was just going to add to that. I think the most important thing, you know to think about as you think about our business going forward is, it really is about the mix of business. So, as data center becomes a higher percentage of our business, you know, that's a favorable mix for us. And then within the segments, as well as, you know, as we look at, you know, where we're strategically focusing, as we, you know, really mix to the higher end of the portfolio, you know, those are the key things that we're looking at from a margin standpoint, but there are always puts and takes, you know, in the business, it's just really about the mix. Yeah. And then just as a real quick follow-up, you know, as Milan ramps and appreciating that, you know, Rome is, sounds like still the majority of the EPYC line-up, how successful have you been, as far as leveraging a stronger position, you know, with regard to uplift on blended ASPs as we think about the continuation of Milan, and even starting to think about Genoa going forward? Thank you. Yeah. So, as we, you know, as we think about, you know, sort of the trajectory of the business, it is about offering, you know, more performance per socket, and that is what we're doing. So, I think, you know, Milan is certainly a performance uplift relative to Rome. It does lend itself to a higher ASP or higher mix of the business. And then clearly, as you know, we go to general, you know, we're going to continue that trajectory.
So, I think, and then, you know, within server there's also a mix between Cloud and Enterprise. As I said earlier, we're quite Cloud-waited here in the first half of the year. And as we as we go to a stronger percentage of enterprise, you know, that would also be a favorable mix in the server side of the business. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Your line is now live. Thanks for taking my question. Lisa, it's to continue on the server business, until last year, you know, we saw AMD take about 2 to 3 points of server share annually, this year the share gains seem to be accelerating on the order of 4 to 5 points. I'm curious what's driving this acceleration? And did you see anything from Intel's roadmap disclosures yesterday that you think can impact your server share gain momentum? Yeah, Vivek. Thanks for the question. Well, you know, as you know, very well, we're very focused on, you know, sort of multi-quarter, multi-year progress in the server in the data center business, you know, I think we're excited with the momentum around our server business. I think, you know, the product roadmap is very strong, I think the execution has been very strong. I think customers also, with the third generation in Milan, you know, felt much more comfortable to go more broadly, with Milan, just because this was, you know, sort of the third time, right.
They had – many of our customers were on Rome already, but with, you know, with Milan, it was, you know, sort of socket compatible. And so there was, you know, it was a faster time to ramp and we're seeing it ramp faster. So, we feel good about where we're positioned. I mean, it's a very competitive market out there Vivek. I’ll always say that. We expect our competition to be really good and we need to be better than that. And so, you know, our team is very focused on execution. And we're excited about Genoa. I think our customers are excited about Genoa. And so, you know, we need to, you know, keep the momentum and keep the roadmap execution as strong as it has been. Got it. And for my follow-up, you announced a $4 billion share buyback, I believe, you know, kind of midway or late-midway, through Q2, you only did about 256 million of that. How should we think about buybacks going forward? You know, are you, you know, do you have a certain timeframe in mind? What's going to guide your decision when and how much of buybacks to do? Thank you. Yeah, I think no specific Vivek, as you know, these programs have been really opportunistic, and we will obviously return, you know, capital to the shareholder as the balance sheet continue to improve. However, we are pleased to initiate the program in Q2 with about 256 million, repurchased 3.2 million. And you will see as to more over time, but I wouldn't want to get into any specifics on this call. Thank you. The next question is coming from Matt Ramsey from Cowen and Company. Your line is now live. Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everybody. I guess Lisa, one of the things I was really pleased to see and this set of results and investors have asked me about quite a bit is that you're delivering the revenue upside, but the operating margin, leverage is coming with that. You guys have rightly been spending a ton to grow the business and that's been reflected in the growth. And I just wonder how you're thinking about the balance of revenue growth versus delivering; sort of upside to operating margins going forward because it's an item that's been a fulcrum from some investors in my conversation? Thanks. Sure, Matt, maybe I'll start and then see if Devinder has anything to add. You know, I think we've always been very thoughtful about, you know how we, you know, both invest in the business as well as delivering, you know, operating leverage, and look, I think our revenue growth has been very strong, you know, it was certainly above what we had previously forecasted.
We are taking the opportunity to vent – to invest in the business. And, you know, that's investing in R&D and investing in sales and marketing, and really, you know, the overall capabilities there, but you do see the operating leverage in the business. And I think we intend to continue to deliver, you know, improved operating margins, you know, as we go forward.
So, I think we can do it, do all of those things. I think we can continue to grow revenue significantly above the industry. We will continue to invest in OpEx at a lower rate than the revenue growth, and we will continue to deliver, you know, operating margin improvement over time. Yeah, I think you covered it Lisa. I think that's well said. I mean, as you saw, we did update the guidance for OpEx as a percent of revenue from, you know, about 26% or 25% for the year, and we continue to discipline from a viewpoint of the investments we need to make to grow the business, as well as obviously, invest in R&D go to market. Hiring people is another area of focus right now as the business is growing pretty significantly. Thank you both for that. As my follow-up, it’s interesting, the more strength the PC market shows, it's almost like the more concern investors have that eventually we revert back towards the mean. And Lisa, your competitor gave some fairly bullish commentary about the state of the PC industry going forward. And I wonder if you might share your view? And we've heard in our work a few bubbles in the Chromebook market, and maybe a couple of PC OEMs saying they're building a tiny bit of CPU inventory. So, on the back of that commentary about the market, if you have any views on your own visibility, and inventory of AMD parts, or maybe the gap between orders and your ability to fulfill them in the PC market, those things would be really helpful. Thank you. Yeah, sure, Matt. So, look, there are lots of different signals in the PC market. So, you know, maybe I will make a few comments. I think it's fair to say that, you know, the end user demand has been very strong. So you know, very strong in the first half of the year, very strong in the second half of last year. And, you know, that's from all this, you know, work from home, school from home, you know, sort of, and then some of this return to office trends. You know, within that, you know, there is a little bit of a mix shift as you go through time. You know, when I look at the market, I would say that we performed very well.
You know, within this market backdrop, you know, we continue to gain revenue share. And what that means is, you know, we're focusing on the most strategic segments of the PC market. You know, as we go forward, you know, I do agree that end user demand is strong. I also believe that, you know, if you look at the second half of this year for the PC market, you know, you'll hear about, you know, sort of pockets of component shortages or match sets, and things like that. So, we're taking that into account, as we think about the second half of the year.
From our perspective, you know, we're planning the PC, you know, our PC business to be about flattish, first half and the second half. And, again, we think that that's very well supported by you know, all of the ordering patterns and all of our, you know, sort of, you know, look at, you know, what the PC OEMs are doing. From an inventory standpoint, we do not believe there is significant inventory. We do track it, you know, very closely of AMD product. Anyways, we look at it at the retailers as well as at, you know, with our OEM.
So, I think we have this, you know, very, you know, we're watching it very closely, and, you know, recognize that the PC market may go up or down. We're expecting it to be like I said, for our business, roughly flattish first half and the second half. And that being the case, you know, we continue to believe that, you know, there is strong end user demand, and there's just, you know, some supply matching that needs to happen, you know, in the marketplace. Thank you. Our next question today is coming from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live. Yeah. Good afternoon, Lisa. Thanks for letting me ask the question and congratulations on the solid results. First just a clarification, I think you said in your prepared comments, relative to the June quarter that EPYC grew solidly double-digits sequentially. The overall segment grew about 19%. I'm just curious, did that EPYC outgrow the overall segment or was it more in line? Can you give us a sense of how it did relative to the segment? Yes. We outgrew the segment in the second quarter. Perfect. And then my second question is just more of a strategic question around pricing, clearly last week on their conference call, Intel talked about perhaps being a little bit more price aggressive, especially in data center, to protect share, and I'd like to get kind of your thought on pricing. I mean, in my mind, that market is much more about a total cost of ownership than an entry point. And given your price performance, I'm just kind of curious as to how concerned you are about the pricing environment or how concerned you think we should be over time? Yeah, thanks for that John. Look, I think the, you know, the market has always been competitive, you know, I don't see that it has, you know, become more competitive or that's changed. As you said, you know, pricing is not the first order variable when you're buying a server CPU it really is about total cost of ownership. I think the performance leadership that we have, is, you know, is clearly there, and I think customers see that.
So, you know, we will, you know, we’ll always fight for every socket. I mean, you know, that we're very competitive in that fashion. But, you know, we think that, you know, the way to do that is with the strength of the roadmap and the strength of the deep partnerships, and, you know, prices, sort of a second order lever in this market. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. Good afternoon and great job on the quarterly execution. You know, now with Milan on a strong ramped trajectory, and, you know, also good to see the moment enterprise, as you guys continue to drive EPYC into new markets just wanted to get an update on the pool in the total service provider market, right? It's a relatively big market. It's about $6 billion, $7 billion market. Milan supports much more networking functionality versus prior generations. And operators continue to virtualize the core of their networks. And with 5G, they're also starting to virtualize their radio access networks. And so just want to see if the team is seeing early momentum with Milan with [telco equipment] OEMs, as well as with some of the large 5G service providers? Yes, sure. Harlan thanks for the question. Yeah, look, we believe the telco segment is a very good segment, you know, for us, and I would say that there's a lot of interest. I wouldn't say it's a significant piece of revenue today. So, I view that as, you know, sort of opportunity as we continue to build out the solutions for Milan, but you know, it is one of the areas that we believe is very strategic for AMD. And as Xilinx, you know, comes in to, you know, so as we combined the Xilinx business with ours, I think their relationships as well, in the communications and telco market, you know, will be helpful in just bringing the overall solution set together. So, yes, we think it's a good market for us, but I would say we're, you know, we're still very early on that particular cycle. Great, thank you. And then on the strong early momentum in enterprise as you move into the second half and as you probably have some visibility into next year, because the enterprise cost cycles are probably a bit longer than some of your cloud customers. Can you just talk about the breadth of the engagements in enterprise, across large corporations, and small-to-medium size businesses? Yes, Harlan. So, you know, we have seen a very strong pipeline, and you know, that started with Rome, but we see that expanding with Milan. I think, if you look at the breadth of platform offerings from all the largest OEMs, for Milan, it's just, you know, broader, and then our past generation, and I think people are also starting, you know, to come up with more, you know, appliances, and we've done quite a bit more ISV optimization as well.
So, you know, our visibility is, you know, very good, into the second half of the year. And it's also very good into 2022. I think the good piece about this, as you said it is longer design cycles, but with large companies, and certainly with some of the, you know, the tier two cloud guys, you know, we've seen, you know, good strong visibility for multiple quarters. And then as we think about, you know, sort of, you know, the small, medium business and more of the channel business, I think all of that is strong opportunity for us. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Great, thank you. I wonder if you could talk about the seasonality of the console business in the back half of the year. Is there any seasonality or does that continue to be kind of more of a supply constraint? Sure, Joe. So, you know, the console business, you know, we're quite early in the console cycle. And I think you've seen that there's very strong demand for those products. And so, I think the seasonality is, is not typical. So, you know, typically, we see the second half, you know, stronger than the first half, and that is, you know, sort of more muted this year. So, there is some growth into the second half of the year, but it's not nearly what it is in a typical console, you know, seasonality. Great, thank you. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your line is now live. Hi, guys, thanks for taking my questions. Lisa, around the PC environment, so you sound a bit more sanguine about it versus your competitor who does seem to be calling for growth next year, and maybe that's a function of some of the opportunities – the other opportunities that you have. I'm just curious, given your other outlook for, kind of continued strong growth, do you think that strong growth is dependent at all, on the state of the PC market next year? So, for example, like a PC, if they were down 10% next year, do you still think you could still grow strongly year-over-year in 2022 off the rest of the portfolio? Yeah, sure, Stacy. So, look, you know, I think there are lots of different signals in the PC market for 2022. So, I think, you know, what we're doing is taking let's call it, we're planning for various different scenarios. But I would say that, you know, from our point of view, you know, the overall answer to your question is, yes. I mean, we believe that there's a, we have strong growth momentum across the portfolio. And, you know, we believe that we will, you know, we can grow in the PC business as well, you know, even if the market is, you know, let's call it not as robust as some might forecast.
You know, our view is that, you know, we're still underrepresented, you know, across the board in the markets that we play in, whether you're talking about data center or PCs, or gaming, and on the PC side, in particular, we're making very good progress in, you know, sort of commercial, you know, premium gaming notebooks, you know, premium consumer. We have more platforms coming with our Ryzen 5000 in our next generation. So, I think our, you know, sort of outlook is less dependent on what exactly happens in the market, but obviously, we watch the market very closely. And, you know, we work with our OEM partners very closely to, you know, to stay in tune with what they're seeing. Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. For my follow up, I want to ask the OpEx question a little more explicitly. So, you did it take it down for the year and you're 25%, but if I'm doing my math, right, the Q4 OpEx percentage is closer to 28. And I get why I understand, but I think the [Analyst Day] you given, 16 months ago had, sort of an OpEx to revenue midpoint somewhere in the mid-26s, should we think about OpEx, I guess trending down from that exit rate to that more, kind of like model level or are you still going to be taking this opportunity, at least for the next like several quarters, maybe do invest in at a bit of a higher level? Is that exit rate of up extra revenue more representative of what we might see in the near to medium-term? Yeah, I think, Stacy, first of all, you hit a dry, the priority for this is they invest in the business for growth. We are growing significantly and just to cover the guidance. So, obviously, there's a lot of areas to invest in to support that growth, whether it's R&D or go to market or even hiring. Second of the year, you also have salary increases that kick-in for employees. And obviously, that does drive the OpEx higher, just given the guide we gave for Q3, which is higher than Q2 from an overall OpEx standpoint.
As far as the numbers are concerned, I know you're probably running your model there, but you know, those numbers are approximate. And really, if you ask me, from an overall standpoint, I would expect that for the year, we come in a little under 25%. You know, we gave the approximate guidance of you know, 25%, but I think we'll come in under 25% for the year. Nothing extraordinary there, it's just you know, making sure we plan the business, support the growth, and make sure that into 2022, as we have new product introductions that Lisa just talked about, we continue to support that because there are lot of new products coming into 2022. So, really that's what it is Stacy. Got it. Thank you very much. Thank you, Stacy. Operator, two more questions, please. Certainly. Our next question is coming from Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Your line is now live. Hey, thanks for letting me ask questions. I just want to ask on the graphic strength. I think you said it doubled. Just curious, is there a way to parse-out how much is coming from crypto and then I think what I heard you say is in the back half, it's a driver for September just, you know, driver into December with PCs flat again, a kind of just maybe you could describe how much of the strength in graphics is, kind of more client graphics versus the data center? Yeah, sure, Blayne. So, you know, to your question about the second quarter. You know, we do not believe there was a significant crypto component in our graphics revenue. I mean, the graphics revenue, as we see it is really RDNA 2 ramping. You know, we launched some new products in mobile and we're pleased with the reception of RDNA 2 in mobile, as well as we started shipments of some of our data center GPUs.
So, you know, our view is that the crypto base component is really negligible. And then as we go into the second half of the year, I wouldn't say graphics is the largest driver of our business, you know the driver really is around data center. And, you know, that's data center across, you know, CPUs, as well as some of the early ramp of the GPUs. But, you know, we do expect, you know, there continues to be strong demand for gaming graphics.
And, you know, we know there are a lot of gamers out there who are still looking to get some of their cards. And so, you know, we will support that, you know that demand, but I don't think crypto was a big piece of it. And, you know, we'll continue to focus our efforts on getting our gaming graphics over into the gamer’s hands. Thanks. And maybe just a follow-up on the data center GPU opportunity, you've mentioned, you have some new wins with HPC and a couple of them are fairly chunky, just kind of curious when you think about that impact in the model. Is that a next year story or is it a bit further out? Yeah. So, I mean, we'll see some growth in the second half of the year, you know, off of a small base. You know, I think it becomes a more meaningful driver as we go into next year, and then certainly the following year. So, think about the data center GPU story as sort of the early innings of, you know, what we did on the CPU side. You know, we're excited about the product, Blayne, I think it's a very exciting, you know, product with our next generation CDNA 2.
I think, you know, we have won some early wins with HPC. You know, we're continuing to work with some cloud customers on the machine learning and AI aspects of it, but it's really a multi-year journey. And you know, the larger driver of our data center business is the server CPU side. Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Lisa, I had a question about your announcement with Google for their Tau instances. I thought it was fascinating because it looks like they're disabling one of the threads and running Milan in a single threaded mode, which seems to me like a throwback to 20 years ago. So, I have a couple of questions on this. I haven't seen Intel Xeon Processors in this mode. Is there something about the AMD architecture, the Milan architecture beyond higher core count that just makes it more sense to use AMD processors in this mode versus Intel processors? Are you seeing a lot of demand outside of Google for this kind of single threaded implementation? And if you are, would it make sense to make a – like a separate line of CPUs that streamlines the logic for only one processing thread, and then you could fit, you know, potentially fit a lot more cores on the CPU and cut the power dissipation, it seems like it would be the next logical step. Would that even be feasible? Is that something you consider you're getting demand for? Thank you. Sure. So mark. The way I would say is this and, you know, again, I want to be a little bit, sort of broad in how I answer the question. I think what you see in the server land is that there are lots of different used cases, you know, for the processors, and you know, you have some that are looking for, you know, sort of the bleeding edge performance, and there the, you know, the multi-threading is very, very useful. And, you know, you get better, you know, performance – per watt performance per dollar. And just overall, you know, socket level performance.
I think, you know, what we've seen is that, as you look across used cases, or some used cases where you're more focused on performance per dollar than overall performance, and you might choose to optimize, you know, sort of, you know, what you do, you know, sort of how you configure the processor differently? I think what you'll see from us, Mark is, we're spending a lot of time with our hyperscale partners, and what we want to do is offer them the type of instance that they need and that their customers need.
So, you'll see us do more customization, you know, across the board, with the idea of, you know, we want to satisfy that range of performance that, you know, across, you know, across, you know, sort of the entire range of used cases. So, you know, I think we'll talk more about how we think about, you know, the roadmap as we go forward, but I will say that, you know, we're being very thoughtful in ensuring that, you know, we have the right product for the right workload, and that it's optimized for performance and power and cost in all those areas. Great, thank you. Very helpful. Appreciate it. Thanks Mark. Thank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over for any further closing comments. Thank you, everyone. We appreciate your time today and certainly your interest in AMD. As always, we appreciate your support and we look forward to seeing you in an event here in Q3.

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Lisa. Lisa. Thank you, Laura. And good afternoon to all those listening in today. Our business performed extremely well in the third quarter as our leadership product portfolio and strong execution drove record quarterly revenue, operating income, net income, and earnings per share. We delivered our fifth straight quarter of greater than 50% year-over-year revenue growth. With each of our businesses growing significantly year-over-year, and data center sales more than doubling. Third Quarter revenue grew 54% to 4.3 billion.
Gross margin expanded by more than four percentage points and operating income doubled year-over-year. Turning to our computing and graphics segment, Third Quarter revenue increased 44% year-over-year to 2.4 billion driven by our latest-generation rising Radeon and AMD instinct processors. In client computing, sales grew by a strong double-digit percentage year-over-year and declined slightly sequentially. Rise in 5,000 processor shipments increased by a double-digit percentage sequentially, resulting in a richer product mix as we believe we gained revenue share for the 6th straight quarter.
In desktops, we launched our rising 5,000 processors with integrated Lyon graphics for the channel to strong demand as third-party reviews highlighted the leadership computing and graphics capabilities, and energy efficiency of these processors. In notebooks, Acer, Asus, HP and Lenovo, all expanded their mobile offerings powered by rising 5,000 mobile processors, as we continue gaining momentum in the premium consumer, gaming and commercial markets. Commercial client growth year-over-year was based on new deployments across public sector and fortune 1,000 technology, energy and automotive customers as the number of AMD-based commercial notebook designs available from the largest OEMs increased significantly year-over-year.
We're also seeing strong growth in the workstation market. According to IDC, drug repro processors now powered the bestselling workstations in their category in both North America and EMEA as we continue winning high-volume deployments across key verticals including media and entertainment, engineering, architecture, and automotive. In graphics, revenue more than doubled year-over-year and grew by a strong double-digit percentage sequentially driven by shipments of our next-generation AMD CDNA 2 datacenter GPUs, and demand for Radian 6,000 GPUs in the channel.
AMD RDNA 2 GPU sales grew significantly in the quarter as we ramp production and expanded our top to bottom portfolio with the launch of the mid-range Radeon RX 6600 XTCards that delivered leadership 10 ADP gaming performance at their price point. Data center graphics revenue more than doubled year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter led by shipments of our new AMD CDNA 2 GPUs for the Frontier Exascale supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Frontier was architected specifically to deliver breakthrough HPC and AI compute performance and provide a blueprint for how super-computing enterprise and cloud customers can enable Exascale level performance over the coming years by combining AMD CPUs, GPUs, and software. We are very pleased with the performance of our AMD's CDNA2 GPUs, and look forward to providing more details on their leadership performance next month. Turning to our enterprise embedded in semi-custom segment, revenue increased 69% year-over-year to 1.9 billion driven by strong growth in epic processor and Semi-Custom sales. Semi-Custom revenue grew sequentially and year-over-year as demand for the latest Microsoft and Sony consoles remains very strong. We expect semi-custom revenue to increase sequentially in the Fourth Quarter as we further ramp supply to address the ongoing game console demand. Turning to server, we delivered our sixth straight quarter of record server processor revenue, as sales more than doubled year-over-year and grew by a significant double-digit percentage sequentially.
Third - gen Epic processors continue ramping faster than the prior generation, and contributed the majority of our server CPU revenue in the quarter. In Cloud, multiple hyperscalers expanded their third-gen Epic processor deployments to power their internal workloads. And both Microsoft Azure and Google announced multiple new AMD powered instances. Cloudflare, Vimeo, and Netflix also all recently announced new deployments powered by Epic processors. With Netflix highlighting how they doubled their streaming throughput per server, while also reducing their TCO.
Enterprise growth was particularly strong in the quarter as the more than 100 third-gen Epic processor platforms from Dell, HPE, Lenovo, Supermicro, Cisco, and others ramp into broader end customer deployments. We expanded our wins in the quarter with Fortune 1000 financial services, automotive, and aerospace companies, and see significant ongoing growth opportunities as our enterprise server pipeline has more than doubled year-over-year. In super computing, we won multiple installations in the quarter highlighted by Argonne National Laboratory selecting 3rd gen EPYC processors, to power the new Polaris supercomputer, that will be used to test and optimize software in preparation for future Exascale class systems.
Overall, we're very pleased with the momentum we have built in our data center business. As server, CPU and GPU revenue grew to a mid-20s percent of overall revenue in the quarter. Turning to our Xilinx acquisition, we are making good progress towards securing the required regulatory approvals, and remain on track to close by the end of the year. This Xilinx acquisition provides significant benefits to AMD, including expanding our product portfolio with leadership, adaptive computing, and AI solutions. And further diversifying our customer base into complementary markets, including wired and wireless communications, industrial, and automotive.
In closing, our record third quarter results and the significant acceleration of our business in 2021 demonstrates that we have the right products and strategies to drive best-in-class growth and significant shareholder returns. We continue growing faster than the market, driven by our consistent execution and the investments we have made to build leadership products. Our supply chain team has executed extremely well in a challenging environment, delivering incremental supply throughout the year, supporting our strong revenue growth. We're also investing significantly to secure additional capacity to support our long-term growth.
Our product portfolio and roadmaps have never been stronger, and I look forward to sharing more details about our next-generation servers, CPUs, and GPUs at our accelerated datacenter premier on November 8th. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our Third Quarter financial performance. Devinder? Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. AMD had another excellent quarter. Our leadership products and growing datacenter momentum are driving record revenue, record profitability, and significant cash flow generation. Third-quarter revenue was 4.3 billion up 54% from a year-ago, driven by strong revenue increases across all businesses and up 12% from the prior quarter. Gross margin was 48% up 440 basis points from a year ago, driven by strong revenue mix and competitive products. Operating expenses were 1.04 billion compared to 706 million a year ago as we continue to invest in our long-term product road-maps and scaling our business.
Operating income more than double to 1.06 billion up 530 million from a year ago, driven primarily by revenue growth. Operating margin was 24%, up from 19% a year ago. Net income grew to 893 million, up 392 million from a year ago. Diluted earnings per share was $0.73 compared to $0.41 per share a year ago. This includes 15% effective tax rate compared to 3% a year ago. Now turning to the business segment results, computing and graphics segment revenue was 2.4 billion up 44% year-over-year, driven by significantly higher client and graphics processor revenue.
Computing and graphics segment operating income was 513 million or 21% of revenue compared to 384 million or 23% a year ago. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by higher revenue, which more than offset higher operating expenses. Operating margin was slightly lower year-over-year, primarily due to investments in R&D and go-to-market. Enterprise embedded and semi-custom segment revenue was 1.9 billion, up 69% from 1.1 billion the prior year.
The strong revenue increase was primarily driven by significantly higher Epic processor and Semi-Custom sales. EESC operating income was up significantly at 542 million or 28% of revenue, compared to 141 million or 12% a year ago. Operating income growth was primary driven by higher revenue and richer product mix, partially offset by higher R&D and go-to-market expenses. Turning to the Balance Sheet, cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were 3.6 billion. We utilized 750 million to repurchase more than 7 million shares of common stock in the third quarter of 2021 as part of our ongoing stock repurchase program. Free cash flow was 764 million compared to 265 million in the same quarter last year. and 888 million in the prior quarter.
On a quarter-over-quarter basis, free cash flow was lower as we made strategic investments in long-term supply chain capacity to support future revenue growth. Inventory was 1.9 billion, up 137 million from the prior quarter in support of continued revenue growth. Let me now turn to the Fourth Quarter Outlook. Today's outlook is based on current expectations and contemplates the current global supply environment and customer demand signals. We expect revenue to be approximately 4.5 billion, plus or minus 100 million, an increase of approximately 39% year-over-year and approximately 4% sequentially. The year-over-year increase expected to be driven by growth across all businesses.
The quarter-over-quarter increase is expected to be driven by higher server and Semi-Custom sales. In addition, for Q4 2021, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 49.5%. Non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately, 1.15 billion. Non-GAAP interest expense, taxes, and other, to be approximately 170 million, and the diluted share count to be approximately 1.22 million shares. For the full-year 2021, we now expect revenue to increase approximately 65% over 2020, driven by growth across all businesses, up from the prior guidance of 60%. In addition, we continue to expect gross margin to be approximately 48% for the full year.
In closing, we delivered another outstanding quarter with very strong year-over-year revenue growth, significant financial momentum, and record profitability. Our leadership products position us well to drive future growth, significant cash generation, and strong shareholder returns. With that, I'll turn it back to Laura for the question-and-answer session. Laura. Thank you. Devinder, operator, we're ready for our first question. Thank you. We'll now be conducting your question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] One moment please, while we poll for questions, and our first question today is coming from Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Your line is now live. Hey, good afternoon and great results. Thanks for taking my questions. Just kind of curious the overall outlook for Q4. So computing graphics being down, I was just curious if that was more the supply, you're still growing sequentially and obviously, I would assume you prioritize servers, just curious what you're seeing in the computing graphics market. And is it anything related to supply constraints? For you there will be down sequentially or maybe downstream constraints and then maybe for [Indiscernible], you're still growing Gross margin. I'm assuming how the Semi-Custom and service than offset each other just walk us through the nice increase in Gross margin for Q4. Sure, Blayne. Thanks for the question. So, as it relates to the fourth quarter and where we are look, we're overall very pleased with our performance in terms of the second half of the year. It's playing out about what we expect it to be in the PC market. So, as you're asking about computing and graphics, we had seen that the PC market end-user demand is strong overall, but there are some match set constraints in the PC market. And so, for that reason, we've called the PC market, really flattish. I would not have said down, I would've called it flattish as we look into the Fourth Quarter.
However, as we look overall at the business, I think the data center business has performed very well and we see strong demand there and we're continuing to see that. And as well, the console business, overall gaming is also quite strong. And so, we see growth in servers and Semi-Custom as we go into the Fourth Quarter and then on the margin dynamics, Devinder, you want to cover that? For Q4? Yeah, so Q4, it is up slightly puts on a guidance one point from Q3. And that's really product mix, higher margin from server offset by Semi-Custom revenue also being higher going from Q3 to Q4. So very pleased with the progress in the gross margin as you look at the Q3, results up 440 basis points from last year, up 80 basis points last quarter. And the progression into Q4, obviously driven by the server, our revenue growing is very pleased with that also. Thanks. Thanks, Blayne. The next question today is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Thanks for taking my question, and congratulations on the strong results and the consistent execution. Lisa, how are you feeling about the spending environment in the datacenter? As we look over the next several quarters, and especially your server roadmap versus the competition because they are planning to launch several new and important products already next year. So, I was just wondering how you're thinking about the competitive landscape and the spending landscape over the next year? Sure. So, thanks for the question. I think overall, we're feeling very very good about the server business or the datacenter market. I think from a market standpoint, we've seen a strong market here in 2021 in both cloud and enterprise, and we see that continuing into 2022. I think from a competitive position standpoint, I think Milan is extremely well-positioned, so we were very pleased with sort of the adoption rate of Milan. We said that we expected it to grow faster than Rome, and it has.
And so, the crossover with Milan enrollment, the Third Quarter, is an important metric for that. Going into the fourth quarter, we continue to see a strong environment. And then as the competitive environment goes into 2022, we always expect the competition to be strong, but our focus has been consistent execution of our roadmap and we feel very good about the Zen 4 in general. In 2022, I think we feel very good about the competitive positioning there and we continue to believe that datacenters are most strategic part of our business, and we're making good progress with our customers and partners. And for my follow-up, Lisa, AMD has done very well in terms of gaining share at the hyperscalers. Where are you in that journey? Is there still a lot of share gains to be had at hyperscalers then importantly, can you repeat that in the enterprise or do you think your competitor's incumbency limit the share gain opportunity in the enterprise? Thank you. Yeah so, Vivek, what I would say there is, our business has been more cloud-weighted with the hyperscalers than enterprise that continued here in this Third Quarter. I do believe that there is a significant additional opportunity for us in the Cloud. So, as we work with these partners, it is it is about expansion of workloads. Really, there's more tailoring of workloads as well as we go forward. And then, there's also just more customers and and broader penetration in both Tier 1 and Tier 2 Cloud, guys. So, I think that's a good market for us.
On the enterprise side, I would say we saw a very strong enterprise quarter here in the third quarter. I think the strength of Milan with our OEMs in terms of the breadth of the platforms is very good, and we're seeing a good traction with sewer Fortune 1000 companies. So, I would say, overall, I think we see a growth trajectory for both our cloud and enterprise business. I think in the enterprise, the key thing has been to get more familiarity with Epic. And we've made very good progress there. And so, I feel very good about where that's going. Okay. Thank you, Lisa. Thanks. The next question is coming from Matt Ramsay from Cowen. Your line is now live. Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. Obviously, Lisa, some really strong progress with datacenter crossing, I guess a quarter of the business here with the results. I did want to ask a question specifically on your server business in China. Your competitor called out China and some of the turmoil that's gone over there as a reason why some of their cloud business had some headwinds in the Third Quarter, and maybe you could comment on how you see spending over the last quarter. And then in the next couple of quarters, specifically in that end market in China. And then I have follow-up. Thanks. Sure, Matt, so again, what I would say is our datacenter business performed very well in the third quarter. That was across both Cloud and enterprise. And in Cloud that was across geographies. So, we haven't seen anything particular as it relates to China or there. What I would say is, we continue to work with the breadth of customers and we're in the process of really rolling out broader adoption across the customer set. So, I think we saw a pretty normal environment for demand. Thanks for clearing that up. As my follow-up kind of unrelated. You guys mentioned in the comments still plans to get the Xilinx deal closed by the end of the year, and I think that's important as there's a lot of things that you can talk about more, maybe more openly about the heterogeneous compute strategy for the business over the long term. Lisa, maybe you could walk us through to the extent that you can talk about it.
Obviously, there's some things that you can't talk about, but the extent you can, what milestones you've achieved behind the scenes that make you feel confident and what hurdles are still there to have the confidence. I mean, I guess we got 6 weeks till we get into the month of December and things slow down a little bit regulatory-wise. So, I just wonder what gives the confidence that we can get there and what we should expect. Thank you. So, look, we've been working diligently on the closure of the Xilinx acquisition. I would say we are through the vast majority of what we need to do in the regulatory front. We're finishing up here and there's a -- there's very good progress on the integration side. So, we've done a lot on the integration. I think we're excited with the plans that we have, and then on the regulatory front, again as I said in the prepared remarks, we've made good progress and we believe we're on track to close at the end of the year. Thanks. To our next question -- Operator. Go ahead. Certainly. Our next question is coming from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. Hi, good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the question and congrats on the strong results. Lisa, I had two questions as well. First, on your outlook for 2022, I realize it's early and I certainly don't expect you guys to provide a point estimate. But I think people are kind of concerned that you've been sort of over growing if you will, relative to your long-term growth rate, you grew 45% last year, you are on track to grow 65% this year. Given your long term through-cycle growth target of 20%.
Again, there is concerned that you could decelerate going into next year given PC dynamics and competitive dynamics and so on and so forth. So again, I don't expect you to give any quantification of next year, but if you could describe the year qualitatively, what are the potential pluses and minuses at this point? That would be super helpful, and then I've got a quick follow-up. Sure. So, look, as you said, it's a little bit early to talk about 2022 quantitatively. I'll say qualitatively, what we see is -- look, we see a positive demand environment, and that's a market statement, but that's also an AMD statement, right? I think the strength of our product portfolio has multiple growth vectors. Datacenter continues to be a very important one for us. I think where we continue to make progress in the graphics market, and we think graphics is a good growth vector. Our console business we would expect would be -- I had mentioned earlier that it'd be up in the Fourth Quarter and then we would expect it to be up in 2022, just given the strength of the demand environment there.
And so, on the PC side, the comments I'll make on the PC side are, the end-user demand appears to be strong. So, there's -- there's a good amount of Refresh going on, whether you're talking about consumer, high-end consumer, or commercial, or gaming. There are some supply constraints around match sets that we believe will continue into the first half of the year. That being the case, what we're using from a planning assumption standpoint is that the PC market maybe flattish as we go from 2021 into 2022.
But even within that environment, we think there are opportunities for us to continue to grow. So overall, I think we were very focused on execution, very focused on working with our customers to make sure that we're aligned with what they need, and overall, I feel very good about our product portfolio going into 2022. Got it. That's super helpful. Thank you. And then as my quick follow-up, similar question on gross margin, I'm not sure if this is fully for Devinder. You're guiding Q4 to 49.5%, which is obviously significant progress from a year ago. Given some of the dynamics you've talked about, whether it be the growth potential and server CPU, the mix within server CPU and I'm sure the mix dynamics on the client side.
I think most of us do expect a pretty nice some positive trajectory into 2022 potentially with a five handle in terms of again, gross margins. But any risks or any headwinds that we should be aware of? I think your foundry partner is raising pricing, there's cost inflation generally across the board, but any risk items that we should think about at this point? Thank you. I wouldn't say it's like that, but I think is about managing the situation. As Lisa said in over the growth sectors that we have, we expect to continue making progress from where we are currently, and especially predicated on the competitive leadership products we have. We're very pleased with the progress we've made over the last few years. But without getting into specifics, I think you can assume that we continue to make progress with the mix of revenue, mix of products, and the competitive products that we're introducing also into 2022. Thank you. Thanks. Our next question is coming from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your line is now live. Hi, guys, thanks for taking my questions. My first one I wanted to ask about Datacenter GPU, I know you said it more than doubled. But can you give us an approximate feeling for how big that is, are we still talking like tens of millions of dollars or is it larger than that? And what are your expectations for how that's going to ramp as Frontier and some of the other supercomputers that a lot of that stuff is going into our ramping over the next couple of years. Sure. So, Stacy, on the Datacenter GPU side, the Third Quarter was a larger quarter for the Datacenter GPU. This is where we shipped the Frontier shipments that are now in the build cycle. It is still a relatively small business compared to the CPU site. So, our expectation is that going into the Fourth Quarter, it's a lumpy business for us. So Q3 was a strong quarter given the shipments for Frontier, we would expect as we go into the Fourth Quarter that it'll be down sequentially quarter-on-quarter, but still, it's a strong growth year overall for a business that we think is a significant strategic growth driver for us over the next few years.
Laura, thank you. For my follow-up I just wanted to ask you about Q4. Obviously, you had given implied guidance for Q4 last quarter. The guidance now is obviously decently [Indiscernible]. Can you just talk a little about what is driving that upside relative to where your expectations were last quarter? Devinder, you want to talk about that or. On the revenue, I think -- go ahead, please. I'm sorry. Were you asking about revenue or margin, Stacy? Well, both if you're willing to answer both. Okay. All right. Let me start and then let's -- I want to make sure I answer all your questions. How is that? So, look, on the revenue side. When we look at the sequential growth, we have been able -- look the supply chain -- this is about really supply chain optimization. And we have been able to secure some additional supply given some of the work that we've been doing. And we see strong demand across the board. But sequentially, what we're guiding to is stronger server demand as well as gaming.
And gaming includes the semi-custom game consoles, as well as our graphics business is doing quite well as well. And then in terms of the sequential margin, it's similar. I mean, we're having servers, some improved mix and graphics driving upside. And that's partially offset by the consoles which are below corporate average, but net-net, I think it's a positive sequential both on revenue and margin. I guess what I'm asking is, for example, are your expectations for servers into Q4 now, higher than they were three months ago when you gave implied guidance for Q4? Yes. Yes, it is. Got it. Okay. Thank you very much. Sure. Thanks. Your next question today is coming from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Thank you. I'm wondering if you could talk about graphics a little bit. It seems like that's the business that's probably struggled the most to get silicon. And yet you've shown some pretty nice growth there. What's the prognosis for that business going forward? And in the past, you've said you're comfortable that there's relatively low crypto currency exposure there. Is that still the case? Yes, sure Joe. Look, the graphics business did have a strong third quarter. I think that's true for graphics, gaming, as well as datacenter, GPU. I think the portfolio that we have there with RDNA 2 had turned out really well, so we're pleased with how it's positioned competitively in the marketplace and overall, gaming has been a secular trend that has continued with very strong demand. In terms of Crypto, our view is that it's really negligible revenue for us in the Third Quarter, it's not a segment that we have been servicing.
We've tried very much to try to keep our gaming graphics focused on gamers. And we were able to increase some of the supply for our graphics and that's one of the reasons that we saw the sequential growth that we saw and going into the Fourth Quarter next year again, I think we see gaming overall as a strong segment for us, and the product set is very good. So, we feel good about it. Great. Thank you very much. Thanks. Thank you. Next question is coming from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I've two quick questions if I can as well, just stick on the expectations in the next year, appreciating that you're not going to give a full guide. I'm just curious how we should think about the Semi-Custom business, given how sizable that's been to the overall growth in 2021? Any framing of how you expect 2022 to shape up at this point? Sure, Aaron. So again, if you Look at the overall growth that we had in 2021, I would say was actually quite balanced across all of our businesses. The Semi-Custom business was in the second year of ramp and demand has exceeded supply. We've been unable to ramp that as we've gone through the year. As we look in to 2022, the historical view of game consoles has been a year four is the peak, at least that's what it was in the last generation.
What we expect in this generation is again, very strong demand going into 2022. So, we would expect it to grow into 2022, which would be the third year of the cycle, and then we'll see what happens after that. But overall, I think our view is we have a very balanced business with multiple growth drivers across datacenter PCs, graphics, as well as consoles.
That's very helpful. And then the follow-up question is on your own supply chain side, I know in a preferred comments you said, working on securing, adequate supply given your growth trajectory. Are you currently able to meet all of the demand that you currently see and can you give any color of what -- how we should think about the supply situation on your end?
So, I mean, we've been working on ramping the supply chain really [Indiscernible] for more than a year if you think about the dynamics here. What I'd like to say is, overall, the demand has been very, very high. So, the fact that we can grow revenue this year, 65% year-on-year, I think is a testament to the supply chain work. I think, if we had more supply, we could certainly ship more.
That being the case, I think we're prioritizing in the most strategic segments, and we have invested significantly in capacity for additional capabilities. And we will see some of that come online as we go through 2022. And we're going to continue to be aggressive to secure additional capacity because we believe our product portfolio will enable that growth. Thank you. Thanks. Thanks. Our next question today is coming from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live. Good afternoon, guys. Congratulations, Lisa. Lisa, my first question is back on the supply side of things. I'm just wondering if you can help me better understand, was it more of an issue when your PC business or your server business, and I guess, especially as we look into next year, supply begins to loosen up. This year given how tight the overall ecosystem was, competing on price didn't make a lot of sense.
As supply begins to accelerate across the ecosystem, how are you thinking about pricing, especially in lieu of your large competitor resetting their gross margins for next year. In your view, does that give them more wiggle room or do you think that they're being pretty benign on the pricing side of things on that gross margin reset? Yeah, so maybe let me -- there's a lot of various aspects to that, John so let us let me try to take it in pieces. As it relates to current supply, I want to make sure that we're clear. I mean, we have brought on a tremendous amount of additional supply and that's part of the reason that we overachieved the Q3 results and then we guided higher in Q4. So, I do think that we have done a lot of work on our supply chain. In the PC market in particular, I think the market is not necessarily constrained on CPUs but more constrained on matched sets. And so, we're trying to ensure that we're not building inventory in the channel.
And that's part of the optimization that we do, is to ensure that as we ship selling processors that we see matched sets to sell-through. From that standpoint, we think inventory is very healthy at the OEMs and that's an important factor as we go into 2022. As it relates to what happens with the pricing environment as supply eases up. I think, right now what we see is again, it's an environment where most people are prioritizing supply.
As we go into 2022 though, I think this is all about the product and what we view is our focus in our product line, has been moving up the stack, ensuring that we're providing significant value to our customers in terms of total cost of ownership on the server side, and innovative features and capabilities on the PC side and the graphics side. And we're going to continue to do that. I mean, we're excited about our product portfolio into 2022. We're going to continue to be very aggressive on the overall roadmap. And with that, I think our game plan is exactly what it was -- what always has been, which is lean into the product cycle, and the deep customer relationships and continue to build that out over time. That's all for me. And then as my follow-up Devinder, you did a good job explaining the year-over-year changes in operating margins in the computing graphics business. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about sequentially what happened? Revenue was up and margins were down a little bit. Is that just the influence of the very strong growth in GPUs going into the datacenter, because it sounds like in the core compute business mix probably got better sequentially for you. So, I'm just trying to make sure I understand all the dynamics in play. If you're talking about the CG segment, its investments. So, I come investments did R&D and go-to-market. And also, we have a lot of new products coming into 2022. There's expenditure involve ahead of the curve before you introduce the products in the next year. And that's really what happened in the transition quarter-over-quarter. Perfect. Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Chris Caso, (ph.), from Raymond James. Your line is now live. Yes. Thank you. Good evening. First question is about the supply constraints and how that affects seasonality as we go into the beginning of next year. And you obviously, you're making efforts to bring on more supply. You spoke out pc, these current strengths with regard to map sets. I'm sure at this point you don't want to provide guidance for Q1, but how should we be thinking about seasonality for Q1 as we contemplate this supply can trains. Yeah, Chris, I think it's a little bit early to talk about Q1. I mean, I think, let's see what would we say about seasonality. I don't have a lot to say other than, typically, Q1 is down from Q4. That's typically what the pattern is given the consumer related businesses. It might be a little bit sub-seasonal as we go into this first quarter, just given the demand environment, but we'll have to see how things play out over the next couple of months. All right. Thank you. A little bit of a bigger picture question for my second question. And we've heard and seen from some of the hyperscalers is a trend of, in some cases, doing some custom designs, doing it on their own, often with ARM-based designs. Do you consider that an opportunity or a threat for AMD, and to what extent are you engaged with some of those hyperscalers on some of these custom designs because you do have IP portfolio yourself? Yeah. Chris on that, we definitely view it as an opportunity. Right? So, I think what's happening in the datacenter market is that as the need for compute gets larger, sort of this tailoring of compute for the various workloads is an important trend. I think our IP portfolio today is a very strong, I think it will even be stronger given some of the things that we have in plan to allow more tailoring.
And we are working very closely with a number of hyperscalers on the vision of compute over the next few years and how we might put together some different solutions between our CPU, GPU, interconnect capability, and then with the addition of Xilinx as well coming into our portfolio. So, lots of opportunity there for customization, I think that's a key trend that we are certainly going to lean into. Thank you. Thank you, Chris. Operator, two more questions, please. Certainly. Our next question is coming from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I also congrats of other people on the strong results. Lisa, I just wanted to ask about the comparison on your C&G side between the C and the G. And specifically on the client graphic side of things. Clearly this year has been a really strong year for AMD. Can you just talk about the go-forward on the client side and that I think we're all pretty well aware what's going to happen on the Datacenter GPU side.
But how do we reconcile your commentary on where you think the PC market would be in the flattish area versus the strength you've had in GPUs this year and a strong GPU market, do you think that continues next year? How much of it is AMD specific or if the PC market is weaker, is that something that's a little bit of a headwind for AMD? So again, what I would say is our market share is still, I would say underrepresented, whether you're talking about the client CPU or APU side, or the GPU side. I think what we have seen here in the third quarter and then into the second half of the year is, our graphics business has performed quite well. It is channel driven in the sense that there's still strong demand amongst gamers for GPUs. As we go into 2022 though, I don't view the PC market as a headwind for the Company. I think as we look at all of these markets, of course we do a bunch of scenario planning of the market is up or if it's down.
I think there are many -- many who think that the market maybe up, there's some who think that market maybe down. And that's why we're choosing to model the base case is flattish. But even within that market, whether you're talking about client CPUs or client GPUs, we think we have opportunities to gain share and grow in that business. Just given the strength of our product portfolio and the fact that we are underrepresented to think the what we can expect given those products. Thanks for that. And I guess as my follow-up, just one for Devinder on the OpEx side. And I'll give the same disclaimer that I know you're not going to give any specifics about next year, but you guys have done a great job of lowering your OpEx intensity throughout this year. I think you're going to be closer to 24% versus your 26 to 27 entering the year in 25 as of last quarter. So great expansion there and margins and better leverage.
As we look forward, though, I think the third quarter was the first time where you guys spent enough that it actually impacted a segment where the operating margin fell a little bit. And I think we all understand why you're doing that and it feeds great growth so it's not a negative. But as I look into '22, do you think next year can be another year where you're operating leverage is positive, or do you expect to be able to spend closer to your former targets in the 25% to 27% of sales range? I think fundamentally, and what you observed is right, very disciplined from an OpEx standpoint. Investing in the growth is important. Many of the things that Lisa talked about earlier is all about growth in many different vectors. And obviously, that requires funding from an OpEx standpoint. Whether it's R&D, go-to-market, hiring, which we're doing from a viewpoint of the dot in the Company. And I think from a modeling standpoint on our guidance stand point you can assume that the growth in OpEx will be lower in revenue. Margin continues to expand, OpEx flattens even down. I mean, you can model it, but very disciplined on that standpoint. And making sure that we're investing for the growth is a top priority for us. Thank you. Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your line is now live. Thank you for fitting me in. I had two, I guess first, Lisa, no invest about software yet I was wondering if you can update us on your software efforts. And maybe as you get close to closing Xilinx, how much that changes things for you on the software side, and maybe how your search for software talents been, and then I had a follow-up. Sure, Tim. So yes. We continue to invest heavily in software, particularly on the Datacenter GPU side. With our next-generation GPU architecture, MI200, which we will be talking a little bit about in next few weeks. We have made significant investments and progress. Our focus has been using the Frontier beachhead with high-performance computing and expanding that into AI and working with our partners on that software development.
So overall, continue to make good progress there. I think the Xilinx acquisition and bringing in that software talent also provides opportunities to optimize across the overall portfolio in terms of just the software infrastructure that people want in an overall ecosystem. So very strategic area that we're making good progression. Thanks a lot. And I guess just last question for me. So, server share, if I look at your guidance for Q4, it looks like you're going to be in the 12.5-13% share if I use the entire TAM. And that's up like 500 basis points versus last year Q4. So, I guess the question is that a reasonable trajectory into next year as if we're sitting here 12 months from now, would you be surprised if you gain another 500 basis points next year. Where do you think about where that share can go next? Well, I think overall our server trajectory has been very strong. I mean, I think we're very pleased with the trajectory here in 2021. I think having a number of quarters where we're doubling the revenue year-on-year speaks to the progress there. As we go into 2022, we still believe we are a share gainer in that environment just given the strength of our portfolio and that's called platforms that are still yet to launch across our customer set.
So, we're continuing to play out the strategy of a datacenter being a place where our technology is very differentiated. And we think that's true in the third-generation with Epic and we certainly are very focused on ensuring that the next-generation with Zen 4 and [Indiscernible] are similarly well-positioned in the marketplace. Thanks a lot. Thank you, Tim. Thank you. We reached end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over for any further or closing comments. No, we're good. Thank you very much, Operator. And thank you to everyone for joining us today. We appreciate your time and participation and your support of AMD. Have a good afternoon. Thank you.

Now with that, I will hand the call over to Lisa. Lisa? Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. 2021 was an outstanding year for AMD, as we exceeded our aggressive growth goals and delivered another record year. Each of our businesses grew significantly and set new annual revenue record, highlighted by data center revenue more than doubling year-over-year.
Annual revenue grew 68% to a record $16.4 billion, and we expanded gross margin for the sixth straight year. We also delivered record net income and EPS, both of which more than doubled year-over-year.
Looking at the fourth quarter, we ended the year exceptionally strong with our sixth straight of greater than 45% year-over-year revenue growth. Fourth quarter revenue grew 49% from a year ago to a record $4.8 billion. We expanded gross margin by more than 5 percentage points and doubled operating income year-over-year.
Turning to our Computing and Graphics segment. Revenue increased 32% year-over-year to $2.6 billion, driven by growth in both Ryzen and Radeon processor sales. Record client computing revenue grew by a double-digit percentage from a year ago, led by record notebook sales.
We saw strong demand for premium AMD notebooks and our higher-end desktop CPUs in the quarter, as Ryzen 5000 processor unit shipments grew by a double-digit percentage sequentially. As a result, we believe we gained client processor revenue share for the seventh straight quarter. We launched our Ryzen 6000 series notebook CPUs at CES last month, featuring our new Zen 3+ core that further extends the leadership compute, gaming and battery life capabilities of our mobile processors. We increased the number of premium gaming and commercial design wins from Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo and other major PC providers to more than 200, including more than 20 AMD Advanced notebooks that combine Ryzen CPUs, Radeon GPUs and Radeon Software to deliver the ultimate gaming experience.
We also provided the first public demonstration of our upcoming Ryzen 7000 desktop processors at CES. Ryzen 7000 series desktop CPUs provide a significant performance increase compared to our current Ryzen processors by combining our high-performance 5-nanometer Zen 4 core with our next-generation memory and IO technologies in the new AM5 socket. There's a lot of excitement in the market for our next-gen Ryzen desktop processors and we're on track to launch in the second half of 2022.
In Graphics, revenue more than doubled year-over-year for the third straight quarter. Radeon 6000 series GPU unit shipments and revenue both grew by double-digit percentages sequentially, led by strong demand across our RDNA 2 desktop family. At CES, we announced that we expanded our Radeon 6000 series GPU portfolio with our first mainstream RDNA 2 desktop GPU priced at $199. We also introduced new mobile GPUs that deliver up to 20% more performance than our prior generation and our first mobile graphics chips for thin and light gaming notebooks.
Data center graphics revenue more than doubled year-over-year, driven largely by HPC wins for our latest Instinct MI200 accelerators. We are seeing growing customer engagements for our data center GPUs based on the leadership AI and HPC performance of our new MI200 accelerators, highlighted by multiple supercomputing wins and an expanded set of platforms on track to launch from Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Super Micro and others starting later this quarter.
Turning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. Revenue increased 75% year-over-year to $2.2 billion, driven by record EPYC processor and Semi-custom sales. Semi-custom sales increased year-over-year as the current game console cycle continues outpacing all prior generations. We expect revenue to grow this year driven by continued strong demand for the latest Microsoft and Sony consoles.
Turning to Server. We had another outstanding quarter. Revenue more than doubled year-over-year and increased by a double-digit percentage sequentially, driven by demand across both cloud and enterprise customers. In cloud, revenue more than doubled year-over-year as the largest providers expanded internal deployments and more than 130 new AMD-powered instances launched from Amazon Web Services, Alibaba, Google, IBM, Microsoft Azure and others.
Microsoft Azure previewed a new HPC instance, powered by our third-gen EPYC processors with 3D stack memory that delivers up to 80% more performance than currently available instances. Our differentiated 3D stacking technology further extends the leadership performance of EPYC processors and technical computing workloads like EDA, fluid dynamics and complex simulations. We started volume production of EPYC processors with 3D stacked memory earlier this quarter in advance of OEM platform launches with all our major server partners.
In Enterprise, revenue doubled year-over-year, driven by the ongoing ramp of more than 100 third-gen EPYC platforms available from Dell, HP Enterprise, Lenovo, SuperMicro, Cisco and others. In HPC, EPYC processor adoption was highlighted by the number of AMD-powered supercomputers on the November Top 500 fastest supercomputers list, tripling year-over-year to 73. EPYC processors also dominated the Green500 List and are now powering eight of the top 10 most efficient supercomputers in the world.
Turning to our overall data center business. We made outstanding progress in the last year. We exited 2021 with data center revenue contributing a mid-20 percentage of overall revenue, and we expect 2022 to be another year of significant growth based on the strong customer demand signals for our current and next-generation products.
In November, we provided first details of our next-generation EPYC processor, codenamed Genoa that will feature up to 96 Zen 4 cores and next-generation memory and I/O technologies including breakthrough memory expansion capabilities. Customer excitement for Genoa is extremely high as it extends our performance leadership across a broad range of workloads.
We also announced the addition of Bergamo to our server roadmap, featuring a version of our Zen 4 core called Zen 4c that has been specifically optimized for cloud-native computing. Bergamo is a high core talent power-efficient CPU that can be used in the same platforms as Genoa. It will feature up to 128 CPU cores and deliver significant performance and power efficiency advantages for cloud workloads. We are sampling Genoa processors to customers now and are on track to launch later this year with Bergamo shipments planned to follow in the first half of 2023.
Turning to our Xilinx acquisition. We were pleased to announce that China's State Administration for Market Regulation approved the transaction on January 27th. The only remaining regulatory approval required is FTC approval of our HSR refiling, and we expect to close the transaction in the first quarter of 2022.
I am more excited than ever about the benefits of the acquisition for both AMD and Xilinx stakeholders. Customer excitement is also high as they look forward to the opportunity to deepen their strategic engagements with AMD based on our expanded technology and solutions portfolio.
In summary, I am incredibly proud of our performance in 2021. Our record annual results highlight our strong execution over multiple years to establish the technical, operational and strategic foundation to position AMD as a high-performance computing leader. Each of our businesses performed extremely well in 2021 with growth significantly ahead of the long-term financial model we outlined at our Financial Analyst Day in 2020. I want to take a moment to recognize and thank the AMD employees whose passion, dedication and execution have enabled this success.
Turning to 2022. Demand for our product is very strong, and we look forward to another year of significant growth and share gains as we ramp our current products and launch our next wave of Zen 4 CPUs and RDNA 3 GPUs. We have also made significant investments to secure the capacity needed to support our growth in 2022 and beyond.
Looking out over the long term, we are confident in our ability to continue growing significantly faster than the market, based on our expanded road map investments and the deep relationships we have established with a broad set of customers who view AMD as a strategic enabler of their success.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our fourth quarter and full year financial performance. Devinder? Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a very strong 2021, with increased demand for our products. Excellent execution resulted in record annual revenue, continued gross margin expansion, record profitability and significant cash flow generation.
The fourth quarter 2021 revenue of $4.8 billion was our sixth consecutive quarterly record, up 49% from a year ago, driven by strong revenue increases across all businesses. Gross margin was 50%, up 560 basis points from a year ago, driven by a richer mix of products and data center revenue growth.
Operating expenses were $1.1 billion compared to $789 million a year ago, as we increased investments in our long-term product road maps to support the significant growth trajectory of our business. Operating income doubled from a year ago to a record $1.3 billion, up $665 million, primarily driven by significant revenue growth and higher gross margin.
Operating margin was 27%, up from 20% a year ago. Net income was a record $1.1 billion, up $486 million from a year ago. Diluted earnings per share was $0.92 compared to $0.52 per share a year ago. This includes a 15% effective tax rate compared to a 3% rate a year ago.
Now turning to fourth quarter business segment results. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $2.6 billion, up 32% year-over-year, driven by higher graphics and client processor revenue. Computing and Graphics segment operating income was $566 million or 22% of revenue compared to $420 million a year ago. The increase in operating income was driven primarily by higher revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses.
Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue was $2.2 billion, up 75% from $1.3 billion the prior year. The strong revenue increase was driven by significantly higher EPYC processor and Semi-Custom sales.
EESC segment operating income grew significantly to $762 million or 34% of revenue compared to $243 million or 19% a year ago. Operating income growth was driven primarily by higher revenue and richer product mix, partially offset by higher R&D and go-to-market expenses.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $3.6 billion at year-end. As we continue returning capital to shareholders, we repurchased $756 million of common stock in the fourth quarter and closed out the year with $1.8 billion of repurchases. Additionally, we have repurchased $1 billion to date in the first quarter of 2022 and have $1.2 billion remaining under the authorized $4 billion share repurchase plan. Quarterly free cash flow was $736 million compared to $480 million in the same quarter last year and $764 million in the prior quarter. Inventory was $2 billion, up $53 million from the prior quarter.
Now let me turn to our full year financial results. 2021 revenue was $16.4 billion, up 68% year-on-year, driven by strong growth across all businesses. Gross margin was 48%, up 370 basis points from the prior year, driven by the strength and competitiveness of our EPYC, Radeon and Ryzen processors.
Operating expenses were 24% of revenue compared to 28% in 2020. 2021 operating income was up 146% from a year ago to $4.1 billion, resulting in an operating margin of 25% compared to 17% in 2020. Net income was $3.4 billion, up 118% from the prior year. Full year free cash flow was a record $3.2 billion, resulting in free cash flow margin of 20% for the year. In addition, we invested approximately $1 billion during 2021 in long-term supply chain capacity to support our expectations for future revenue and market share growth.
Let me now turn to our financial outlook. Today's outlook is based on current expectations and contemplates the current global supply environment and customer signals and does not contemplate the addition of Xilinx as that transaction has not yet closed.
First quarter 2022 revenue is expected to be approximately $5 billion, plus or minus $100 million, an increase of approximately 45% year-over-year and approximately 4% quarter-on-quarter. The year-over-year increase is expected to be driven by growth across all businesses. The quarter-on-quarter increase is expected to be driven by higher server and client revenue.
In addition, for Q1 2022, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 50.5%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.2 billion; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $207 million based on a 15% effective tax rate; and the diluted share count to be approximately 1.22 billion shares.
For the full year 2022, we expect revenue to be approximately $21.5 billion, an increase of approximately 31%, driven by growth across all businesses. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 51%. Non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately 24% of revenue, non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 15%. And non-GAAP cash tax rate to be approximately 9% due primarily to the US tax requirement to capitalize R&D and the full utilization of our US net operating losses and tax credits in 2022.
In closing, we had an outstanding quarter and an excellent year with very strong revenue growth and numerous financial records. As we enter 2022, our leadership products and growing customer momentum continue to position us very well for long-term growth. I look forward to AMD delivering another year of very strong financial performance.
With that, I'll turn it back to Laura for the question-and-answer session. Laura? Thank you, Devinder, and thank you, Lisa. Operator, we're ready for our first question. Certainly. We’ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Yeah. Thanks for taking the question, and congratulations on the quarter. Just thinking about the full year guidance, I know that you had mentioned in your prepared remarks that you expect the semi-custom segment to grow. I'm curious if you could help us maybe appreciate how you're thinking about the semi-custom segment relative to the server segment and whether or not that 30% contribution from total data center still applies for 2023, the outlook that you had provided at the last Analyst Day, or you think that we're tracking above that trend? Thank you. Sure, Aaron. Thanks for the question. So for 2022, I mean our current view is that we'll see growth in all of our businesses. We see strong demand for our products as well as we have increased supply capability given what we've done with our partners, so relative to the growth from the different businesses.
The growth will be led by server. So from what we see from customers and design wins and platforms and all that, server will be very strong next year. But we also expect growth from our other businesses, including consoles, including our PC business, our graphics business and our embedded business. So we expect the percentage of data center to continue to increase as we go into next year, and we'll give more on that as we go through the year. Okay. Thank you. Thanks, Aaron. Thank you. Your next question today is coming from Matt Ramsay from Cowen & Company. Your line is now live. Thank you very much. Good afternoon. For the whole team, but Lisa, congrats on getting close on Xilinx. Excited to see what that brings and obviously, the strong results. One of the questions I'm getting tonight is with such a strong start, greater than 30% guidance for revenue in 2022, can you just kind of walk us through maybe with a little more specificity, some of the things that you've done in the supply chain around substrate, around back-end test and package, around wafer demand and just to give people comfort that there's coverage there and visibility and the potential for upside, particularly as you take server and desktop on the 5-nanometer. I imagine, 7-nanometer capacity won't go away. It will stay as that new capacity comes online. So I just want to make sure I understand all the variables around the confidence in supply. Thanks. Yeah, absolutely, Matt. Thanks for the question. So we've been working on the supply chain really for the last four or five quarters knowing the growth that we have from a product standpoint and the visibility that we have from customers. So in regards to your question on 2022 supply environment, we've made significant investments in wafer capacity as well as substrate capacity and back-end capacity. We feel very good about our progress in the supply chain to meet the 2022 guidance. And our goal is, frankly, to have enough supply to satisfy the demand out there.
So our view is we're going to continue to work with our partners and our customers to ensure that we know what they need. And likewise, our capacity investments are for 2022, but also beyond 2022, because as the business grows, we need to continue to forecast and make plans for that, and that's what we've been working on. Very good. Thanks for that. Just as a follow-up, I've been hearing more and more, and as you guys roll out the 5-nanometer portfolio, many of those products in server and in desktop will include next-generation Infinity Fabric. And it's been a conversation for a while about what you guys have branded sort of A+ A, AMD CPU and GPU together. I wonder as you look out over the next several quarters, how -- Lisa, how would you characterize that combination in importance to your company strategy and the growth? Thanks. Yes. Well, we're very excited about our 5-nanometer products. I think Zen 4 is very critical. It's a focus for this year for both our server road map as well as our client road map. And then the work with the Infinity Fabric really is just on top of that and allows us to continue to optimize sort of the AMD CPU and GPU ecosystem together.
So whether on the data center side, with our data center GPU products, working with EPYC in high-performance computing or on the PC side, when we have our AMD APUs plus our discrete graphics, plus the software on top. So it is an important -- very important element of our strategy, and it just goes to continuing to differentiate with the overall portfolio, as we go into these new platforms. Thank you, Matt. Operator, next question please. Certainly. Our next question is coming from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live. Hi. Thanks a lot for letting me ask a question. Congrats on the strong results and the strong guide. Lisa, I just want to talk about the computing segment, the client computing side. At least in my model, that was a significant portion of the upside in the quarter after, I believe, last quarter, you talked about not wanting to fill the channel and make sure you ship according to demand.
So in the near term, what changed? And perhaps more importantly, as you look into 2022, it appears that you're planning for significant share gains to continue in that sector. Can you talk a little bit about what gives the confidence for that share gain, please? Sure, Ross. So your question about the Computing and Graphics segment. Look, our focus in this segment is to be very closely aligned with our customers and what they're doing in the market. So we've been monitoring sell-in and sell-out and sell-through trends very carefully.
I think the strength that we saw in the fourth quarter was very much a result of sort of the product strength. And we saw very nice notebook demand continuing at the premium part of the market in commercial, gaming, premium ultrathin. So we believe that the PC performance was a bit above our original guidance, but we believe that was to match end user demand.
Going into 2022, again, same story. I think the -- what we see is, 2021 was a strong year for PCs. Overall, the industry shipped approximately 350 million units. I think our view is that 2022 will be roughly flattish from a unit standpoint. But we will see some mix changes in there with enterprise and premium being stronger than, for example, low end and education.
So from our standpoint, it's revenue share that we believe we can gain. It's the strength of our Ryzen 6000 series that we just launched at CES. We have 200 platforms from all of the OEM customers. And we have pretty good visibility in working with our customers on that. So -- and I think we feel good about it. And again, the client business is one of all of our businesses will grow. And I like that diversity, frankly, in the portfolio. But we feel good about the progress we've made in PCs, and we'll continue to ensure that we're matching sell in with sell out so that there is not inventory build in the business. Thanks for the color. Maybe a quick follow-up on the pricing side of the equation. You talked about getting enough supply to grow the impressive targets that you guys have for the year. Conceptually and strategically, how do you think about pricing? Is that something you pass along? Is it a tailwind to gross margin? And I don't know if you'd give any sort of precision, but out of the 30% plus that you're guiding to for the fiscal year, roughly, how do we think about pricing as a tailwind within that? Yes. Well, I would say the way to think about pricing is the industry has seen some price increases across the supply chain. And that's as to be expected given the amount of capacity that we're all putting on to satisfy the strong demand. So we're always in this for the long-term and working with our supply chain partners as well as our customers to ensure that we find a way to kind of share the additional costs. But our focus is on ensuring that we have the supply to meet the high demand.
And I think what you're seeing is growth in the model from the standpoint that we've always kind of said we're underrepresented in the business. When you look even today with all of our growth, we're still underrepresented in the business, whether you're talking about the server business or the PC business. And so we believe that our product strength and our customer engagements are such that we can grow significantly in this environment. Thank you. Thanks, Ross. Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Thanks for taking my question. Lisa, I wanted to get your thoughts on the competitive landscape in the server market this year versus last. Your competitor at Intel is launching their Sapphire Rapids platform. They seem to be very excited about that. They're adding a lot of capacity in their fabs. Yet enterprise spending, which has tended to favor them in the past, right, is also coming back. So I'm just curious, how are you thinking about AMD's ability to gain more share in servers this year? Yes, Vivek. So look, we always expect the competitive environment to be very strong and very aggressive. And that's the way we plan our business. That being the case, I think we're very happy with the growth that we've seen in the business sort of last year.
And as we look forward, we see opportunities in both cloud and enterprise. On the cloud side, we're in 10 of the largest hyperscalers in the world are using AMD. As they get familiar with us over multiple generations, they're expanding the workloads that they're using AMD on. So we see that across internal and external workloads.
In the Enterprise segment, we doubled year-over-year here in 2021. We continue to add more field support to have more people get familiar with our architecture. We have very strong OEM relationships. So I feel very good about our server trajectory. And yes, it's very competitive out there. But we think the data center business is a secular growth business. And within that, we can grow significantly faster than the market. All right. So my follow-up, Lisa, the semiconductor industry just went through a very tough time last year and even into this year, given all the supply shortages. I'm curious, what has that done to help you build stronger relationships with your customers who are perhaps looking for a more consistent execution on the roadmap and more reliable sources of supply? So how is the shortage environment in semis changed the way customers are looking at AMD today than how they used to look at you historically? Yeah. I think, Vivek, the most important thing that we are working on with our customers is really consistent execution. And so when you look at the last year and some of the supply-demand imbalance, it has actually caused us to work much, much more closely with our customers. I think we have -- we're talking about visibility now multiple quarters and, in some cases, multiple years out. For the type of capacity that we're talking about for the size of the customers that we're talking to, we need to do that to plan to have the capability to support all of that capability.
So overall, I think we have definitely deepened the relationship with the customers. And by the way, also, we've deepened the relationships with our supply chain partners. So I think the entire sort of -- the entire food chain needs to come together to deliver on the very strong demand that's out there. So that's certainly what we've been working on. Thanks. Thanks, Vivek. Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. Great. Thank you. Congrats on the strong results, Lisa. I had two questions as well. One relatively short-term and one on Xilinx. The short-term question. Just on Q1 revenue, you're obviously guiding total company revenue up on a sequential basis. Your nearest competitor talked about CPU inventory corrections in the quarter. Is that something that you're seeing in the market? And if so, is that contemplated in your guidance? Sure, Toshiya. Thanks for the question. So yeah, our guide in Q1 actually is up sequentially. Usually, we're down sequentially, just given normal seasonality, but the demand patterns are such that demand is strong and we have additional supply coming on board, and so that's why we're guiding sequentially up.
As it relates to CPU inventory, whether in PCs or in servers, we don't believe there is any significant inventory of our products, whether at our customers or in the retailer channel. So from that standpoint, I think we've been watching very carefully the sell-in and sell-through patterns, and we believe we're matched to end-user demand. Great. And as my quick follow-up on Xilinx. It's been a while since your initial announcement. I'm sure you've had quite a bit of back and forth with your customers. You've had time to monitor how they've been performing as a stand-alone company. How has your view on the company and sort of the hit technology and the potential revenue synergies going forward evolved at all? I know, you're still waiting to close this thing. So maybe you can't say too much, but just curious how your view on things have evolved as it relates to Xilinx. Thank you. Yes, absolutely. Look, I'm extremely excited about Xilinx. I mean, I would say that we very much have been planning for the integration over this period of time. We've had customers anxious to talk to us about combined road maps.
When we think about sort of the technology that they have, it's very complementary to ours, very, very strong team. And their business results were just posted last week, and their business is also doing it very, very well. So I think the combination is going to be very exciting. We look forward to telling you a lot more about it, as we get to close and beyond. Thank you. Our next question today is coming from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live. Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Lisa, thanks for letting me ask a question. Lisa, a couple of questions. First, I'm wondering if you could just help me better understand the fungibility of your capacity planning throughout the year, i.e., I understand that your view on the PC market this year is sort of flattish with a better mix and you gaining share.
But in the event that come mid-year that were to change and perhaps be a little bit worse than thought, do you have the ability to rejigger your sort of supply chain to move towards server and CPU? How does that kind of math work? Yes, John. So we've certainly worked very hard to give ourselves fungibility amongst the various capacity corridors that we have. So we've done numerous cross qualifications and new factory bring-ups and all of that stuff. So I would say it's not 100% fungible, but there -- it is -- there is an ability to move across the different businesses.
And we make that a dynamic allocation decision sort of like weekly based on what we see going on. So I think we have a pretty good pulse on the market. And we sort of understand sort of what's going on. And our customers are giving us signals on a regular basis. And so, I think, we'll be able to manage through at all of the puts and takes as we go through the year. That's helpful. And then my second question, just on data center and GPU. Where does that factor into kind of your growth expectations for this year? And now that you've created sort of a strong beachhead of EPYC inside the data center, does that help the sales cycle at all to get more GPU penetration? Yes, sure. So our data center GPU had a very strong year in 2021. It was sort of a key year for us as we launched the MI200 family and we had several large supercomputing wins. This year, for data center GPU, it's about the cloud and about sort of expanding beyond sort of the large HPC wins. I view it as a strategic growth vector for us over the next several years.
I think your question is a good one about sort of the pull now that EPYC is very sort of well established in these accounts. I do think that helps us with data center GPU. But the way to think about it is, this is a long-term investment for us.
The hardware is very, very good. We've been investing more in the software. We've been working with our customers to ensure that our tool chain gets them the performance that they need. And so I would say, this is a longer-term driver, but I'm pleased with the progress that we made certainly through this last year. Thanks a lot. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Your line is now live. Hey, thanks for taking my question. I was curious on the EPYC side and the preamble you kept clearly strong trends in cloud and enterprise and HPC. Just curious on the comp channel. You had a press release recently with Nokia. I know it's kind of early days, but any kind of comments you had in terms of your design progress there? It's kind of the last area that you haven't really penetrated in servers. Yes. Sure, Blayne. It's still very early. But yes, we're very happy with the partnership with Nokia that was announced. As you said, this is an area where we're early in the cycle. It's an area where we're building relationships. And so I feel good about the progress there, but I would say it's still quite early.
And then you didn't ask this, but just one of the other things with the communications and 5G. As we bring Xilinx into the equation, they also have very deep relationships with a number of these accounts. And so we see that as an incremental positive as we think about EPYC in communications. Thanks. And then maybe for my follow-up, just on the March guidance. Semi-Custom typically has a pretty seasonal decline. It's been anything but typical. And you had very strong trends it seems like in the end of the year. So I'm just kind of curious within that March guidance that I think you can provide in terms of -- I'm assuming it's probably down, but I am just kind of curious versus normal levels. If you could just tell us anything, that would be helpful. Sure. So for the Q1 guide, the sequential up is being driven by -- primarily by server and then also by client. For Semi-Custom, it is normally significantly down. And this year, it is flattish into the first quarter. And it's -- as you said, the seasonal patterns aren't there. Demand continues to be strong, and we continue to support our customers with additional product there. Thanks, Lisa. Sure. Thanks. Your next question is coming from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your line is now live. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I want to revisit the pricing question. I don't think you quite answered it. I get the inflationary environment, I get your costs are going up, it's fair to pass those along. But of the 31% growth in 2022, how much of a tailwind is pricing? I mean is it none? Is it some? Like how much? What's the number? Stacy, I don't think I'm going to answer that exactly. But what I will say is what I said before. Look, we are sharing. As we go through this environment, the key is to have long-term relationships, both on the supply chain side and on the customer side. But without a doubt, the predominant growth is products. So it's units and ASPs from the mix of the product, and that's the predominant growth. Okay. Okay. For my follow-up, look, I feel really bad about me picking on a 51% gross margin, but I am going to, so I apologize in advance. But I'll be honest, just given the mix seemingly should be getting quite a bit better year-over-year in 2022 versus 2021, and you're almost sitting at 51%, I mean, even going into Q1 anyway. Like why doesn't that margin go higher? Can you give us some feeling of the drivers, I guess, from where you're sitting right now in Q4 to Q1 guide through the year? Like why shouldn't we expect more upside to that gross margin given where the mix is going? Yes, Stacy, I can take that. As you heard Lisa talk about semi-custom in Q4 to Q1, you would expect an increase, but it is flattish. And really, it's product mix-dependent, right? I think looking at any particular quarter is sometimes not the way to do it. It's kind of looking at the long-term. We did 48-plus percent in 2020, and we're going to 51% as a guide in 2022. And if you look at it from that standpoint, the margin of the company continues to go up in a very steady way as data center grows, as we get to a better mix of product within the client and graphics business, and that's, I think, the better way to look at it, Stacy. Okay, got it. Thank you guys. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I had one for Lisa and one for Devinder, if I may. Lisa, on -- it seems like one of the potential threats to the merchant processor players like yourself is that your own customers are designing their own processors. And I'm wondering, does AMD have a role working with your customers to provide customized solutions, be it tweaking x86 or co-designing something more specific together hand-in-hand? I don't know if Xilinx would play a role in that. Could you just talk about what you're doing on -- with your customers on that effort? Yeah, sure, Mark. So actually, it's a very exciting area. It's -- just consider it an evolution of -- we've always had a semi-custom model, like the work that we do with the console guys to design specifically for their application. As we look at the broader set of applications, including some of these data center applications, we do believe that there's a sort of the next leg of the stool in terms of deep customer relationships. So we already do a lot of customization around product SKUs and specific optimization points, but we can certainly imagine both customer IP or different incarnations of our IP to really optimize, because as these applications end up really requiring so much volume, it really does justify additional customization for those cases. Yeah, got you. Thank you. And then a follow-up for Devinder, if I may. Devinder, five, 10 years ago, I don't think a lot of people would have expected to hear you talk about buying back billions of dollars worth of stock. So congratulations on that progress. The question on this topic is, where are -- where is AMD in terms of evolving this recent capital return push into a policy? Are you at a point where you're just looking opportunistically to buying back stock, or some companies say, we're going to return X-percent of our cash flow to shareholders. Where is AMD in this -- in the evolution of capital return? Thank you. I think we just started in 2021, $1.8 billion. We did another $1 billion early in 2022. And certainly, that -- those purchases are part of our long-term $4 billion share repurchase program. To your question about policy, I don't think we're quite there yet. We just started. We'll evaluate it as we close the volume transaction and also in our outlook of the business, confidence in the business and then evaluate what we do from an overall standpoint as we look out to the future, the next few years here. Fair enough. Thank you. Thanks Mark Our next question is coming from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Great. Thank you. You've obviously done a great job of bringing on supply. But it seems like AMD product is still relatively tight kind of everywhere. Do you see the constraints being more severe in any of the end markets versus any of the others? Sure, Joe. Well, I think overall, we have been in a mode of demand is larger than supply. Although, we made a lot of progress through 2021. And I expect to make more progress, really incremental capacity will come online through 2022, especially in the second half.
So I think it's really about sort of our prioritization decisions and trying to ensure that we spend -- that we're satisfying our customers' needs. But we're definitely working on getting more supply as we go through the year. And I think you should see it loosen up a bit. Great. Thank you. And then for my follow-up, you mentioned, I think, within server that both enterprise and cloud were up over 100%, which seems pretty good. Can you talk about the mix of enterprise versus cloud within that business, give us some qualitative sense of how big enterprise it has become. Yes. So enterprise has grown nicely. I mean, we're still cloud-weighted. So if you look -- sometimes these patterns, it's better to look on a full year basis. So we are still cloud-weighted relative to enterprise. But enterprise has made a really nice progress. It's a sizable business, and the -- we've made progress with the larger OEMs as well as across a number of regional OEMs. Great. Thank you very much. Thanks. We have time -- two more, please? Certainly. Our next question is coming from Chris Caso from Raymond James. Your line is now live. Yes. Thank you. Good evening. First question is, if you could give some indication of the strategy behind some of the processor variants that have come out, most recently Milan-X and Bergamo coming up. Do those variants represent incremental revenue to AMD? What's the strategy behind it? How does that help you, help the product line? Sure, Chris. Well, I think the strategy is, as we have gotten more scale in the business, we can invest more and we see ways to further differentiate our product portfolio. So I mean, I think Milan-X is really sort of the highest of the highest end. And we see that for technical computing and some of these EDA workloads that, that does give us a very differentiated product. And then we have the regular Milan product line. We'll have Genoa. And Bergamo is really optimized for cloud.
So I do believe it gives us more opportunity to expand from a market share and a footprint standpoint. And I think the broader statement, Chris, is that, the data center is so large. There are so many different workloads that you can optimize. Like, by doing these variants, we will actually get a better solution for the customer, give them better total cost of ownership and, hopefully, give us a larger footprint in that workload as well. Thank you. As a follow-up, the follow-up question is about supply and just following up on some of your earlier comments. But can you tell us how you're approaching that now with getting the additional supply? Is it a factor of your customers coming to you with the requirements and then you're going back to the foundry.
And obviously, you need to make commitments to the foundries right now. Are those backed up by customer commitments? And in the event that business turns out to be better as it was last year, are you able to procure that additional supply in time for when the business needs it? Yes. We've set out a road map for, frankly, not just 2022 but beyond, which allows, let's call it, very aggressive growth goals. We work that on a regular basis with our customers and our supply chain partners. I would say we have better visibility than we have ever had from a customer demand standpoint. And so that gives us pretty good confidence in terms of what is needed, but there are always going to be some puts and takes. And so we have enough flexibility to do that. But our goal is to dimension for success, right? At the end of the day, that's what we want to do is we want to satisfy customer demand, and so we're dimensioning for success and work with our customers as their demand evolves. Thank you. Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. Hi, good afternoon. Just wanted to ask about your Embedded business. It's not often talked about, but it's a great market, right, diversified across various end markets, you can also leverage your leading edge and mature portfolio. You've got a pretty good lineup of the FX-based and Ryzen-based processors targeting Embedded. You've also gotten some pretty good design win traction in automotive with guys like Tesla, you've got wins in retail with digital signage, wins in networking, IoT edge platforms. And then with Xilinx, you can sort of really leverage their exposure in industrial automotive coming consumer end markets. It's a small part of the business today, but how do you see the Embedded opportunity for AMD looking out over the next several years? Yes. Thanks for the question, Harlan. Look, I like the Embedded business. I've always liked the Embedded business. It's a nice, sticky business over many years. It is smaller, but it has grown nicely. And the volume design wins in automotive and they've now sort of expanded their usage. They've recently expanded their usage over a broader part of their product portfolio.
We've focused on networking and storage as key markets. I do think there is a very good synergy with Xilinx in terms of just the customer set and the channels. And so I do see it as a nice grower for us as we go through it, and there's very good reuse from our server products as well as our client products. So we'll talk -- again, we'll talk a little bit more about it as the business gets to more size. And that will be part of our Financial Analyst Day conversation when we get to that in June. Perfect. Thanks, Lisa. Thank you, Harlan. Thank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over for any further or closing comments. Everyone, thank you very much for joining us for our fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings call. We appreciate your support of our company and look forward to seeing you again soon. As a reminder, we will have our Financial Analyst Day this year on June 9th. Thank you, everyone. Have a great day. Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.","this conference call is being recorded . it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Laura Graves, corporate vice president of Investor Relations . the call will be replayed via webcast on our website .",1.0

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]
As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It’s now my pleasure to turn the call over to Laura Graves, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations. Laura, please go ahead. Thank you. And welcome to AMD’s first quarter 2022 financial results conference call. By now you should have had the opportunity to review a copy of our earnings press release and accompanying slides. If you have not reviewed these documents, they can be found on the Investor Relations page of amd.com.
Today we will discuss AMD first quarter results including partial quarter contributions from the acquisition of Xilinx, which closed of February 14, 2022. We will also discuss AMD results on a standalone basis for the first quarter of 2022.
We will refer primarily to non-GAAP financial measures during this call. The full non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliations are available in today’s press release and in the slides posted on our website.
Participants on today’s conference call are Dr. Lisa Su, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and Devinder Kumar, our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Victor Peng, President of AMD’s Adaptive and Embedded Computing Group, will join us for Q&A. This is a live call and will be replayed via webcast on our website.
Before we begin, I would like to note AMD will host its 2022 Financial Analyst Day on Thursday, June 9th, and our second quarter quiet time is expected to begin at the close of business on Friday, June 17th.
Today’s discussion contains forward-looking statements based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of today, and as such, involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statement in our press release for more information on factors that could cause actual results to differ.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Lisa Su. Lisa? Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. For the last several years, we have been on a journey to both scale and transform AMD. We have consistently executed our strategy, expanded our portfolio of leadership products and diversified our business, all while driving best-in-class growth.
We reached a significant inflection point in our journey during the first few months of 2022, as we took several major steps that fundamentally reshape our business. In addition to delivering record financial results, we closed our strategic acquisition of Xilinx and announced our plans to acquire Pensando.
The strategic importance of the Xilinx acquisition to our long-term goals cannot be overstated. As the industry’s number one provider of FPGA and adaptive computing solutions, Xilinx significantly expands our technology and product portfolio.
Xilinx also adds multiple high-margin long-term revenue streams spending a new set of markets and customers, further strengthening and diversifying our business model. Importantly, Xilinx has successfully executed its own growth strategy in recent years with the increased adoption of adaptive silicon across data center, communications, automotive and other large Embedded markets.
With Pensando, we will further expand our data center solutions capabilities. Pensando will add a proven team that has developed an industry-leading DPU and software stack already deployed with key customers including IBM, HPE, Microsoft, Oracle and Goldman Sachs.
Pensando’s differentiated technology further expands our product portfolio and will enable AMD to innovate at the silicon, software and platform levels to deliver leadership solutions for our cloud, enterprise and edge customers.
Now turning to our first quarter financial performance, we started the year very strong with record quarterly revenue and net income. First quarter revenue, including the contributions from six weeks of Xilinx grew 71% year-over-year to a record $5.9 billion. We expanded gross margin 7 percentage points to 53% and more than doubled both operating and net income year-over-year.
Excluding Xilinx, revenue grew 55% year-over-year to a record $5.3 billion, gross margin expanded 5 percentage points to 51% and operating income more than doubled to a record $1.6 billion.
Turning to our Computing and Graphics segment, revenue increased 33% year-over-year to $2.8 billion, driven primarily by the ramp of our latest Ryzen and Radeon products. Client compute revenue grew by strong double-digit percentage based on higher Ryzen mobile and desktop processor sales. As a result, we believe we gained client processor revenue share for the eighth straight quarter.
In Desktop, we expanded our processor portfolio with the introduction of seven new Ryzen CPUs including the Ryzen 5800X3D, which is the industry’s fastest gaming CPU and first desktop processor featuring 3D stack triplets.
In Notebooks, record mobile processor revenue was driven by the launch of our Rembrandt Ryzen 6000 mobile processors that extend the leadership compute, gaming and battery life capabilities of our mobile processors.
In Commercial, we recently introduced our latest Ryzen 6000 PRO processors with leadership performance and battery life and modern security and manageability features. We are well positioned to accelerate our growth in commercial notebooks in 2022 based on the expanded number of design wins on track to launch.
Although, the PC market is experiencing some softness coming off multiple quarters of near-record unit shipments, our focus remains on the premium, gaming and commercial portions of the market where we see strong growth opportunities and we expect to continue gaining overall client revenue share.
In Graphics, revenue grew by a strong double-digit percentage year-over-year, with record desktop graphics channel sales. Desktop GPU sales nearly doubled year-over-year, as sales of our Radeon 6000 series graphics cards were strong. In Mobile, the first notebooks featuring our latest Radeon 6000 mobile GPUs launched in the quarter, and we expect sales to ramp over the coming quarters.
Data center graphics revenue was flat year-over-year as you launched our Instinct MI210 accelerators. We expanded our engagements with large cloud customers in the quarter and launched our ROCm 5.0 software suite targeting exoscale-class, HPC and AI applications.
Turning to our Enterprise Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, revenue increased 88% year-over-year to $2.5 billion, driven by record server, Semi-Custom and Embedded processor sales. Semi-Custom sales grew by a significant double-digit percentage year-over-year based on strong demand for Sony and Microsoft consoles, as well as Valve’s new Steam Deck. Sales for this game console generation continued to outpace all prior generations and we expect 2022 to be a record year for our Semi-Custom business.
Turning to our Embedded business, revenue more than doubled year-over-year led by growth in automotive. We also secured multiple design wins in next-generation security and firewall devices from Tier 1 networking providers.
Turning to Server, we had another record quarter as revenue more than doubled year-over-year and increased by a double-digit percentage sequentially. We have more than doubled Server processor revenue year-over-year in eight of the last 10 quarters, highlighting the growing demand for our EPYC processors with cloud enterprise and HPC customers.
Cloud revenue more than doubled year-over-year as hyperscalers expanded their internal infrastructure deployments, and 70 new AMD-powered instances launched from Alibaba, Amazon, Baidu Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Google and others. There are now more than 460 AMD-based cloud instances available from the largest hyperscalers, with additional instances on track to launch in the coming quarters.
In Enterprise, revenue more than doubled year-over-year with strong growth in key verticals including IT infrastructure, financial services and database applications. Our sales pipeline continues to be very strong and we saw our win rate grow in the first quarter across a broad set of Enterprise end customers.
We launched our first EPYC processors with 3D stacked chiplets in the quarter. This technology extends our performance leadership in technical computing workloads by up to 66% compared to our prior generation. Atos, Cisco, Dell, HPE, Lenovo and Supermicro all launched Servers featuring the new CPUs in the quarter.
Excitement for our next-generation Genoa server processors continued to grow, as we expanded customer and partnering sampling in the quarter. We expect Genoa will be the industry’s highest performance general-purpose server CPU, further extending the performance, energy efficiency and TCO advantages of our EPYC processors.
We remain on track to launch Genoa in the second half of the year and expect to continue our share gain trajectory based on expanded cloud, enterprise and HPC customer adoption. In addition, development of our higher core count Bergamo processors optimized for high-throughput cloud workloads continues to progress well with shipments on track to begin in the first half of 2023.
Turning to the Xilinx business, for the six weeks following acquisition close, Xilinx revenue was $559 million. On a pro forma basis for the full quarter, Xilinx delivered its fourth straight quarter of greater than 20% year-over-year revenue growth and the second straight quarter of greater than $1 billion of revenue.
In Data Center, first quarter demand was led by expanded FPGA as a service and smartNIC deployments at Tier 1 hyperscalers, as well as low-latency network solutions with fintech companies.
We saw strength in Communications led by wired demand and access and optical transport. In wireless, Versal based 5G deployments continued ramping in multiple regions and we secured a strategic design win with a Tier 1 communications equipment provider to power their next-gen baseband solutions with the Versal ACAP solution.
We saw strong demand across the Xilinx Embedded markets led by record pro forma full quarter revenue in automotive, industrial, vision and healthcare and consumer. Looking forward, we see very strong demand across all the Xilinx end markets and are focused on increasing supply.
Turning to our integration work, in the first few months since close, we have seen tremendous excitement from our customers, partners and employees, and we expect to see significant product and revenue synergies.
We now have the best portfolio of high performance and adaptive computing engines in the industry, and we see multiple opportunities to leverage our expanded technology portfolio to deliver even stronger products.
As one example, we are integrating Xilinx’s differentiated AI engine across our CPU product portfolio to enable industry-leading inference capabilities, with the first products expected in 2023.
We have also identified significant additional revenue synergy opportunities with some of our largest customers, as we can now address a larger portion of their compute needs with our expanded product portfolio.
In summary, the start of 2022 is a significant inflection point for AMD, marked by record top and bottomline financial results, driven by our leadership product portfolio and strong execution and the close of our Xilinx acquisition. We have now delivered greater than 45% year-over-year revenue growth for seven straight quarters and increased net income by more than 60% year-over-year for the last ten quarters.
Based on higher AMD organic growth, as well as the addition of Xilinx with strong demand across multiple end markets, we now expect annual revenue to grow by approximately 60% year-over-year, up from approximately 31% growth we guided at the beginning of the year.
Longer term, I am incredibly excited about our additional growth opportunities as we add the Xilinx and Pensando teams. We now see a significantly larger TAM opportunity for AMD across a diverse set of end markets based on our broad a portfolio of leadership compute engines and expanded solutions capabilities. I look forward to sharing more about the products and technologies that will enable the next stage of our growth journey at Financial Analyst Day in June.
Now I’d like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our first quarter financial performance. Devinder? Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. The first quarter was an excellent start to the year with strong demand for our legacy products resulting in record quarterly revenue, continued gross margin expansion, record profitability and record cash flow generation. In addition, we are very pleased to have closed the Xilinx transaction and announced our intention to acquire Pensando.
First quarter consolidated revenue was $5.9 billion, up 71% from a year ago, driven by significant growth across all businesses and the inclusion of Xilinx revenue for the partial period. Excluding the Xilinx contribution, AMD revenue was $5.3 billion, up 55% from a year ago with Data Center revenue doubling year-over-year.
Gross margin was 53%, up 660 basis points from a year ago, driven by higher server processor revenue and high margin Xilinx revenue. Gross margin for AMD excluding Xilinx was 51%, up 480 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by higher Server processor revenue.
Operating expenses were $1.3 billion compared to $830 million a year ago as we increased investments in our long-term product roadmaps to support the future growth of our business. Operating income more than doubled from a year ago to a record $1.8 billion, up $1.1 billion, primarily driven by significant revenue growth and higher gross margin.
Operating margin was 31%, up from 22% a year ago. Net income was a record $1.6 billion, up $947 million from a year ago. Diluted earnings per share was $1.13 per share, compared to $0.52 per share a year ago.
Now turning to first quarter business segment results. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $2.8 billion, up 33% year-over-year, driven by higher client and graphics processor revenue. Computing and Graphics segment operating income was $723 million or 26% of revenue, compared to $485 million or 23% of revenue a year ago. The increase in operating income was driven primarily by higher revenue partially offset by higher operating expenses.
Enterprise Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue was $2.5 billion, up 88% from $1.3 billion in the prior year. The strong revenue increase was driven by higher Server, Semi-Custom and Embedded revenue.
EESC segment operating income grew significantly to $881 million or 35% of revenue compared to $277 million or 21% of revenue a year ago. The higher operating income and margin were driven by increased revenue, richer product mix and an $83 million licensing gain.
Xilinx revenue for the partial quarter was $559 million with operating income of $233 million or 42% of revenue. On a pro forma basis for the full quarter, Xilinx generated over $1 billion of revenue, up 22% compared to a year ago, with growth across all Xilinx major end market categories. We are on track to achieve our cost synergy goals for the acquisition and expect the addition of Xilinx to be accretive to non-GAAP earnings per share for 2022.
Turning to the balance sheet, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $6.5 billion at the end of the first quarter. We deployed $1.9 billion to repurchase common stock in the first quarter. To-date, we have utilized $3.7 billion of our initial $4 billion stock repurchase program. We also announced a new $8 billion share repurchase program during the quarter. In total we had $8.3 billion in remaining authorization at the end of the first quarter.
Quarterly free cash flow was a record $924 million, compared to $832 million in the same quarter last year and $736 million in the prior quarter.
We successfully executed a five-year $3 billion sustainability-linked credit facility to replace our existing $500 million facility. This further demonstrates our commitment to our corporate ESG goals. Inventory was $2.4 billion, up $436 million from the prior quarter due to the addition of Xilinx inventory.
Before I turn to our financial outlook, let me cover our financial segment reporting. Beginning with the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we plan to change our segment reporting to the following four segments, Data Center, Client, Gaming and Embedded, which will align our financial reporting with our strategic end markets. I look forward to sharing further details with you at our Financial Analyst Day.
Today’s outlook is based on current expectations and contemplates the current global supply environment and customer demand signals. For the second quarter of 2022, we expect revenue to be approximately $6.5 billion, plus or minus $200 million, an increase of approximately 69% year-over-year and approximately 10% quarter-over-quarter.
The year-over-year increase is expected to be driven by the addition of Xilinx revenue plus higher Server, Semi-Custom and Client revenue. The quarter-over-quarter increase is expected to be primarily driven by Xilinx revenue plus higher server revenue.
In addition for Q2 2022, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 54%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.56 billion or 24% of revenue, non-GAAP interest expense taxes and other to be approximately $270 million based on a 13% effective tax rate and the diluted share count to be approximately 1.64 billion shares. For the full year 2020, we now expect revenue to be approximately $26.3 billion, an increase of approximately 60% driven by Xilinx and higher Server and Semi-Custom revenue.
We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 54%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately 24% of revenue, non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 13%, and non-GAAP cash tax to be approximately 10% due primarily to U.S. tax requirement to capitalize R&D and the full utilization of our U.S. net operating losses and tax credits in 2022. Fiscal year 2022 will be a 53-week year and include an additional week in the fourth quarter.
In closing, we had an excellent start to 2022 with strong revenue growth across all businesses. We are pleased to have completed the Xilinx acquisition, which strengthens our business model with revenue diversification, accretive gross margin and increased cash generation. We are very delighted to welcome the Xilinx team to AMD.
Looking ahead, AMD is very well-positioned for long-term growth, margin expansion and cash generation, driven by our leadership products and roadmaps.
With that, I will turn the call back over to Laura to begin the Q&A portion of our call. Laura? Thank you very much, Devinder. Operator, we are ready to go ahead and begin our first question. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Matt Ramsay from Cowen. Your line is now live. Thank you very much, everybody. Good afternoon. Congratulations Lisa on obviously getting Xilinx closed and the strong results. I guess there’s a lot going on from a macro perspective in the markets that you serve and then the supply chains Lisa. So, I mean, the first half of the year I think you doing kind of 54%, 55% organic growth in the first quarter. Maybe you could talk me through a bit the puts and takes in the quarter. I think there’s a perception that you have additional supply coming online. There’s obviously supply constraints and lockdowns in China, your server business doing extraordinarily well in the numbers that you just printed and then maybe some perception of the softening in the PC market. So there’s a lot going on and I kind of love you to walk me through the puts and takes for the quarter if you could? Thank you. Yeah. Absolutely, Matt. Thanks for the question. So we did have a very strong first quarter. There is a lot going on without a doubt in the business. I would say, if you look at the strength in our business in the first quarter, it was really broad-based.
So, very, very strong server results. We continue to gain share, we continue to bring more supply online. There also are very strong results in our Semi-Custom or game console business, as well as in the client and graphics businesses.
There is some softness in the PC market, but we had for the last number of quarters actually been shifting our mix to the higher end or the more premium segments of the PC market. And so that’s where more of our exposure is.
And we actually saw a significant growth in our PC business sequentially as we started ramping our Ryzen 6000 notebooks and that resulted in strong ASP growth, as well as just our key market segments of Premium, Commercial and Gaming being covered there.
As we go forward, obviously, all of the things that you talked about are in play. That being the case, I think, we have managed through the supply situations very well. We continue to work with our customers and ensure that we are optimizing our builds to their build and with the addition of Xilinx we also have another set of end markets that have very strong demand that are all additive to our business. Yeah. Thank you for that, Lisa. I appreciate all the color. I guess as my follow-up question I wanted to examine the full year guidance that you have given. Obviously, it includes Xilinx, so it’s a little bit apples and oranges from last year. But I think in the press release you guys mentioned that you expect some upside from the original 31% organic growth guidance. If you have any comments on magnitude there that would be helpful? And then I think just what investors would love to hear from you is maybe your view on the Data Center CapEx spending environment and also on the PC market. I think you guys have been maybe a bit more conservative than some of your competition in your market commentary about PCs maybe being flattish coming into this year. I imagine there some new puts and takes to that. So just some thoughts on how you guys constructed the guidance for the year especially relative to the original 31% would be really helpful? Thank you very much. Yeah. So lots of questions in there, Matt. So, but let me try to go through them. So first on the full year 2022 guide, it is a significant increase in guidance, up 60%. There are a couple pieces to that. On the organic side of the AMD business, we originally guided up 31% based on what we saw in the market in January.
As we look at the market now and our own sort of customer and supply situation, we see that organic growth higher into the mid-30%s. That’s primarily driven by very strong demand in our server business, very strong demand in our console or Semi-Custom business, additional supply coming online.
We have taken a bit more of a conservative perspective on the PC market. Again, I think the softness is in certain parts of the market, it’s not in all parts of the market and our focus is on where we add the most value in the market and that is in the Premium segments.
In terms of the Xilinx piece of it, the full year addition of three and a half quarters of Xilinx is a significant add. On a pro forma basis, the Xilinx business is also growing very well and it’s growing sort of like in the low 20%s if you consider full-year compared to calendar year 2021.
So, overall, I think, we have a broad base set of growth drivers and multiple levers for growth as we go through the year and we continue to work on -- working with our customers on where the demand is and ensuring that we are satisfying that demand. I appreciate the color, Lisa. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. Thank you for taking the question and congrats on the strong results and completing the acquisition as well. I had two questions myself. I guess first on the supply chain situation, Lisa, obviously, there’s a lot going on in terms of wafer supply and substrates and now the China lockdowns. What are some of the bigger pain points for you and to the extent the China lockdowns are impacting your business directly or indirectly, are you assuming any impact to revenue and profitability in the second quarter? Sure. Toshiya, thanks for the question. On the supply environment, we have been working on this really for the last 18 months. We have made a lot of progress on both the wafer side and significant investments on the substrates. I would say that, we continue to get sort of very good support from our suppliers. That’s one of the reasons we can increase our guidance the way it is.
From an overall, you mentioned the China COVID situation. From our standpoint, we haven’t had any significant impact on our own shipments and our own supply chain. We have been working with some customers that have had some customer build delays and that is contemplated in our second quarter guidance.
We are going to continue to work on supply optimization with the addition of Xilinx, some of the, let’s call it, more mature notes, 16-nanometer and above wafer supply is still somewhat constrained. We are working with sort of the larger scale of AMD to try to bring more supply on board there, as well as continuing to ramp our overall capacity to support a very strong next few quarters. Hopefully, that answered your supply questions. Yeah. For sure. Thank you. And then my second question, my follow-up question was on the Data Center business. It’s great to hear that you have decided to re-segment your business. So thank you for that. I am curious how meaningful Data Center was as a percentage of revenue in the quarter, Server CPU, Data Center GPU and now FPGAs from Xilinx. And I guess more importantly, how are you thinking about the medium- to long-term opportunity in both your classic Data Center GPU business, as well as the FPGA business. I think in Data Center GPU, you mentioned that it was flat in the quarter, but you also talked about being engaged with more cloud customers, so curious what you are seeing there. And then on the FPGA side, I think, Victor and team, prior to the deal announcement, was pretty vocal about the long-term growth opportunity there as well. So any update from your perspective would be great. Thank you. Right. Okay. So, again, a few pieces to that. Let me try to give you some color and then maybe Victor will add on the FPGA side. So in terms of, yes, we are going to change our segment reporting, as Devinder said, as of the second quarter to be -- to give you more alignment to the markets.
In terms of this quarter for the pieces that you mention on higher revenues, the data center for those pieces was, let’s call it, low 20s percentage of our overall revenue. And then in terms of the longer term Data Center picture, we are incredibly excited about the opportunity in Data Center.
When you look at the pieces we have for now, I mean, the CPU franchise is very strong, continuing to get stronger. We are excited with how Genoa looks and how Bergamo looks and sort of the engagements with customers there. We are excited about the GPU portfolio as well.
GPUs for us are a longer-term sort of roadmap, similar to what we did on the CPU side. We had been more focused on, let’s call it, supercomputing and HPC, so that was strong for us last year and that’s why we are flattish year-on-year. We are very engaged on the AI front now continuing our investments in our software stack and working with cloud guys to optimize our software stack.
And then moving onto FPGAs and then also our adaptive SoCs and then the Pensando acquisition. I think what we now have is just an incredibly strong portfolio when we are dealing with whether you are talking about the largest cloud hyperscalers or you are talking about enterprise and then with Pensando and Xilinx, it also gives us exposure to the edge as well.
And so we have all the compute engines and are able to optimize that. So I think you should expect to hear a lot more from us in the Data Center certainly at our Financial Analyst Day, but really strong opportunities there. Maybe, Victor, you want to add on some of that? Yeah. I think you covered well. The only thing I would add is just again I think not only do we have a really broad portfolio of all the compute engines, but we are doubling down on the networking side, right, since we have strength in that and smartNIC and then with Pensando the kind of solutions that we could provide to customers in the overall infrastructure, right? It’s not about point things. It’s about the total solution.
And as you probably know, scale-out in just a lot of these applications, you could be throttled by the network. So we really can optimize all this. And the customers really want optimizes customized solutions, and I think, that’s what we could do with both the former Xilinx, smartNIC, as well as Pensando even going further. Thank you for all the details. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Thanks for taking my question. Lisa, my first one is on the server market. Milan helped you take and continues to help you take a lot of share in the market. I am curious, what’s the state of play in front of the next-gen Genoa versus the Sapphire Rapids server cycle from two perspectives? First, just from the industry adoption of DDR5, can that be a bottleneck to adoption of these next-generation servers? And second perspective is that you will have two different flavors of Genoa with the cloud optimized version coming later. So just give us your sense of how this next generation cycle plays out versus the very strong success you had been in Malan so far? Yeah. Absolutely, Vivek. So the way I think about it is the data center market and particularly in servers, people are getting much more optimized for workloads and so there are different flavors and we see that even in Milan today with Milan and our Milan-X, X3D or the X3D we introduced.
And so I think it’s natural for these solutions to sit side-by-side. I think as you go into Genoa, the next-generation platform, we would expect, again, the adoption -- there’s a lot of excitement on Genoa and there’s a lot of customer demand for Genoa. I do expect that Genoa will sit again side-by-side with Milan for quite some time, because you are not going to move the infrastructure instantaneously over.
And then when you think about Bergamo, which is the cloud optimized, I think, that will be more specific for specific large hyperscalers who have the need for, let’s call it, a more performance per dollar, performance per watt solution. So the way to think about this, Vivek, is as our business has grown, we can invest more broadly and that will give us just a more optimized solution for our customer’s TAMs. Very helpful. And then, Lisa, my second question. I have two or three interrelated questions on the PC market. So what is your new sense of what the PC TAM can be this year versus what you thought before? And then I think as part of that, your competitors have mentioned several times they are back in the market with Alder Lake and they are taking a lot of share. So I am wondering what you have seen there. And then, finally, what’s your share of the Commercial market today versus what it was last year? So, just something on TAM competition and Commercial exposure? Thank you. Sure. So, Vivek, when we kind of started the year, we were thinking that the PC TAM could be flat to, let’s call it, down, let’s call it, low mid-single digits. I think given how we have started this year and then some of the other things in the market, we are taking a more conservative approach to the PC TAM.
So for our modeling for the full year guidance we are modeling something like down high-single digits. Now a lot of things can happen between now and then. So I would say that I think that’s a good place for us to model.
Within that, we have always been very focused on where we can add the most value and the Premium segments. Ryzen 6000, our Rembrandt product is extremely well positioned from a battery life or performance standpoint. We have a number of Commercial very good systems that are in the process of being launched. I think we are excited about that.
To your question about Commercial share, we are still underrepresented in the Commercial market and we know that, and that’s a focus area for us. I think, overall, from a market share standpoint, we believe we are focused in the right segments and so even under the backdrop of, let’s call it, a softer PC market that we will -- we can continue to expect to gain revenue share in the process and that’s sort of our overall strategy.
So I think the other piece of it is, we have so many levers in the business now as we go forward. I think the strength in the business is really looking at the overall Data Center portfolio, the PC portfolio, the Gaming portfolio and the Xilinx portfolio together. There are lots of levers for growth, and as we go through this year, we see that being very helpful. Thank you, Lisa. Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your line is now live. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one, I wanted to ask about data centers. So it more than doubled last year, more than doubled again this quarter. Do you guys have the supply available to double that business again for the full year, like if you can get and I guess if the supply is there, do you think it can be fulfilled? Yeah. So, Stacy, I think, the data center business, particularly the Server CPU business, continues to be very strong for us. I am not going to proclaim a certain will it double every quarter. I can say that we expect to grow very strongly over the next few quarters.
And we are continuing to bring on additional supply to do that. The demand is there and it really is about continuing to work with our customers on that. But I think our confidence level in Data Center growth is very high. Thank you. For my follow up, I wanted to ask just a quick question on PC. So in the context of the PC market TAM that you see down our modeling, down high-single digits, given your mix shifts and your share gains, do think you can actually grow your client revenues year-over-year in 2022 for the full year? Yes, Stacy. We are expecting that we will grow client revenues on a year-over-year basis in that time environment and we continue to mix shift to, let’s call it, the more Premium segments and so it’s a revenue share statement. Got it. But it’s fair to say much more of year-over-year revenue growth is things like Servers and putting Xilinx aside for a minute, Data Center and Servers and consoles more than client? Yes. That is true. But our expectation though is, we have a number of growth drivers in the business, but in terms of what has allowed us to increase the full year guide from an organic standpoint, it is a strong visibility in Server, strong visibility on the console side, strong visibility just from an overall supply and demand perspective. Got it. Thank you so much. Thank you. Next question is coming from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Yeah. Thanks for taking the questions. I will stick to two if I can. I guess my first question as we think about the Server market and your share gains, but more importantly, we also think about the proliferation or expansion of the product portfolio. I am curious just what you are seeing from a competitive perspective and your thoughts around continuing to mix higher in terms of the Server market thinking about the blended ASP trends in your Server business. How should we think about that as we think about Milan-X, Genoa, I guess Bergamo thereafter, just that trend looking forward? Yeah. So, Aaron, obviously it depends on the mix between Cloud and Enterprise, but in general as we offer more value, let’s call it, more performance, more capability, we would expect our ASP to mix up and in any given quarter, it’s more of what is the Cloud versus Enterprise mix.
But, look, I am very pleased with the fact that we are growing both Cloud and Enterprise very substantially. So I think that tells you that we are growing it across the entire Server market and we are going to continue to, let’s call it, optimize products so that one of our customers get more capability and we get more value for our technology. Yeah. And then the second quick question is, on the capacity discussion, I am curious as you bring Xilinx into the model. You scale the business going forward. How could we think about flexibility from a perspective of capacity? If PC slow down, can your capacity be fungible and move that capacity over to Servers or even Xilinx capacity into Server CPUs? I am just curious of how we should think about that ability to mix across product segments as you think about your wafer capacity agreements. Yeah. Aaron, the way to think about that is, so both the Xilinx portfolio and sort of the organic AMD portfolio do use TSMC. So we are complementary there as our primary wafer supplier. We use very similar substrate suppliers as well.
The Xilinx portfolio tends to be on more mature nodes although there is some 7-nanometer of the majority of the portfolio is on 60-nanometer and above. So I would say, there’s not much fungibility there. However, on the backend, on the substrate side, there is very good fungibility across the portfolio.
And from the standpoint of overall supply, I think, you have heard from Devinder, we have invested significantly over the last 18 months in sort of securing the supply capacity and we are seeing it come online and that’s again what I’d like to do is as you see it come online that’s when it will go into our revenue forecast.
But I feel very good about the progress that we are making and we are continued to dimension the company for just a much larger business and so it’s a lot of supply that we are bringing online. And we are working very much with Victor and his team as well, because he has strong backlog and strong demand and we are looking to use all of the AMD assets to also accelerate some of his builds. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. Good afternoon and congratulations on the solid results in closing the acquisition. Lisa, the team has done a great job of supporting all the major enterprise workloads on your latest generation EPYC and driving strong winds on the enterprise side with all of the OEM Server guides out there. I am just wondering, how much of the strength in the Server business is being driven by the strong Enterprise design win traction? And given your pipeline of wins and orders, how big will Enterprise be as a percent of your Server business maybe exiting this year? Yeah. So -- Harlan, thanks. So we have made great progress on the Cloud side, so we have strong adoption on internal, as well as external-facing workloads. We have also made strong progress on the enterprise. I mean, as you said, all major OEMs have EPYC throughout the portfolio.
And in this past quarter, and in general, we have grown the Enterprise business about at the same pace as the Cloud business. We are still Cloud-weighted, but I believe that it’s going to be fairly balanced growth across both portfolios. Perfect. And then maybe a question for you or for Victor, but when I think about the Embedded markets, auto, industrial, aerospace and defense, comm, infrastructure, consumer, just given the strong market position here by Xilinx, I mean, they are in a good position to catalyze. EPYC’s attached to catalyze. Ryzen attached to their FPGA solution. So maybe Victor can help us understand like what percentage of Xilinx FPGA solutions in the Embedded market sits next to either an x86 or high-performance ARM processor, because I think that the processor opportunity in Embedded is much larger than the FPGA opportunity and I believe that Embedded is a pretty small percentage of overall business for AMD, so pretty big opportunity, but wanted to get your views. Yeah. Maybe I will take this one. I agree with you actually. One of the things of the many things that’s really exciting since we joined AMD is we have done some customer visits and they are really excited about exactly that point.
We have a broader portfolio in processors and even in some areas in the GPUs is also of great interest. The Embedded business at AMD has been selling APUs and Embedded versions of both the Server, as well as the Client kind of products.
And now with the FPGAs and the adaptive SoCs we have, we really can give a much more complete solution. And so that is differently on the menu of things in terms of revenue synergies which we will discuss more at the Financial Analyst Day. But we are really excited about what we have even with the existing products and then we are really working on our roadmap for creating more value going forward. So it’s a great observation. Great. Thank you. Thanks, Harlan. Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Lisa, I think, maybe an easier way for investors to have thought about AMD historically, particular more recently is, you have been successful in delivering Server CPUs for data processing in the Data Center. And I think people or at least I have, thought about Xilinx historically doing networking and communications solutions for base stations, as well as Data Centers, and they have kind of moved into this adaptive computing mode where they are doing more data processing also. And I wonder, you have seen other companies with general-purpose computing solutions kind of add a communications capability. And I am wondering, is there an opportunity for more data processing at the network edge, like say at the base station where Xilinx has historically been really strong? And do you think the solutions, the architecture that you would have at the base station for the combination of data and communications network processing, do think that ultimately looks very similar to what you see deep in the hyperscale Data Centers deep in the Cloud? Yeah. Sure, Mark. So I think the answer is, yes, and maybe I will generalize it a bit more. We are a big believer. I mean, the whole strategy behind AMD is to have the best sort of compute engines and then put them together sort of in solutions for specific end markets.
So I think our CPUs, GPUs, the FPGAs, the adaptive SoCs and then the DPU that we are adding from Pensando give us just a tremendous range of capability. So to your specific question and sort of Comms Infrastructure, I definitely think there’s a strong opportunity there. As Victor mentioned, we have been to a number of our joint large customers, and there is absolute interest in trying to put these solutions together.
And more broadly though, I think what we see in terms of growth going forward that there will be more customization around solutions for large -- for these large customers, whether it’s Cloud customers or large telcos or even some edge opportunities. And having these compute engines will allow us to basically optimize those solutions together. So we look forward to telling you sort of a lot more about sort of how we are thinking about these roadmaps as we go into our financial Analyst Day in June. And a follow up, if I may. How -- as you develop those more customized solutions for your larger customers, how important is it to have your own software ecosystem versus to kind of pull everything together versus to kind of rely more on the open source community or other players for that software layer to sit on top of that? That’s all I had. Thank you. Yes. Mark, so the software is very, very important. And software across all of those engines is important and Xilinx comes with a very strong software stack. We have our own software stack. You will see is unify that and that will be an important part of our roadmap going forward.
And to your open-source point, we do believe in open-source. We think collaboration is an important part of the ecosystem as well. So, all of those are things that we are working on to provide more complete solutions for our customers. Great. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Congrats on the strong quarter and closing the Xilinx deal. Lisa, just a lot of moving parts, you have said that a bunch of times, so forgive me if I dive into them a little bit. As we think about your second quarter guide, I just wanted to get some of the moving parts that you are assuming there. Take out the Xilinx side or just give you the full quarter of and the little bit of guidance there. It looks like the core AMD is growing low-single digits sequentially. You have mentioned about the PC side seeing some weakness. You have talked about that a bunch and then the strength on the Server on the Semi-Custom side. So any sort of color about the puts and takes to get you that organic growth? Yeah. Sure. Ross, thanks for the question. So for the second quarter in particular, the second quarter guide is driven by sort of one is the full quarter of the Xilinx business and strength in our server business primarily as we see the second quarter.
There are other puts and takes, I would call them, on the smaller side of that. If you recall, I mean if you think about whether you think about the PC business or the gaming business, they tend to be more second half-weighted, so the second quarter doesn’t tend to be a strong quarter for those businesses and so that’s not the driver of the sequential increase. Perfect. And I guess a similar question, a perfect segue in your answer there, when I think about the full year guide, obviously, incredibly impressive. You talked about the organic increases. It looks like, especially with that extra week, that you are kind of going up low or mid-to-high single digits in one of those quarters and kind of flattish after that just to get to the full year. So similar sort of question. What are the puts and takes there? Is the PC seasonality something you are kind of leaning against a little bit relative to the high single-digit drop you have talked about where you guys will still grow but maybe not as fast as in years past given that backdrop or is there something else that plateaus out in the second half? I am not sure that I see a quote-unquote plateau, Ross, so I wouldn’t say that. What I would say though is if I give you sort of the puts and takes of the second half of the year, that the -- again, we expect that the server business will continue to grow, as we said, good visibility there. We expect the console business to grow in the second half versus first half also. That’s typical seasonality.
Typical seasonality in PCs would also have the second half higher than the first half. I think we are modeling for a little bit sub seasonal, just given sort of all the puts and takes in the market there. And then we expect the Xilinx business to also grow in the second half as more supply comes online given the strong demand.
So if you see all those pieces, I don’t think there’s a plateau. I think it’s a continued improvement as we see, one, strong demand and also more supply coming online in the second half of the year. Thanks for that and apologies for the plateau word. No one ever apologizes to me. So that’s really nice, Ross. Operator, we will take two more questions please. Certainly. Our next question is coming from Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your line is now live. Thanks a lot. My first question is really around Semi-Custom. The rest of the business has been asked quite a bit. So I guess my question on Semi-Custom is, Lisa, do think that it can be a $4 billion business this year? It sounds like it could get pretty close maybe to get there? And I guess also as part of that question, I think, you were thinking next year would be an up year also for Semi-Custom. But given some of the consumer uncertainty, do you still think that it can be up next year? And then I had a second question. Thanks. Yeah. Sure, Tim. So without going into the exact numbers, I would say, the Semi-Custom business is a strong growth driver. We have -- we work with these customers very closely. We have good views of where they think the demand is.
We are still in a place, if you were to look into the retail channel, you would say that the demand is underserved today in the Semi-Custom business and their real build is towards holiday. So the answer is we do believe that Semi-Custom will be at a record for us this year. We have more content. We also have the Valve Steam Deck that also has gotten very strong reviews and is ramping as we go into the second half of the year.
And then on 2023, I do believe that 2023 will be another strong year for Semi-Custom and would be up. And again, if you look at the history of these ramps, it’s really around the fourth year that you see -- that you really see the business kind of hit its peak.
In addition to that, just knowing some of the game releases that are -- from a software standpoint that are coming out, there are -- there is -- obviously there’s a good line of software also and [ph] expected strong lineup as we go forward. So, yes, that’s our current view of the Semi-Custom business. Thanks a lot. And I guess just following up on the overall Server market, I know that you are not the best read, because you are gaining so much market share. But there have been some comments from some of the big cloud customers about quote, moderating or slowing investments and there is some debate about does that mean that there’s going to be some slowdown in procurement of servers. So if you strip out your sort of share gain, I am curious of your assessment on just overall strength in the Data Center market. Do you see it slowing at all later on this year or even into next year? Thanks. I would say, Tim, we haven’t seen that. We haven’t seen that particular phenomena. What we do see is that there needs to be good planning. So good planning with our Server customers and our large cloud customers and we are doing that. And our planning extends beyond 2022, extends into 2023 as well, and from what we can see, it’s robust demand. Thank you so much. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Brett Simpson from Arete Research. Your line is now live. Yeah. Thanks very much. Lisa, I wanted to get your perspective on the AI silicon markets and you have obviously focused on HPC with MI200, and you have got CPU roadmap on the server side that’s a big host processor for AI. But can you share with us how we should think about AMD in the next sort of two years, three years around areas like AI training, areas like inference, particularly with the GPU portfolio, MI300, et cetera? And when do you think this platform is really going to be able to sort of compete and win in the AI training and inference space? Thank you. Yeah. Absolutely. Let me start, Brett, and then I will ask Victor to also make some comments. No question, AI is a huge opportunity for us and it’s one where we are thinking about it very holistically in terms of how we address.
So on the Server CPU side, a lot of inference is done on the server CPU side. We have been investing in that area. On the GPU side for both training and inference, there, a lot of it is around the software stack and so our focus is on optimizing our software stack with our large cloud customers and partners.
And then what Xilinx brings to our portfolio is actually a lot of capability on the AI inference side in their current portfolio and then additive to the AMD portfolio. So I think you will see a much broader set of offerings from us in AI as we start talking about sort of the broader product roadmaps. And maybe, Victor, you want to give some more? Yeah. I mean, look, we have been -- we have this AI engine that is already deploying in production in a number of Embedded applications and endpoints in also edge devices like in cars.
They are doing a lot of image recognition, all kinds of inference applications and that same architecture can be scaled and brought into the CPU product portfolio and as we have alluded to that, it’s exactly our plan.
We are also in a moment ago is a succession around software. We are absolutely working on the unified overall software enabled the broad portfolio, but also especially in AI. So you will hear more about that at the Financial Analyst Day but we are definitely going to be leaning in AI both inference and training.
And I would say end-to-end, because we have endpoints, we have edge devices, both computing and embedded devices, and in the cloud and enterprise. So we are very excited about that revenue synergy opportunity actually. Brett, did you have a follow up? Great. And -- yeah. Thanks, Laura. Yeah. Just as a follow-up, in terms of AMD from a Software monetization perspective, you are obviously seeing big changes in the way you are dressing Software. You are moving up the software stack, do a high level of abstraction. Is this somewhere you think over the next two or three years, do you plan to charge for Software? And can you share with us maybe how you might think about AMD as a Software business going forward? Thank you. Yeah. I think, Brett, maybe it’s a broader conversation about our overall Software strategy. But as Victor mentioned, the unified Software capabilities around AI are very, very important. We also have with the acquisition of Pensando, they have a very strong Software team and effort around their GPUs and what we can do there.
So I think as a total, you should see us investing a lot more in Software. And then in terms of the monetization and stuff, I think, we can address that more as we think about the overall solution space that will be offering across all of these compute engines. And again, much more --- great conversation that we can have as we come into our Financial Analyst Day in June. Thank you, Lisa. And as a reminder to everyone on the call, Financial Analyst Day will be on Thursday, June the 9th. We look forward to having you there. We will also be webcast from our website.

With that, I will hand the call over to Lisa Su. Lisa? Thank you, Laura and good afternoon to all those listening in today. This was an excellent quarter for our business as we delivered record revenue and profitability based on our strong execution, leadership product portfolio and diversified business model. Each of our segments grew significantly year-over-year, led by higher data center and embedded sales as we continue expanding our presence across a broader set of markets and customers. Revenue grew 70% year-over-year to a record $6.6 billion. We also expanded gross margin 6 percentage points year-over-year to 54% and set records for operating and net income, both of which more than doubled from the prior year.
Turning to the business results. Starting in the second quarter, we updated our financial segment reporting to align with our four strategic end markets: Data Center, Client, Gaming and Embedded. Let me start with our Data Center segment. Revenue increased 83% year-over-year and 15% sequentially to $1.5 billion, led by record server processor sales. EPYC processor demand was strong in the quarter, with significant year-over-year growth across both cloud and enterprise customers. In cloud, more than 60 new instances powered by third-gen EPYC processors launched in the quarter from AWS, Baidu, Google, Microsoft Azure and Oracle, including the industry’s first cloud-based software-as-a-service solution for chip design from Microsoft Azure and Synopsys, powered by our Milan-X processors with 3D stacked triplets.
In enterprise, OEM adoption accelerated in the quarter as Dell, HPE, Lenovo, Super Micro, Cisco and others brought tailored solutions to market that deliver leadership performance and TCO across many enterprise workloads. Recent examples include Lenovo’s AMD-powered Think Systems, setting a price performance world record for transaction processing and AMD-based HPE ProLiant servers, delivering record-setting virtualization performance. We made progress further establishing our data center GPU footprint in the quarter, highlighted by the AMD-powered Frontier supercomputer, debuting in the number one spot on both the top 500 list of the world’s fastest supercomputers and the GREEN500 list of the most energy-efficient supercomputers.
I am extremely proud of our work with HPE and Oak Ridge National Laboratory to build the world’s first exascale supercomputer. Breaking the exa block barrier is a significant computing milestone and the fact that it was made possible by EPYC processors and Instinct accelerators, highlights AMD’s unique ability to push the envelope in computing further and faster than anyone else.
Looking at our broader data center opportunities, we saw strong growth year-over-year for our industry leading FPGA and networking products with cloud and financial customers. We closed our acquisition of Pensando in the quarter, further expanding our data center solutions capabilities with the addition of a world class team and an industry-leading DPU and software stack that complement our existing products. With the additions of Xilinx and Pensando, AMD now provides the industry’s broadest set of leadership compute engines and accelerators to enable the best performance, security, flexibility and TCO for leading edge data centers. Looking ahead, customer pull for our next-generation 5-nanometer generalist server CPU is very strong. We are on track to launch and ramp production of Genoa as the industry’s highest performance general-purpose server CPU later this year, positioning our data center business for continued growth and share gains.
Turning to our Client segment. Revenue grew 25% year-over-year to $2.2 billion based on record mobile processor sales. We believe we gained client processor revenue share for the ninth straight quarter led by strong adoption of our latest generation Ryzen mobile processors. Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo and others are on track to significantly expand their portfolio of AMD-based notebooks as they bring almost 300 new designs to market this year, powered by Ryzen processors.
We also saw strong demand in the quarter for our latest generation Ryzen Pro processors that deliver leadership performance and battery life for professional notebooks. Commercial client processor revenue grew significantly year-over-year as HP, Lenovo and others launched more than 50 AMD-based commercial notebooks and Dell announced its first AMD-based precision workstation. Looking ahead, we are on track to launch our all-new 5-nanometer Ryzen 7000 desktop processors and AM5 platforms later this quarter, with leadership performance in gaming and content creation. Taking a step back, while there has been additional softness in the PC market in recent months, we believe we are very well positioned to navigate through the current environment based on the strength of our existing product portfolio and upcoming product launches.
Now turning to our Gaming segment. Revenue increased 32% year-over-year to $1.7 billion as semi-custom growth more than offset a decline in gaming graphics sales. Semi-custom SoC sales continue outpacing the prior generation and we remain on track for record semi-custom annual revenue in 2022. Gaming graphics declined in the quarter as macro conditions impacted discretionary spending. New AMD Advantage gaming notebooks that combine Ryzen and Radeon processors to enable outstanding gaming experiences launched recently to strong reviews, highlighted by the Alienware M17 receiving multiple Editors’ Choice awards from leading industry publications. While we expect the gaming graphics market to be down in the third quarter, we remain focused on executing our GPU roadmap, including launching our high-end RDNA 3 GPUs later this year. Our next-generation RDNA 3 architecture is another major step forward for our graphics roadmap, delivering more than a 50% generational improvement in performance per watt by combining our most advanced gaming architecture with 5-nanometer triplet manufacturing.
Looking at our Embedded segment, revenue grew significantly year-over-year to $1.3 billion, led by robust demand across all markets and nodes for our FPGA and Adaptive Computing products. Xilinx products are deployed in virtually every market, powering mission-critical applications for thousands of customers. We accelerated Xilinx’s product sales in the second quarter with the benefit of the additional manufacturing scale and resources of AMD. We delivered record core markets revenue led by aerospace and defense, industrial vision and health and test and measurement. Communications growth was led by higher demand in wired from multiple Tier 1 system vendors, while wireless demand was driven by multiple ramping ORAN deployments in North America.
Embedded CPU revenue also grew significantly in the quarter based on higher automotive sales and the ramp of new networking and storage design wins. As we highlighted at our Financial Analyst Day in June, we have identified greater than $10 billion in long-term revenue synergy opportunities as we bring the AMD and Xilinx assets together. Our largest opportunity is in AI and we have already started executing new hardware and software roadmaps to capture the significant opportunity we see to drive pervasive AI across cloud, edge and endpoints.
In summary, our work over the last several years has placed AMD on a significant growth trajectory. AMD has never been stronger and the markets for our products have never been as large or diverse. As a result, we have now delivered eight straight quarters of record revenue as our strong execution and leadership products have driven increased adoption across an expanded set of markets and customers.
Despite the current macroeconomic environment, we see continued growth in the back half of the year, highlighted by our next-generation 5-nanometer product shipments and supported by our diversified business model. We remain laser focused on executing our product and technology roadmaps, further deepening our customer relationships and investing strategically across the company to drive our next phase of growth across the $300 billion high-performance and adaptive computing market.
Now I’d like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our second quarter financial performance. Devinder? Thank you, Lisa and good afternoon everyone. AMD reported excellent second quarter results. Strong demand for our leadership products drove record quarterly revenue and continued gross margin expansion. The second quarter includes the first full quarter of Xilinx’s financial results and we are pleased to have closed the acquisition of Pensando in the quarter.
Second quarter revenue was $6.6 million, up 70% from a year ago, driven by higher revenue across all segments and the inclusion of Xilinx revenue. Gross margin was 54%, up 640 basis points from a year ago, driven primarily by higher data center and embedded revenue. Operating expenses were $1.6 billion compared to $909 million a year ago as we continue to scale the company. Operating income more than doubled from a year ago to record $2.2 billion, driven by significant revenue growth and higher gross margin. Operating margin was 30%, up from 24% a year ago. Net income was a record $1.7 billion, up $929 million from a year ago. Earnings per share, was $1.05 per share compared to $0.63 per share a year ago.
Now, turning to our reportable segments. As previously communicated, we modified our segment reporting to align with our strategic end markets and the way we now manage the business. The Data Center segment includes server CPUs, data center GPUs, Pensando and Xilinx data center products. The Client segment includes desktop and notebook PC processors and chipsets, while the Gaming segment includes discrete graphic process and semi-custom game console products. The Embedded segment includes both AMD and Xilinx embedded products.
Starting with the Data Center segment. Revenue was $1.5 billion, up 83% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in third-generation EPYC server processor revenue. Data Center operating income was $472 million or 32% of revenue compared to $204 million or 25% a year ago. Higher operating income was driven primarily by stronger revenue partially offset by higher operating expenses. Client segment revenue was $2.2 billion, up 25% year-over-year, driven by a richer mix of Ryzen mobile processor sales. Client operating income was $676 million or 32% of revenue compared to $538 million or 31% a year ago. Operating income improvement was driven primarily by higher revenue partially offset by higher operating expenses.
Gaming segment revenue was $1.7 billion, up 32% year-over-year, driven by higher semi-custom product sales. Gaming operating income was $187 million or 11% of revenue compared to $175 million or 14% a year ago. Higher operating income was driven primarily by higher semi-custom revenue, which was partially offset by higher operating expenses. Operating margin was lower primarily due to lower graphics revenue and higher operating expenses.
Embedded segment revenue was $1.3 billion, up $1.2 billion from a year ago, driven primarily by the inclusion of Xilinx embedded revenue. Embedded operating income was $641 million or 51% of revenue compared to $6 million or 11% a year ago, driven by higher revenue.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments was $6 billion at the end of the second quarter. During the quarter, we deployed $920 million to repurchase common stock and have $7.4 billion in remaining authorization. Cash from operations was a record $1 billion. Quarterly free cash flow was $906 million compared to $888 million in the same quarter last year. Inventory was $2.6 billion, up approximately $220 million from the prior quarter in support of second half revenue and the inclusion of Pensando. During the quarter, we established AMD in the investment-grade debt market by issuing debt of $1 billion.
Turning to our financial outlook. Today’s outlook is based on current expectations and contemplates the current macroeconomic environment and customer demand signals. For the third quarter of 2022, we expect revenue to be approximately $6.7 billion, plus or minus $200 million, an increase of approximately 55% year-over-year, primarily led by growth in the Data Center and Embedded segments.
In addition for Q3 2022, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 54%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.64 billion or 24.5% of revenue, non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $270 million based on the 13% effective tax rate and the diluted share count to be approximately 1.63 billion shares. For the full year, we continue to expect revenue of approximately $26.3 billion, plus or minus $300 million, an increase of approximately 60% at the midpoint led by growth in Data Center and Embedded segments. We continue to expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 54%.
In closing, we had an excellent second quarter, with year-over-year revenue growth across all segments, margin expansions and record profitability. Looking ahead, we remain focused on executing our product and financial objectives, while continuing to monitor market signals and work closely with our customers to navigate the dynamic market conditions. We are confident that we are well-positioned for long-term growth driven by our revenue diversification, financial model and earnings power.
Before we transition to the Q&A, we would like to take this opportunity to thank Laura Graves for all her service to AMD and wish her every success on her retirement later this month. Thank you, Laura.
With that, let us begin the Q&A portion of our call. Thank you, Devinder. Kevin, go ahead and begin the Q&A, please. Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. Great. Thank you so much for taking the question. Congrats to Laura on your upcoming retirement. I had two questions. The first one, I wanted to better understand what’s contemplated in your guidance, your Q3 guidance, as well as your implied Q4 guidance, both in terms of revenue and gross margins? If you can kind of speak to the pluses and minus on a sequential basis, that would be super helpful. And then I have a follow-up. Sure. Thanks, Toshiya, for the question. So in terms of the Q3 and the Q4 guidance, so if we would start first with Q3, I think the Q3 guidance implies that, first of all, the revenue growth is led by the Data Center, as well as some increase in our semi-custom or Game Console business, which historically peaks in the third quarter. We have taken a more conservative outlook on the PC business. So a quarter ago, we would have thought that the PC business would be down, let’s call it, high single digits. And our current view of the PC business is that it will be down, let’s call it, mid-teens. And that’s contemplated into our third quarter guidance. And then as we go into the fourth quarter, what we see is, again, the sequential growth there will be led by the Data Center, as well as our Embedded business, with the same view of the PC business. But what we also have there is a set of new product ramps that we’re very excited about. So we have a number of 5-nanometer products that will be ramping in the fourth quarter, including our client products, as well as our server – our general products, as well as our graphics products. So that’s sort of the view of Q3 and Q4 from a revenue standpoint. And then from a margin standpoint, again, we’re guiding full year margin at 54%, which is what we – which is the same. And again, it’s a mix of business in each of the businesses that is resulting in that. Got It. Thank you for the color particularly around your PC assumptions. My follow-up, I was hoping you can speak to what you’re seeing in your Data Center business. Given the macro backdrop, we get a bunch of questions from investors about the forward and sort of the concerns related to both enterprise and spending in the cloud. What are your customers telling you at this point? What kind of visibility do you have? And at what point do you become more dependent on the overall market? And I asked the question because if we take the most recent quarter, you’re probably about third of your nearest competitor in terms of revenue scale, you were about 1.7% a year ago. So obviously, you’re significantly larger, curious at 1 point, do you become more correlated with the broader market? Thank you. Yes. Thanks for the question on the Data Centers. So look, the Data Center business has grown very nicely for us. We’re pleased with the segment growth both on a year-over-year as well as a sequential basis. In terms of what we’re seeing underneath that, in the second quarter, for example, we did see the Cloud business continue to be very strong. So from what we – from our customers, we’re continuing to ramp new cloud instances and workloads with Milan and we see that continuing into the second half of the year. For the Enterprise business, we actually did make also a good progress on the OEM side there as well. What I would say is the trends there are a bit more mixed and perhaps more correlated to some of the macro backdrop. So we do see a significant pipeline, although some of the deals are taking a little bit longer to close. And I would say that there are some match set of things that the OEMs are working through. But all in all, I think we continue to see significant growth opportunities as we go into the second half of the year and into 2023 just given our strong product positioning. And as I said, in this part of the cycle, we see Milan continuing to ramp into the second half of the year. And then we see Genoa coming in towards the end of the year into 2023. So I do think, to your overall question, do we become more correlated to the market? I mean, I think we are – we’ve certainly gained a lot of share. So we’re a larger piece of the market, but we are still underrepresented. And the visibility with our customers, especially our large cloud customers’ second half of this year into next year is very good. And we’re planning really for the next four to six quarters, and that gives us good visibility. Very helpful. Thank you so much. Sure. Thank you. Your next question is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Your line is now live. Thanks for taking my question. Lisa, I just wanted to revisit the second half outlook because your large competitor recently presented a very bleak picture of PC and Enterprise and Data Center talking about excess inventory, etcetera, but you are leaving your expectations relatively unchanged. I’m curious, how do you see your inventory levels? And do you think AMD could be impacted by any excess PC or server or graphics inventory from your main competitors? Just is your second half you think adequately de-risked the way you see it today? Yes, sure, Vivek. So look, if you look at our second half guidance, and maybe let’s talk about the full year guidance. We have – there are some puts and takes in how we’re seeing the business today. So whenever we guide, we recognize that there are multiple dynamics that we’re looking at. In the current guidance for the full year and the second half, what we’re saying is that we continue to see strong demand in the Data Center, in our Embedded business, as well as in the Console business. And we are being more conservative in our PC outlook. Our PC outlook now at mid-teens would kind of put the market at somewhere around, let’s call it, 290 million to 300 million units. So I do think we’ve appropriately de-risked the PC business.
As it relates to inventory as we look at the current situation, given some of the COVID lockdowns and things in the second quarter. I think there was a bit of buildup in PC inventory, and we’ve taken that into account in the second half. We think the AMD portion of that is modest. And as a result, it will rebalance itself in the second half of the year. So overall, I think we feel very good about the second half. And again, with the portfolio that we have, one of the things that has been important is we were still supply constrained in several of the areas. Certainly, on the Embedded side, we were supply constrained in the second quarter. And even on the Server side, we were tight in the second quarter. We have additional supply that’s coming online, especially as we get towards the end of the year. That will help us really meet more of the demand from customers. So we feel pretty good about all of those puts and takes. Got it. And for my follow-up, Lisa, one more on the data center side. So cloud spending seems very strong right now. But we see all these media reports about the cloud players wanting to control their spending levels, etcetera. When do you think that shows up in their spending outlook? Or do you think you have enough of a share gain story with Genoa coming out later this year to offset any slowdown from just a broader spending environment perspective? And just how are you feeling about the next-gen kind of Genoa versus Sapphire Rapids competitive outlook? Yes, Vivek. So I mean, we spend a lot of time with our customers talking about what they’re seeing in their businesses and what they’re seeing in their markets, particularly the large cloud customers. What I would say is every customer is different. So they each have their own dynamics of what they’re trying to optimize. We have seen a bit of a slowdown in China, and you might have expected that. But certainly, with North America cloud, they’ve been very strong this year, and the forecast are robust for next year.
Relative to your overall question, I think we do feel like we’re in a share gain position. I think the product positioning is such that Milan is very, very strong right now. And we think that Genoa as well is very well positioned into next year. So we’ll always spend time with the customer set and see what they’re seeing. But from our current view, I think we have a strong opportunity to continue to grow the Data Center business into 2023. And our view is we have an expanding portfolio as well. In addition to Genoa, we have our Bergamo, which is a cloud optimized capability as well that’s coming online early next year. So there is a lot of new products that are supporting sort of our growth ambitions. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question is from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your line is live. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. For my first question, your larger competitor now has a very sort of publicly admitted push out on their own server product. Does that make you feel like better for what you see for your Genoa ramp, especially as we get into 2023? Is it stronger than you may have seen it previously? And I guess if that’s the case, it sounds like you were still a little bit supply constrain on server in general in Q2. Do you have the supply as we go into next year to upside on that number if the orders actually do get stronger in the wake of the Sapphire Rapids delay? Sure, Stacy. Thanks for the question. So we’re very focused on our own product ramp. And certainly, the key for us was to continue to work very closely with our customers to get them to ramp as fast as possible. I think in Genoa looks very good. We’ve gotten very strong feedback from the customer set. The performance looks very good. There’s a lot of interest to ramp quickly on both the cloud, as well as some of the high-end enterprise stuff. So we feel very good about it. And to your question about supply, we have spent basically the last 12 months building our capacity across the world to support the type of growth that we think the product can handle. So there is a large step-up in supply that we expect to see over the next four, five quarters. And I think we’ll continue to work on that. Got it. Thank you. For my follow-up, I wanted to dig a little bit more into the implied Q4 outlook. Again, I know you answered some questions on some of the drivers into Q4. But if I look at it, it’s taken at the dead midpoint it’s something like a 7% sequential increase from Q3 to Q4 with gross margins going up about 100 bps to 55%. I guess, of that increase, is it fair to say that the bulk of it continues to be Data Center and may be Embedded? The gross margins to me would suggest that, that’s probably the case. But any more further color you could give us on the magnitude of what’s driving that increase would be helpful. Thanks. Yes. I think, Stacy, the bulk of the increase is certainly led by the Data Center and the Embedded segments. Actually, our Embedded segment has performed really well. Very pleased with the growth that we’re seeing there. And then in terms of the margin, it very much is a mix within the business as well. So the pluses and minuses are, yes, Data Center and Embedded are up, but the mix of data center is a little bit more to Cloud than Enterprise, and Embedded a bit more from communications than some of the other markets. But Overall, the 7% increase, I think, is very well supported given all of the new product ramps that we have going on in addition to some additional supply that’s coming in as we get into the fourth quarter. And just as a reminder, it’s also a 14-week quarter for us in Q4. And so, all those things give us sort of the implied guide. Got it. Forgot about the 14-week. Got it. Thank you so much, that’s helpful. Thank you. The next question is coming from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live. Hi, thanks for letting me ask a question and congrats on the solid results, especially in this environment and Laura, congratulations on your retirement. Lisa, I want to dig a little bit into the Gaming business. You obviously have the two parts of that: the client GPUs and the game console side of things. It seems like there are very different dynamics happening there. So when you talked about the – I believe you said the client GPU side would be down year-over-year in the third quarter. Can you just talk a little bit about what’s happening there? Is that just a reflection of the PC market or is there any sort of share gains, product issues going on? And then the semi-custom color, you sounded like it’s going to remain strong for the rest of the year. So is there – is that just the fourth year of the ramp or the third year, I guess, it would be – or is there some sort of seasonal effect we should appreciate as well? Yes. Sure, Ross. Thanks for the question. So our Gaming business is the two halves of the sort of the discrete graphics or the consumer graphics and then our Game Console business. So I would say that on the semi-custom side, let’s take that first. The Console business has been very strong. So I would say it’s a strong cycle. Overall, we were more supply constrained in sort of last year into the first half of this year. We’ve been able to get additional supply for that. I think there’s continued belief that it’s a strong cycle for the consoles. We expect consoles to peak in the third quarter, and then the normal seasonality would see a decline in the fourth quarter. As it relates to the consumer graphics, I would say that as we entered this year, we were coming off of a very strong 2021 for consumer graphics where gaming demand was very high, we have seen a slowdown here in the second quarter, and we expect that is somewhat due to sort of demand now – sort of the supply now and more supply versus demand, as well as some of the macro issues as it relates to consumer spending. We do expect, as we go into the fourth quarter, though, that we’ll see some sequential increase in that business because we’ll have new products that are launching in that timeframe. So those are the puts and takes. I think overall, as a segment, we continue to believe Gaming is a long-term secular driver. There are some sort of short-term dynamics here in the PC market that we’re dealing with. But I think the fact that the Game Consoles have performed so well is a positive for the segment. Thanks for all that color. I guess, for my follow-up, switching over to the gross margin side of things. You guys have done an amazing job on that, and Xilinx obviously helps raise the bar as well. As we look forward, I know you have a long-term target of 57%, can you just talk about if supply becomes looser? And I know you have areas that are loosening and areas that are tight simultaneously. But can you talk about the cost inflation you’re feeling? Do you think that will lessen at all next year? And kind of how do we think about the March from the 55 you seem to be exiting this year at to the 57. What’s the sort of timetable and the drivers of that increase? Well, I think, Ross, what I would say is the business is certainly getting to scale across the board. So the increase in margins as we go forward in the long-term model really is as a result of mix. So what we’ve said is that we believe the Data Center and Embedded businesses can get to over 50% of the company. We’re right now sitting probably in the low 40s, and we expect Data Center, in particular, to grow faster than the rest of the company, and that will drive sort of margin expansion. It is – we’re all working on costs and trying to ensure there are some inflationary kind of costs that are out there. We’re all working on trying to keep those to a minimum. And frankly going back to the work of working on cost reductions as we do in semiconductors over time, but the primary margin expansion for us is in Data Center as well as Embedded growing sort of faster than the other businesses. Thank you. Sure. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Matt Ramsay from Cowen. Your line is now live. Thank you very much. Good afternoon and thanks, Laura, for the partnership down the years. Lisa, I wanted to ask a question about the server business. Obviously, the growth is very strong right now. But a lot of that business continues to be driven by the engagements that you’ve had and continue to build out with cloud. As we look forward over the next, I mean you had talked in some of your script about how you guys were preparing for continued growth in the Server business over the next four, six, eight quarters. And the roadmap is going to diversify some next year with Bergamo and Ciena and Genoa X seeming to launch on top of the Genoa platform. And I wonder you give some color on how the relationships and engagements are going in enterprise and in the telco wireless space as well? I am just trying to get a gauge of how quickly the server business can grow through diversification, not just continued share gains with cloud. Thanks. Sure, Matt. So definitely, I think our focus – we love the progress that we are making in cloud, and we are going to continue to earn every amount of share that we can there. On the enterprise side, as we have always said, it takes a bit longer because the sales cycles are a bit longer. We have made very nice progress with all of the top OEMs. I think the portfolios are continuing to expand. We are excited about not just the current portfolio, as you said, with Genoa, but as we expand to Genoa X at the very high end of the performance as well as Ciena that is a – that just broadens our portfolio for telco. So, our expectation is that we continue to steadily grow share in the enterprise, as well as we go through 2023 and beyond. And I think there is a broader opportunity to sell the broader AMD portfolio. We have, not just the CPU, but I think the addition of the Xilinx assets and the Pensando assets, as well as our GPU portfolio, I think all lead to the overall growth in the data center business for us. Thanks for that Lisa. As my follow-up, it’s a question I would normally ask Devinder, but I have gotten a few e-mails on it in the last hour. So, I figure I would go ahead and ask it. The revenue, obviously, including Xilinx, up 70% or so year-on-year, but a few people have pointed out to me that the cash flow or the free cash flow was only up a tiny bit or very, very modestly. And I wonder if you could walk us through that a little bit where the one-time items with inventory steps up with acquisitions, where maybe more investments in supply. I am just wondering what the variables are there on expanding the free cash flow leverage as we go forward. Thank you. Yes, I can do that. I think one is when the revenue grows a lot, there is investment needed in working capital. So, working capital numbers from an inventory and AR standpoint, they are up significantly year-on-year. We also have, as we said previously, a 3% tax rate going up to about 10%. And the cash taxes get paid. But the timing of the cash taxes sometimes is Q2. And in Q2, we did have some significant cash tax payment from a payment standpoint given the timing of payments of the Federal government. And then you have timing of shipments that does affect the free cash flow. And the last thing I will mention given the discussion, some of the questions that Lisa was asked about, supply for server and supply overall are with the share gain from the growth of the business. We are making investments in capacity from a prepayment standpoint, and those obviously require funding the suppliers, and that also has an impact on the free cash flow because that flows through the free cash flow accretion. So, this is really, if you look at it, inventory and capacity investing for growth and investing for the future. Investing for growth. Got it. Thanks very much guys. Appreciate it. Thank you. Next question is coming from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Yes. Thanks for taking the questions. Laura, congratulations. I wish you the best. I guess for my first question, I wanted to maybe try and unpack the data center business a little bit more. I apologize to kind of continue to go there. But as I look at the trends over the last couple of quarters, and especially given the unit decline that we saw at your largest competitor in this last quarter, I am curious if you could help us appreciate the trajectory of what you are seeing from a blended overall pricing perspective within your server CPU business. Just trying to appreciate as we get into Genoa or Bergamo as we move into 2023. How should we think about the ASP trend on a blended basis within the server CPUs? Okay. So Aaron, I guess what I would say there is, Genoa has much more content than Milan, right. If you think of Milan, it’s Rome and Milan are 64 core processors. And as you get into Genoa and Bergamo, you get to 96 and 128 core. So you would expect on a per unit basis that the ASP would go up. That being the case, I think we would expect that Milan is going to coexist with Genoa and Bergamo for quite some time, just given sort of the different infrastructure and so on and so forth. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color. Yes. And then just as a quick follow-up, I am curious on the data center GPU business. You talked about Frontier, I am curious about where you guys expect that business to kind of shape out for the year? Have you started to see further traction in the ability to sell your CPU plus GPU strategy more broadly? Thank you. Yes. So, we continue to make good progress in the data center GPU. The key there for us is to work with some of the large hyperscalers who have been very closely partnering with us on our MI200 product. I think from an overall revenue standpoint, it’s not a big contributor this year. But certainly, we would expect it to be a larger contributor in 2023 as some of those sort of initial engagements turn into more production engagements. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk a little bit to situation at Xilinx. Is that business still supply constrained? Where are you in terms of relieving those constraints? And obviously, it’s growing nicely. What’s your visibility there kind of into the first part of next year? Yes. Sure, Joe. So, actually, I would say that the Xilinx business has performed extremely well. The demand across all segments has been strong. And what we were able to do as we brought Xilinx into the portfolio is really make some significant improvements in the supply chain. And so we have seen a nice step up. If you were to look on a pro forma basis the Xilinx portfolio grew about 20% sequentially, which is very nice growth. As we look into the second half of the year, we are still a bit constrained in certain areas, certain parts of the Xilinx portfolio, although we continue to make good progress. And I expect additional supply to come on, especially towards the latter part of the year, into 2023. Our view of the business, again, I think the quality of the design wins, the quality of the overall – when you look – the diverse market is very strong. And so I think as we are able to continue to relieve some of those supply constraints into the second half of the year, I think see a good growth trajectory for the business. Great. Thank you. And then as a follow-up on – just wondering how you think about competition in microprocessors in the context of – for the last 4 years, either you or Intel has generally been constrained, Intel for a couple of years and you for the last couple of years. As those constraints ease and obviously, Intel utilization probably falls a little bit here. Could you talk about what you anticipate pricing wise? Do you think anything changes, or does this continue to be kind of a value-priced market? Thanks. Well, I think Joe, it is – I mean we always assume that it’s going to be a very competitive market. I think it depends a little bit on where you are talking about within the market. But on the data center side, what we have found is pricing is not sort of the first factor that customers are paying attention to. It’s really total cost of ownership. So, the performance and the sort of the performance per dollar equation is very important there and sort of the power efficiency. As we go into the PC market, we have deliberately focused our PC market on, let’s call it, the more premium segments. So, gaming as well as high end sort of the ultra-premium, as well as the commercial segments. And again, I think those are much more about the product. There are some parts of the PC market that are very price sensitive, like the low end. And like I said, we have tried to reduce our exposure there going forward. So, I think – I don’t think the dynamics change a lot. I think it’s always a very competitive market and the key thing there is to have a very strong roadmap. Okay. Thank you. Sure. Your next question is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to come back to the data center business. If I look at the spreadsheet that Suresh sent around with the restated data center numbers. And it looks like your data center business kind of aligns apples-to-apples to Intel’s pretty closely. It looks like you guys gained 6.6% share from Intel. And if I kind of take a guess about the pro forma contribution of Xilinx, what it would have been in Q1, it’s about 6% share gain. And that would be – I think that would be the highest share gain in that data center business that you guys ever reported even going back to 2005. Admittedly, two-thirds of that is from Intel declining. I guess since that would put you against until, I guess, in the like kind of the mid-20s, and I am curious if you think that math sounds about right to you. And I am hoping that you could because we are grouping more things together, if you could just share with us, was there any outsized contribution from Xilinx or Pensando or something like that and that, that would make that look – that might change the interpretation from what it looks like on the service because that’s a pretty big jump in share? So, that’s the first part of the question. I had a follow-up, too. Thanks. Sure, Mark. So, this is sort of the reason that we went to the new segments so that there was better visibility. I know you guys have been asking about that for a while. So, I think your math is in the ZIP code from our point of view. And we are pleased that we are gaining share. I think that was our expectation was that as the product portfolio expands, as we increase supply, as we ramp more instances across the customer set that we would see share gains. And we will continue to focus on that going forward. To your question, there was no outsized contribution. The other pieces of it that are in the segment are relatively small, and it was primarily driven by EPYC as you state. Okay. Great. And then the follow-up, if I may. I just wanted to come back to the visibility on this business. And I am wondering like about the kind of like the variance that you get from your cloud customers. So, I guess the scenario that I am curious about is, I imagine the cloud, a lot of the cloud companies do a lot of planning on their data center since it is central to their business. And they sign a data center lease that’s going to get built in six months. Do they – after they do that, do they come to you guys and say, hey, this is coming online. We need to get these chips from you in six months and how kind of how consistent and how tight is the variance span around the visibility that they give you guys? And that’s all I had. Thank you. Yes. Mark, actually it has been very helpful. I mean I think the planning that we are doing jointly with our customers has been very helpful. Much of our conversation right now, frankly, is about 2023, and ensuring that we have enough capacity for some of the build-outs that are out there. So, I would say the visibility is very good. And obviously, things can change, plus or minus here and there. But overall, I think the ZIP codes of how much growth, how much more content the customers need are very active conversations. And frankly, there have been active conversations for the past few months. I think the one positive of sort of the supply chain stuff that we have all gone through is that there is a new recognition of the need for long-term planning so that they can get their match sets and they can get their factory capacity and we can get our factory capacity in line as well. So, overall, very good visibility. Thank you, Mark. Kevin, we have time for two more questions, please. Certainly. Our next question is coming from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. Good afternoon and congratulations on the solid results and execution. On the ramp of Genoa back half of this year, kind of early next year, I believe the team has a total of around 20-plus SKUs across their cloud, enterprise and embedded customers. Your cloud customers obviously are anxiously awaiting these platforms. Would you be rolling out your high-volume cloud SKUs first? And what’s the qualification look like on these high-volume SKUs? Just asking because, obviously, your competitor is struggling with SKU releases, and I just want to make sure that the AMD team is executing and releasing its high-volume SKUs to your cloud customers. Sure, Harlan. So, we certainly go through a full, again, interlock with our customers. Our focus is on the high-volume cloud SKUs, as well as sort of the high-volume enterprise SKUs because there is a fairly sort of lengthy qualification cycle that’s actually in both the cloud and the enterprise. From what we see today, again, there is a strong customer pull on Genoa. And so we are working very closely with our customers, and we expect to ramp production in the fourth quarter and then into the first half of next year. And it will be different by different customers and different platforms and so on and so forth. But what we are seeing is a lot of strong engagement with our customers. Prefect. Thank you, Lisa. Thanks Harlan. Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your line is now live. Thanks a lot. Lisa, I just wanted to sort of double click on you keeping the full year guidance in light of the weaker PC TAM. It seems like maybe if you take the lost units and you multiply by ASP, it seems like it costs you maybe $750 million, but you kept the full year. And data center seem pretty in line. So, is really the offset that you are getting better supply at Xilinx? Is that really the story? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks. Yes. No, I wouldn’t say that, Tim. What I would say is that, again, whenever we put together full year guidance especially from the beginning of the year, we understand that not everything is going to be exactly so. So, as we look now into the second half of the year, what we are seeing is, again, data center is strong. Again, we expect data center to grow second half to first half nicely. Embedded/Xilinx will also grow to some extent, second half to first half. And the consoles will also grow as well. And so I think as we look at those components offsetting what is perhaps a more conservative PC outlook, we believe that, that offsets nicely. And again, just as a reminder, we do have a number of product ramps in the fourth quarter that are coming out in 5-nanometer, and we think that will drive sort of the sequential growth in the fourth quarter. So, I think those are some of the puts and takes in the full year guide. Awesome. Thank you. And then I guess last thing, Devinder, can you talk about purchase commitments? There was a question on free cash flow, and I am wondering if maybe there is a pretty big increase in purchase commitments. So, I wonder if you can talk about that. Thanks. I think in 2021, as I said on the Financial Day, we had about $1 billion committed and paid. And this year, it does step up a little bit, especially given all the supply that we need to get ready for 2023. And that does flow to the free cash flow. In the first half, it wasn’t so significant, but it does step up in the second half. So, it will impact that from that standpoint. Thank you. We reached end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over for any further or closing comments. Thank you, everyone, for your participation in today’s earnings call.

Now with that, I’d like to hand the call over to Lisa. Lisa? Thank you, Ruth, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. Our third quarter revenue and gross margin came in below our expectations due to softening PC demand and substantial inventory reduction actions across the PC supply chain.
Despite the macro backdrop, overall revenue grew 29% year-over-year to $5.6 billion as our Data Center, Gaming and Embedded segments, each delivered significant year-over-year growth and performed in line with our expectations. We also expanded gross margin and grew net income year-over-year, highlighting the strength of our business.
Turning to the business results, starting with our Data Center segment. Revenue increased 45% year-over-year and 8% sequentially to $1.6 billion. We delivered our 10th straight quarter of record server processor sales, driven by strong demand for third-gen EPYC processors and initial shipments of our next-generation Genoa CPU to select customers.
Cloud revenue more than doubled year-over-year and increased sequentially as multiple hyperscalers expanded deployments of EPYC processors to power their internal properties and more than 70 new AMD instances were launched by Microsoft Azure and Amazon, Tencent, Baidu and others in the quarter.
In enterprise, OEM revenue was down sequentially as server OEMs continued working through match set issues and some business load the pace or scale of their purchases based on the macro uncertainties.
Looking at the broader competitive landscape, our third-gen EPYC CPUs in market today are the highest performance and most energy efficient x86 server CPUs available, and we expect to further extend that lead with our next-generation 5-nanometer Genoa processors, which deliver significant performance, energy efficiency and TCO advantages for both hyperscale and enterprise workloads.
We will publicly launch Genoa next week and are ramping production to support initial cloud deployments and the introduction of fourth-gen EPYC processor platforms by HP Enterprise, Dell, Lenovo, Super Micro and others.
Looking at our broader Data Center portfolio, as expected, Data Center GPU sales were down significantly from a year ago when we had substantial shipments supporting the build-out of the Frontier exascale supercomputer.
We made good progress with our Data Center GPU software enablement work in the quarter, including announcing our role as a founding member of the PyTorch Foundation. We look forward to working closely with the largest cloud providers as we drive a standards based approach to the development of popular PyTorch deep learning software framework.
Demand from Data Center customers for our adaptive, SmartNIC and DPU products was strong during the quarter. We had record sales of our Xilinx FPGA and networking Data Center products led by demand from cloud and financial customers.
Sales of our Pensando DPUs also ramped significantly from the prior quarter driven by cloud adoption. The addition of Pensando DPUs to our product portfolio has been very well received by customers, highlighted by our enterprise customer pipeline doubling in the few months since the acquisition closed.
We were excited to support VMware’s launch of its next-generation cloud virtualization platform in the quarter. Our Pensando DPUs will be included in the first validated server and HCI solutions, supporting the new VMware virtualization offerings from Dell, HPE and others, that will make it much easier for enterprise customers to build more performance and secure Data Centers powered by our industry-leading DPUs.
Taking a step back, we have built significant momentum in our Data Center business as we have consistently executed our server CPU road map and expanded our solutions capabilities with the addition of the Xilinx and Pensando products to our portfolio.
We remain on track to further expand our product portfolio in 2023 with the launches of our edge and telco optimized Siena and cloud optimized Bergamo processors. With 128 cores and 256 threads per socket, we expect Bergamo will first end our performance and energy efficiency leadership in cloud workloads.
Customer response has been very strong based on the performance, features and software compatibility Bergamo delivers. We believe our broad family of leadership CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, adaptive SoCs and DPUs position us well for long-term growth and share gains in the Data Center.
Now into our Client segment. Revenue declined 40% year-over-year to $1 billion. Our Client processor shipments were below PC consumption in the third quarter as we worked closely with our customers to reduce downstream inventory.
Desktop channel sell-through increased from the prior quarter, driven by increased demand for our Ryzen 5000 Series CPUs and the launch of our Ryzen 7000 Series processors and AM5 platform in September.
We launched our 5-nanometer Ryzen 7000 Series processors with strong reviews based on delivering leadership performance in gaming, productivity and content creation applications. We expect Ryzen 7000 CPU sales to ramp this quarter aligned with the launches of a broader range of mainstream and enthusiast AM5 motherboards.
Now turning to our Gaming segment, revenue increased 14% year-over-year to $1.6 billion as strong semi-custom sales offset a decline in gaming graphics. We delivered our sixth straight quarter of record semi-custom SoC sales as demand for the latest game consoles remained strong, and Sony and Microsoft prepare for the holiday season.
Gaming graphics revenue declined in the quarter based on soft consumer demand and our focus on reducing downstream GPU inventory. We will launch our next-generation RDNA 3 GPUs later this week that combine our most advanced gaming graphics architecture with 5-nanometer chiplet designs.
Our high end RDNA 3 GPUs will deliver strong increases in performance and performance per watt compared to our current products and include new features supporting high resolution, high frame rate gaming. We look forward to sharing more details later this week.
Looking at our Embedded segment, revenue increased significantly year-over-year to a record $1.3 billion, driven by growth from aerospace and defense, industrial and communications customers.
Demand across our core markets remained very strong. We had record sales to aerospace and defense and automotive customers who are increasingly using our FPGA and adaptive SoC products to enable differentiated capabilities and features in their products.
Record communications market revenue was driven by growth from both wired and wireless customers. We saw a particular strength in North America led by new 5G wireless installations and expanded wired infrastructure deployments. Overall demand for our Xilinx products remain strong as we continue to leverage AMD’s scale to secure additional supply to address this demand.
Longer term, we are very excited about the growth opportunities in our Embedded business. We closed multiple high revenue design wins in the quarter with automotive, networking, emulation and prototyping, communications and aerospace and defense customers.
We are also seeing new design win opportunities and deeper engagements with many of our Embedded customers based on the expanded breadth of our adaptive SoC, FPGA, CPU, GPU and DPU product portfolio.
In summary, we are well-positioned to navigate the current market dynamics based on our leadership product portfolio, strong balance sheet and growth in our Data Center and Embedded segments.
We have three clear priorities guiding us. First and foremost, we are focused on executing our road maps and delivering our next generation of leadership products. Second, we are building even deeper relationships with our customers as we make AMD a fundamental enabler of their success. And lastly, we remain very disciplined in how we manage the business.
We will continue to invest in our strategic priorities around the Data Center, Embedded and Commercial markets, while tightening expenses across the rest of the business and aligning our supply chain with the current demand outlook.
The secular trends driving increased demand for high performance and adaptive computing in the cloud, at the edge and across intelligent end devices remain unchanged and provide a strong backdrop for long-term growth.
Now I’d like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our third quarter financial performance. Devinder? Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. AMD reported third quarter results in line with the preliminary results we announced last month. While we are pleased with the performance of our Data Center, Gaming and Embedded segments, each of which grew significantly year-over-year, our third quarter results also reflect lower than expected Client segment revenue. Third quarter revenue was $5.6 billion, up 29% from a year ago.
Gross margin was 50%, up 150 basis points from a year ago, primarily driven by higher revenue in the Embedded and Data Center segments, partially offset by lower Client revenue and $160 million of inventory, pricing and related charges in the graphics and client businesses.
Operating expenses were $1.5 billion, compared to $1 billion a year ago as we continue to scale the company. Operating income was up 20% from a year ago to $1.3 billion, driven by revenue growth and higher gross margin.
Operating margin was 23%, compared to 24% a year ago, due to higher operating expenses. Net income was $1.1 billion, up $202 million from a year ago. Earnings per share was $0.67 per share, compared to $0.73 per share a year ago, primarily due to lower Client segment revenue.
Now turning to our reportable segments. Starting with the Data Center segment, revenue was $1.6 billion, up 45% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in third-generation EPYC server processor revenue.
Data Center operating income was $505 million or 31% of revenue, compared to $308 million or 28% a year ago. Higher operating income was driven primarily by stronger revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses.
Client segment revenue was $1 billion, down 40% year-over-year, due to reduced process shipments resulting from a weak PC market and a significant inventory correction across the PC supply chain. Client operating loss was $26 million, compared to operating income of $490 million or 29% of revenue a year ago, primarily due to lower revenue.
Gaming segment revenue was $1.6 billion, up 14% year-over-year, driven by higher semi-custom product sales, partially offset by lower gaming graphics revenue. Gaming operating income was $142 million or 9% of revenue, compared to $231 million or 16% a year ago. The decrease was primarily due to lower graphics revenue and inventory pricing and related charges.
Embedded segment revenue was $1.3 billion, up $1.2 billion from a year ago, primarily due to the inclusion of Xilinx’s embedded product revenue. Embedded operating income was $635 million or 49% of revenue, compared to $23 million or 30% a year ago, driven primarily by higher revenue.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $5.6 billion at the end of the third quarter. During the quarter, we repaid the 7.5% senior notes totaling $312 million that matured in August and deployed $617 million to repurchase common stock. We have $6.8 billion in remaining authorization for stock repurchases.
Cash from operations was $965 million and free cash flow was $842 million, compared to $764 million in the same quarter last year. Inventory was $3.4 billion, up approximately $721 million from the prior quarter, driven primarily by client products and new products ramping in the second half of the year.
Now turning to our financial outlook, today’s outlook is based on current expectations and contemplates the near-term macroeconomic environment. For the fourth quarter of 2022, we expect revenue to be approximately $5.5 billion, plus or minus $300 million, an increase of approximately 14% year-over-year and flat sequentially.
The year-over-year growth is driven by Embedded and Data Center segments, partially offset by a decline in the Client and Gaming segments. On a sequential basis, Embedded and Data Center segments are expected to grow, offset by declines in the Client and Gaming segments.
In addition, for Q4 2022, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 51%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.55 billion or 28% of revenue, non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $175 million based on a 13% effective tax rate, and diluted share count to be approximately 1.62 billion shares.
For the full year, we expect revenue to be approximately $23.5 billion, plus or minus $300 million, an increase of approximately 43%, led by growth in the Embedded and Data Center segments. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 52%.
In closing, we continue to focus on executing our long-term strategy, while navigating current market conditions. We will prioritize the key investments for our product roadmaps and long-term growth, while taking several near-term cost management actions, including prudently controlling operating expenses and headcount growth, while actively managing inventory in line with our revenue expectations.
With that, let me turn the call over to Ruth for our Q&A session. Ruth? Thank you, Devinder. Kevin, if you could please poll the audience for questions. Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I have one question and one quick follow-up. I guess, as we look at your Client piece of the business being down sequentially in the current quarter, as we work through inventory digestion at your customers. I am curious just how you are thinking about kind of the clearing out of that inventory, do you think we find a bottom coming out of the December quarter or any kind of thoughts of just that kind of full expectation of reflection of inventory in the PCU -- PC market for you guys? Yeah. Sure, Aaron. Thanks for the question. So,1 clearly, the PC business has been very volatile and underperformed for us in the third quarter. I think as we go into the fourth quarter, we are guiding that -- it’s embedded in our guidance is that, PCs will be down again in the fourth quarter.
We believe that, that will be a significant step in clearing inventory between the third quarter and the fourth quarter, and of course, we will monitor the macro conditions, but we will certainly exit the year in a better place. Yeah. And then as a quick follow-up on the service side of the business, I think, in the past, you have talked about your ability to shift being somewhat supply constrained. I am just curious if you have an update on the supply situation in the server CPU, especially as we look towards the general processor ramp in the next quarter or two? Yeah. Sure. So in the -- on the server side, we certainly have been ramping up our overall supply. I think we have made good progress on that throughout the year. We have more supply in Q4 than we had earlier in the year and some of those investments are coming online here in the fourth quarter. So we expect as we go into 2023 with the Genoa launch not to be supply constrained based on what we currently see. Yeah. Fair enough. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you. Next question is coming from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. Thanks so much for taking the question. Lisa, I wanted to ask a question on the outlook for 2023, specifically in the server CPU business. I know it’s early and difficult to predict, but given the supply comment that you just made, given what you are hearing from customers, both on the cloud side, as well as the enterprise side and the ramp of your new products. How are you thinking about the positives there versus the macro, which continues to be a headwind? I think many of us have your business growing in Data Center kind of in the 20% to 30% range, is that a fair place to be or is that a little too optimistic given what you know today? Yeah. So it is a little bit early to talk about 2023 precisely. But maybe let me give you a backdrop of where we see the Data Center market today. As you said, in the near-term, there are some overall macro headwinds that are affecting all markets, including the Data Center market.
Now it varies by segment, and so if I go through each of the segments, what we are seeing is I think North America cloud is, probably, the most resilient out of the segments within the Data Center market and this is where AMD is the strongest.
We have had very good progress at the North America cloud vendors and we continue to believe that although there may be some near-term, let’s call it, optimization of, let’s call it, individual footprints and efficiencies at individual cloud vendors over the medium-term.
As we go into 2023, we expect growth in that market, particularly customers moving more workloads to AMD, just given the strength of our product portfolio, and overall, Genoa coming forward.
As we look through the other segments, I think, China is -- has been very weak in 2022 and we are not forecasting a significant recovery in 2023. So we will see how that goes. And then on the enterprise side, I would say, enterprise is probably most impacted by the macro. So we have seen customers taking longer to make decisions and perhaps being a little bit more conservative on CapEx.
That being said, though, we feel very good about our value proposition, we feel very good about our product portfolio, and we believe, even in a little bit of a choppy market that we can gain share across that business. So, overall, I think, our Data Center trends are good and we need to work through the macro as everyone does. That’s helpful. And then as my follow-up, a question on gross margins, maybe for Devinder. So you are guiding Q4 gross margins up about 100 basis points, which is good to see, but you are still 300 basis points below where you were in Q2, and since then, obviously, Client is down significantly, your Data Center business is very resilient and so is the classic Xilinx business. So from a mix perspective, you should be in a better place. What’s driving down gross margins in Q4, I guess, versus Q2, are you recognizing another inventory hit or is it something else? Thank you. No inventory hit, first of all, Toshi. On the gross margin, as you said, Q2 54%, if you go all the way to Q4 51% primarily is the weak PC market and Client margins coming down. For example, if you look at Q3, all other businesses were in line with expectations and Client margins came in lower.
We also have in the Data Center, a place cloud weighted, which has lower ASPs. So that also has an impact on margins.
And then as Lisa mentioned earlier, some of the new capacity that we have from a supply standpoint, there are some additional costs from the supply capacity agreements and those are all baked in into the Q4 51% margin guidance. Thank you. Thank you. The next question is coming from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your line is now live. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. For the first one, I wanted to ask about the extra week in Q4. How much revenue was that driving on an overall basis, as well as in Data Center specifically, is there -- I don’t know how linear those -- particularly that business is? Is there any sort of -- is there any material impact from that extra week? Yeah. Stacy, we are not really counting on a material impact from the extra week. I think if you look at the pluses and minuses in the quarter. The guidance for Q4 really is around sort of PCs and, let’s call it, Gaming being lower, and again, those are -- with all the holidays in place, we are not counting on too much there. And then Data Center is -- Data Center, Embedded are higher, but we are not expecting that the extra week has a material impact. Got it. Thank you. For my follow-up, I wanted to ask about units versus pricing in Q3 and Q4. I know in Q3, you specifically mentioned pricing has an impact and it sounds like you are suggesting Client margins are coming down. I don’t know if that’s just a cost or if there’s a pricing impact as well, but like what did units and pricing do in Client in Q3 and what are you expecting in Q4? Sure, Stacy. So I think if you look at the third quarter, it was -- there are a lot of dynamics in the Client business. So market was weak. In particular, consumer was weak and we have more of a footprint in consumer. So in that framework, we saw units come down, but we also saw ASPs come down on a sequential basis.
Now I will say that ASPs were still up on a year-over-year basis. So we have been, let’s call it, disciplined in this pricing environment. We did see some pricing dynamics in the quarter, and we couldn’t face unprofitable business and we will continue to be sort of watching that space.
So that was the pluses or minuses as it relates to Client ASPs. And as we go into the fourth quarter, again, I think, we are forecasting for a competitive environment given the market weakness and that’s embedded in the guide. Got it. That’s helpful. Thank you, guys. Thank you. Next question is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Thanks for taking my question. For the first one, I just wanted to clarify what is the client revenue we should be thinking about for Q4, is it $800 million, $900 million, any help there? And then, I guess, Lisa, the bigger question there is, what does client recovery look like, do you get back to the $2 billion quarterly rate, do you get to $1.5 billion? And I asked that because your competitor was suggesting that next year the PC TAM would only be down 4% or 5%, which seems a little bit optimistic. What do you think AMD is kind of -- what kind of PC TAM does AMD have in mind for next year so that we get a sense for how this de-risk the model is from a PC perspective? Yeah. So, a couple of different points, Vivek. Let me just answer the sort of the expectations around Q4. I would say, we are guiding, let’s call it, modestly down for Client and Gaming, and obviously, we are coming off of what is already a low base in Q3. We want to do that to correct the sort of the inventory situation as quickly as possible, and as a result, we are going to under ship consumption again in the fourth quarter to do that.
As it relates to next year, I think, there are a lot of factors. I mean this year PCs will be down quite a bit, let’s call it, high-teens, close to 20%. As we go into next year, I think, the industry is calling mid-single digits. I think that would be a good case. I think we should model down to minus 10%.
And again, within our PC business, we expect as we get through this inventory correction, I mean, we have very good products, and I feel very good about our product portfolio and very good about our platforms overall. So I do think the PC business will recover as we go into 2023, but we will have to work through these dynamics over the next quarter or so. Understood. And for my follow-up, Devinder, maybe one for you on gross margins, how much of the write-offs and pricing actions that you are taking in -- that you took in Q3 and are taking in Q4, how much are they recoverable in Q1? So let’s say, hypothetically, Q1 revenue is the same as Q4 revenue, what can gross margins be, how much of the actions are recoverable and basically how do you start getting back to the prior trend of 54% gross margin, because the longer term target is over 57%? So if Client revenues don’t really grow that much, are there actions that can help you get back to your prior gross margin trajectory? Thank you. Let me try to answer it this way. If you look at Q3 in and of itself, we came in with about 50% gross margin. We had $160 million of charges, which are inventory pricing and related charges. If you adjust for those, the margin for -- in Q3 is about 52%.
And we had guided to 54%, we came in at 52%, and primarily, that’s due to two reasons, right? You have the Client weak PC market, and obviously, the Client margins are down. As I said earlier, the rest of the business will perform for the expectations.
We have to work through what’s going on with the PC market over this quarter, next quarter and maybe early 2023 and then we come back and talk about the margins. I do feel good about the products we are introducing, especially the new products and perhaps the ability to increase margins from where we are right now, guiding 51% and then taking it up from there. But is the $160 million recoverable, I guess that’s really my question? Those were mostly inventory rights or pricing actions we would take. Largely, I would say, not recoverable, if that’s what you are asking. I mean can you get back to the 52% that you would have been normalized, like, I expect if you don’t take these actions in Q1, then should you be at a higher gross margin in Q1 versus Q4? I won’t guide Q1, but what I will say is from the 51% that we have in Q4, we can improve from there. Thank you. Thank you. Next question is coming from Matt Ramsay from Cowen. Your line is now live. Thank you. Very much. Good afternoon. At least I have one question on the Data Center segment and then a follow-up on Client. On the Data Center business, if you look back to the pre-announcement a month ago. I think, there was a little bit of maybe -- you came in a little bit under where we were modeling, I will just say that way. And so I got a ton of questions on that and I was really interested in some of the comments that you made in your script about how cloud revenue still more than doubled year-over-year, and anyway, just confirming that I got that right. And maybe if you could help us break down your Data Center business a little bit between the strength in cloud that I would expect to continue given the CapEx commentary we have heard, but there were obviously some headwinds from enterprise that you called out and clearly from HPC, both on CPU and GPU. So I think that would be helpful to just break it down, because I was surprised that, that cloud revenue was as strong as it was given where the numbers came in, in the quarter. Thank you. Yeah. Sure, Matt. So for focus on the third quarter, what I would say is, cloud revenue did more than double, enterprise revenue was down. And then on the GPU side, because we had a strong quarter in the third quarter of 2021, that was down too, and perhaps, that wasn’t quite in your modeling.
But the larger dynamics are, as I said earlier, the North America cloud is probably the best out of all the Data Center segments. There is some impact on macro, though. I mean I think everyone is aware of that, that there is a little bit of pull back in CapEx spending. That being the case, I think our market share is very good there and we will -- we expect it to continue to grow.
And as the business becomes more cloud weighted -- there have been a few margin questions, so I will just mention, as the business becomes more cloud weighted, that tends to have a little bit of downward pressure on the margin.
But our goal right now is footprint and expanding our footprint across cloud and enterprise. I will say even in a weak enterprise market as we go forward over the next few quarters, we feel really good about how we are positioned and the platform solutions that are coming out with all of our OEM partners.
So I think on a quarter-by-quarter basis, you may not get the model exactly right, but I think on a longer term basis, I think, the product portfolio and the product capabilities should help us continue to gain share. Okay. Thank you, Lisa. That’s helpful. I think to highlight the cloud momentum continuing. I guess as my follow-up, I wanted to kind of revisit what we have learned over the last three months or four months in the PC market. It’s super dynamic times out there, and obviously, things have changed in demand really, really quickly from when you guys guided back at the beginning of August until the pre-announcement. And I just kind of wanted to walk back through sort of the dynamics of how the quarter progressed from when you guys gave the original guidance, I guess, obviously, the market went down, there was inventory corrections and whatnot. But just how quickly did you guys see that and I guess the real question coming out of this is, how are you thinking about changes you might make in monitoring inventory levels or working with your channel partners? Just any changes you are thinking about making operationally to the business to sort of protect from this kind of thing coming and, I guess, going forward? Thanks very much. Any color there would be really helpful. Sure, Matt. So, yes, the third quarter, the PC market was very volatile. Going into it, we expected the market would be weak. It was weaker than we expected and the weakest portion of the market is a consumer market where we tend to be more heavily weighted.
I think the thing that perhaps we saw in the market is, we -- as the overall macro economy has also weakened, customers in general across the Board have just become more cautious. So even as they were selling through their inventory, they were not replenishing stock to the same levels.
And frankly, we were coming off of a supply/demand imbalance where in the first half of the year, people were actually trying to gather inventory and we had been in a supply constrained situation.
So it is a very dynamic situation, I would say. I think that we have great partnerships across the supply chain. I feel good about the visibility that we have. I think the market will continue to be volatile. But we will -- we are all sort of biased towards reducing inventory levels so that we can better react to the market factors and the market situation. So, hopefully, that helps a little bit. Yeah. No. Definitely appreciate that Lisa. Thank you. Next question today is coming from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about your visibility in the Xilinx part of the business to the extent that we have seen some weakening in kind of broader markets here and there, but generally, it’s okay. Like can you just talk about how long your visibility extends there, how you feel about growth into next year? Yeah. Absolutely, Joe. So the Xilinx business, our Embedded business has been performing just extremely well. Another very strong quarter in Q3 and we have -- we see growth into the fourth quarter.
We have been very focused on what’s happening within the various sub-segments. I think the nice part of the business, as you know, is that, it has -- it’s very broad based. So we have seen communications was up for us, aerospace and defense very strong, automotive was also up for us here in the third quarter.
We did see some weaknesses. Consumer was weak. There was some sub-segments of industrial. So test and measurement was weaker in the third quarter. So we do see the puts and takes there. But overall, I would say, the business has strong visibility.
We are still supply constrained in certain nodes and some of the legacy nodes. We have made a lot of progress on supply. So we are seeing additional supply come in in Q4 and that leads us to good confidence in Q4.
We expect the first half, again, we have multiple quarters of visibility just given the lead times in that business and we will be watching it very carefully. But I would say, overall, the products portfolio is strong and we have also gained some share in that business as well. Great. Thank you very much. Thanks. Thank you. Next question today is coming from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live. Everybody, thanks. So let me ask a couple of questions quickly here. Lisa, if you could give us a little color, you talked about the fourth quarter being, I guess, down modestly in Client and Gaming. Can you give relatively similar color for Data Center and Embedded, just because the volatility between segments, obviously, has been huge over the last couple of quarters? Yeah. Sure, Ross. Well, since -- on an absolute level, we are talking about flattish from Q4 to Q3, 5.5 versus 5.56. So modest decline in Client and Gaming. Within Gaming, we would expect consoles to be down in the fourth quarter given they are coming off of Q3, which is their peak. That’s offset a bit by our new graphics launch that is occurring in the next few weeks.
And then as it relates to Data Center and Embedded, it’s about the same. Let’s call it, modest plus as we go forward. We expect again cloud to be stronger than enterprise. That’s some of the margin dynamics that we were asking earlier, and Embedded, as we get more supply, modestly up as well. Great. That’s perfect. And then as my follow-up, one for either you or Devinder. As we think about OpEx for next year, how do you guys philosophically balance the desire to stick to your business model that you laid out at your most recent Analyst Day versus the desire to continue to spend, continue to gain market share, put out the great new products and execute that you have done so well, are those kind of buffers conflicting against each other, and how, if so, do you reconcile that confliction? Yeah. I think the key thing is we continue to invest in the strategic areas, in Data Center and Embedded and the product roadmaps. The macro environment has weakened soft PCs and we are taking actions to reduce expenses especially in the rest of the business besides what I talked about earlier in terms of the areas of focus and we have slowed down hiring.
So you are right, Q4, if you look at E2R business is high, but we are very disciplined in terms of what we are going to do. Expense actions do take time to kick in and we expect that as we go out into 2023, the E2R comes more in balance with the revenue and we manage it in line with the revenue out in time. Yeah. And maybe, Ross, if I’d just add on top of that. I think we have the opportunity -- we have multiple levers in OpEx. So we are going to be very disciplined, as Devinder said. That being the case, I mean, we feel very good about our strategic direction around Data Center, Embedded and the commercial markets. So we want to continue to invest there where we will be more conservative on the consumer facing portions of our business and that’s how we will manage through 2023. Thank you. Next question is coming from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. Your line is now live. Hi. Thank you very much. Lisa, I wanted to come back to the PC business. There’s such a big disparity between your 3Q guide and what Intel guided to or reported versus what they are guiding to in 4Q and usually things normalize over a longer period of time. But I just wanted to understand, is it a case of they took their medicine earlier and AMD continued to over ship versus demand? Just kind of help us understand and there seems to be also a dynamic that Intel is raising pricing in 4Q, so there was some pull-in ahead of that. And I have been getting a lot of questions myself. I don’t understand specific disparity. So any help would be very helpful? Yeah. Sure, Ambrish. Look, I think, again, let me comment on our business, right? So for our business, as we exited the first half of the year, I think, we were planning for a sort of a reasonable PC market in the second half.
Usually, the third quarter is higher than the first half, and the third and the fourth quarter are seasonally higher, and so that’s what we were building to, together with our customers, by the way, with that expectation.
I think the market weakness, as well as just the overall caution in the environment just caused people to behave a bit differently and that really required us to work together with our customers on the inventory corrections.
And as you said, there were some temporal sort of dynamics and we are aware of those temporal dynamics. Some of it is very -- sort of very aggressive pricing that we chose not to follow, and again, that’s a decision that we made. And others are, as you might expect, there might be some temporal optimization that people are doing.
I don’t think there’s anything fundamental. I think fundamentally, our product portfolio is strong. I think we have very good platforms in place and we will work through this. I fully agree that it’s kind of a messy market environment that we have to work through, but we will work through it. Got it. Good. Thank you. And I had a follow-up for you, Devinder. Just talk about capacity opening up at the foundries and we had this conversation at the Analyst Day about the headwind to free cash flow given your need or desire to secure capacity. Is that going to temper off now -- taper off as we go through the remainder of the next few quarters as there should be more capacity that’s available, plus on the PC side you should need much less than what you needed a couple of quarters ago? Thank you. Yeah. I mean the capacity agreement that we were working on, which have some benefit, especially as Lisa talked about earlier in the service space, these are long-term agreements we put in place to support the growth of the business.
Given the market backdrop, we work actively with our suppliers in aligning supply with timing of revenue and ramp up products and that’s something that we are able to do with our suppliers given what’s happened to the market. So, there is --- from that standpoint some flexibility overall and that’s something we will work through over the next two quarter to three quarters. Thank you. Next question is coming from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. In Data Center, the team continues to expand the number of compute instances with your cloud customers on Milan. It seems like the momentum is carrying up through the ramp of your fourth generation Genoa platforms. I think this is a very good dynamic. I assume you guys have good visibility here. So how long does the Milan momentum continue into next year and are your cloud customers already qualifying Genoa and when do you expect Genoa to start to kick into high-volume ramp? Yeah. Thanks for the question, Harlan. So, yes, look, we are very happy with our Milan sort of workload ramp. We are continuing to ramp Milan here this year and then into next year as well. As it relates to Genoa, we did start initial shipments of Genoa to our strategic customers in the third quarter.
That is continuing in the fourth quarter. So we are ramping production in the fourth quarter. A lot of the, let’s call it, the qualifications or the first instances are being qualified here in the fourth quarter into the first quarter.
And what we have said before is that, Milan and Genoa are going to actually coexist for quite some time, just given how competitive both are. Genoa is a new platform. It is new DDR5 and PCIe 5.0, and that takes a bit longer for people to qualify. So we would expect both to continue to ramp in 2023 and that’s how we are planning the business. Great. Thank you. And despite the macro concerns, and as you mentioned, some near-term workload optimization, your North American cloud customers, I mean, they are still growing their cloud services business at a strong 30%, 40% year-over-year growth rate and I assume that these types of growth rates like the consumption of compute networking, storage workloads and therefore, installed utilization, like, this is all quite strong in driving the need to build out more compute capacity. Is this what’s driving the team’s sort of strong mid-term outlook for this segment or is it more a function of your strong product lineup with Genoa and continuing to capture greater compute share or both? Yeah. Right. Harlan, I would say, it’s a little bit of both and I think you said it well. In the very near-term, there is a little bit of optimization that each cloud vendor is doing. But in the medium-term, what our customers are telling us is they need more compute.
And the more compute is for additional workloads building out. It’s also for upgrade of, let’s call it, older compute, given our new products have very strong TCO, power efficiency, given the cost of power and energy around the world. We are actually seeing that also be a driver for some of the conversion to AMD in the cloud as we go into 2023. Thank you, Lisa. Thanks, Harlan. Thank you. Next question is coming from Chris Danely from Citi. Your line is now live. Thank you. So if we take the macro out of it, can you just go through your share expectations in desktop, notebook and server, let’s just say, for the next 12 months or so? Let’s see, I am trying to think how do I take the macro out of it. So your question is -- put the actual TAM aside and just talk about where we are going from a share standpoint, is that your question? Yeah. You can say relatively where you expect to gain more or less. I got it. I got it. Okay. Yeah. I want to be responsive to the question. Well, let’s start with the Data Center. I think in the Data Center, we believe that we will continue to gain share. We expect to continue to gain share in both cloud and enterprise.
We are more underrepresented in enterprise, and so, again, that’s a key focus for us. But as we just stated in the last few questions, I think, North America cloud, in particular, I think, we see line of sight to significant new deployments based on our current roadmap.
In the desktop and notebook business, our focus is on certain segments. So we are very focused on premium. We are very focused on gaming and we are focused on commercial. I think in those areas, there are, again, opportunities for us to continue to gain share.
I think in desktop DIY business or sort of the desktop channel business, we have a strong lineup. We just launched the new Ryzen 7000 Series. We have additional products that we will launch next year as well and that’s sort of the puts and takes in the various businesses. Sure. And then as my follow-up, I guess, just getting back into the macros that you mentioned that ASPs are getting a little or at least pricing is getting a little tough on CPUs. If this downturn in PCs continues into next year and if it spreads into the Data Center market, how do you think of pricing going forward and would you choose to maybe give up some share if your competitor remains aggressive on price and the environment stays difficult? Chris, I think, we are -- we have a very strong value proposition. Our strategy is not to lead on price. So if you look at -- look in the Data Center, although price is one factor, we find price is not the leading factor in the majority of the selections. There is work for us to do in terms of workload optimization and that’s where a lot of our focus has been in the Data Center. So, hopefully, that answers that piece.
As it relates to the PC business, it is more price-sensitive. We have seen it become more price-sensitive. I think, again, where we have a strong value proposition we will continue to be very competitive.
But even back a year ago, we didn’t choose to compete in the Chrome market, because, again, that was just not a profitable business for us and so we are going to be disciplined in ensuring that what we are taking is profitable business. Got it. Thanks, Lisa. Thank you. Thank you. Next question is coming from Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your line is now live. Hi. Thanks a lot. I had two. Lisa, first, I wanted to ask about U.S.-China trade and I guess the recent restrictions, they didn’t seem to have too much direct impact on you, but the direction of travel seems pretty clear and you report China as 25% of revenue, but that’s sell-in. So I am wondering if maybe you can help us with what China is on a consumption basis and kind of how you handicap where your China TAM is going. When you are making these investment decisions, how do you think about the U.S.-China trade and the direction of travel? And I had a follow-up, too. Thanks. Yeah. Sure, Tim. So we are certainly watching the situation very closely. Upon reviewing all of the new regulations as they have gone into effect, it is minimal impact on our revenue in the near-term.
We are certainly working very closely with commerce and the rest of the U.S. Government on how those are rolling out. And then I think on a medium-term basis, again, my view on these things is, we will always follow the U.S. regulations and understand the need for national security.
The majority of our China business is, let’s call it, non-Data Center. So it’s more in the PC business, as well as in some of the consumer facing businesses. So we are paying attention to that as we go forward in the business. But for the near-term, we have not seen any significant impacts, and we will continue to follow it very closely. Thank you, Lisa. And then, I guess, I wanted to ask a question about PCs. So you guided in late July and it seemed like things were fine and then we lost basically $1 billion basically in two months. It would seem like those were massively weak months, and I would think that, maybe there’s been some improvement in the run rate when you kind of head into Q4. Does that mean inventory has sort of leaned out a little bit? I mean the market probably only absorbed, I don’t know, 58 million units in Q3, and if you annualize that, you are at 200 million units a year. It’s like hard to get PCs that bad next year. So I am just kind of wondering if you can comment on sort of the run rate, because August and September must have been terrible months? Thanks. The PC market certainly was volatile in the third quarter. I would say that, we did drain a good amount of inventory in the third quarter. I think we are -- our guide indicates a desire to drain more in the fourth quarter, and I think, we will make progress in that.
And of course, it all depends on how the macro behaves over the next couple of months, but like I said, I think we are -- we have good visibility into the various market factors and we are planning for a weaker PC environment in the fourth quarter. Thank you, Tim. Thank you. Operator, we will take two more questions, please. Certainly. Our next question is coming from Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Your line is now live. Hey. Thanks for taking the question. I want to go back to just the pricing question prior. If you look at the decline in your Client business a little over 50%, is there a way to think about units versus pricing there and I think there’s a couple of factors. I’d be curious your thoughts mix away from the high end, but then you mentioned competition, just kind of your thoughts as to that impact to pricing as well? Yeah. So, Blayne, it was certainly more units. I think Stacy asked the question earlier. ASPs were down sequentially, but they were up year-over-year. So the decline was more driven by units, but there was an ASP factor on a sequential basis.
And then in terms of what we see in the market, I would say that as the market weakened, there was sort of more pressure at the high end in terms of just velocity and desire to clear inventory. And so the mix did mix towards lower ASPs and towards more incentives to clear that inventory. As it relates to longer term, though, I don’t feel like there’s a longer term significant mix change, if that’s what you were asking. I guess the second part -- maybe I will ask the second part is, gross margins are down 100 basis points from Q3 to Q4, mix is kind of going in your favor with Data Center and Embedded. But then I guess you are saying PCs are not down that much. So I can’t -- I guess I was figuring maybe pricing is not that bad either. So I guess that’s a long way of asking, again, what’s the reason for the core margins to be down 100 basis points from Q3 to Q4? Yeah. Okay. So let me try that. So if you think about what we see in the business. There’s a couple of factors. So if you say, excluding the charges that we described the $160 million in Q3, we were about 52%. We are guiding to 51%.
We do see the client market continuing to be weak. We want to make sure that we have -- we do clear additional inventories. We do see in Data Center a mix to -- when the mix is higher for North America cloud, that tends to be lower ASPs just given the environment in that business.
And then Devinder mentioned that as we increase capacity, particularly in the server market, there were some -- we have some additional capacity coming online and that has a bit of cost impact. So those are the couple of factors that get you to the 51%. Thanks. Sure. Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Harsh Kumar from Piper Sandler. Your line is now live. Yeah. Hey, guys. First of all, thanks for squeezing me in. Lisa, I had a question of the near-term to, call it, mid-term view of the data center market. Do you think that the data center market is inherently growing in the December quarter, the market, not AMD, and do you think -- and/or do you think you are growing because you are launching Genoa? And to that point, you talked about dislocations and sort of the cloud and the data center market. I was curious what specifically are you seeing and if you could differentiate between are you seeing just slower growth or is there inventory that’s built up? And then I have got a follow-up. Yeah. So, look, what I would say is, again, on a very discrete basis, I wouldn’t say the overall data center market is necessarily up. Just given the macro impact, there is some impact on overall spending.
In terms of our business, we do have a weighting towards North America cloud that tends to be sort of the most resilient part of the market. And then as it relates to what’s happening in the market? Like I said, I think, what’s happening is -- enterprise is weak. I think that is overall people -- businesses are just being more cautious. China is weak and has been weak all year.
And then in cloud, in general, there’s not in general, every customer is a bit different in what they are trying to do. Some are just optimizing inventory, some are optimizing footprint and then some are continuing to build. And so I wouldn’t call it a market per se. I would call it their individual instances for each customer.
What’s helpful for us is, what we are talking about is not just Q4 with our customers. We are really talking about what do they need for all of 2023. I mean we are coming from a place where we were supply constrained and so we are planning for the capacity that’s necessary and there, we see which workloads are moving and when are they moving each of the workloads. And so that gives us some visibility into what their spending plans are for 2023. Very helpful, Lisa. And then for my last follow-up, can you talk about the gaming market in general? Of course, September, you mentioned was the peak quarter. So December will be off some. But is this also the peak Gaming year in 2022 and should we be thinking that Gaming will be down or just because these things are still so hard to get, to try to go buy PS5, you still can’t get your hands on it easily. So do you think there’s more legs left to the growth next year? Yeah. So, Harsh, we do believe that there is still some pent-up demand, especially coming into this holiday season. So Q3 was the peak for us this year. Q4 is down seasonally as you might expect.
Going into next year, I think, there are puts and takes. I would say the best way to model at this point is to model Gaming segment flattish and let’s see how the holiday season goes, but that would be the way we would call it at this point. Thank you. We have reached end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over for any further or closing comments. Thanks, Kevin. Thank you everybody for tuning in today and we look forward to connecting with you all throughout the quarter. And we have two important product launches coming up here in the next 10 days, so we will look forward to that engagement. Thanks, everyone. This concludes the call. Thank you. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.

Please refer to the cautionary statement in our press release for more information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.
Now with that, I'll hand the call over to Lisa. Lisa? Thank you, Ruth, and good afternoon to all those listening in today.
Before discussing our financial results, I wanted to make a few comments about our CFO transition. I'd like to start by thanking Devinder for all of his contributions to AMD over the last 39 years. During his tenure as CFO, we built a strong financial foundation that has enabled AMD's significant growth and success. On a personal note, his partnership and expertise have been invaluable to me. I know I speak for all of AMD when I say we appreciate all he has done for the company and wish him the best in his upcoming retirement.
I also want to welcome our new EVP and CFO, Jean Hu, to our first AMD earnings call since joining us earlier this month. Jean's more than 14 years of public company CFO experience and proven track record of financial leadership make her an excellent addition to our team. I look forward to working closely with her as we continue to transform and scale our business.
Now turning to the business results. 2022 was a strong year for AMD as we navigated the challenging macro environment to deliver best-in-class growth and record profitability driven by our Embedded and Data Center segments. We also transformed the company. We accelerated our Data Center business and closed our strategic acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando, significantly diversifying our business and strengthening our financial model as our Data Center, Embedded product sales grew from $3.9 billion in 2021 to $10.6 billion in 2022.
Looking at our financial results. Fourth quarter revenue increased 16% year-over-year to $5.6 billion, driven by significant growth in our Embedded and Data Center segments which accounted for more than 50% of overall revenue in the quarter.
On a full year basis, we grew annual revenue 44% to $23.6 billion. We set annual records for revenue, gross margin and profitability driven largely by a 64% increase in our Data Center segment revenue and the strong performance of our Embedded segment following our Xilinx acquisition.
Turning to the fourth quarter business results, starting with our Data Center segment. Revenue increased 42% year-over-year to $1.7 billion, led by increased adoption of our EPYC processors by cloud providers.
In cloud, sales to North American hyperscalers more than doubled year-over-year as hyperscale customers continued moving more of their internal workloads and external instances to EPYC processors. EPYC processors now power more than 600 publicly available instances globally following the launches of new AMD-based instances from AWS, Microsoft and others in the quarter.
In Enterprise, revenue declined year-over-year as demand slowed based on the macro environment. Against this backdrop, we continue expanding our pipeline and closed a number of new wins in the fourth quarter with Fortune 500 financial services, automotive, technology, energy and aerospace companies.
In HPC, growing EPYC processor adoption was highlighted by the number of AMD-powered supercomputers on the latest Top 500 list increasing by 38% year-over-year. AMD now powers more than 100 of the world's fastest supercomputers and 15 of the top 20 most energy-efficient supercomputers in the world.
To build our Data Center leadership, we launched our fourth gen EPYC processors this past November that deliver up to 2x faster performance in cloud, enterprise and HPC applications, and are up to 80% more energy efficient than the competition's most recently announced offerings. We are seeing very strong customer pull for fourth-gen EPYC CPUs, which complement our third-gen offerings with additional performance and capabilities. Initial cloud deployments are going very well, and we expect to ramp both internal workloads and public instances throughout 2023.
For Enterprise, there are more than 140 fourth-gen EPYC platforms in development from HPE, Dell, Lenovo, Super Micro and others, an increase of 40% compared to the prior generation.
Now looking at our broader Data Center portfolio. We had record sales of our Xilinx Data Center and networking products in the quarter, led by strong demand from financial services companies for our newly launched Alveo X3 series boards, optimized for low latency trading. Sales of our Pensando DPUs also ramped significantly from the prior quarter, driven by supply chain improvements and continued demand. We are very pleased with the customer reception of the Pensando technology with good long-term growth opportunities as DPUs become a standard component in the next generation of cloud and enterprise data centers.
Data center GPU sales were down significantly from a year ago when we had shipments supporting the build-out of multiple Instinct MI250 accelerator supercomputer wins. In January, we previewed our next-generation MI300 accelerator that will be used for large model AI applications in cloud data centers and has been selected to power the 2-plus exaflop El Capitan exascale supercomputer at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories.
MI300 will be the industry's first data center chip that combines a CPU, GPU and memory into a single integrated design, delivering 8x more performance and 5x better efficiency for HPC and AI workloads, compared to our MI250 accelerator currently powering the world's fastest supercomputer. MI300 is on track to begin sampling to lead customers later this quarter and launch in the second half of 2023.
Turning to our Client segment. Revenue declined 51% year-over-year to $903 million. We continue to ship below PC consumption in the fourth quarter as we focused on further reducing downstream inventory. While overall PC demand remains soft, desktop channel sell-through increased sequentially during the holiday season.
We launched our latest generation Ryzen 7000 series notebook processors earlier in January, including our Ryzen 7040 CPU series that deliver leadership performance in battery life and are our first processors to feature Ryzen AI, the industry's only dedicated on-chip AI inference engine in an x86 processor. Ryzen AI is powered by the highly scalable XDNA architecture, which is the first integration of AMD and Xilinx IP, less than a year after closing the acquisition.
We also launched our Ryzen 7045 series CPUs, our first mobile processor based on a triplet design that delivers significantly higher performance than the competition in gaming and content creation applications. We have more than 250 ultrathin gaming and commercial notebook design wins, spanning our full family of Ryzen 7000 series processors on track to launch this year, an increase of 25% year-over-year with the first notebooks planned to go on sale in February.
Now turning to our Gaming segment. Revenue declined 7% year-over-year to $1.6 billion as lower gaming graphics sales more than offset higher semi-custom revenue. Semi-Custom SoC revenue grew year-over-year as demand for game consoles remained strong during the holidays. Gaming graphics revenue declined year-over-year as we further reduced desktop GPU downstream channel inventory.
Channel sell-through of our Radeon RX GPUs increased sequentially, and we launched our high-end Radeon 7900 series GPUs to strong demand based on the performance of our new RDNA 3 architecture and 5-nanometer triplet design. In January, we announced our first RDNA 3 mobile GPUs that have been selected to power new gaming notebooks from Dell, Alienware, ASUS and others that are on track to begin shipping in the first half of 2023.
Looking at our Embedded segment. Revenue increased significantly year-over-year to a record $1.4 billion. We had record sales across a number of our Embedded markets, including communications, automotive, industrial and healthcare, aerospace and defense, and test and emulation.
In communications, we saw particular strength with expanded 5G wireless installations in India and ongoing wired infrastructure deployments with Tier 1 communications providers. Automotive growth was driven by the ramps of new Ford camera, 4D radar and infotainment wins across multiple customers. We recently announced multiple new wins for our automotive grade Zynq UltraScale + platforms with some of the largest vehicle equipment suppliers including ASINs next-generation automated parking assist system and DENSO's next-generation LiDAR platform that can improve the resolution required for autonomous driving and other industrial machine vision applications by 20x.
We also continued to see strong growth with industrial and health care, aerospace and defense and tested and emulation customers in the quarter, driven by SAM expansion for our leadership-adaptive SoCs, new design win ramps and increased supply across multiple nodes.
Taking a step back, as we approach the one year anniversary of the closing of our Xilinx acquisition next month, the integration has gone extremely well, and our Embedded business has become a major growth driver for AMD, strengthening our financial model and significantly diversifying our business.
In addition, we are seeing substantial new revenue synergy opportunities as we combine Xilinx's industry-leading adaptive products and 6,000-plus customers with AMD's expanded breadth of compute products and scale.
In summary, overall, 2022 was a strong year for AMD despite the weak PC market. We significantly grew our Data Center, Embedded and Gaming businesses and executed well across our product portfolio.
As we enter 2023, we expect the overall demand environment to remain mixed with the second half stronger than the first half. In the PC market, we are planning for the PC TAM to be down approximately 10% for 2023. We expect to continue to ship below consumption in the first quarter to reduce downstream inventory, which is reflected in our guidance.
In our Embedded and Data Center segments, we believe we are well positioned to grow revenue and gain share in 2023 based on the strength of our competitive positioning and leadership high-performance and adaptive product portfolio. We do see elevated levels of inventory with some cloud customers, which will lead to a softer first half and a stronger second half of the year.
We continue working very closely with our customers to navigate the dynamic market conditions while also making the right strategic investments to exit the current cycle with an even stronger and more differentiated set of products to drive future growth.
Over the next several years, one of our largest growth opportunities is in AI, which is in the early stages of transforming virtually every industry service and product. We expect AI adoption will accelerate significantly over the coming years and are incredibly excited about leveraging our broad portfolio of CPUs, GPUs and adaptive accelerators in combination with our software expertise to deliver differentiated solutions that can address the full spectrum of AI needs in training and inference across cloud, edge and client.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jean to provide some additional color on our fourth quarter and full year financial results. Jean? Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone.
2022 was a very strong year for AMD. We had a record revenue, gross margin, profitability, and we generated significant free cash flow. The year was also highlighted by our strategic acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando, expanding and diversifying our business portfolio.
Fourth quarter 2022 revenue for $5.6 billion was up 16% from a year ago, driven by higher revenue in the Embedded and Data Center segment, partially offset by lower Client and the Gaming segment revenue.
Gross margin was 51%, up 70 basis points from a year ago, primarily driven by richer product mix with higher revenue in Embedded and Data Center segment, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue. Operating expenses were $1.6 billion compared to $1.1 billion a year ago, driven by the inclusion of Xilinx OpEx and additional R&D and go-to-market investments to support the next phase of our revenue growth.
Operating income declined $66 million from a year ago to $1.3 billion, and the operating margin was 23%, down from 27% a year ago. Net income was $1.1 billion flat year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share was $0.69 compared to $0.92 per share a year ago, primarily due to lower client operating income.
Now turning to our reportable segment for the fourth quarter. Starting with the Data Center segment. Revenue was $1.7 billion, up 42% year-over-year, primarily driven by strong growth in third-generation EPYC server processor revenue and the early ramp of fourth-generation EPYC processors.
Data center operating income was $444 million or 27% of revenue compared to $360 million or 32% a year ago. Higher operating income was driven primarily by stronger revenue, partially offset by higher R&D investment to support the top line revenue growth.
Client segment revenue was $903 million, down 51% year-over-year due to reduced processor shipments resulting from a weak PC market and significant inventory correction across the PC supply chain. Client operating loss was $152 million compared to operating income of $530 million a year ago or 29% of revenue, primarily due to lower revenue.
Gaming segment revenue was $1.6 billion, down 7% year-over-year due to lower gaming graphics revenue, partially offset by higher semi-customer product sales. Gaming operating income was $266 million or 16% of revenue compared to $407 million or 23% a year ago. The decrease was primarily due to lower graphics revenue.
Embedded segment revenue was $1.4 billion, up $1.3 billion from a year ago, primarily due to the inclusion of Xilinx Embedded revenue. Embedded operating income was $699 million or 50% of revenue compared to $18 million or 25% a year ago, primarily driven by the inclusion of Xilinx.
Turning to the balance sheet. We have a strong balance sheet with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment of $5.9 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. During the quarter, we returned $250 million to shareholders through share repurchases. In 2022, we returned a total of $3.7 billion to shareholders which was 119% of free cash flow. We have $6.5 billion in remaining authorization to share repurchases.
Free cash flow was $443 million compared to $736 million in the same quarter last year. Free cash flow decreased primarily due to higher inventory. Inventory was $3.8 billion, up approximately $402 million from the prior quarter, primarily driven by the inventory increase in advanced process nodes to support the ramp of new products.
Now let me turn to our full year financial results. 2022 revenue was $23.6 billion, up 44% year-over-year, driven by increased Embedded, Data Center and the Gaming segment revenue, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue. On our combined AMD and Xilinx company basis, 2022 pro forma revenue was $24.1 billion, up 20% compared to $20.1 billion in 2021.
Gross margin was 52%, up 370 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by richer product mix with higher revenue from Embedded and Data Center segment, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue. Operating expenses were 26% of revenue compared to 24% in 2021. 2022 operating income was $6.3 billion, up $2.3 billion, an increase of 56% from a year ago resulting in operating margin of 27% compared to 25% in 2021, primarily driven by higher revenue and gross margin expansion.
Net income was $5.5 billion compared to $3.4 billion, up 60% from the prior year. Earnings per share was $3.50 compared to $2.79 for the prior year, primarily due to Data Center growth and addition of Xilinx. Full year free cash flow was $3.1 billion, resulting free cash flow margin of 13% for the year. We invested approximately $1 billion in long-term supply chain capacity in 2022 to support our expectations for future revenue growth and increase market share.
Let me now turn to our financial outlook. Today's outlook is based on current expectations and contemplates the current macro environment. For the first quarter of 2023, we expect revenue to be approximately $5.3 billion, plus or minus $300 million, a decrease of approximately 10% year-over-year and 5% sequentially.
Year-over-year Data Center and Embedded segment revenue are expected to grow, offset by lower Client and Gaming segment revenue. Sequentially, Embedded segment revenue is expected to increase. Client and Gaming segment revenue are expected to decline largely consistent with seasonality. Data Center segment revenue is expected to decline due to elevated levels of inventory with some cloud customers.
In addition, for Q1 2023, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 50%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.6 billion; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $146 million based on a 13% effective tax rate. Diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.62 billion shares.
For the full year of 2023, we are not providing specific guidance due to the uncertainty in the macro environment. However, let me provide some color. Directionally, we expect Embedded and Data Center annual revenue to grow from 2022 based on the strength of our product portfolio and expected share gains. In addition, we expect Client and the Gaming segment revenue to decline based on the current demand environment.
We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately flattish in the first half and the expansion in the second half of the year. We expect to manage quarterly non-GAAP operating expenses flat with the fourth quarter until we see the demand environment improves. For modeling purpose, we expect non-GAAP effective tax rate for the year to be 13% and the diluted share count to be approximately 1.62 billion shares.
In closing, we had a strong year with record revenue and profitability, driven by our leadership in product portfolio and the diversification of our business. Looking forward to 2023, as Lisa mentioned earlier, we'll continue to focus on executing our long-term growth strategy while driving financial discipline and operational excellence. We believe our leadership of products, growing customer momentum and strong financial foundation position us well for long-term profitable growth.
With that, I'll turn it back to Ruth for a Q&A session. Thank you, Jean. And operator, if you could poll the audience for questions now, please. Certainly [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Matt Ramsay from Cowen. Your line is now live. Yes, thank you very much. Good afternoon. First of all, congratulations, Jean and congrats as well to Devinder I mean the last five years of the company have been remarkable. But I remember all the work you and your finance team did six or seven years ago to keep the foundation stable for what's happened since. So enjoy the retirement? My first question, Lisa, is just about the drivers of 2023?
You guys talked in the prepared script about all the different crosscurrents that are kind of going on right now versus the strength of your portfolio versus some inventory digestion in the Data Center space and obviously, what's going on in the PC market. But I've gotten about a zillion versions of the same question tonight, which was do you think the company can grow for the year 2023 overall? And if you could just kind of walk us through the drivers of the business as we work through the year? Thanks. Yes, absolutely, Matt. Thanks for the question. So there are lots of puts and takes in 2023, and we want to give you kind of some of the drivers. Our largest growth driver is certainly the Data Center. We are very positioned well with our product portfolio. We just launched our Genoa fourth gen EPYC. We also have Bergamo coming this year as well. When we talk to our cloud customers, what they're telling us is they appreciate the execution of our road map.
And we have an opportunity to move more workloads to AMD as we go through the year. So we feel very good about our product positioning. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, coming off of a very strong 2022, there is some inventory at some of the cloud customers. And so, we are expecting a softer first half and then a stronger second half, but we feel very good about our market share position and opportunity to grow with Data Center.
Also on the embedded side, I would say we have a very strong portfolio there. The Xilinx business has done very well in 2022. It's a diversified set of markets. We see strength in a number of the end markets. And so, we think that's also a grower for AMD. On the other side, our Client and Gaming businesses, we believe, will decline. We have made good progress. When we look at the PC markets in the second half of the year of 2022, we were really trying to rebalance inventory.
And I think we made progress exiting Q4. We're still expecting to ship below consumption in the first quarter and then sort of go from there. Our product portfolio is strong. We think there's an opportunity for growth as we go into the second half of the year. But we think overall for the year, client will decline just given the TAM. And then on the Gaming segment, again, we're coming off of a very strong 2022.
And so console demand has been actually quite strong. And given where we are in the cycle, we would expect gaming to be down on a year-over-year basis. But overall, I think lots of puts and takes, but we're positive on what we can do in terms of the Data Center and the embedded segments, given our product portfolio. And we'll watch the macro on the Client and Gaming and see how that plays out. Thank you very much Lisa for all the details there. I guess as my follow-up, I wanted to ask a question about gross margin. The margin, I guess, sequentially down a little bit into March. But I kind of wanted to focus on the drivers of the longer-term margin that's down, I guess, three or four points from where you were a few quarters ago despite more mix of the revenue coming from Embedded and Data Center?
So if there's any way that you guys could try to quantify maybe how much of the margin headwind is from just lower client revenue? How much of it might be from any programs that you're working through to clear the channel? And how might we model? What are the drivers that we should think about in terms of the margin recovering? Thank you. Yes, maybe - so on the overall margin, the way to think about our business, Matt, is - and our margin is primarily driven by product mix. So as the Embedded and Data Center businesses are - grow, so the margin expansion grows with it. In terms of the sequential question that you had from Q4 to Q1, that's just a product of the mix. So with Data Center being lower sequentially that - that's that. We are also working through our client inventory clearing.
What we're seeing in the PC business is, as we're going through this sort of normalization of inventory, especially on some of the older products, we do have more marketing programs and pricing incentives in place. We do expect that to normalize as we go through the first half of the year. And so as Jean said in the prepared remarks, we would expect margin expansion as we go into the second half with the growth in Data Center, Embedded and some normalization of the client business as well. Thank you. Next question is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Your line is now live. Thanks for taking my question and thanks and best wishes to Devinder and Jean from my side as well. On the first one, Lisa, I think you mentioned some elevated inventory among your cloud customers. I was hoping you could give us some quantification of how elevated? Is it a one quarter issue? Is it a 2-quarter issue? Does it impact the pace of your Genoa ramp because I think coming into this year, the expectations where you could grow server sales by over 20%?
Do you think that is still a possibility because I imagine you get some benefit from better general pricing? So just puts and takes of how we should think about your Data Center business through this year? Yes, sure, Vivek. So look, we remain very bullish about our Data Center business. I mean I think the feedback that we've gotten on Genoa from our customer set is very strong. And as I said, the important thing is we are expanding workloads. In terms of where we believe the - as the inventory normalizes, each customer is different, so they have what they're trying to achieve in terms of inventory levels.
Our expectation is that sort of the first half softness for cloud and then second half strength as that's worked through. But like I said, it's different for each customer. And then in terms of overall growth, as I said, we're very bullish on the overall growth of our Data Center business and the opportunity to gain share as we go through the year. And as we go through the ramp in Genoa, we do have more content with the higher core count that should also help ASPs. Got it. And then on the PC side and also kind of as it relates to the pricing environment, you mentioned the PC TAM is - could be down about 10%. But when we look at the shipments, right, from you and your competitor, they could be down as much as 40% or 50%, right, year-on-year in Q1. So do you think there's a possibility that the TAM assumption of just down 10% could be an optimistic one?
Because I would imagine that would suggest the inventory clears out soon, but you're suggesting that it may not clear out until Q2. So I was just hoping you could give us some better sense for when the PC market starts recovering? And do you think it could become more price competitive before it recovers? Yes. So maybe just to make sure that we're just correlating the numbers. So my comment about PC TAM being down 10% was assuming, if you take a look at sort of what IDC just published for - in 2022 at about 290 million units, and that's more of a sell-through TAM versus a sell-in TAM. So we have been under shipping sort of the sell-through or consumption for the last two quarters in an attempt to renormalize that as soon as possible.
In terms of do I think its conserve - I think it's in the ZIP code. I think it's in the ZIP code. So if you imagine 2023 sell-through TAM of about 260 million units, plus or minus, seems to be about the right number. We have made good progress in inventory normalization. We want to be cautious, obviously, heading into the year just given the macro environment. First quarter, we said would be roughly seasonal for PCs.
I think second quarter - first quarter should be the bottom for us in PCs. We - and then grow from there into the second quarter and then into the second half. And I should note also, Vivek, I mean, we just launched our Ryzen 7000 Series with sort of our AI capabilities, both from a notebook and desktop standpoint.
So, we feel good about the product road map in PCs. Obviously, we have to get through this normalization. Most of the focus is on continuing to differentiate our products and working with our customers to offer sort of very strong platforms. Thank you. Next question is coming from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your line is now live. Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I noted that you said that gross margins would expand in the second half, but you didn't give us any color on how much they might expand. Can you give us any idea like first half to second half? Or I mean just for the full year, do you think gross margins grow year-over-year from the 52% that you printed in 2022? Stacy, this is Jean. Let me take this question, then Lisa can add. As we talk about it, it's both our Embedded and Data Center segment have strong gross margins. So we feel pretty good about second half. We continue to have the growth of both Embedded and Data Center segment. The major headwind we are facing is really Client side, which if you think about the gross margin in the first half of 2022 versus the first half of 2023, the major impact is from the client revenue, inventory correction, which impact the gross margin in the Client segment.
So going into second half, the normalization of the Client segment will help us to expand the gross margin. I think it really depends on how the Client segment will recover. That will drive the gross margin if it's going to go back to the first half of 2022 or expand beyond that level. But overall, we feel pretty good. Once we normalize the Client segment, our gross margin will continue to expand. So I guess, I ask the question again. For 2023, do you think gross margins can expand over 2022? Maybe what I would say, Stacy, is I think we've given you the puts and takes for where the margin goes. I think it depends a bit on what happens in the macro environment. But we do feel good about second half expansion, and we'll see sort of the relative recovery in macro as it relates to all of our segments. Got it. Thank you. I guess for my follow-up, maybe it follows up on that a little bit more just around the mix. I get how Data Center and Embedded should be growing in the second half versus the first half. But presumably, Client will, too, first half to second half, given that you are under shipping, it sounds like by a pretty wide margin right now. How do you feel about your mix just across the four businesses of the second half versus the first half? Do you think your Data Center plus Embedded mix, as a percentage of total revenue in the second half, is materially higher than it is in the first half? Or I mean could it even be not that different at all given the potential growth that you might see just from the channel normalization in clients? Yes. I think the way to think about it is, I think our Data Center grow - growth in the second half versus first half, we expect that to be significantly stronger. As it relates to clients, we would also expect it to be stronger. Again, depending a bit on macro and sort of how the TAM actually evolves.
I think for the Embedded businesses, I would say that we expect to grow over the full year 2023 versus 2022. What we see right now is a fairly strong backlog and good visibility into the first half of the year. I'm not ready to say that Embedded will grow in the second half versus the first half, though, because we're coming off very strong growth already. And so I think those are the puts and takes. Thank you. Next question is coming from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. Good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the question. Lisa, the pushback that we often get is AMD is doing really well, gaining share, but you're gaining share in relatively mature markets. And when it comes to AI, you do have a strategy, but you really haven't shown the product set, if you will. You talked about how you have CPU, GPU, FPGA and Pensando, and you're shipping samples of MI300, I guess, later this quarter and potentially launching in the second half. At what point do we, as analysts and investors, start to see your AI strategy materialize in the P&L and your profitability, if you will. Yes. Thanks for the question. We believe that AI is a huge driver of compute growth. And given our portfolio, it should be a driver of our growth as well. I think if you think about the product sets that we are putting sort of AI content in, you should expect MI300, of course, on the GPU training side. We just launched Ryzen AI in our PC portfolio. You can expect additional AI acceleration coming in our server portfolio as well. So you're going to see AI broadly across our road maps.
In terms of when - we've talked before about sort of our Data Center GPU ambitions and the opportunity there. We see it as a large opportunity. As we go into the second half of the year and launch MI300, sort of the first user of MI300 will be the supercomputers or El Capitan, but we're working closely with some large cloud vendors as well to qualify MI300 in AI workloads. And we should expect that to be more of a meaningful contributor in 2024. So lots of focus on just a huge opportunity, lots of investments in software as well to bring the ecosystem with us. That's very helpful. And then, Lisa, as my follow-up, I had a question on profitability in your client business or your PC business. I think a year ago, margins were really high. Supply was relatively tight. Since then, with the inventory correction and perhaps a little bit more competition, your profit margins are down. You talked about the first half of this year still being sort of in digestion mode, and then in the second half, things normalizing. But would it be realistic to assume your gross margins in the Client business return to first half '22 levels? Or in hindsight, margins back then were perhaps - you were over-earning in that business given the environment? Yes. Sure. So I think on the Client segment, it's fair to say that we believe, given where we are with the client inventory levels, the first half will certainly be lower. We expect some improvement in the second half. But in terms of overall margin, we expect that the client business will be below the corporate average, and that's how we're modeling the client business. Thank you. Next question is coming from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Aaron, perhaps your phone is on mute. Please pick up your handset. Yes. Thanks you for taking the questions. I guess the first question is going back to the Data Center piece of the business and specifically around the ramp of Genoa. I'm curious, is there any help that you can provide us with thinking about the ASP uplift you expect to see with the Genoa product cycle? And I guess at some point through 2023, how do we start to think about the Bergamo product cycle as well impacting the server CPU business? Sure. So Aaron, we started shipping Genoa in the third quarter that ramped into the fourth quarter and will continue to ramp through 2024. The way I think about - or the way you should think about the Genoa ramp is that it is a new platform for our customers. So they'll be introducing it - introducing first-in-cloud sort of internal workloads and then going to external workloads and then enterprise. So I think it will be throughout 2024. We have - I'm sorry, throughout 2023. We do have higher core counts on Genoa.
So you would expect that, that will give us some ASP uplift as we go through to some of those higher core count products. Bergamo will launch in the first half of the year. We are on track for the Bergamo launch, and you'll see that become a larger contributor in the second half. So as we think about the Zen 4 ramp and the crossover to our Zen 3 ramp, it should be towards the end of the year, sort of in the fourth quarter, that you would see a crossover of sort of Zen 4 versus Zen 3, if that helps you. Yes, that's very helpful. And then as a quick follow-up, the business doesn't really ask that much about, but it's been doing phenomenally well here these last couple of quarters. It's actually the Xilinx business. I know it's within the Embedded largely. But your self-reporting, I think if I read the filings correctly, growing 40% plus on a like-for-like basis for Xilinx. I think your competitor also growing a solid pace. How do you think about the sustainability or durability of that demand in that Embedded or Xilinx business as we move through '23? Sure. So Aaron, that business has done very well. So the Xilinx business, I think our overall Embedded business continues to do well. When we look across the subsegments, there are puts and takes in the subsegments. But what we see is content is going up. So we had records in communications, industrial and health care, aerospace and defense, automotive. We have the Embedded processor content that's also going into automotive. So we feel very good about that business.
I think as we look into 2023, I mentioned this in the question with Stacy. We have a very good visibility to the first half just given the lead times and the backlog. And the first half looks strong, so we expect to grow sequentially in the first quarter.
As we go into the second half of the year, we're monitoring the overall demand environment. And just given how strong it's been, we are looking at whether there'll be some puts and takes in some of the end market segments there. But overall, I think the key point is the content, and our design win momentum is good, and we continue to ramp new design wins in the Xilinx business. Thank you. Your next question is coming from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Great, thank you. I wonder if you could talk to us about the puts and takes of PC market share in a down 10% environment. I would assume it helps you with consumers better than commercial, but what is your progress in terms of penetrating the notebook market and penetrating the commercial market where you could continue to gain share? Yes. Joe, we view that the opportunity - so first of all, I would say that in general, the PC market share numbers are probably a bit noisy right now, just given all of the sell-in, sell-through and the inventory dynamics that are being worked through. Actually, in the fourth quarter, we believe we gained a little bit of share in the PC market. As we go forward into 2023, we think our product portfolio is very strong.
As we look at Ryzen 7000 and where it goes and where we are positioned in the commercial as well as the high-end consumer segments, we're not changing our strategy on PCs. Quite - a few years ago, we really focused on sort of the more premium segments. We have less penetration in the low end, which I think is helpful.
And as we go forward, we're continuing to focus on commercial PCs and getting a larger footprint in there. I will say the enterprise work that we're doing on the server side, I think, links very well to the commercial PC work, and we're continuing to invest in sort of the sales and marketing resources to ramp that side of the business. Great. And then going back to the Genoa question that was asked a second ago, as you are in this kind of budget conscious environment, you're introducing a chip in a system that has pretty high platform cost. Does that slow the adoption at all? It seems like people - and your competitors dealing with some of the same issues. Just how does the current environment affect the rate at which Genoa will ramp? Yes. I would say, Joe, the total cost of ownership benefit of Genoa, particularly in some of the larger cloud workloads, is very, very significant. So I wouldn't say that, that's necessarily slowing the pace of adoption. It is a new platform though. So if you think about when we went from Rome to Milan, it was basically similar platforms.
So I would say that, that ramp was a bit faster. But as it relates to Genoa, we had always expected that Milan and Genoa would coexist through 2023. And that we would have - we still have Milan instances that are just ramping now, and we expect that will continue through 2023. And so I really view this as the natural thing when we introduce Genoa at sort of the higher core count, that both will coexist. And as some of the platform costs come down, you'll see the Genoa cutover, and that's what I mentioned towards the fourth quarter of 2023. Thank you. Next question is coming from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live. Thanks for letting me ask a question. And Jean, congrats on the new job. Lisa, I was hoping you could give a little bit of sequential color to just size the magnitude of the three segments that are going down in the first quarter and then Embedded going up. And really what I'm getting at there is, in an answer to a prior question, you talked about the mix being a headwind to gross margin. And I think, Jean, you cited Data Center dropping as a percent of the mix. So just trying to get the magnitude of just how much Data Center has to drop to make that outcome on the mix side be true. Sure, Ross. So let's see. We said the Client and Gaming segments would be seasonal. So you would expect that the Data Center would be more than seasonal. So maybe to help you size that, think about the Data Center sequential drop as double digit, whereas the Client and the Gaming segments are more like single digit, if that helps. Yes, it does. And anything similarly on Embedded? Is that kind of up single digits? Yes. Yes. Embedded will grow sequentially single digit. Yes. Got it. Sorry for the nitpicky question. A bigger picture one for you then, Lisa, on competitive intensity. On one hand, I could see that the total cost of ownership benefits of these products, multicore, better performance, et cetera, could lead to higher ASPs, whether you're talking about the Data Center side or your Client business. On the other side, competitive intensity and overall demand is weaker. And at some point, you might even get deflationary costs on the foundry side of things. Can you talk a little bit about the pricing environment given those somewhat contradictory pressures? Sure. So maybe let me separate Data Center and Client because they're a little bit different. I think on the Data Center side, we would - we do see that, in general, the performance, the power performance, the total cost of ownership, selling the solution is the most important piece of it because the solutions are actually quite different in terms of what you can do between sort of fourth gen EPYC and sort of other solutions. The environment is always competitive, but we feel very good about the overall value proposition that we bring to both cloud and enterprise customers.
I think on the client side, we've said for the last couple of quarters that the pricing environment is more aggressive. I think that normally happens when the industry is working on rebalancing. I think we're working on rebalancing our OEM partners are working on rebalancing. The retailers are working on rebalancing. And so, there are more incentives and more - a more aggressive pricing environment.
I view that, that's primarily on, let's call it, older products let's call it previous generation products. And as we work through that, there will be some normalization as we think about our newer generation products where there's more capability added. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of the puts and takes.
And in terms of the cost environment, I think all of us in the industry have seen some elevated costs, but I think we also see - expect that to normalize too as everyone is sort of optimizing their CapEx spending. Thank you. Thank you. Your next question today is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Hi, thanks for taking my question and congrats to Jean on the new seat. Two questions, if I may. First, on the PC side, can you give us a sense about roughly how far under consumption, you believe, you're shipping on the PC side, either in Q4 and Q1?
And Lisa, correct me if I am wrong, I thought I heard you say in an answer to an earlier question that you expect the PC client, but just to grow into second quarter. So is that suggest that 1Q, you think is the bottom on the PC? And then I had a follow-up? Thank you. Sure, Mark. So we - so the first - the second question, yes. We do believe the first quarter is the bottom for our PC market - for our PC business, and we'll see some growth in the second quarter and then a seasonally higher second half. In terms of the under shipment, I mean, I think we're - we undershipped in Q3, we undershipped in Q4. We will undership, to a lesser extent, in Q1. So I think you can infer that from our guidance single-digit down.
And then we'll be back to a more normal environment. Now just as a reminder though, the first half is not usually a - the first half is usually a seasonally weak client time anyways. So, we would expect more lift in the second half, not so much in the second quarter. Got you, okay. That's very helpful, thank you. And then a follow-up, if I may, on the - China is lifting, as they're lifting the COVID restrictions, I guess I would imagine that you would expect that ultimately, at some point, to translate into higher demand. And I'm wondering if you could just kind of share with us your thoughts about how that might play out?
And could you remind us is, to the extent that you can help us understand of the risk to the supply side for you in the event that the COVID spreads rapidly as they lift the restrictions and impacts what you have on the supply side there? Thank you. Sure, Mark. So we've done a very good job in our supply chain in terms of risk mitigation. So we have - we don't believe that we have a significant risk as it relates to COVID future outbreaks, if there are any. As it relates to China recovery, I think we would benefit from a China recovery. It's very difficult to call. I mean we've seen, certainly in our Data Center business, we saw in the second half of the year and last year in the first half of this year that the China Data Center business has been weak for us.
If there was a recovery, I think we would benefit from that. Similarly, some of the other consumer patterns as well. But it's very difficult to call. So we put that in the bucket of macro uncertainty, and we'll see how it plays out. Operator, we'll take two more questions from two callers, please? Certainly. Our next question is coming from Chris Danley from Citi. Your line is now live. Great, thanks ladies. Congrats on being the first all-female CEO, CFO team - that's means long time coming. So your gross margins held up pretty well for the Q1 guide despite high-margin Data Center business going down. So if the Data Center business remains weak and has a rough quarter in Q2, can we expect a similar gross margin resiliency? Yes, definitely. I think as I said earlier, the major impact on gross margin actually is the PC client side. The stabilization and the bottoming of client business really help us with the gross margin at the current level. Second half, we should see the expansion of gross margin. Sure and as my follow-up on your PC client business. So it - had its correction a little bit later than some of the other folks in the semi industry and was obviously a little bit steeper. Can you talk about why that happened and why we should - should or should not expect that or could that happen in the Data Center business as well? I guess, Chris, what I would say is I think the PC market has been volatile, and we did significantly - coming off the pandemic, there was very high demand during the pandemic, and I think we were all adjusting as we're looking at sort of the demand environment post pandemic and with macro uncertainty. I think the Data Center business we have you know again, we're heavily weighted towards cloud.
And we have very good discussions with our overall customer set in terms of what they need. I think what's going in our favor in the Data Center is our workloads are expanding. And so, we've heard from all of our cloud customers that they're adopting both Milan and Genoa in more workloads than previous. And so I think that gives us good confidence. And frankly, the Data Center customers are also giving us good visibility into what they need for 2023.
So there is an adjustment in the first half. And I think that's something that we understand. And we also expect that we're going to have to ramp up production in the second half as some of the demand resumes. And I think, the overall factor of compute in the cloud being a very important long-term driver is definitely there. So, we feel good about sort of where we're positioned. Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your line is now live. Hi, thanks a lot. Lisa, I had a question on your client business. I know that your competitor at times uses rebates and subsidies. But the numbers that are in their filings have gotten pretty vague. So I take it from your answer to a prior question that you think that's more on legacy parts?
I guess I'm just kind of wondering what changes or impact that's had on your business? And I continue to hear these worries that it's going to have some lasting effect on your share and particularly on your margins? Thanks. Sure, Tim. So let me make a couple of points. I think all of us, as we participate in the PC industry, there are various parts of the ecosystem that we work with. We work with our OEMs we work with our retail partners. We work with our distribution and channel partners. And we're all working together to work through sort of the elevated inventory levels. As I said, I think we've made good progress on that.
And I think we have much better visibility into the various pieces. As it relates to the pricing environment, I do believe that the pricing environment is - particularly when you're clearing older inventory or older generation products, is a bit more competitive. And we see that. As we look forward, the way we're modeling the client business is that we are modeling gross margins to be less than corporate average.
That's different than our previous modeling. So previously, client was more like at corporate average. And I think given the - I think the nice thing is our business is quite a bit more diversified now. And so with our Data Center, Embedded businesses really being strong growth drivers, I think Client continues to be a good market overall. And as we work through this, we will see some of the normalization that Jean mentioned. Thank you well Lisa. And then I guess just as the last thing, you went through some puts and takes on the different pieces for the year, but I just wondered if I could just get you to kind of give a bias for what you think that the revenue for the year is the bias. It sounds to me like the bias is more up than down, but I just wanted to give you a chance to maybe confirm that or not? Thanks. I think, Tim, the answer is yes. But again, let's work through the next couple of quarters. And we feel good about how our products are positioned, and we just need to work through the macro and see how that plays out. Thanks. Great, thank you. That concludes today's earnings call. Again, welcome to Jean, and we're delighted to have her on board, and much gratitude to Devinder for his 39 years of service and all his leadership and we look forward to touching base with all participants throughout the quarter. Thank you. Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.

Now with that, I'll hand the call over to Lisa. Lisa? Thank you, Ruth, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. We executed very well in the first quarter as we delivered better-than-expected revenue and earnings in a mixed demand environment, launched multiple leadership products across our businesses and made significant progress accelerating our AI road map and customer engagements across our portfolio.
First quarter revenue was $5.4 billion, a decrease of 9% year-over-year. Sales of our data center and embedded products contributed more than 50% of overall revenue in the quarter as cloud and embedded revenue grew significantly year-over-year.
Looking at the first quarter business results. Data Center segment revenue of $1.3 billion was flat year-over-year with higher cloud sales, offset by lower enterprise sales. In cloud, the quarter played out largely as we expected. EPYC CPU sales grew by a strong double-digit percentage year-over-year but declined sequentially as elevated inventory levels with some MDC customers resulted in a lower sell-in TAM for the quarter.
Against this backdrop, we were pleased the largest cloud providers further expanded their AMD deployments in the quarter to power a larger portion of their internal workloads and public instances. 28 new AMD instances launched in the first quarter, including multiple confidential computing offerings from Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and Oracle Cloud that take advantage of the unique security features of our EPYC processors. In total, we now have more than 640 AMD-powered public instances available.
Enterprise sales declined year-over-year and sequentially as end customer demand softened due to near-term macroeconomic uncertainty. We continued growing our enterprise pipeline and closed multiple wins with Fortune 500 automotive, technology and financial companies in the quarter. We made strong progress in the quarter, ramping our Zen 4 EPYC CPU portfolio. All of our large cloud customers have generally running in their data centers and are on track to begin broad deployments to power their internal workloads and public instances in the second quarter.
For the enterprise, Dell, HPE, Lenovo, Super Micro and other leading providers entered production on new general server platforms that complement their existing third-gen EPYC platforms. We are on track to launch Bergamo, our first cloud-native server CPU and Gena X, our fourth Gen EPYC processor with 3D chiplets for leadership in technical computing workloads later this quarter. Although we expect server demand to remain mixed in the second quarter, we are well positioned to grow our cloud and enterprise footprint in the second half of the year based on the strong customer response to the performance and TCO advantages of Genoa, Bergamo and GenX.
Now looking at our broader data center business. In networking, Microsoft Azure launched their first instance powered by our Pensando DPU and software stack that can significantly increase application performance for networking intensive workloads by enabling 10x more connections per second compared to non-accelerated instances.
We expanded our data center product portfolio with the launch of our first ASIC-based Alveo data center media accelerator that supports 4x the number of simultaneous video streams compared to our prior generation. In supercomputing, the MAX Plug Society announced plans to build the first supercomputer in the EU, powered by fourth-gen EPYC CPUs and instinct MI-300 accelerators that is expected to deliver a 3x increase in application performance and significant TCO improvements compared to their current system.
Our AI activities increased significantly in the first quarter, driven by expanded engagements with a broad set of data center and embedded customers. We expanded the software ecosystem support for our instinct GPUs in the first quarter, highlighted by the launch of the widely used Pie Torch 2.0 framework, which now offers native support for our software. In early April, researchers announced they used the LUMI supercomputer powered by third-gen EPYC CPUs and instinct MI250 accelerators to train the largest finished language model to date.
Customer interest has increased significantly for our next-generation instinct MI300 GPUs for both AI training and inference of large language models. We made excellent progress achieving key MI300 silicon and software readiness milestones in the quarter, and we're on track to launch MI300 later this year to support the El Capitan exascale supercomputer win at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and large cloud AI customers.
To execute our broad AI strategy and significantly accelerate this key part of our business, we brought together multiple AI teams from across the company into a single organization under Victor Peng. The new AI group has responsibility for owning our end-to-end AI hardware strategy and driving development of a complete software ecosystem, including optimized libraries, models and framework expanding our full product portfolio.
Now turning to our client segment. Revenue declined 65% year-over-year to $739 million as we shipped significantly below consumption to reduce downstream inventory. As we stated on our last earnings call, we believe the first quarter was the bottom for our client processor business. We expanded our leadership desktop and notebook processor portfolio significantly in the quarter. In desktops, we launched the industry's fastest gaming processors with our Ryzen 7000 X3D series CPUs that combine our Zen 4 core with industry-leading 3D chiplet packaging technology.
In mobile, the first notebooks powered by our Dragon range CPUs launched a strong demand, with multiple third-party reviews highlighting how our 16 core Ryzen 9 7945HS CPU is now the fastest mobile processor available. We also ramped production of our Zen 4-based Phoenix Ryzen 7040 series CPUs in the first quarter for ultrathin and gaming notebooks to support the more than 250 ultrathin gaming and commercial notebook design wins on track to launch this year from Acer, Asus, Dell, HP and Lenovo.
Looking at the year, we continue to expect the PC TAM to be down approximately 10% for 2023 to approximately 260 million units. Based on the strength of our product portfolio, we expect our client CPU sales to grow in the second quarter and in the seasonally stronger second half of the year.
Now turning to our Gaming segment. Revenue declined 6% year-over-year to $1.8 billion as higher semi-custom revenue was offset by lower gaming graphics sales. Semi-custom SoC revenue grew year-over-year as demand for premium consoles remain strong following the holiday cycle.
In gaming graphics, channel sell-through of our Radeon 6000 and Radeon 7000 series GPUs increased sequentially. We saw strong sales of our high-end Radeon 7900 XTX GPUs in the first quarter, and we're on track to expand our RDNA 3 GPU portfolio with the launch of new mainstream Radeon 7000 series GPUs this quarter.
Looking at our Embedded segment. Revenue increased significantly year-over-year to a record $1.6 billion. We saw strength across the majority of our embedded markets, led by increased demand from industrial, vision and health care, test and emulation, communications, aerospace and defense and automotive customers. Demand for our adaptive computing solutions continues to grow as industrial vision and health care customers actively work to add more advanced compute capabilities across their product lines.
We also released new Vitis AI software libraries to enable advanced visualization and AI capabilities for our medical customers and launched our next-generation platform that provides a turnkey solution to deploy our leadership adaptive computing capabilities for smart camera, industrial and machine vision applications.
In Communications, we saw strength with wired customers as new infrastructure design wins ramped into production. We also launched Zinc RF SoC products to accelerate 4G and 5G radio deployments in cost-sensitive markets and formed our first telco solutions lab to validate end-to-end solutions based on AMD CPU, adaptive SoCs, FPGAs, DPUs and software.
In automotive, deployments of our adaptive silicon solutions for high-end ADAS and AI features grew in the quarter, highlighted by Subaru rolling out its AMD-based iSIGHT 4 platform across their full range of vehicles. In addition, we expanded our embedded processor portfolio with the launches of Ryzen 5000 and EPYC 9000 embedded series processors with leadership performance and efficiency as we focus on growing share in the security, storage edge server and networking markets.
Looking more broadly across our embedded business, we are making great progress in bringing together our expanded portfolio and scale to drive deeper engagements with our largest embedded customers.
In summary, I'm pleased with our operational and financial performance in the first quarter. In the near term, we continue to see a mixed demand environment based on the uncertainties in the macro environment. Based on customer demand signals, we expect second quarter revenue will be flattish sequentially with growth in our client and data center segments, offset by modest declines in our Gaming and Embedded segments.
We remain confident in our ability to grow in the second half of the year, driven by adoption of our Zen 4 product portfolio, improving demand trends in our client business and the early ramp of our instinct MI300 accelerators for HPC and AI.
Looking longer term, we have significant growth opportunities ahead based on successfully delivering our road maps and executing our strategic data center and embedded property priorities, led by accelerating adoption of our AI products. We are in the very early stages of the AI computing era, and the rate of adoption and growth is faster than any other technology in recent history.
And as the recent interest in generative AI highlights, bringing the benefits of large language models and other AI capabilities to cloud, edge and endpoints require significant increases in compute performance. AMD is very well positioned to capitalize on this increased demand to compute based on our broad portfolio of high-performance and adaptive compute engines, the deep relationships we have established with customers across a diverse set of large markets, and our expanding software capabilities.
We are very excited about our opportunity in AI. This is our #1 strategic priority, and we are engaging deeply across our customer set to bring joint solutions to the market, led by our upcoming instinct MI300 GPUs, Ryzen 7040 Series CPUs with Ryzen AI, Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoCs, LVO V70 data center inference accelerators and Versal AI adaptive data center and edge SoCs. I look forward to sharing more about our AI progress over the coming quarters as we broaden our portfolio and grow the strategic part of our business.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jean to provide some additional color on our first quarter results. Jean? Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results for the first quarter and then provide our current outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. As a reminder, for comparative purposes, first quarter 2022 results included the only partial quarter financial results from the acquisition of Xilinx, which closed in February 2022.
Revenue in the fourth quarter was $5.4 billion, a decrease of 9% year-over-year as Embedded segment strength was offset by lower Client segment revenue. Gross margin was 50%, down 2.7 percentage points from a year ago, primarily impacted by Client segment performance.
Operating expenses were $1.6 billion, increasing 18% year-over-year, primarily due to inclusion of a full quarter of expenses from Xilinx and Pensando acquisitions. Operating income was $1.1 billion, down $739 million year-over-year, and the operating margin was 21%. Interest expense, taxes and other was $128 million. For the first quarter, diluted earnings per share was $0.60 due to better-than-expected revenue and operating expenses.
Now turning to our reportable segment for the first quarter. Starting with the Data Center segment, revenue was $1.3 billion, flat year-over-year, driven primarily by higher sales of EPYC processors to cloud customers, offset by lower enterprise server processor sales.
Data Center segment operating income was $148 million or 11% of revenue compared to $427 million or 33% a year ago. Lower operating income was primarily due to product mix and increased R&D investments to address large opportunities ahead of us.
Client segment revenue was $739 million, down 65% year-over-year as we shipped significantly below consumption to reduce downstream inventory. We expect an improvement in second quarter Client segment revenue and a seasonally stronger second half. Client segment operating loss was $172 million compared to operating income of $692 million a year ago, primarily due to lower revenue.
Gaming segment revenue was $1.8 billion, down 6% year-over-year. Semi customer revenue grew double-digit percentage year-over-year, which was more than offset by lower gaming graphics revenue. Gaming segment operating income was $314 million or 18% of revenue compared to $358 million or 19% a year ago. Decrease was primarily due to lower gaming graphics revenue.
Embedded segment revenue was $1.6 billion, up $967 million year-over-year, primarily due to full quarter of Xilinx revenue and the strong performance across multiple end markets. Embedded segment operating income was $798 million or 51% of revenue compared to $277 million or 46% a year ago, primarily driven by the inclusion of a full quarter of Xilinx.
Turning to the balance sheet and the cash flow. During the quarter, we generated $486 million in cash from operations, reflecting our strong financial model despite the mixed demand environment. Free cash flow was $328 million. In the first quarter, we increased inventory by $464 million, primarily in anticipation of the ramp of new Data Center and Client product in advanced process node. At the end of the quarter, cash, cash equivalents and such short-term investment were $5.9 billion, and we returned $241 million to shareholders through share repurchases. We have a $6.3 billion in remaining authorization for share repurchases. In summary, in an uncertain macroeconomic environment, the AMD team executed very well, delivering better-than-expected top line revenue and earnings.
Now turning to our second quarter 2023 outlook. We expect revenue to be approximately $5.3 billion, plus or minus $300 million, a decrease of approximately 19% year-over-year and approximately flat sequentially. Year-over-year, we expect the Client, Gaming and the Data Center segment to decline, partially offset by Embedded segment growth. Sequentially, we expect Client and Data Center segment growth to be offset by modest Gaming and Embedded segment decline.
In addition, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 50%. Non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.6 billion. Effective tax rate to be 13%. And the diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.62 billion shares.
In closing, I'm pleased with our strong top line and bottom line execution. We have a very strong financial model, and we'll continue to invest in our long-term strategic priorities, including accelerating our AI offerings to drive sustainable value creation over the long term.
With that, I'll turn it back to Ruth for Q&A session. Thank you, Jean. And Kevin, we're happy to pull the audience for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is coming from the Vivek Arya from Bank of America. For my first one, Lisa, when I look at your full year Data Center outlook for some growth, that implicitly suggest Data Center, right, could be up 30% in the second half versus the first half, right? And I'm curious, what is your confidence and visibility and some of the assumptions that go into that view?
Is it -- do you think there is a much bigger ramp in the new products? Is it enterprise recovery? Is it pricing? So just give us a sense for how we should think about the confidence and visibility of the strong ramp that is implied in your second half Data Center outlook? Right. So Vivek, thanks for the question. Maybe let me give you some context on what's going on in the Data Center right now. First of all, we have said that it's a mixed environment in the Data Center. So the first half of the year, there are some of the larger cloud customers that are working through some inventory and optimization as well as a weaker enterprise.
As we go into the second half of the year, we see a couple of things. First, our road map is very strong. So the feedback that we're getting working with our customers on, it's ramping well. It is very differentiated in terms of TCO and overall performance. So we think it's very well positioned. Much of the work that we've done in the first half of the year -- in the first quarter and here in the second quarter is to ensure that we complete all of that work such that we can ramp across a broader set of workloads as we go into the second half of the year.
And then I would say, from an overall market standpoint, I think enterprise will still be mixed with the notion that we expect some improvement. It depends a little bit on the macro situation. And then as we go into the second half of the year, in addition to Genoa, we're also ramping Bergamo. So that's on track to launch here in the second quarter and will ramp in the second half of the year. And then as we get towards the end of the year, we also have our GPU ramp of MI300. So with that, we start the ramp in the fourth quarter of our supercomputing wins as well as our early cloud AI wins. So those are all the factors. Of course, we'll have to see how the the year play about how we're positioned from an overall product and road map standpoint for Data Center. All right. And for my follow-up, Lisa, how do you see the market share evolve in the Data Center in the second half? Do you think that the competitive gap between your and your competitors' products, has that narrowed? Or you still think that in the second half, you have a chance to gain market share in the Data Center? Yes, absolutely, Vivek. Well, I mean, we've gained share nicely over the last 4 years. When you look at our Data Center progression, it's actually been pretty steady. As we go into the second half of this year, I think we continue to believe that we have a very strong competitive position. So we do think that positions us well to gain share.
In the conversations that we're having with customers, I think they're enthusiastic about Zen 4 and what it can bring into cloud workloads as well as enterprise workloads. I think actually Genoa is extremely well positioned for enterprise where we have been underrepresented. So we feel good about the road map. I mean, obviously, it's competitive, but we feel very good about our ability to continue to gain share. Next question is coming from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Lisa, I wanted to ask about the Embedded business. It's been a really strong business for you since the acquisition of Xilinx, you're guiding the business down sequentially in Q2. Is this sort of the macro/cycle kicking in? Or is it something supply related? If you can kind of expand on the Q2 outlook there and your expectations for the second half, that would be helpful. Yes, absolutely, Toshiya. Thanks for the question. I mean I think the Embedded business has performed extremely well over the last 4 or 5 quarters. Q1 was another record for the Embedded business. When we look underneath it, there is a broad set of market segments that we have exposure to, and the majority of them are actually doing very well. .
Our thought process for sort of modest decline into Q2 is that we did have a bunch of backlog that we're in the process of clearing and that backlog will clear in Q2, and then we expect that the growth will moderate a bit. We still very much like the positioning of sort of our aerospace and defense, our industrial, our test and emulation business our automotive business. We expect wireless trends to be a little bit weaker as well as consumer trends. So those are the kind of the puts and takes in the market. But I would say the business has performed well above our expectations. That's helpful. And then as my follow-up, maybe one for Jean on the gross margin side of things. In your slide deck, I think you're guiding gross margins up half over half in the second half. Can you maybe speak to the puts and takes and the drivers as you think about gross margins over the next 6 to 9 months? Yes. Thank you for the question. Our gross margin is primarily driven by mix. If you look at the first half -- first quarter performance and second quarter guide, we are very pleased with the strong gross margin performance in both the Data Center and the embedded segment. We haven't been seeing headwinds from a Client segment impacting our gross margin.
Going to the second half, we do expect gross margin improvement because Data Center is going up and the Embedded continue to be relatively strong. The pace of improvement in the second half actually will be largely dependent on the Client segment. We think the Client segment gross margin is also going to improve. But overall, it's going to be below corporate average. So the pace of improvement of gross margin could be dependent on the pace for the Client business recovery in second half. But in the longer term, right, when we look at our business opportunities, the largest incremental revenue opportunities are going to come from Data Center and Embedded segment. So we are building very good about longer-term gross margin going up continuously. Next question is coming from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. I've got two as well. I guess the first question going back on just like the cadence of the server CPU cycle with Genoa and Bergamo. And I think it's great to hear that you guys are on track to launch Bergamo here. But there's been some discussion here throughout this last quarter around some DDR5 challenges. I think there's PMEC issues. I'm just curious of how you -- if those issues have presented themselves or how you would characterize the cadence of the ramp cycle of Genoa at this point? Yes. Sure, Aaron. So yes, look, I think Genoa, we always said, as we launched it, that it would be a little bit more of a longer transition compared to Milan because it is a new platform. So it is the new DDR5, it's PCI Gen 5. And for many of our top customers, they're also doing other things other than upgrading the CPUs.
So from that standpoint, I would say the ramp is going about as we expected. We've seen a lot of interest, a lot of customer engineering work that we're doing together in the data centers with our customers, we feel great about the set of workloads, and we see expansion in the workloads going forward. So overall, our expectation is, particularly as we go into the second half, we'll see Genoa ramp more broadly. But Genoa and Milan are going to coexist throughout the year, just given sort of the breadth of platforms that we have. And anything specific on the DDR5 questions that come up? And then I'm curious if my second question just real quick is the MI300, if we look out beyond just the deployment through the course of this year, how do you guys think about success in that data center GPU market to we think about beyond just? Yes. Sure, Aaron. So back to the DDR5 question, we haven't seen anything specific on DDR5. And it's just normal platform bring up that we're seeing. Now as it relates to your question about MI300, look, we're really excited about the AI opportunity. I think that is success for us is having a significant part of the AI overall opportunity. AI for us is broader than cloud. I mean it also includes what we're doing in Clients and Embedded. But specifically, as it relates to MI300, MI300 is actually very well positioned for both HPC or supercomputing workloads as well as for AI workloads.
And with the recent interest in generative AI, I would say the pipeline for MI300 has expanded considerably here over the last few months, and we're excited about that. We're putting a lot more resources. I mentioned on the prepared remarks, the work that we're doing, sort of taking our Xilinx and sort of the the overall AMD AI efforts and collapsing them into one organization that's primarily to accelerate our AI software work as well as platform work. So success for MI3100 is for sure, a significant part of sort of the growth in AI in the cloud. And I think we feel good about how we're positioned there. Next question is coming from Matt Ramsey from TD Cowen. Yes. Lisa, my first question, I think just the way the business has trended, right, with enterprise and with China in the data center market being a bit softer recently, and it seems like that's kind of continuing into the second quarter. It occurs to me that a big percentage of your data center business, particularly in server in the second half of the year is going to be driven by U.S. hyperscale.
And I guess my question is the level of visibility you have to unit volumes, to pricing, to timing of ramps. If you could walk us through that a little bit, given it's customer concentrated. I imagine you have some level of visibility. And you mentioned growth for the year-end data center. If you could be a little bit more precise there, that's -- I understand there's market dynamics, but it's a bit of a big comment and helps to just push me to ask about quantifying the growth for the year. Sure. Matt, thanks for the question. So look, I think as we work with our largest cloud customers in the Data Center segment, particularly with our EPYC CPUs, we have very good conversations in terms of what their ramp plans are, what their qualification plans are, which workloads, which instances. So I feel that we have good visibility. Obviously, some of this is still dependent on overall macro situation and overall demand. But our view is that there is a lot of good progress in the Data Center.
Now in terms of quantification, as I said, there's a lot of puts and takes. My view is that enterprise will improve as we go into the second half, and we're even seeing, I would say, some very early signs of some improvement in China as well. So our view is, I think, double-digit Data Center growth is what we currently see. And certainly, we would like to ramp Genoa and Bergamo as a large piece given the strength of those products, we'd like to see them grow share here over the next couple of quarters. Lisa, that's helpful. For my follow-up question, I think in the prepared scripts, we're obviously undershipping sell-through to clear the channel in the Client business in the first half of the year. And I think the language that was used was seasonal improvements in the second half. So are you guys expecting to come back to shipping in line with sell-through so to stop under-shipping demand? And then for on top of that seasonal improvements in the market? Or -- and if you could just kind of help me think about the magnitude and the moving pieces in Client for the second half? Yes. So we've been undershipping sort of consumption in the Client business for about 3 quarters now. And certainly, our goal has been to normalize the inventory in the supply chain so that shipments would be closer to consumption. We expect that, that will happen in the second half of the year, and that's what the comment meant that we believe that there will be improvements in the overall inventory positioning.
And then we also believe that the Client market is stabilizing. So Q1 was the bottom for our business as well as for the overall market. From what we see although it will be a gradual set of improvements, we do see that the overall market should be better in the second half of the year. We like our product portfolio a lot. I'm excited about having AI-enabled on our Ryzen 7000 series. And we have leadership notebook platforms with Dragon Range. Our desktop road map is also quite strong with our new launch of the Verizon 7000 X3D products.
And so I think here in the second quarter, we'll still undership consumption a bit. And by the second half of the year, we should be more normalized between shipments and consumption, and we expect some seasonal improvement into the second half. Your next question is coming from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Yes, I guess same question in terms of the cloud business. You mentioned some combination of kind of digestion of spending and inventory reduction. Can you give us a sense of how much inventory was there in hyperscale? How much has it come down? And how much are you sort of maybe undershipping demand in that segment. Yes. I think, Joe, this is a bit harder because every customer is different. What we're seeing is different customers are at a different place in their sort of overall cycle. But let me say it this way though. I think we have good visibility with all of our large customers in terms of what they're trying to do for the quarter, for the year. Obviously, some of that will depend on how the macro plays out. But from our viewpoint, I think we're also going through a product transition between Milan and Genoa and some of these workloads.
So if you put all those things into the conversation, that's why our comment was that we will -- we do believe that the second quarter will grow modestly and then there'll be more growth in the second half of the year as it relates to the Data Center business. So there lots of puts and takes, every customers in a bit of a different cycle. But overall, the number of workloads that they're going to be using AMD on, we believe, will expand as we go through the next few quarters. Great. And then for my follow-up, I mean, you mentioned interest in MI300 around generative AI. Can you talk to -- is that right now kind of a revenue pipeline with major hyperscalers? Or is that sort of more indication of interest level? Just trying to figure out where you are in terms of establishing yourself in that market? Yes. I would say, Joe, we've been at this for quite some time. So AI has been very much a strategic priority for AMD for quite some time. With MI250, we've actually made strong progress. We mentioned in the prepared remarks some of the work that was done on the LUMI supercomputer with generative AI models. We've continued to do quite a bit of library optimization with MI250 and software optimization to really ensure that we could increase the overall performance and capabilities.
MI300 looks really good. I think from everything that we see, the workloads have also changed a bit in terms of -- whereas a year ago, much of the conversation was primarily focused on training. Today, that has migrated to sort of large language model inferencing, which is particularly good for GPUs. So I think from an MI300 standpoint, we do believe that we will start ramping revenue in the fourth quarter with cloud AI customers and then it will be more meaningful in 2024. Next question is coming from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Good to see the strong dynamics in Embedded, very diverse end markets. And given their strong market share position here, the Valens team is in a really good position to catalyze EPYC attach or Ryzen attached to their FPGA and adaptive compute solutions, right? I think embedded x86 is like a $6 billion to $8 billion per year market opportunity. So, Lisa, given you're a year with Xilinx in the portfolio, can you just give us an update on the synergy unlock and driving higher AMD compute attached to Xilinx sockets? Yes. Thanks, Harlan. It's a great question. The Xilinx portfolio has done extremely well with us. Very strong, I would say, we continue to get more content attached to the FPGAs and the adaptive SoCs. We have seen the beginnings of good traction with the cross-selling and that is opportunity to take both Ryzen and EPYC CPUs into the broader embedded market. I think the customers are very open to that. I think we have a sales force and a go-to-market capability across this customer set that is very helpful for that.
So I do believe that this is a long-term opportunity for us to continue to grow our embedded business. And we've already seen some design wins as a result of the the combination of the Xilinx portfolio and the AMD portfolio, and I think we'll see a lot more of that going forward. Great. And in terms of other opportunities, there appears to be this trend towards more of your cloud and hyperscale customers opting to do their own silicon solutions around accelerated compute or AI offload ends, right? And if I look at it right, there are less than a handful of the world semiconductor companies that have the compute, graphics, connectivity IP portfolio that you guys have as well as the capabilities to design these very complex offload SoCs, right? Does the team have a strategy to try and go after some of the semi-custom or full-blown ASIC-based hyperscale programs? We do, Harlan, and I would put it more broadly. And the more -- the broader point is, I think we have a very complete IP portfolio across CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, adaptive SoCs, DPUs and a very capable semi-custom team. And so beyond hyperscalers, I think when we look at sort of higher volume opportunities, we think there are higher volume opportunities beyond game consoles that there are custom opportunities available. So I think that combination of IP is very helpful. I think it's a long-term opportunity for us, and it's one of the areas where we think we can add value to our largest customers. Next question is coming from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Lisa, I just want to talk about the pricing environment in a general sense. You guys have done a great job of increasing the benefits to your customers and being able to raise prices, pass along cost increases, those sorts of things. But the competitive intensity and the weakness in the market, at least currently seems to -- that it could work against that.
So in the near term and then perhaps exiting this year into the next couple of years, can you just talk about where you think pricing is going to go across both your Data Center market, most importantly, but then also in your Client market? Yes. I think, Ross, what I would say is a couple of things. I think in the Data Center market, the pricing is relatively stable. And what that comes from is -- our goal is to add more capability, right? So it's a TCO equation where as we're going from Milan to Genoa, we are adding more cores, more performance. And the performance per dollar that we offer to our customers is one where it's advantageous for them to adopt our technologies and our solutions. So I expect that.
I think in the Client business, given some of the inventory conditions in there, I think there's -- it's a more competitive environment. We're all -- from my standpoint, we're focused on normalizing the inventory levels. And with that normalization, the most important thing is to ensure that we get the shipments more in line with consumption because I think that's a healthier business environment overall. And then, again, it's back to product values, right? So we have to ensure that our products continue to offer superior performance per dollar, performance per watt capabilities in the market. And pivoting for my follow-up on the AI side and MI300. I just wanted to know what you would describe as your competitive advantages? Everybody knows that's a market that's exploding right now. There's tons of demand. You guys have all the IP to be able to attack it. But there's a very large incumbent in that space as well.
So when you think about what AMD can bring to the market, whether it's hardware, software, heterogeneity of the products you can bring, et cetera, what do you think is the core competitive advantage that can allow you to penetrate that market successfully? Yes. There's a couple of aspects, Ross. And -- yes, since we haven't yet announced MI300, all of the specifications will -- some of those will come over the coming quarters. MI300 is the first solution that has both the CPU and GPU together, and that has been very positive for the supercomputing market. .
I think as it relates to generative AI, and we think we have a very strong value proposition from both a hardware and again, it's a performance per dollar conversation, I think there's a lot of demand in the market. And there's also -- I think given our deep customer relationships on the EPYC side, there's actually a lot of synergy between the customer set between the EPYC CPUs and the sort of 300 GPU customers.
So I think when we look at all these together, our view is that demand is strong for AI. And I think our position is also very strong given there are very, very few products that can really satisfy these large language model sort of needs. And I think we feel confident that we can do that. Next question is coming from Tim Arcuri from UBS Lisa, there was a lot more talk on this call about AI. And obviously, PyTorch 2.0 now supporting ROCm is a great step forward. But how much would you say software is going to dictate how successful you can be for these workloads? You had mentioned that you're forming this new group, this new AI group. Do you have the internal software capabilities to be successful in AI? Tim, I think the answer is yes. I think we have made significant progress even over the last year in terms of our software capabilities. And the way you should think about our AI portfolio is it's really a broad AI portfolio across client sort of edge as well as cloud. And with that, I think the Xilinx team brings a lot of background and capability, especially in inference. We've added significant talent in our AI software as well.
And the beauty of particularly the cloud opportunity is it's not that many customers, and it's not that many workloads. So when you have sort of very clear customer targets, we're working very, very closely with our customers on optimizing for a handful of workloads that generate significant volume. That gives us a very clear target for what winning is in the market. So we feel good about our opportunities in AI. And I'd like to say that it's a multiyear journey. So this is the beginning what we think is a very significant market opportunity for us over the next 3 to 5 years. And I guess as my follow-up. So can I -- can you just give us a sense of sort of the overall profile that you see for revenue into the back half? I know you said that Data Center and Embedded will be up this year. It sounds like Data Center probably up double digits. But I also wanted to confirm that you think that total revenues also will be up this year year-over-year. Right, Tim. So I think as we said, we're not guiding the full year just given all the puts and takes. So we see Q2 is flattish second half return to growth. We'll have to see exactly how the macro plays out across PCs and enterprise. But yes, we feel good about growth in Embedded, growth in Data Center -- on the data center side, double-digit growth sort of half year-over-year. And then we'll see how the rest of the segments play out. . Your next question is coming from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO Capital Markets. Actually, I wanted to come back to the first quarter for Data Center. That's a pretty big gap between -- on a Q-over-Q basis on your business versus Intel. And I think almost 2x. This is the first time you would have lost share on a Q-over-Q basis in a long time. So could you please address that? And I acknowledge that quarters can be pretty volatile, but it seems to be a pretty large gap.
And then for my follow-up, just remind us again, please, for the full year growth for Data Center, kind of what's embedded in the assumptions for cloud as well as enterprise? Yes. Let me make sure I get your question, Ambrish. So you're asking about Q1 Data Center and whether we think we've lost share on a sequential basis? Right. If I look at just your report versus what Intel reported on a Q-over-Q basis, it clearly on a year-over-year basis, you have gained share. But I'm just comparing down $14 million versus what you reported, and so that would imply that you had a share loss versus them unless the Data Center GPU and the Xilinx business was down significantly also on a Q-over-Q basis. Yes. Ambrish, maybe I'll give you a little bit of color is definitely in Q1, the other networking business, including GPU, have been down that definitely is the case. But from a share perspective, when we look at overall Q1 reported revenue from both sides and analyze the data, we don't believe we lost the share. Yes, that's right, Ambrish. So I think you just have to go through each of the pieces. But I think from an EPYC or a server standpoint, we don't believe we lost share. If anything, we might have gained a little bit. But I think overall, I wouldn't look at it so closely on a quarter-by-quarter basis because there are puts and takes. From what we see overall, we believe that we have a good overall share progression as we go through the year. And then the underlying assumptions for full year for Data Center? Underlying assumptions for the full year. I think the key pieces that I talked about are Q2, let's call it, modest growth. We still expect some cloud optimization to be happening. As we go into the second half of the year, we'll see a stronger ramp of Genoa and the beginnings of the ramp of Bergamo, we think enterprise is still more dependent on macro, but we do believe that, that improves as we go into the second half of the year. And then we'll have the beginnings of our MI300 ramped in the fourth quarter for both supercomputing and some early AI workloads. Next question is coming from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. For my first one, Lisa, can you just like clarify this explicitly for me. So you said double-digit Data Center. Was that a full year statement? Or was that a second half year-over-year statement? Or was that a half-over-half statement for Data Center? Yes. Let me be clear. That was a year-over-year statement. So double-digit Data Center growth for the full year of 2023 versus 2022. Got it. Which just given what you did in Q1 and sort of are implying for Q2 needs something like 50% year-over-year growth in the second half to get there. So you're endorsing those -- you're endorsing that now? I am... Yes, your math is right. Okay. For my second question, Jean, you made a comment on gross margins where you said the increase of gross margins in the second half was dependent on gross margin in Client getting better. I just want to make sure, did I hear that right? And why should I expect Client margins would get better, especially given what Intel has been doing in that space to protect everything? Like why is that something that's going to happen? Yes, Stacy, that's a good question. The way to think about it is if you look at our Q1 gross margins and the Q2 guide around 50%. And as you know, both our Data Center and Embedded have a very strong gross margin performance. And so what the headwinds that impact our gross margin is really PC client on the side, which, as we talked about, is we are shipping significantly under the consumption and also to digest inventory in the downstream supply chain.
As you know, typically, that's the time you get a significant pressure on the ASP side and on the funding side, that's why our gross margin in the Client segment has been challenged. In second half, we know it's going to be normalized. That's very important fact is when you normalize the demand and the supply, and we continue to plan a very competitive environment, so don't get us wrong on that front. But it will be better because you are not digesting the inventory, the channel funding, everything, those kind of price reduction will be much less. So we do think the second half will side, the gross margin will be better than first half. Got it. And I apologize, I misspoke as well. 50% half of were half in Data Center, not year-over-year. So we're all doing it. Our next question is coming from Blayne Curtis from Barclays. I had two. Maybe just to start with following on Stacy's prior question. Could you just comment on what client ASPs did in the March quarter? I mean I assume they're down a decent amount. Your competitor was down, but any color you could provide on what the environment was in March? Yes, sure, Blayne. So the ASPs were down quite a bit on a year-over-year basis, if you're talking about the overall Client business. And what that is, is that's also the Client ASPs were higher in the first half of '22, if you just think about what the supply environment was or the demand environment was in that. And given that we're undershipping in the first quarter, the ASPs are lower. Got it. And then I just wanted to ask you on the Data Center business, the operating profit is down a ton sequentially. And you talked about enterprise being down, I think that's part of it. But it's a big drop, and it looks like gross margin probably is down a bunch too. Can you just comment on why that drop in profitability in Data Center? Yes, Blayne, that's a good question. I think when you look at the year-over-year, you're absolutely right. Revenue is largely flattish, but operating margin dropped significantly. There are 2 major drivers. The first is we have increased the investment significantly, especially in networking and AI. As you may recall, we closed the Pensando last May or June. So this is the full quarter for Pensando expenses versus last year. Plus we also increased GPU investment under AI investment. That's all under the Data Center bucket.
Secondly, I mentioned about product mix. Lisa said year-over-year cloud sales grew double digits significantly and enterprise actually declined. So in Q1, our revenue in data center is heavily indexed to the cloud market. versus last year in Q1. Typically, cloud gross margin is lower than enterprise. We do expect, even in Q2, it will be balanced -- more balanced and going forward, we do think the enterprise side will come back. But I guess the big decline was sequential. So I'm assuming cloud was down sequentially? Yes. Sequential, it's revenue. If you look at the revenue, it was down very significantly, right? And the mix also is a little bit more indexed to cloud sequentially too. Yes. It's the same factors. Yes. So both the mix to cloud as well as the R&D expense has increased just given the large opportunities that we have across the data center and especially AI. Your final question today is joined from Harsh Kumar from Piper Sandler. Lisa, I had a question. I wanted to ask you about your views on the inferencing market for generative AI 3+. Specifically, I wanted to ask because I think there's some cross currents going on. We're hearing that CPUs are the best way to do inferencing, but then we're hearing the timeliness of CPUs is not there as a function to be able to enable these kind of instances. So I was curious what you guys think. And then I had a follow-up. Well, I think, Harsh, if you were saying -- I mean, I think today, inference is used a lot. CPUs are used a lot for inference. Now where the demand is highest right now is for generative AI and large language model inferencing, you need GPUs to have the horsepower to train sort of the most sophisticated model. So I think those are the 2, as you say, crosscurrents. I think inference becomes a much more important workload just given the adoption rate of AI across the board. And I think we'll see that for smaller tasks on CPUs, but for the larger tasks on GPUs. Okay. So it still defers back to GPUs for those. And then a similar question on the MI300 series. I know that you talked a lot about success in the HPC side. But specifically, I was curious if you could talk about any wins or any kind of successes or success stories you might have on the generative Ai side with MI300 or 250 series? Yes. So as we said earlier, we've done some really good work on MI250 with AI and large language models. The example that is public is what we've done with and the training of some of the finish models. We're doing quite a bit of work with large customers on MI300. And what we're seeing is very positive results. So we think MI300 is very competitive for generative AI. we'll be talking more about sort of that customer and revenue evolution as we go over the next couple of quarters. Great.

With that, I'll hand the call over to Lisa. Lisa? Thank you, Mitch, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. We executed well in the second quarter, launching multiple leadership products, significantly expanding our AI engagements, and ramping our latest Zen 4, EPYC, and Ryzen product families. Second quarter revenue declined 18% year-over-year, to $5.4 billion. Sales were flat sequentially as Client and Datacenter segment growth was offset by expected declines in our Gaming and Embedded Segments. AI cluster engagements grew by more than seven times sequentially as multiple customers initiated or expanded programs supporting future deployments of Instinct MI250 and MI300 hardware and software at scale.
Looking at the second quarter business results, Datacenter segment revenue, of $1.3 billion was down 11% year-over-year, and up 2% sequentially. Although market demand remains mixed, the 4th Gen EPYC CPU adoption accelerated in the quarter, with revenue nearly doubling sequentially as cloud provided expanded deployments to power their internal infrastructure and public instance offerings. In cloud, 30 new AMD instances launched in the second quarter, with multiple Genoa instances announced by AWS, Alibaba, Microsoft, and Oracle.
Genoa delivers up to 1.9 times more performance in enterprise and cloud applications, and 1.8 times more performance per watt than the competition, making it, by far, the industry's higher performance and most efficient server processor. As an example, AWS announced its M7a Genoa instance, which is the highest performance and best price-performance general purpose x86 instance they offer. In total, there are now more than 670 AMD-powered cloud instances publicly available, and we expect that number to grow 30%, to nearly 900 by the end of the year, driven largely by new Genoa deployments.
We also expanded our Zen 4 server product portfolio in the quarter with the launches of Bergamo and Genoa-X. Microsoft Azure announced the first Genoa-X HPC instances that offer more than five times higher performance in technical computing workloads compared to their prior generation. With Bergamo, we deliver more than double the performance than competitive offerings for cloud-native applications, while offering full x86 software compatibility. We were excited to be joined at our launch event by Meta, where they announced plans to deploy Bergamo broadly across their global datacenter infrastructure to power applications, including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.
Looking ahead, Dell, HPE, Lenovo, Supermicro, and other large server providers are on track to begin launching their new Bergamo platforms in the third quarter. In enterprise, while macroeconomic uncertainty resulted in weaker customer demand year-over-year, sales of EPYC processors for enterprise servers grew sequentially as we closed multiple wins with large energy, technology, financial services, and healthcare companies. Overall, pull from large enterprises continued to grow. For example, Banco de Brasil, BNP Paribas, Petronas, Uber, and other large enterprises, all adopted EPYC processors in the quarter. And SAP selected EPYC processors to power RISE with SAP applications hosted on Google Cloud.
We expect EPYC revenue to grow by a double-digit percentage sequentially in the third quarter, led by the expanding 4th Gen EPYC CPU ramp. In addition, Siena, our first EPYC processor optimized for leadership, Edge server, and teleco infrastructure is on track to launch this quarter.
Turning to our broader Datacenter business, in networking, the largest cloud providers expanded their adoption of Pensando DPUs in the quarter, highlighted by new deployments with Alibaba and Oracle Cloud. In supercomputing, EPYC and Instinct processors continue to be the solutions of choice for the most powerful supercomputers in the world, powering 121 of the fastest systems on the latest top-500 list, and seven of the 10 most efficient systems on the Green500 list. In AI, we made strong progress in the second quarter as we met key hardware and software milestones to address the growing customer pull for our datacenter AI solutions.
Our AI strategy is focused on three areas. First, deliver a broad portfolio and multi-generation roadmap of leadership GPUs, CPUs, and adaptive computing solutions for AI inferencing. Second, expend the open and proven software platform we have established that enables our AI hardware to be deployed broadly and easily. And third, expand the deep and collaborative partnerships we have established across the ecosystem to accelerate deployments of AMD-based AI solutions at scale. We delivered on all three fronts in the second quarter. On the software and partnership side, Hugging Face announced plans to optimize thousands of their models for AMD Instinct, Ryzen, EPYC, Radeon, Versal, and Alveo platforms.
To make it easier for developers to tap into the full performance and features of our AI hardware, we delivered a significant performance and feature update in our latest ROCm software, and expanded support for AMD silicon across the leading frameworks, including PyTorch, TensorFlow, Onyx, and technologies like OpenAI Triton. We are receiving positive feedback on the improvements and the new capabilities of our latest ROCm software stack from our AI customers and ecosystem partners. As an example, leading AI software company, MosaicML, recently highlighted that our Instinct MI250 accelerator delivers competitive training performance with minimal or no changes to the underlying AI software.
On the hardware side, we announced our new Instinct MI300X GPUs designed to be the world's most advanced accelerators for generative AI. MI300X combines our next-gen CDNA 3 architecture with the industry's largest memory footprint and fastest memory bandwidth. These are critical factors in AI inferencing performance. Customer interest in our Instinct MI300A and MI300X GPUs is very high. Engagements with top-tier cloud providers, large enterprises, and numerous leading AI companies significantly expanded in the quarter. We are providing early system access and sampling both products with our lead AI, HPC, and cloud customers now, and remain on track to launch and ramp production in the fourth quarter.
Turning to our Client segment, revenue declined 54% year-over-year to $1 billion. Client segment revenue increased 35% sequentially as Ryzen 7000 series CPU sales grew significantly, led by the launches of new notebooks from the largest OEMs. We also launched new commercial offerings with our first Ryzen Pro notebook and desktop processors powered by our leadership Zen 4. More than 100 AMD-powered commercial PC platforms are on track to launch this year from HP, Lenovo, and other leading OEMs as we grow this important part of our client business.
We expect our Client segment will grow in the seasonally stronger second-half of the year based on the strength of our product portfolio and increased adoption of our Ryzen 7000 CPUs, including the ramp of our Ryzen 7040 mobile CPUs that deliver leadership performance and energy efficiency, and are the industry's first x86 processors with a dedicated AI engine. Going forward, we see AI as a significant PC demand driver as Microsoft and other large software providers incorporate generative AI into their offerings. We are executing a multi-generational rise in AI processor roadmap which, together with our ecosystem partners, will fundamentally change the PC experience.
Now, turning to our Gaming segment, revenue declined 4% year-over-year to $1.6 billion as higher semi-custom revenue was more than offset by lower gaming graphic sales. Sequentially, segment revenue declined 10%. Semi-custom SoC sales were strong in the quarter as Microsoft and Sony had healthy console demand based on improved retail availability globally, and the launches of new AAA games. In gaming graphics, we expanded our Radeon 7000 GPU series in the second quarter with the launch of our mainstream RX 7600 cards for 1080p gaming. We are on track to further expand our RDNA 3 GPU offerings with the launch of new, enthusiast-class Radeon 7000 series cards in the third quarter.
Turning to our Embedded segment, revenue increased 16% year-over-year to $1.5 billion. Sequentially, revenue declined 7% as solid demand with industrial, vision and healthcare, automotive, and broadcast customers was offset by softness with communications customers as some operators slowed their infrastructure upgrades.
We expanded our leadership adaptive computing product portfolio in the quarter, launching our new Versal Premium VP1902 adaptive SoC with advanced chiplet packaging, the industry's largest and most performance solution for emulating and verifying next generation ASICs and SoCs.
In the low end, we announced our Spartan UltraScale+ FPGA family to address a new range of cost optimized, industrial, computer vision, healthcare and robotics applications. We also released enhanced versions of our Vivado and Vitis software platforms that make it easier for customers to develop highly performant applications for our Versal Adaptive SoCs.
Embedded CPU sales grew in the quarter with the launches of new AMD powered security, storage and networking solutions from HPE, Fortinet and other leading vendors. Looking into the second-half of the year, after delivering six quarters of very strong year-over-year growth, we expect Embedded segment revenue to decline in the back-half of the year as lead times normalize and some customers reduce their inventory levels.
We continue to be very pleased with our embedded design win momentum and in particular, the growing revenue synergy opportunities we see based on our combined adaptive and embedded processing product portfolio.
In summary, we executed well in the quarter against our strategic priorities. Looking at the second-half of the year, we expect the PC market to grow seasonally with more normalized inventory levels across the supply chain.
In the datacenter market, we see a mixed environment as AI deployments are expanding. However, cloud customers continue optimizing their datacenter compute and enterprise customers remain cautious with new deployments. Against this backdrop, we expect strong growth driven by higher fourth gen EPYC and Ryzen 7000 processor sales and initial shipments of our Instinct MI300 accelerators in the fourth quarter.
Longer term, while we are still in the very early days of the new era of AI, it is clear that AI represents a multibillion dollar growth opportunity for AMD across cloud, edge and an increasingly diverse number of intelligent endpoints.
In the datacenter alone, we expect the market for AI accelerators to reach over $150 billion by 2027. We have increased our AI related R&D, ecosystem enablement and go-to-market investments to capture a significant share of this emerging market.
The strong progress we are making executing our AI roadmaps and the rapid pace at which we are expanding our ecosystem of AI hardware and software partners makes us very confident we can deliver leadership, training and inference solutions powered by our instinct EPYC, Ryzen AI, Versal and Alveo platforms for our customers and partners.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jean to provide additional color on our second quarter results and our outlook for Q3, Jean? Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results for the second quarter and then provide our current outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. We are pleased with our second quarter results with revenue of $5.4 billion and a diluted earning per share of $0.58.
On a year-over-year basis, revenue declined 18% as growth in the Embedded segment revenue was more than offset primarily by lower Client segment revenue. Revenue was flat compared to the first quarter, as growth in both the client and the Datacenter segments was offset by expected declines in the Gaming and Embedded segments.
Gross margin was 50%, down approximately four percentage points from a year ago, primarily driven by lower Client segment performance, partially offset by strong Embedded segment performance.
Operating expenses were $1.6 billion, an increase of 3% year-over-year primarily due to higher R&D investments. Operating income was $1.1 billion, down $114 million year-over-year and operating margin was 20%.
Interest expense, taxes and other was $120 million. For the second quarter, diluted earning per share was $0.58, compared to $1.05 in the same period last year. EPS declined on a year-over-year basis, primarily due to Client segment performance.
Now, turning to our reportable segments for the second quarter, starting with the Datacenter segment revenue was $1.3 billion, down 11% year-over-year, mainly due to lower third generation EPYC processor sales as enterprise demand was softer and inventory levels were elevated at certain MDC customers.
Datacenter revenue grows sequentially with strong sales of our fourth generation EPYC processors, specifically Gen 1 partially offset by decline in adaptive SoC product sales. Datacenter segment operating income was $147 million or 11% of revenue, compared to $472 million or 32% a year ago.
Lower operating income was primarily due to lower revenue and increased R&D investment to support future growth. Client segment revenue was $998 million down 54% year-over-year, due to reduced processor shipment resulting from a weaker PC market and significant inventory correction across the PC supply chain.
On a sequential basis, revenue grew 35% as we ramped our Ryzen 7000 series processors and the PC market conditions improved. Client segment operating loss was $69 million, compared to operating income of $676 million a year ago, primarily due to lower revenue. We expect the Client segment to return to profitability in the third quarter.
Gaming segment revenue was $1.6 billion, down 4% year-over-year. Semi-customer revenue grew year-over-year which was more than offset by lower gaming graphics revenue. On a sequential basis, gaming revenue declined 10% in line with our expectations. Gaming segment operating income was $225 million or 14% of revenue, compared to $187 million or 11% year ago, primarily due to higher semi-custom revenue.
Embedded segment revenue was $1.5 billion, up 16% year-over-year, primarily driven by strength in the industrial vision, healthcare, automotive, test and emulation market. On a sequential basis, Embedded segment revenue declined 7%, primarily due to weaker communication market demand. Embedded segment operating income was $757 million or 52% of revenue, compared to $641 million or 51% a year ago, primarily driven by higher revenue.
Turning to the balance sheet and the cash flow, during the quarter, we generated $379 million in cash from operations. Free cash flow was $254 million. Inventory increased by $332 million to support the continued ramp of Advanced Technology products, we expect inventory to decline as we ship this product to customers in the second-half of the year.
At the end of the quarter, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment was drawn at $6.3 billion. Now, turning to our third quarter 2023 outlook, we expect revenue to be approximately $5.7 billion plus or minus $300 million and an increase of approximately 2.5% year-over-year and approximately 6.5% sequentially.
Year-over-year, we expect revenue for the Client segment to be up, Datacenter segment to be flattish, and the gaming and Embedded segments to decline. Sequentially, we expect the Client and the Datacenter segment to each grow by a double-digit percentage and the Gaming and Embedded segments to decline.
Non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 51%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.65 billion, non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 13%, and the diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.63 billion shares.
In closing, I'm pleased with our second quarter top line and bottom line execution. We expect our new product ramps across the Datacenter and Client segment to drive sequential growth into the third quarter. Importantly, our leadership product portfolio, datacenter and AI investment priorities and financial strengths position us well for long-term growth.
With that, I'll turn it back to Mitch for Q&A session. Thank you, Jean. John, we're happy to poll the audience for questions. Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Yes, good afternoon, and thanks for taking my questions, and congrats on the results. I guess, Lisa, my first question is around the Datacenter business. I think we're all, across the industry, observing a shift in workload and spending patterns like maybe we've, arguably, never seen. And your company is in a great position to participate on both sides of that on the CPU strength, and obviously in the AI space. Last quarter, you had given us some metrics around potentially being able to grow your datacenter business by 50% in the second-half of the year versus the first-half. And maybe you could give us a little bit of an update on how you're thinking about that milestone and the drivers of growth across CPU and accelerator for the back-half? Thanks. Yes, sure, Matt. Thanks for the question. So, you're absolutely right. It's a very dynamic market right now in the datacenter. We certainly see -- let me go through some of the pieces. So, on the positive side, we certainly see that acceleration of AI demand. From our standpoint, we see it in a couple ways. We have a number of design wins in AI deployments as the CPU that goes with GPUs, as well as other accelerators. So, in the head nodes, we've seen that positive on the CPU side. We've also seen some strong interest in our MI250 accelerator, which is currently shipping right now. And we see very strong pull on the MI300 accelerators that are starting production in the fourth quarter.
So, those are the positive market dynamics as we go into the second-half of the year. We also see some of the softer cloud spend that is happening outside of AI as some of the cloud vendors are optimizing their CapEx. And enterprise, I would say is still on the weaker side. But with all that in place, we are expecting a large ramp in second-half for our Datacenter business, and weighted towards the fourth quarter. And we are still looking at a zip code of, let's call it, 50% plus or minus second-half to first-half. So, it's a big ramp, but when we look at all the components, I think that the customer pull is certainly there. And it's exciting to be in this part of the industry. Thank you for that, Lisa. I guess as my follow-up, still sticking with the Datacenter business. Your company is aggressively trying to ramp both the hardware and the software side of the MI300 programs to support AI. There's been some conflicting reports as to whether all of those deployments are time. I think you've, in the prepared script, said what you guys think about that. I guess my question is really around the software work and the hardware itself that you're doing with your lead customers, maybe you could give a little bit about, firstly, how the customer feedback has been on the performance of the hardware itself?
And secondly, how you think the software work you're doing with your lead customers will translate into other customer deployments as we work through next year? Thanks. Yes, sure, absolutely. So, if I give you just some color on how the customer engagements are going, there's very strong customer interest across the board in our AI solutions, that includes, let's call it, multiple tier 1 hyperscalers that we're engaged with. It includes some large enterprises. And it also includes this new category of some of these AI-centric companies that are sort of very forward-looking in terms of how they're deploying and building AI solutions. So, from that aperture, we made a lot of progress with our ROCm software stack.
I'm actually -- there is a lot more to do, but I would say the progress that we've made has been significant. We're getting lots of feedback from those lead customers. We're seeing the benefits of the optimization, so working also on the higher-level model frameworks, the work that we're doing with the PyTorch Foundation, the work that we're doing with Onyx, with Triton. And the key is we're getting significant real-time feedback from some of these lead customers. So, we're learning at a very fast pace. In terms of the feedback on performance, a number of companies have now been able to look at MI250 across a broad range of workloads, and that's a good translation as you go to MI300, and the feedback has been quite positive.
We have customers sampling either on our lab systems, they're accessing the hardware, or sampling in their labs. And I would say, so far very positive. The pull is there. There is a lot of work to be done, but we feel very good about the progress of our overall AI solutions for the Datacenter. Thanks, Lisa. Thanks, Matt. And the next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Yes, thanks for taking the question. Just building on Matt's comments or question, I just want to go back to the implied revenue for the Datacenter business for the back-half of the year. Jean, I think, last quarter, you had alluded to, for the full-year, the expectation is still growing 10% or double digits, I should say, for the full-year the Datacenter business, just confirming that. And what I'm really trying to ask is, given the guidance of flat year-over-year growth in Datacenter in 3Q, it would seem, if my math is correct, you're implying a 50% or so increase sequentially into 4Q. I'm just trying to frame exactly how you're thinking about the cadence of what 4Q looks like, underpinning that expectation? Hi, Aaron. Thanks for the question. I think as Lisa just mentioned earlier, it's a very dynamic market. There are puts and takes. We have a tremendously strong momentum with our product portfolio, but there is continued softness in enterprise market, and also call it, the optimization is still ongoing. So, overall on balance, we think year-over-year it's probably more like a high single-digit. It's really strong ramp, not only in Q3, right, sequentially earnings double-digit -- strong double-digit. And the Q4, of course we're going to see continued sequential strong ramp. Yes, that's helpful, Jean. And then just following up on that as well, how have you guys managed through, with that ramp in mind, the supply chain side? I know that your manufacturing partners talked about expanding their capacity significantly. Just curious of what you're seeing as far as being able to fulfill that degree of demand as we look into, not just this quarter, but into 4Q? Yes, sure, Aaron. So, we have been really investing in our supply chain, the Datacenter growth is so strategic to us, that this has been part of the strategy. So, if you look at all aspects of the supply chain, from the wafers to the backend capacity, to some of the specific components that you need to do something of the class of MI300, we've worked with the entire supply chain. We feel that we have ample supply for an aggressive ramp in the fourth quarter and into 2024. But this is certainly one of the areas that we spent quite a bit of time to ensure that we do have that confidence. Okay. Thank you. Thanks, Aaron. And the next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Hi, thank you so much for taking the question. My first one is on the Datacenter business as well. And I just wanted to follow up on the Q3 to Q4 dynamic. And I do apologize if I missed this, but in the implied growth rate in Datacenter in Q4, can you speak to what percentage of supercomputing. I think there is a big project that's slated to ship in Q4. And is there any contribution from the Instinct series outside of supercomputing as well or is it primary your server CPU franchise? Yes, sure, Toshiya. Thanks for the question. So, as Jean said, into the third quarter, we expect double-digit sequential growth in Datacenter, that's primarily EPYC. So, that's primarily the Zen 4, let's call it the combination of Genoa and Bergamo, as that continues to ramp. As we go into the fourth quarter, there is an implied significant ramp in revenue. I think there are multiple components to that. So, there is -- the server CPU side will continue to ramp as we see Zen 4 ramp. There is a sort of large, call it, lumpy supercomputer win, so our El Capitan win will be in the fourth quarter primarily, with a little bit in the first quarter.
And then we will have contribution from both MI300X going to large AI customers as they start their initial ramps, as well as MI250s with a number of customers who have now -- view that as a very good option for some of the workloads that are not necessarily the largest language models or the largest parameters, but let's call it more sort of the other AI workload. So, those are the components of the fourth quarter implied growth. Lots of pieces to it, but clearly a big piece of it is the MI300 ramp. That's helpful, thank you, Lisa. And then shifting gears a little bit and follow-up question on the Client side. You talked about the business returning to profitability in Q3, which is great. But you're still well below where you were in '21 and '22 from an operating margin perspective. Can you speak to the competitive landscape in the client business? Is there a path back to, call it, 20%, 30% operating margins there? And do you have any cost initiatives ongoing to get you back to that level of profitability in Client? Thank you. Yes, sure. Maybe let me start, and then maybe Jean can add some comment. So, look, I think the PC business has been fairly volatile over the last number of quarters, from the pandemic highs to some of the inventory digestion that we were all dealing with. I can say that I'm pleased to say that I think the growth that we're seeing -- that we saw during the second quarter and that we see in the second-half is the strength of our product portfolio. I think the Ryzen 7000 series is doing well, there's good customer pull. I think from a competitive dynamic standpoint, the business is always competitive, but we feel good about.
The most important thing that was a little bit of a drag on operating margins was the revenue being low, as well as some of the -- we had a case where the sell-in was below consumption as we were normalizing inventory levels in the supply chain. As we get past that, what we see is I think the Client business continues to grow. We believe that Client will grow into 2024 as well. In terms of some of the cost initiatives, we have been, let's call it, optimizing sort of the overall R&D footprint, but maybe I'll let Jean comment some more. Yes, on the OpEx side, the team has done a great job during this process to really optimize the investment in Client, on the segment to be more efficient and effective. If you look at the overall common company level, our OpEx has been largely flattish. But we are investing in AI, Datacenter, and the strategic priorities we have which generate a much higher return on investment. So, we have optimized it. We feel pretty good about this level of operating expense to continue to invest in Client, the segment. As Lisa mentioned, it's really about revenue. The model we leverage to generate profitability, we should be able to get back to 20%. Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Yes, good afternoon, and thank you for taking my question. Good to see the quarter-over-quarter inflexion in your EPYC business targeted at enterprise customers. I think you did mention a continued muted environment in enterprise. But the team continues to drive share gains with global corporations, you're ramping Genoa. Are you anticipating your enterprise segment to contribute to the strong second-half growth profile of your Datacenter business? Yes, thanks for the question, Harlan. Look, enterprise business is very strategic to us. We feel that we're underrepresented. It's a place that we're putting more resources because, again, when we look at the value proposition of Genoa and entire Zen 4 portfolio, we think it plays very well into the enterprise. So, pleased to see the growth in the second quarter. We do believe that we're on a path to continue to grow into the second-half of the year, and beyond. And the key here is also investments in some of the go-to-market activity, so investing in more business development folks that can call directly on these enterprise customers, together with our OEM partners, and ensure that our value proposition is very well understood. Perfect, thank you. And then on the accelerated compute, general purpose compute demand might muted in China, but there is a significant amount of unmet demand for accelerated compute in this region. And I know there were performance thresholds put in place last year, and maybe U.S. government might lower that performance threshold again soon, I'm not sure. But let's say barring that, has the team looked into developing China-specific SKUs, if they are MI250 or your new MI300 platforms? It seems like the opportunity here is quite large. Yes, Harlan, look, China is a very important market for us, certainly across our portfolio, as we think about certainly the accelerator market. Our plan is to of course be fully compliant with U.S. Export controls, but we do believe there's an opportunity to develop product for our customer set in China that is looking for AI solutions, and we'll continue to work in that direction. Thank you, Lisa. Thanks, Harlan. And the next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please proceed with your questions. Thank you for taking my question. The first one, just a clarification, would it be reasonable to assume that your GPU accelerator sales could be about, say, $500-ish million this year, so about 7%, 8% of datacenter sales? And if that is the right number, does it mean your server CPU sales are effectively flattish year-on-year this year? Yes, Vivek, I don't know that I would go into quite that granularity. What we will say is the GPU sales in the first-half of the year were very low as we were sort of in a product transition timing as we go into the second-half of the year. In particular, the fourth quarter, we'll have MI300 ramp. I think your number may be a little bit high in terms of the GPU sales, but overall in general, I think our expectation is that, as Jean said, the datacenter business, given all of the market dynamics, we see it up high single-digits year-on-year, we see much better second-half compared to first-half. And I think the product portfolio and the ramp of Genoa and Bergamo, as well as the ramp of MI300 are key components of the second-half ramp. Thank you, Lisa. And for my follow-up, just kind of a broader question on AI accelerators in the commercial market, so I'm excluding the Supercomputing, the El Capitan projects, et cetera. What is AMD's specific edge in this market? You know there are already strong and established kind of merchant players, there are a number of ASIC options, a number of your traditional competitors, Intel and others, and several startups are also ramping.
So my question is, what is AMD's specific niche in this market? What is your value proposition and how sustainable is it, because you're just starting to sample the product now. So, I'm trying to get some realistic sense of how big it can be and what the specific kind of niche and differentiation is for AMD in this market? Yes, sure Vivek. So, I think maybe let me take a step back and just talk about sort of our investments in AI. So, our investments in AI are very broad and I know there's a lot of interest around datacenter, but I don't want us to lose track of the investments on the edge as well as in the client. But to your question on what is our value proposition in the datacenter, I think what we have shown is that we have very strong capability with supercomputing, as you've mentioned. And then, as you look at AI, there are many different types of AI. If you look across training and inference, sort of the largest language models and what drives some of the performance in there when we look at MI300, MI300 is actually designed to be a highly flexible family of products that looks across all of these different segments.
And in particular, where we've seen a lot of interest is in the sort of large language model inference. So, MI300X has the highest memory bandwidth, has the highest memory capacity. And if you look at that inference workload, it's actually a very, it's very dependent on those things. That being said, we also believe that we have a very strong value proposition and training as well. When you look across those workloads and the investments that we're making, not just today, but going forward with our next generation MI400 series and so on and so forth, we definitely believe that we have a very competitive and capable hardware roadmap. I think the discussion about AMD, frankly, has always been about the software roadmap, and we do see a bit of a change here on the software side. Number one, we've put a tremendous amount of resource on it. So, bringing together our former Xilinx software team, together with the AMD sort of based software team, we've dramatically increased the resources. And also the focus has now been on sort of optimizing at these higher level models.
So, if you think about the frameworks around PyTorch and Triton and Onyx, I think many of the new AI centric companies are actually optimizing at a different level, and they're working very closely with us. So, in this place where AI is tremendously exciting, I think there will be multiple winners. And we will be first to say that there are multiple winners. But we think our portfolio is actually fairly unique in the sense that we do have CPUs, GPUs, we have the accelerator technology with Ryzen AI on the PC side as well as in the embedded side with our Xilinx portfolio. So, I think it's a pretty broad and capable portfolio. Thank you, Lisa. And the next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to first go back to the Q4 datacenter guide. So, if I do my math right, it's something like $700 million sequentially in datacenter from Q3 to Q4. So, how much of that is MI300 versus CPU? And given the lumpiness of the El Capitan piece, what does that imply for the potential seasonality into Q1 as most of it rolls off? Yes, sure. So, it is a large ramp, Stacy, into the fourth quarter. I think the largest piece of that is the MI300 ramp. But there is also a significant component that's just the EPYC processor ramp with, as I said, the Zen 4 portfolio. In terms of the lumpiness of the revenue and where it goes into 2024. Let me give you kind of a few pieces.
So, I think there was a question earlier about how much of the MI300 revenue was AI centric versus let's call it supercomputing centric. The larger piece is supercomputing, but it's meaningful revenue contribution from AI. As we go into 2024, our expectation is again, let me go back to the customer interest on MI300X is very high. There are a number of customers that are looking to deploy as quickly as possible.
So, we would expect early deployments as we go into the first-half of 2024, and then we would expect more volume in the second-half of '24 as those things fully qualify. So, it is going to be a little bit lumpy as we get through the next few quarters. But our visibility is such that there are multiple customers that are looking to deploy as soon as possible. And we're working very closely with them to do the co-engineering necessary to get them ramped. But like, of the $700 million, it's like $400 million of it El Capitan or is it $500 million or $300 million like how big is the El Capitan piece? You can assume that the El Capitan is several hundred million. Several hundred, okay. For my follow-up, just gross margins coming up in the back in the second. I mean, they still kind of missed in the quarter. I know they rounded up to 50%, but they were 49.7%. I know you're guiding 51 for Q3. Jean, where do you see gross margins sitting like in Q4 as we exit the year? Yes, I think the gross margin is, for us, the primary driver as we discussed in the past, it's really mixed. And if you look at our guidance or outlook of Q3, gross margin of 51%, it's more than one percentage point improvement sequentially despite of very significant headwind from embedded business declining in Q3. So, the datacenter and the client business are expect to grow double-digit sequentially and provide a positive impact on the gross margins, which actually more than offset the headwind from embedded business.
So, going to Q4, again we're not guiding Q4 and it's going to depend on mix. I would say one thing is you will have a similar dynamics, right. Datacenters expect to grow very significantly. At the same time, we're going to have the same headwind from embedded business declining sequentially. So, overall, we do expect gross margin to improve from this level going forward. Okay, thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Great, thank you. You've talked about the embedded business declining as you move into the second-half. Can you give us a sense for how much? And is that decline a function of the common infrastructure market or are you seeing weakness beyond that part of the market? Yes, sure, Joe. Thanks for the question. So, look, when I look at the embedded business, I think we should start by remembering that we're coming off of six quarters of very strong growth. I mean, this business has performed extremely well and very pleased with the overall momentum in the business.
To your exact question of what we're seeing in the markets, we're actually seeing the core markets hold up pretty well, so let's call it aerospace and defense strong; industrial vision and healthcare, strong; test and emulation strong. We are seeing communications weakness. So, that is the primary driver of the second-half commentary. And there's also some inventory optimization, as you might expect, since our league times have come down over the last several months. So, in terms of zip code, I would say think of it as double-digit down sequentially in the third quarter, and that's the current view that we have. But overall, the business has been extremely strong for us, so I think this is an expected decline as we come off the cycle. Great. And any sense for beyond this quarter, since we've asked you so many Q4 questions already today, but any sense is that kind of the bottom level or do you expect there to be some continued contraction? As Jean would say, we're not guiding for the fourth quarter, but I think you should expect embedded sort of in that similar zip code. Yes, that's what I would say. Okay, great. Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Thanks a lot. Jean, my first question is on inventory. You said it's going to come down a bit as you ramp into the Q4, obviously, you have a big Q4. Can you sort of shape that out for us? Before this, normalized inventory days were kind of 90 to 100 days. Where do you think you're going to exit Q4 in terms of inventory days? Yes, Tim, thanks for the question. I think as we ramp those product lines in Q3 and Q4, you will see inventory come down first in Q3 and Q4 again. I think the inventory days of inventory probably will be around 110 to 120 days. The key thing is, right, is if you look at a lot of our product, they are like advanced process technology, five nanometer, four nanometer, six. The manufacturing cycle tend to be long. So, in the longer term, you should expect us from days of inventory be more around 100 to 120 days versus traditionally like 80 days or 75 days. That will be too short for really most advanced process technologies. Thanks a lot. And then, my follow-up is for you, Lisa. I mean if you kind of add up the units, the customer interest, you can easily get to several hundred thousand units, it seems to me, for the MI300X next year. So, the question really is on the supply chain, and particularly Cohost, do you think that's going to be a bottleneck for you? I know that they've been expanding capacity. I know you've been trying to procure more there. Can you sort of talk about that and sort of do you think that supply could become a limiting factor you next year? Thanks. Yes, absolutely. So, I'm not going to comment on the exact units, but what I will say is that we've been focused on the supply chain for MI300 for quite some time. It is tight. There's no question that it's tight in the industry. However, we have sort of commitments for significant capacity across the entire supply chain. So, co-host is one piece of it, high bandwidth memory is another piece of it and then just the general capacity requirements and look, our goal is to make this a significant growth driver for AMD, I think it's a great market opportunity. We love the engagements with customers, it's our responsibility to provide the supply for the demand and so that's what we've been working on. Thanks a lot. Thanks, Tim. And the next question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland with SIG. Please proceed with your question. Hey guys, thanks for the question and more on the MI300 opportunity that you guys called out as a multibillion dollar growth opportunity, I was wondering if perhaps you could put a time frame around that multibillion dollar opportunity but more specifically, have you guys ported over MI300 LLMs to MI300? Have you looked at the performance? How do they perform? Are you excited about that? And then, in terms of hyperscale uptake, is it the X version, the GPU only version, that you expect to be the biggest seller here? And have you had any semi-custom kind of configurations here that potentially might even include an FPGA or other kind of Lego movements on the MI300? Thank you. Sure. So, there were a lot of aspects to that question, Chris. So, let me try to give you some framework here. I don't think we're ready to talk about timing yet of revenue numbers. What we will say is we do believe it's a multibillion dollar opportunity. I think 2024 is a very important year for us.
Ramping MI300 in multiple customers over the next several quarters is very important. I think I mentioned earlier in the Q&A that the customer interest is actually diverse, which is great. It includes sort of what you would expect in terms of the large Tier-1 hyperscalers. But I think these new class of sort of AI focused companies have been working very closely with us, and then some of the large enterprises are also looking at ramping up their efforts. The performance that we see is strong. I think the large language model work that we've done, we've done a lot of it on MI250, and we've seen very good results that's on both training as well as inference. I think as we go through MI300 again, the early results are strong.
For AI applications, what we're seeing now is MI300X. So, let's call it the GPU only version is the one that is sort of most prevalent in the AI customer engagement. But the MI300A, actually, which is sort of where we have the CPU and the GPU more closely coupled together is also of interest. So, I think the key is I think we've built a platform that does allow people to kind of choose what is best for the models and for the workloads that they're trying to enable. And that's what we're working on. Great. And just as a quick follow-up, then, Siena Telco is a market kind of owned by your competitor there. They have a lot of software around Telco. What kind of share do you think you can take in the Telco market from them over the next few years? Yes, we're excited about Siena. I think Siena fits again. It's as you said, it's a niche that we haven't previously been focused on. I think our interactions with the Telco suppliers are they're anxious to have Siena be a part of their portfolio. Siena is also one that we'll use for other edge applications, or let's call it lower end applications that need the performance of Zen 4, but perhaps not the heavy platform that we have on the Genoa and Bergamo. So, we do think we're starting from a very low point. So, there's an opportunity to gain share over the next couple of years, and we'll focus on that. Thanks so much, Lisa. Thanks, Chris. And the next question comes from the line of Chris Danely with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Hey, team. Thanks for squeezing me in. Lisa, so if the MI250, 300, et cetera ramp or the revenue is mostly GPU only, what kind of an impact would that have on AMD gross margin? Would that still be gross margin accretive or dilutive or net neutral to your corporate gross margin? Yes, thanks Chris. Let me just make sure I get the statement clear. So, both MI300A and MI300X will be part of the ramp, particularly in the fourth quarter. And as we go into next year for the AI specific applications, we are more heavily weighted towards MI300X, just given sort of where the software is written. And to your question about gross margins at the corporate level, so we would expect that our AI business will be accretive to gross margins at the corporate level. And obviously, as you start the ramp, there's a little bit of learning, but overall we expect it to be accretive to our corporate gross margins. Great. And then, from a follow-up I just had -- I guess clarification, so it sounds like most of the MI revenue you have in the hopper right now for at least the committed revenue is LCAP, is that true? And do you have other, I guess, confirmed or hard orders for that, or maybe just spend some time telling us how you're working with the customers or what it takes for them to go from, ""Hey, we are interested,"" to, ""Here is the purchase order?"" Yes. So, may be if your question is do we have other customers who are committed to MI300 other than LCAP, the answer is yes. We have a number of customers who are actually committed. And the way these things go, actually it's not different, not very different than how a server ramp goes, right? I mean one starts with an initial deployment, ensures that the software works, ensures that we have all of the reliability and capability in the datacenter, and then they ramp from that. I will say the difference in AI deployments is, I think, customers are willing to go very quickly. There is sort of a desire and agility because we all want to accelerate the amount of AI compute that's out there. And so, the speed in which customers are engaged and customers are making decisions is actually faster than they would in sort of a normal, sort of regular environment. And that's great. I think that's helping us, as I said earlier, learn, perfect the software, get of all the capabilities in place for a significant ramp next year. Great. Thanks, Lisa. Thanks. John, we have time for one more question. Okay. And our final question comes from the line of Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question. Yes, hey, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. And Lisa, we are looking forward to an exciting second-half for your company. I had a quick question on the server share. Do you think that there is a theoretical limit to the share that AMD can get? Historically initially we heard 80/20 was a pervading rule, and then you busted through that. Now we are hearing customers say 70/30 is more like it. More importantly, are there anything large vendors for your server business, where you have significantly more than 30% share, let's say, 40% or even 50% share? And I have a follow-up. Yes, sure, Harsh. Thanks for the question. Look, in the server business, I think the most important thing for our customers is that we have a strong roadmap, and it's a roadmap that they can count on. And we've been building that sort of working model, that roadmap, and the trust over the past four or five years. So, I don't think there is any theoretical cap on AMD share. I would say, if we look today, there are multiple customers who have us deployed in their datacenters more than 50% share. And from our view, the place where we have perhaps been a bit more underrepresented is in the enterprise. And that's just a matter of sort of the breadth of enterprise customers and the breadth of enterprise software. So, we believe that we have leadership today, and we are very, very focused on ensuring that we continue leadership in the market. And with that, there is an opportunity to continue to gain share in the server market. Thank you, Lisa. On my second one, can you help us think a little bit about the generative AI spend, let's say, if you can side press some kind of metric, and so, how many dollars of spend today are you seeing from your customers on generative AI for let's say each dollar of regular server CPU spend? Is there a metric that we can think of? Is there a trend today? And where do you think it can be in a couple of years. Yes. I think, Harsh, the best way to answer that, and again, we are all sort of -- it's all on crystal ball as to what's going to happen over the next four or five years. There is no question that the demand for generative AI solutions is very high, and there is a lot of compute capacity that needs to put in. The way we size the market is, it can perhaps grow at a rate of, let's call it 50% CAGR plus or minus over the next three or four years. So, that would take us to $150 billion by the time we get to 2027. Now, that's all accelerators in the datacenters, so that includes GPUs, that includes other ASICs and other accelerators. But I think we have an opportunity to address a large portion of that market. So, that makes it very clear priority for us. It's our number one strategic priority, and we will continue to work closely with our customers as they optimize between CPU and GPU or spend. Thank you, Lisa. Thank you. Great. John, that concludes today's call. Thank you to everyone for joining us today. Ladies and gentlemen, you may now disconnect your lines at this time.

Thank you, Mitch, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. We executed well in the third quarter, delivering strong top line and bottom line growth, achieving multiple milestones on our AI hardware and software road maps and significantly accelerating our momentum with customers for our AI solutions. In PCs, there are now more than 50 notebook designs powered by Ryzen AI in market, and we are working closely with Microsoft on the next generation of Windows that will take advantage of our on-chip AI Engine to enable the biggest advances in the Windows user experience in more than 20 years.
In the Data Center, multiple large hyperscale customers committed to deploy Instinct MI300 accelerators, supported by our latest ROCm software suite and the growing adoption of an open hardware-agnostic software ecosystem.
Looking at the third quarter financial results, revenue grew 4% year-over-year and 8% sequentially to $5.8 billion, driven by record server CPU revenue and strong Ryzen processor sales.
Turning to the segment results. Data Center segment revenue of $1.6 billion was flat year-over-year and up 21% sequentially as solid demand for both 3rd and 4th Gen EPYC processor families resulted in record quarterly server processor revenue. We gained server CPU revenue share in the quarter as 4th Gen EPYC CPU revenue grew more than 50% sequentially, crossing over to represent a majority of our server processor revenue and unit shipments.
In cloud, while the demand environment remained mixed in the quarter, EPYC CPU revenue grew by a strong double-digit percentage sequentially as hyperscalers expanded deployments of EPYC processors to power their internal workloads and public instances while optimizing their infrastructure spend. Nearly 100 new AMD-powered cloud instances launched in the quarter from Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Oracle, Tencent and others, including multiple general instances that deliver leadership performance for general purpose, HPC, bare metal and memory optimized workloads.
In enterprise, while overall demand remains soft, we are seeing strong indications that the significant performance and TCO advantages of Genoa and our expanded go-to-market investments are paying off as enterprise revenue grew by a double-digit percentage sequentially. We closed multiple new wins with leading automotive, aerospace, financial services, pharmaceutical and technology customers, and the number of enterprise customers actively testing EPYC platforms on-prem increased significantly quarter-on-quarter.
We also expanded our 4th Gen EPYC processor portfolio with the launch of our Siena processors that deliver leadership energy efficiency and performance for intelligent edge and telco applications. Dell, Lenovo, Super Micro and others launched new platforms that expand our EPYC CPU TAM to address telco, retail and manufacturing applications. With the launch of Siena, we now offer the industry's most performant and most energy-efficient portfolio of server processors across cloud, enterprise, technical, HPC and edge computing.
I am very pleased with the momentum we have built for our EPYC CPU portfolio. We are building on this momentum with our next-gen Turin server processors based on our new Zen 5 core that delivers significant performance and efficiency gains. Turin is in the labs of our top customers and partners now, and customer feedback has been very strong and we're on track to launch in 2024.
Looking at our broader Data Center portfolio, we made significant progress in our Data Center GPU business in the third quarter as the multiyear investments we have made in our hardware and software road maps resulted in significant customer traction for our next-generation Instinct MI300 accelerators and particularly our Instinct MI300X GPU that delivers leadership inferencing and training performance.
On the hardware side, bring-up and validation of our MI300A and MI300X accelerators continue progressing to plan with performance now meeting or exceeding our expectations. Production shipments of Instinct MI300A APUs started earlier this month to support the El Capitan Exascale Supercomputer, and we are on track to begin production shipments of Instinct MI300x GPU accelerators to lead cloud and OEM customers in the coming weeks.
On the software side, we further expanded our AI software ecosystem and made great progress enhancing the performance and features of our ROCm software in the quarter. In addition to ROCm being fully integrated into the mainline PyTorch and TensorFlow ecosystems, Hugging Face models are now regularly updated and validated to run on Instinct accelerators and other supported AMD AI hardware. AI start-up, Lamini, announced they achieved software parity with CUDA for LLMs running on Instinct MI250 GPUs, enabling enterprise customers to easily deploy production-ready LLMs fine-tuned for their specific data on Instinct MI250 GPUs with minimal code changes.
We also strengthened our AI software capabilities with the strategic acquisitions of Mipsology and Nod.ai. Mipsology is a long-standing partner with proven expertise delivering AI software and solutions running on top of our adaptive SoCs for data center, edge and embedded markets. Nod.ai adds a highly experienced team with a track record of substantial contributions to open-source AI compilers and industry-leading software already used by many of the largest cloud enterprise and AI companies. Nod's compiler-based automation software can significantly accelerate the deployment of highly performant AI models optimized for our Instinct, Ryzen, EPYC, Versal and Radeon processors.
Based on the rapid progress we are making with our AI road map execution and purchase commitments from cloud customers, we now expect Data Center GPU revenue to be approximately $400 million in the fourth quarter and exceed $2 billion in 2024 as revenue ramps throughout the year. This growth would make MI300 the fastest product to ramp to $1 billion in sales in AMD history. I look forward to sharing more details on our progress at our December AI event.
Turning to our Client segment. Revenue increased 42% year-over-year and 46% sequentially to $1.5 billion. Sales of our Ryzen 7000 processors featuring our industry-leading Ryzen AI on-chip accelerator, grew significantly in the quarter as inventory levels in the PC market normalized and demand began returning to seasonal patterns. Revenue for our latest-generation client CPUs powered by our Zen 4 core more than doubled sequentially as we saw strong demand for our Ryzen 7000 Series notebook and desktop processors that deliver both leadership energy efficiency and performance across a wide range of workloads.
In commercial, we launched our first Threadripper PRO workstation CPUs based on our Zen 4 Core that deliver unmatched performance for multi-threaded professional design, rendering and simulation applications. Dell, HPE and Lenovo announced an expanded set of workstations powered by new Threadripper PRO processors as we focus on growing this margin-accretive portion of our client business.
Looking forward, we are executing on a multiyear Ryzen AI road map to deliver leadership compute capabilities built on top of Microsoft's Windows software ecosystem to enable the new generation of AI PCs that will fundamentally redefine the computing experience over the coming years.
Now turning to our Gaming segment. Revenue declined 8% year-over-year and 5% sequentially to $1.5 billion as lower semi-custom revenue was partially offset by increased sales of Radeon GPUs. Although semi-custom SoC sales declined in line with our projections for this point in the console cycle, overall revenue for this console generation continues tracking significantly higher than the prior generation based on strong demand for Microsoft and Sony consoles.
In Gaming Graphics, revenue grew both year-over-year and sequentially, driven by increased demand in the channel. We expanded our Radeon 7000 series with the launch of new RX 7000 Series enthusiast desktop GPUs that offer leadership price performance for 1440p gamers.
Turning to our Embedded segment. As we expected, revenue decreased 5% year-over-year to $1.2 billion. Sequentially, revenue declined 15% as lead times normalized and customers focused on reducing inventory levels. We expanded our leadership Versal SoC portfolio in the quarter with the launches of our first adaptive SoCs with on-chip HBM memory that deliver significant performance and efficiency for memory-bound data center, network, test and aerospace applications. We also announced our next-generation space-grade Versal SoC that integrates an enhanced AI Engine and is the industry's only solution that supports unlimited reprogramming during development and after deployment.
For the fintech market, we launched our latest Alveo Accelerator card that delivers a 7x improvement in latency compared to our prior generation and has already been deployed by multiple trading firms in their ultra-low latency training platforms. Since closing our acquisition of Xilinx a little over 1.5 years ago, our Embedded business has grown significantly, driven by our leadership products.
Looking ahead, based on our current visibility, we expect Embedded segment revenue to decline sequentially as customers continue working through elevated inventory levels through the first half of 2024. Over the medium term, we see strong growth opportunities for our Embedded business based on our significant design win traction and our broad and differentiated portfolio of embedded FPGAs, CPUs, GPUs and adaptive SoCs that can address a larger portion of our customers' compute needs.
In summary, I'm pleased with our third quarter financial results, driven by the significant acceleration of Zen 4 server and client processor sales. Looking at the next couple of quarters, we expect strong growth in our Data Center business, driven by both EPYC and Instinct processors. This growth will be partially offset by softening demand in our Embedded business and lower semi-custom revenue, given where we are in the console cycle. As the PC market returns to seasonal patterns, we believe we are well positioned to gain profitable share in the premium and commercial portions of the market based on the strength of our product offerings.
We are focused on accelerating our leadership AI capabilities across our entire product portfolio, executing on our hardware and software road maps and expanding our enterprise computing footprint. I look forward to sharing more details on our AI progress in a few weeks at our Together We Advance AI event.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jean to provide additional color on our third quarter results and our outlook for Q4. Jean? Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results for the third quarter and then provide our current outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. We delivered better-than-expected third quarter results with revenue of $5.8 billion and diluted earnings per share of $0.70. On a year-over-year basis, revenue increased 4% as growth in the Client segment revenue was partially offset by lower Gaming and Embedded segment revenue.
Revenue was up 8% sequentially, driven by growth in both the Client and the Data Center segment. Gross margin was 51%, up approximately 1 percentage point year-over-year primarily driven by stronger Client segment revenue and product mix. Operating expenses were $1.7 billion, an increase of 12% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher R&D investment to support our significant AI growth opportunity. Operating income was $1.3 billion, representing a 22% operating margin. Taxes, interest expense and other was $141 million. For the third quarter, diluted earnings per share was $0.70 compared to $0.67 in the same period last year.
Now turning to our reportable segment. Starting with the Data Center segment, revenue was $1.6 billion, flat year-over-year as growth in the EPYC processor sales was offset by a decline in adaptive SoC product sales. Data Center revenue grew 21% sequentially, primarily driven by strong sales of our 4th generation EPYC processors to both cloud and enterprise customers. Data Center segment operating income was $306 million or 19% of revenue compared to $505 million or 31% a year ago. Lower operating income was primarily due to increased R&D investment to support future AI revenue growth and product mix.
Client segment revenue was $1.5 billion, up 42% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher sales of Ryzen mobile processors. On a sequential basis, revenue grew 46% as PC market conditions continued to improve, and we ramped our Ryzen 7000 series to meet strong demand. Client segment operating income was $140 million or 10% of revenue compared to an operating loss of $26 million a year ago, driven by higher revenue and a disciplined OpEx management. We are pleased that the Client segment returned to profitability in the third quarter.
Gaming segment revenue was $1.5 billion, down 8% year-over-year, primarily due to a decrease in semi-custom revenue, partially offset by increase in Radeon GPU sales. On a sequential basis, Gaming segment revenue declined 5%, in line with our expectations as we are now in the fourth year of the console cycle.
Gaming segment operating income was $208 million or 14% of revenue compared to $142 million or 9% a year ago, primarily driven by higher Radeon GPU revenue. Embedded segment revenue was $1.2 billion, down 5% year-over-year, primarily due to lower sales to the communication market. On a sequential basis, embedded segment revenue declined 15%, primarily due to inventory correction at customers in several end markets. Embedded segment operating income was $612 million or 49% of revenue compared to $635 million or 49% a year ago.
Turning to the balance sheet and the cash flow. During the quarter, we generated $421 million in cash from operations and the free cash flow was $297 million. In the fourth quarter, we expect to pay approximately $550 million in cash taxes, primarily due to previously deferred taxes from California disaster relief efforts made available by the IRS. Inventory decreased sequentially by $122 million to $4.4 billion. At the end of the quarter, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment was strong at $5.8 billion. We returned $511 million to shareholders, repurchasing 4.8 million shares and we have $5.8 billion in remaining share repurchase authorization.
Now turning to our fourth quarter 2023 outlook. We expect revenue to be approximately $6.1 billion, plus or minus $300 million, an increase of approximately 9% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Year-over-year, we expect revenue for the Data Center and the Client segments to be up by strong double-digit percentage, the Gaming segment to decline, given where we are in the console cycle, and the Embedded segment to decline due to additional softening of demand in the embedded market. Sequentially, we expect Data Center segment to grow by strong double-digit percentage, Client segment revenue to increase and the Gaming and Embedded segment to decline by double-digit percentage.
We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 51.5%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.74 billion, non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 13% and the diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.63 billion shares.
In closing, I'm pleased with our execution in the third quarter with year-over-year growth in revenue, gross margin and earnings per share. In the fourth quarter, we expect to benefit from strong Data Center and Client momentum, driven by MI300 AI accelerated ramp and the strength of our high-performance leadership Zen 4 family of products despite lower sales in the Gaming segment and additional softening of demand in the embedded market.
Looking ahead, the investment we are making in AI across our Data Center, Client, Gaming and the Embedded segment enable us to offer one of the best industry's broadest portfolio, targeting the most compelling opportunities and positioning us to drive long-term profitable growth. With that, I'll turn it back to Mitch for the Q&A session. Thank you, Jean. John, we're happy to poll the audience for questions. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Lisa, I had 2 questions. My first one is on the Data Center GPU business. You talked about '24 revenue potentially exceeding $2 billion. I was hoping you could provide a little bit more color. What percentage of this is AI versus supercomputing or other applications? Within AI, maybe talk about the breadth of your customer lineup. And how should we think about which workloads you're addressing, again, within the context of AI? Is it primarily training or inference or both? Great. Thanks, Toshiya, for the question. So look, we've made significant progress on the overall MI300 program. I think we're very happy with how the technical milestones look. And then also, we've made significant progress from a customer side. Your question as to how the revenue evolves, so the way to think about it is, in the fourth quarter, we said revenue would be approximately $400 million, and that's mostly HPC with some -- the start of our AI ramp.
And then as we go into the first quarter, we actually expect revenue to be approximately similar in that $400 million range. And that will be mostly AI so with a very small piece being HPC. And as we go through 2024, we would expect revenue to continue to ramp quarterly, and again, it will be mostly AI. Within the AI space, we've had very good customer engagement across the board from hyperscalers to OEMs, enterprise customers and some of the new AI start-ups that are out there.
From a workload standpoint, we would expect MI300 to be on both training and inference workloads. We're very pleased with the inference performance on MI300, so especially for large language model inference, given some of our memory bandwidth and memory capacity. We think that's going to be a significant workload for us. But I think we would see a broad set of workloads as well as broad customer adoption. And then as my follow-up, a question on the server CPU side. You talked about Genoa growing really nicely in the quarter. I think you talked about both units and volume being bigger than its predecessor. Is the growth that you're seeing or the growth that you saw in Q3 and the growth that you're guiding to for Q4, is this primarily a function of share growth or are you actually seeing a pickup in the overall market? And I ask the question because, obviously, year-to-date, there's been a significant shift away from traditional compute to accelerated computing, but are you actually starting to see signs of stabilization or even improvement on the traditional compute side? Sure. So the way I would frame it is we're very pleased with our third quarter performance as it relates to EPYC overall. I think the 4th Gen EPYC, so that's Genoa Plus Bergamo actually ramped very nicely. We got to a crossover in the third quarter, which is a little bit ahead of what we had previously forecasted.
And when I look underneath that, I would say with a strong growth in both cloud. Cloud was strong so strong double digits. The adoption is pretty broad across first-party and third-party workloads and new instances. And then on the enterprise side, we've also seen some nice growth across our OEMs. And so from the standpoint of, is it the market recovery or is it share gain? I think it's some of both.
From a market standpoint, I would say it's still mixed. I think enterprise is still a little bit mixed depending on sort of which region from a macroeconomic standpoint. Cloud depends a bit on the customer set. But overall, I think we're pleased with the progress and the leadership of EPYC has ended up allowing us to grow substantially in the third quarter and then into the fourth quarter. And the next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Just to build off that last question, Jean, I think last quarter, you kind of endorsed the notion that your Data Center business would grow. I think it was in the high single-digit range. I think you started the year thinking like [ 10 ]. So I guess the question is, do you still see that kind of growth rate setup? And how has that $400 million evolved underneath that? Has that -- was it $300 million now going to $400 million? Just how has that changed over the course of the last quarter just to level set that Data Center expectation? Yes. So I think for the second half, we said we expect Data Center business to grow approximately 50% versus first half. But right now based on what we are seeing, we continue to see in that similar range of that 50%. So we are very happy and pleased about the strong momentum of our Data Center business.
On the GPU side, Lisa mentioned about $400 million, around $400 million. As we go through the quarter, we have a strong engagement with the customers. So we do see the progress continues and we see customers placing orders. So that's why when we go through the quarter, we start to increasingly confident about the revenue profile in Q4 we are guiding. Yes. And Aaron, if I could add to that, if I can just add to that. I think what we've seen is the adoption rate of our AI solutions has given us confidence in not just the Q4 revenue number, but also sort of the progression as we go through 2024. Yes, that's helpful. And maybe just the follow-up. How would you characterize the supply side of the equation? As you look at that $2 billion number, do you feel confident that you've got adequate visibility in the supply side to hit those expectations? Any update on that side? Sure, Aaron. So we've been planning the supply chain for the last year and we're always planning for success. So certainly, for the current forecast of greater than $2 billion, we have adequate supply. But we have also planned for a supply chain forecast that could be significantly higher than that, and we would continue to work with customers to build that out. And the next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Following up on the Data Center GPU, can you talk about the breadth of customers that you might see there? How -- I assume it's fairly concentrated in year 1, but you also did mention multiple hyperscalers. Can you just give us a sense for how concentrated that might be? Yes. Sure, Joe. So we've been engaging broadly with the customer set. I think in the last earnings call, we said that our engagements had increased 7x. And so there is a lot of interest in MI300. We will start, let's call it, more concentrated in cloud, sort of several large hyperscalers. But we're also very engaged across the enterprise and there's a lot of interest. Our partnerships with the OEMs are quite strong. And when we think about sort of the breadth of customers who are looking for AI solutions, we certainly see an opportunity, especially as we get beyond the initial ramp to broaden the customer set. Great. And now that you're getting a look at volume in that space, can you talk about, are the gross margins there going to be comparable to your other Data Center businesses? Yes. So on the gross margin side, we do expect our GPU gross margin to be accretive to corporate average. Of course, right now, we are at a very, very early beginning of the ramp of the product. As you probably know, typically when you ramp new product, it takes some time to improve yield, testing time, manufacturing efficiency. So typically, it takes a few quarters to ramp the gross margin to a normalized level. But we are quite confident that our team is executing really well. And the next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Lisa, I also wanted to ask about that $2 billion number for Data Center GPU next year. That's still a pretty small portion, obviously, of the total TAM. Where do you think that can go? Do you think when we look at this out a couple of years, do you think you can be 15%, 20% share for total Data Center GPU or do you have aspirations to be even larger than that? Yes, Tim, I mean, I would say that first of all, this is an incredibly exciting market, right? I think we all see the growth in generative AI workloads. And the fact is we're just at the very early innings of people truly adopting it for enterprise business productivity applications. So I think we are big believers in the strength of the market.
We previously said we believe that the compound annual growth rate could be 50% over the next 3 or 4 years. And so we think the market is huge and there will be multiple winners in this market. Certainly, from our standpoint, we want to be -- we're playing to win and we think MI300 is a great product, but we also have a strong road map beyond that for the next couple of generations. And we would like to be a significant player in this market. So we'll see how things play out. But overall, I would say that I am encouraged with the progress that we're making on hardware and software and certainly with the customer set. And then Jean, I just wanted to ask on March. I know that there's a lot of moving parts. It sounds like Data Center is up but PC is going to be down, normal seasonal. And Embedded and Gaming sound down as well. So can you just help us shape sort of how to think about March? Is it down a smidge? Is it flat? Could it be up a little bit? And maybe then how to think about like first half, back half next year, if you even want to go there. Tim, we're guiding 1 quarter at a time. But just to help you with some of the color, as Lisa mentioned earlier, we said the Data Center GPU revenue will be flattish sequentially. That's the first thing, right? The mix will shift from El Capitan majority in Q4 to predominantly more for AI in Q1. So that -- because of the long lead time manufacturing cycle, we feel like it's going to be a similar level of revenue with the Data Center GPU.
But in general, if you look at our business, we do have a seasonality. Typically Q1, the Client business, server business, Gaming business seasonally is down. Of course, right now, we definitely have a little bit more seasonality, given Embedded and the Gaming dynamics we are seeing right now. Server and Client typically were down sequentially, seasonally too. But overall, I think we are really focused on just execution. We probably can provide more color when we get close to Q1 2024, and especially, Lisa, please add if we have any color we can provide on the whole year 2024. Yes. No, I think that covers it. When we look at the various pluses and minuses, I think we feel very good about the Data Center business. It continues to be a strong growth driver for us as we think about 2024 for both server as well as our MI300 clients as well, we think incrementally improves from a market standpoint as well as we believe we can gain share, given the strength of our product portfolio. And then we have the headwinds of Embedded in the inventory correction that we'll go through in the first half and the console cycle. So I think those are the puts and takes. And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Lisa, on the MI300, many of your hyperscaler customers have internal ASIC solutions ready or in the process of getting them ready. So if inference is the primary workload for MI300, do you think it is exposed to replacement by internal ASICs over time? Or do you think both MI300 and ASICs can coexist, right, along with the incumbent GPU solution? Yes. I think Vivek, when we look at the set of AI workloads going forward, we actually think they're pretty diverse. I mean, you have sort of the large language model training and inference then you have what you might do in terms of fine-tuning off of a foundational model and then you have, let's call it, straight inferencing what you might do there. So I think within that framework, we absolutely believe that MI300 has a strong place in the market, and that's what our customers are telling us and we're working very closely with them. So yes, I think there will be other solutions, but I think for the -- particularly for the LLMs, I think GPUs are going to be the processing of choice and MI300's very, very capable. Got it. And then a question, Lisa, on just this interplay between AI and traditional computing. It seems like especially when it relates to ASPs and units, seems like server CPU makers are kind of holding the line on price per core. But at the same time, the cloud players are extending the depreciation and replacement cycle of traditional server CPUs. So I'm just curious to get your take. What do you think is the interplay between units and ASP, right?
If you were to take a snapshot of what you have seen in '23 and how it kind of informs you as you look at '24, that is it possible that maybe unit growth in server is not that high but you are able to make up for it on the ASP side. So just give us some color on, one, what is happening to traditional computing deployments? And secondly, is there a difference in kind of the unit and ASP interplay on the server CPU side? Yes. I think it's a good point, Vivek. So I mean, if I take a look at 2023, I think it's been a mixed environment, right? There was a good amount of, let's call it, caution in the overall server market. There was a bit of inventory digestion at some of the cloud guys and then some optimization going on with enterprise, again, somewhat mixed. I think as we go forward, we've returned to growth in the server CPU market. Within that realm, because these -- like for example, 4th Gen EPYC, somewhere between 96 and 128 cores. I mean, you just get a lot of compute for that.
So I do think there is the framework that unit growth may be more modest, but ASP growth, given the core count and the compute capability will contribute to overall growth. So from a traditional server CPU standpoint, I think we do see those trends. 2023 was a mixed environment and I think it improves as we go into 2024. And the next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. I want to ask on the Embedded side. I think last quarter, you kind of talked about the headwinds being mostly in the communications end market. You're guiding it down in December. I was curious if that weakness is spread. And then your competitor talked about kind of a reset getting back to pre-pandemic levels. Just kind of curious how you framed that reset? You said it'd be weak to the first half. Yes, absolutely, Blayne. So I think when we look at end markets, I think communications was weak in sort of last quarter and it certainly continues to be weak. We see 5G sort of CapEx just down overall. On the other market where we see a little bit of, let's call it, soft end market demand would be industrial and that's a little bit more geographic, so a little bit worse in Europe than in other geographies.
The other end markets are actually relatively good. And what we just see is that inventory is high, just given where we were with lead times coming into the sort of through the pandemic and with the high demand that was out there. As the lead times have normalized, people are drawing down their inventories and they have an opportunity to do that, given the normalization. So from an overall standpoint, we think demand is solid.
And what we view is that we have a very strong portfolio in Embedded. We like sort of the combination of the, let's call it, the classic Xilinx portfolio together with the Embedded processing capabilities that we add. Customers have seen sort of that portfolio come together, and we've gotten some nice design win traction as a result of that. So we have to get through sort of the next couple of quarters of inventory correction, and then we believe we'll return to growth in the second half of the year. And then I just wanted to ask on the PC market. I think you and Intel have seen -- you were under-shipping in the first half. Maybe you're kind of overshipping a little bit now, restocking. I'm just kind of curious of your perspective of what that normalized run rate is in terms of the size of the PC market and kind of any perspective if inventory levels are starting to move back up. Yes. I would say, again, Blayne, when we looked at sort of the third quarter and sort of the environment that we're in now, I think inventory levels are relatively normalized, and so the selling and consumption are fairly close. We were building up for a holiday season that is a strong season for us overall.
When I think about the size of the market, I think from a consumption standpoint this year is probably somewhere like 250 million to 255 million units or so. We expect some growth going into 2024 as we think about sort of the AI PC cycle and some of the Windows refresh cycles that are out there. And I think the PC market returns to, let's call it, a typical seasonality, in which underneath that, we have a strong product portfolio. And we are very much focused on growing in places like high-end gaming, ultrathins, premium consumer as well as commercial. So those are -- that's how sort of we see the PC market. And the next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with TD Cowen. Lisa, I wanted to maybe ask the AI question a little bit differently, not just focused on your GPU portfolio but more broadly. I think one of the big surprises to a lot of us is how quickly the AI market changed from accelerator cards to selling full servers or full systems for your primary competitor. And they've done a lot of innovation not just on GPU but on CPU on their own custom interconnect, et cetera.
So what I'd like to hear a little bit of an update on is just how you think about your road map going forward across CPU, GPU and networking and particularly the networking part as you look to continue to advance your AI portfolio. Yes. Thanks, Matt. I think it's an important point. What we're seeing with these AI systems is they are truly complicated when you think about putting all of these components together. We are certainly working very closely with our partners in putting together sort of the full system, CPU, GPUs as well as the networking capability.
Our Pensando acquisition has actually been really helpful in this area. I think we have a world-class team of experts in this area, and we're also partnered with some of the networking ecosystem overall. So going forward, I don't think we're going to sell full systems, let's call it, AMD-branded systems. We believe that there are others who are more set up for that. But I think from a definition standpoint and when we're doing development, we are certainly doing development with the notion of what that full system will look like. And we'll work very closely with our partners to ensure that, that's well defined so that it's easy for customers to adopt our solutions. As my second question, Jean, I wanted to dig into gross margin a little bit and just, I guess, complement you and the team on being able to guide up for the fourth quarter. Sequentially, gross margin if we, I guess, rewound the clock back to the beginning of the year and the Embedded segment would be down from the peak to where you're guiding the fourth quarter, maybe down by 1/3. I wouldn't have thought gross margin would have hung in as well and grown sequentially each quarter through the year. Obviously, Client margins got better. But maybe you could walk us through some of the puts and takes on gross margin, and inside of each segment, where you're making progress because I imagine some of that progress is pretty positive underneath. Yes, Matt, thank you for the question. Yes, there are a few puts and takes, especially in a mixed demand environment. So let me just comment on Q3 first. We are very pleased with our gross margin expansion sequentially, 140 basis points. As you mentioned, the Embedded segment, revenue actually declined double digits sequentially.
There are 2 primary drivers. The first one is definitely Data Center grew 21% sequentially, which should provide a tailwind to our gross margin. Secondly, as we go through the inventory correction in PC market, we did encounter some headwinds in the Client segment gross margin. And in Q3, we saw very significant improvement with our client segment gross margin. I think going forward, the pace of Client segment improvement will moderate, but it will continue to drive incremental gross margin improvement in Client segment.
So that really is why we are able to drive sequential growth in Q3. And in Q4, I would say the major dynamics is with a very strong double-digit growth in Data Center business, we definitely have the tailwind, which more than offset the Embedded segment decline sequentially double digit again. I think going forward, it's really mix, primarily mix, is driving our gross margin, but we feel pretty good about second half next year when we can expand the Data Center significantly and especially Embedded segment start to recover, we should be able to drive more meaningful gross margin improvement in second half. And the next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Lisa, I had a question on the MI300 side of things. When you go to market, obviously, there's been shortages this year of GPU accelerators, and so a second source is definitely needed. But beyond just providing that second source role, can you just walk us through some of the competitive advantages that the customer lists that you're going to talk about on the sixth is finding to be so attractive relative to your primary competitor? Yes. I think there's a couple of different things, Ross. I mean, if we start with, it's just a very capable product. The way it's designed from a triplet standpoint, we have a very strong compute as well as memory capacity and memory bandwidth. In inference, in particular, that's very helpful. And the way to think about it is on these larger language models, you can't fit the model on 1 GPU. You actually need multiple GPUs.
And if you have more memory, you can actually use fewer GPUs to infer those models, and so it's very beneficial from a total cost of ownership standpoint. From a software standpoint, this has been perhaps the area where we've had to invest more and do more work. Our customers and partners are actually moving towards an area where they're more able to move across different hardware so really optimizing at the higher-level frameworks. And that's reducing the barrier of entry of sort of taking on a new solution.
And we're also talking very much about, going forward, what the road map is. It's very similar to our EPYC evolution. When you think about sort of the -- our closest partners in the cloud environment, we work very closely to make each generation better. So I think MI300 is an excellent product and we'll keep evolving on that as we go through the next couple of generations. For my follow-up, I want to focus on the OpEx side of things. You guys have kept that pretty tight over the years. Jean, I just wondered what the puts and takes on that might be heading into 2024. I think you're exiting this year at about up kind of high single digits, maybe 10% year-over-year. Any sort of unique puts and takes, especially as you guys are driving for all that MI300 success as we think about OpEx generally in 2024? Yes, thanks for the question. Our team has done an absolutely great job in reallocating resources within our budget envelope to really invest in the most important areas in AI and the data center. We are actually in the planning process for 2024. I can comment on a very high level, given tremendous opportunities we have in AI and the Data Center, we definitely will increase both R&D investment and go-to-market investment to address those opportunities.
I think the way to think about it is our objective is to drive top line revenue growth much faster than OpEx growth, so our investment can drive long-term growth. And we also can leverage our operating model really actually expand earnings much faster than revenue. That's really how we think about running the company and driving the operating margin expansion. And the next question comes from the line of Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler. Lisa, I had a strategic one for you and then somewhat of a tactical one. On the strategic side, as your key competitor is sort of getting their act together on the manufacturing technology and the nodes, would it not be feasible to think that their manufacturing cost could be significantly better, let's say, than that of yours? And so if that's the case down the line 1 year or 2 years out, I'm curious what kind of value-add offerings would AMD have to provide to a customer to keep the market share that you have in the server space, data center space and then keep that growing as well? Yes, Harsh, maybe I should just take a step back and just talk about sort of the engagement that we have with our data center customers. When we think about sort of the EPYC portfolio and what we've been able to build over the last few generations and what we have going forward with Zen 5 and beyond, process technology is only 1 piece of the optimization. It's really about process technology, packaging. We're leading sort of the usage of chiplets and 2.5D and 3D integration and then when you go to architecture and design. So it's really the holistic product.
And from a pricing standpoint, actually, price is only 1 aspect of the conversation. Much of the conversation is on how much performance can you give me at what efficiency. So from a -- from an overall efficiency standpoint, I think we've developed fantastic products. We are working closely with our customers to ensure that we continue to evolve our overall portfolio. So I think from a value-added standpoint, it's providing the best TCO is what our customers are looking for, and that's where our road map is headed.
Going forward, I think having the CPU, the GPU, the FPGAs, the DPUs, I think it gives us actually a nice portfolio to really optimize not just on a single component basis but on sort of all of the different workloads that you need in the data center. Very helpful, Lisa. And then for my follow-up, a lot of folks that we talk to think that compute game is shifting completely from CPUs to GPUs. So it was actually very encouraging to hear you talk about your core EPYC CPUs and the traction that you're seeing with the new generation of CPUs. So I'm curious, if I was to ask you how you think the long-term growth prospects for the next, call it, 2 to 3 to 4 years are for your CPU business, not the GPU but the CPU business, I'm curious what the answer would be. Yes. So look, I'm a big believer and you need all types of compute in the data center, especially when you look at the diverse set of workloads. There's a lot of excitement around AI, and we are very much clear that, that is the #1 priority from a growth standpoint going forward. But the EPYC CPU business, we feel like we've consistently gained share throughout the last few years.
And even with that, we're still underrepresented in large portions of the market, right? We're underrepresented in enterprise. We've seen some nice sort of sequential growth and nice prospects there, but there's a lot more we can do in enterprise. And we're still underrepresented in cloud third-party workloads, which, again, it's a -- you have to sell through the cloud manufacturers. So I think overall, we feel good about our EPYC leadership and also our go-to-market efforts that will help us continue to grow that business in 2024 and beyond. Operator, we have time for 2 more questions. And the next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. First, I wanted to just dial in on the Q4 guidance. If you are going to grow Data Center 50% half over half and I assume Client is up sequentially, it implies Gaming and Embedded both likely down sequentially in the 20% range. I know you said double digits. But is that right? And if that is true, especially for Embedded, what does that mean going forward into next year? I know you said it's going to be weak in the first half. Does that mean -- I mean, is it stable at these levels or does it continue to decline through the first half until things stabilize? Just how do we think about that in the context of the guidance that you've given for Q4? Yes. Sure, Stacy. Let me take that and then Jean might add a few comments. So without getting very specific, I would say I think your comments about Data Center and Client are correct. And then from an Embedded and Gaming standpoint, we would say Embedded, think about it down similar levels sort of in the teens compared to sort of Q3 was down in the teens and Q4 will be down in the teens. And then Gaming, from a console standpoint, we do expect that to be down a bit more than that.
And then as we go into Q1, again without being -- there are lots of things that need to happen. We would expect that both gaming and embedded would be down into Q1 as well and sort of the other comments would be more around seasonality. Does that help? That does help. For my follow-up, again, I wanted to ask about gross margins. So I know that they've been extending through the year, but for the full year, they're actually down. And I get the mix things and everything else. But as I look into next year, like how do I think about this because it sounds like Embedded is going to be pretty weak next year. Client is what it is. Data Center is growing but it does feel like even if the  GPUs are accretive, they're not accretive yet, and it's going to take them a while to get to be accretive.
Like how much do you think you can expand gross margins year-over-year like in '24 versus '23, given the trends that we have entering the year? Stacy, I'll say the first thing is if you look at 2023, it's a very unusual year for the industry, right, especially the PC market. It's one of the worst down cycles during the last 3 decades. So during that kind of a down cycle, definitely, we had headwinds on gross margin side, on our Client business, which we have made significant progress in Q3 and Q4 in second half.
Going into next year, the mix primarily is the driver of our gross margin. The way to think about it is Data Center is going to be the largest incremental revenue contributor next year. And then with both Gaming and Embedded facing continued sequential decline, I think it's all about the mix. We do expect next year will improve gross margin versus 2023, especially second half. So that's how we think about it right now. And our final question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna. There was an article suggesting that you guys could be interested in doing some ARM-based CPUs. I guess I'd love any thoughts that you have there on that architecture for PC. But also Apple has their M3 out now. It seems pretty robust. Qualcomm has an X Elite new chip. It was rumored NVIDIA might be doing that as well. Would love your expectations for this market. And what does that mean for the TAM for AMD moving forward? Yes. Sure, Chris. Thanks for the question. So look, the way we think about ARM, ARM is a partner in many respects so we use ARM throughout parts of our portfolio. I think as it relates to PCs, x86 is still the majority of the volume in PCs. And if you think about sort of the ecosystem around x86 and Windows, I think it's been a very robust ecosystem.
What I'm most excited about in PCs is actually the AI PC. I think the AI PC opportunity is an opportunity to redefine what PCs are in terms of productivity tool and really sort of operating on sort of user data. And so I think we're at the beginning of a wave there. We're investing heavily in Ryzen AI and the opportunity to really broaden sort of the AI capabilities of PCs going forward. And I think that's where the conversation is going to be about.
It's going to be less about what instructions that you're using and more about what experience are you delivering to customers. And from that standpoint, I think that we have a very exciting portfolio that I feel good about over the next couple of years. And 1 quick 1 on FPGA for the Data Center in particular. That was a really cool fintech win. I understand that. Can you talk about where we stand in Data Center FPGA and that outlook, FPGA for AI? And could we even mix in an FPGA into the MI300 tile at some point or is there really, at this point, not an AI market for FPGA? Yes. I mean, Chris, the way I think about sort of FPGAs in the data center, it's another compute element. We do use FPGAs or there are FPGAs in a number of the systems. I would say from a revenue contribution standpoint, it's still relatively small sort of in the near term. We have some design wins going forward that we would see that content grow but that won't be so much in 2024, that will be beyond that.
And part of our value proposition, I think, to our data center partners is, look, whatever compute element you need, whether it's CPUs or GPUs or FPGAs or DPUs or -- we have the ability to sort of bring those components together. And that is a strong point as we think about just how heterogeneous these data centers are going forward. So thank you for that. At this time, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. Now I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mitch for any closing comments. Great, John. That concludes today's call.

With that, I'll hand the call over to Lisa. Thank you, Mitch, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. We finished 2023 strong as data center sales accelerated significantly throughout the year despite the mixed demand environment. As a result, we delivered record data center segment annual revenue and strong top line and bottom line growth in the fourth quarter, driven by the ramp of Instinct AI accelerators and robust demand for EPYC server CPUs across cloud, enterprise and AI customers.
Looking at our financial results. Fourth quarter revenue increased 10% year-over-year to $6.2 billion, driven by significant double-digit percentage growth in our data center and client segments. On a full year basis, annual revenue declined 4% to $22.7 billion as record data center and embedded segment annual revenue was offset by lower client and gaming segment revenue. Importantly, Data Center and Embedded segment annual revenue grew by $1.2 billion and accounted for more than 50% of revenue in 2023 as we gained server share, launched our next-generation Instinct AI accelerators and maintained our position as the industry's largest provider of adaptive computing solutions.
Turning to the fourth quarter business results. Data Center segment revenue grew 38% year-over-year and 43% sequentially to a record $2.3 billion. Server CPU and Data Center GPU sales both set quarterly and annual revenue records as sales of our Data Center products accelerated throughout the year. We gained server CPU revenue share in the quarter, driven by significant double-digit percentage growth in fourth-gen EPYC processor revenue and demand for our third-gen EPYC processor portfolio.
In cloud, while the overall demand environment remains soft, server CPU revenue increased year-over-year and sequentially as North American hyperscalers expanded fourth-gen EPYC processor deployments to power their internal workloads and public instances. Amazon, Alibaba, Google, Microsoft and Oracle brought more than 55 AMD-powered AI, HPC and general-purpose cloud instances into preview or general availability in the fourth quarter. Exiting 2023, there were more than 800 EPYC CPU-based public cloud instances available. We expect this number to grow in 2024 based on the leadership performance, efficiency and features of our EPYC CPU portfolio.
In enterprise, sales accelerated by a significant double-digit percentage in the quarter as we built momentum with Forbes 2000 customers. We closed multiple wins with large financial, energy, automotive, retail, technology and pharmaceutical companies, positioning us well for continued growth based on expanded production deployments planned for 2024. A growing number of customers are adopting EPYC CPUs for inferencing workloads where our leadership throughput performance delivers significant advantages on smaller models like LLaMA-7b as well as to power head nodes in large training and inference clusters.
Looking ahead, customer excitement for our upcoming Turin family of EPYC processors is very strong. Turin is a drop-in replacement for existing fourth-gen EPYC platforms that extends our performance, efficiency and TCO leadership with the addition of our next-gen Zen 5 core, new memory expansion capabilities and higher core counts. Internal and end customer validation work is progressing to plan, with Turin on track to deliver overall performance leadership as well as leadership on a per core or per watt basis across a wide range of workloads when it launches later this year.
Turning to our broader data center portfolio. Our data center GPU business accelerated significantly in the quarter, with revenue exceeding our $400 million expectation, driven by a faster ramp for MI300x with AI customers. We launched our MI300 accelerator family in December with strong partner and ecosystem support from multiple large cloud providers, all the major OEMs and many leading AI developers. MI300X GPUs deliver leadership generative AI performance by combining our high-performance CDNA 3 architecture with industry-leading memory bandwidth and capacity. Customer response to MI300 has been overwhelmingly positive, and we are aggressively ramping production to support the dozens of cloud, enterprise and supercomputing customers deploying Instinct accelerators.
In cloud, we are working closely with Microsoft, Oracle, Meta and other large cloud customers on Instinct GPU deployments, powering both their internal AI workloads and external offerings. For enterprise customers, HPE, Dell, Lenovo, Supermicro and other server vendors are on track to launch differentiated MI300 platforms later this quarter with strong demand from multiple enterprise customers. In HPC supercomputing, we shipped the majority of AMD Instinct MI300A accelerators for the El Capitan supercomputer in the fourth quarter and expect to complete shipments this quarter for what is expected to be the world's fastest supercomputer when it comes online later this year.
We also closed new Instinct GPU wins in the quarter, including the flagship system at the German High-Performance Computing Center, HLRS, as well as what is expected to be one of the world's most powerful enterprise supercomputers for energy company, Eni. On AI software development, we made significant progress expanding the ecosystem of AI developers working on AMD platforms with the release of our ROCm 6 software suite. The ROCm 6 stack significantly increases performance in key generative AI workloads, adds expanded support and optimizations for additional frameworks and libraries and simplifies the overall developer experience.
The additional functionality and optimizations of ROCm 6 and the growing volume of contributions from the open source AI software community are enabling multiple large hyperscale and enterprise customers to rapidly bring up their most advanced large language models on AMD Instinct accelerators. For example, we are very pleased to see how quickly Microsoft was able to bring up GPT-4 on MI300X in their production environment and roll out Azure private previews of new MI300 instances aligned with the MI300X launch.
At the same time, our partnership with Hugging Face, the leading open platform for the AI community, now enables hundreds of thousands of AI models to run out of the box on AMD GPUs, and we are extending that collaboration to our other platforms. Looking ahead, our prior guidance was for data center GPU revenue to be flattish from Q4 to Q1 and exceed $2 billion for 2024. Based on the strong customer pull and expanded engagements, we now expect data center GPU revenue to grow sequentially in the first quarter and exceed $3.5 billion in 2024. We have also made significant progress with our supply chain partners and have secured additional capacity to support upside demand.
Turning to our client segment. Revenue was $1.5 billion, an increase of 62% year-over-year and flat sequentially. We launched our latest generation Ryzen 8000 Series notebooks and desktop processors in January, including our Ryzen 8040 Mobile Series that combine leadership compute performance and energy efficiency with an updated MPU that delivers up to 60% more AI performance compared to our prior generation that was already industry-leading. Acer, ASUS, HP, Lenovo, MSI and other large PC OEMs will all offer notebooks powered by our Ryzen 8000 series processors, with the first systems expected to go on sale in February.
To further our leadership in AI PCs, we launched our Ryzen 8000G series processors earlier this month, which are the industry's first desktop CPUs with an integrated AI engine. Millions of AI PCs powered by Ryzen processors have shipped to date and Ryzen CPUs power more than 90% of AI-enabled PCs currently in market. Our work with Microsoft and our PC ecosystem partners to enable the next generation of AI PCs expanded significantly in the quarter.
We are aggressively driving our Ryzen AI CPU road map to extend our AI leadership, including our next-gen Strix processors that are expected to deliver more than 3x the AI performance of our Ryzen 7040 Series processors. Strix combines our next-gen Zen 5 core with enhanced RDNA graphics and an updated Ryzen AI engine to significantly increase performance, energy efficiency and AI capabilities of PCs. Customer momentum for Strix is strong, with the first notebooks on track to launch later this year.
Looking at 2024, we are planning for the PC TAM to grow modestly year-on-year, weighted towards the second half as AI PCs ramp. We continue to see strong growth opportunities for our client business as we ramp our current products, extend our AI PC leadership and launch our next wave of Zen 5 CPUs.
Now turning to our Gaming segment. Revenue declined 17% year-over-year and 9% sequentially to $1.4 billion as lower semi-custom revenue was partially offset by increased sales of Radeon GPUs. Semi-custom SoC sales declined in line with our projections in the quarter. Going forward, we now expect annual revenue to decline by a significant double-digit percentage year-over-year as supply caught up with demand in 2023 and we entered the fifth year of what has been a very strong console cycle.
In Gaming graphics, revenue grew both year-over-year and sequentially, driven by strong demand in the channel for both our Radeon 6000 and Radeon 7000 series GPUs. We expanded our Radeon 7000 GPU series with the launch of new RX 7600 XT Series enthusiast desktop GPUs earlier this month that offer leadership price performance for 1080p gaming. We also launched new open source Fidelity FX Super Resolution 3 software that can deliver significantly higher gaming frame rates on both GPUs and APUs.
Turning to our Embedded segment. Revenue decreased 24% year-over-year and 15% sequentially to $1.1 billion as customers focused on reducing their inventory levels. We expanded our embedded portfolio in the quarter with new leadership solutions for key markets. We launched new Versal Prime Adaptive SoCs for the aerospace, test and measurement, health care and communications markets that deliver industry-first support for DDR5 memory and increased DSP capability compared to our prior generation.
In automotive, we launched new Versal SoC solutions that bring industry-leading AI compute capabilities and advanced safety and security features to next-generation vehicles. We also launched Ryzen embedded processors with unmatched performance and features for industrial automation, machine vision, robotics and edge server applications.
Looking at 2024, we expect overall Embedded demand will remain soft through the first half of the year as customers continue to focus on normalizing their inventory levels. Longer term, we're very confident in the growth trajectory of our Embedded business as our expanded product portfolio drove more than $10 billion of design wins in 2023, an increase of more than 25% compared to 2022.
In summary, I'm very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results. For 2024, we expect the demand environment to remain mixed, with strong growth in our data center and client segments, offset by declines in our Embedded and Gaming segments. Against this backdrop, we believe we will deliver strong annual revenue growth and expand gross margin, driven by the strength of our Instinct, EPYC and Ryzen product portfolios. Taking a step back, we believe AI is a once-in-a-generation transition that will reshape virtually every portion of the computing market, starting in the data center and then expanding into PCs and across multiple embedded markets.
We have built excellent customer traction based on the strength of our multiyear AI hardware and software road maps, and we see clear opportunities to drive our next wave of growth as we deliver leadership AI solutions across our portfolio. In the data center, we see 2024 as a start of a multiyear AI adoption cycle with the market for data center AI accelerators growing to approximately $400 billion in 2027. Customer deployments of our Instinct GPUs continues accelerating, with MI300 now tracking to be the fastest revenue ramp of any product in our history and positioning us well to capture significant share over the coming years based on the strength of our multi-generation instinct GPU road map and open source ROCm software strategy.
In PCs, we are focused on delivering our long-term road maps with leadership Ryzen AI NPU capabilities to enable differentiated experiences as Microsoft and our other software partners bring new AI capabilities to PC starting later this year. At the same time, we are rapidly driving leadership AI compute capabilities across the full breadth of our embedded product portfolio. This is an incredibly exciting time for the industry and even more exciting time for AMD as our leadership IP, broad product portfolio and deep customer relationships position us well to deliver significant revenue growth and earnings expansion over the next several years.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jean to provide some additional color on our fourth quarter and full year financial results. Jean? Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results and then provide our current outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. AMD executed well in 2023 despite mixed market demand environment, delivering revenue of $22.7 billion and earnings per share of $2.65. We drove year-over-year revenue growth in our embedded and data center segments. In addition, we successfully launched our AMD Instinct MI300 GPUs, positioning us for a strong ramp in 2024 in the AI market.
For the fourth quarter of 2023, revenue was $6.2 billion, growing 10% year-over-year as revenue growth in the Data Center and the Client segments was partially offset by the lower revenue in our Embedded and Gaming segment. Revenue was up 6% sequentially, primarily driven by the ramp of AMD Instinct GPUs across several leading customers and higher revenue from EPYC server processors, partially offset by the decline in Embedded and Gaming segment revenues. Gross margin was 51%, flat year-over-year, with higher revenue contribution from the Data Center and the Client segments offset by lower Embedded segment revenue.
Operating expenses were $1.7 billion, an increase of 8% year-over-year as we invest in R&D and marketing activities to support our significant AI growth opportunities. Operating income was $1.4 billion, representing a 23% operating margin. Taxes, interest expense and other was $163 million. For the fourth quarter of 2023, diluted earnings per share was $0.77, an increase of 12% year-over-year.
Now turning to our reportable segments. Starting with the Data Center segment, revenue was $2.3 billion, up 38% year-over-year and 43% sequentially, driven by strong growth of both AMD Instinct GPU and the fourth-generation AMD EPYC CPU sales. Data Center segment operating income was $666 million or 29% of revenue compared to $444 million or 27% a year ago. Higher operating income was primarily due to operating liability driven by higher revenue. Client segment revenue was $1.5 billion, up 62% year-over-year, driven by Ryzen 7000 Series CPU sales. Client segment operating income was $55 million or 4% of revenue compared to an operating loss of $152 million a year ago driven by higher revenue.
Gaming segment revenue was $1.4 billion, down 17% year-over-year and 9% sequentially due to a decrease in semi-custom revenue, partially offset by increase in Radeon GPU sales. Gaming segment operating income was $224 million or 16% of revenue compared to $266 million or 16% a year ago. Embedded segment revenue was $1.1 billion, down 24% year-over-year and 15% sequentially as customers continue to work down their inventory levels. Embedded segment operating income was $461 million or 44% of revenue compared to $699 million or 50% a year ago.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. During the quarter, we generated $381 million in cash from operations and the free cash flow was $242 million. Inventory decreased sequentially by $94 million to $4.4 billion. At the end of the quarter, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment was strong at $5.8 billion. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2 million shares and returned $233 million to shareholders. For the year, we repurchased 10 million shares and returned $985 million to shareholders. We have $5.6 billion in remaining share repurchase authorization.
Now turning to our first quarter of 2024 outlook. We expect revenue to be approximately $5.4 billion, plus or minus $300 million. Sequentially, we expect Data Center segment revenue to be flat, with the seasonal decline in server sales offset by strong Data Center GPU ramp. Embedded revenue to decline as customers continue to work down their inventory levels. Client segment revenue to decline seasonally. And in the Gaming segment, as we enter the fifth year of what has been a very strong gaming cycle and given current customer inventory levels, we expect revenue to decline by significant double-digit percentage. Year-over-year, we expect Data Center and Client segment revenues to increase by strong double-digit percentage given the strength of our product portfolio and the share gain opportunities. Embedded segment to decline and the Gaming segment revenue to decline by significant double-digit percentage.
In addition, we expect first quarter non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 52%. Non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.73 billion. Non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 13% and the diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.63 billion shares. While we are not providing specific full year guidance for 2024, let me provide some color.
Directionally, for the year, we expect the 2024 Data Center and the Client segment revenue to increase, driven by the strengths of our product portfolio and the share gain opportunities. Embedded segment revenue to decline and the Gaming segment revenue to decline by significant double-digit percentage. We expect to expand gross margin in 2024 and continue to invest to address the large AI opportunities while driving operating model leverage to deliver earnings per share growth faster than top line revenue growth.
In closing, we delivered solid financial results in 2023, further strengthening our product portfolio and establishing ourselves as a leading provider of data center GPUs for AI. We are very well positioned to build on this momentum and deliver strong financial performance in 2024 and beyond.
With that, I'll turn it back to Mitch for the Q&A session. Thank you, Jean. John, we're happy to poll the audience for questions. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Just kind of framing the outlook and the guidance for this calendar first quarter. I guess the first question is, can you help us on a relative basis, the $400 million of data center GPU revenue that you expected in Q4, what that ultimately kind of fell out to be? And then on the guidance into 1Q, can you help us appreciate what seasonal is defined as we think about the Server business into the 1Q guide? Sure, Aaron. Let me start and then see if Jean has something to add. So relative to the data center GPU business, look, we were very pleased with the performance that we saw in the fourth quarter. It was always going to be a very sort of back-end quarter weighted as we were ramping the product. And we saw MI300A, our HPC product actually ramped very well. And then we saw MI300X, the AI product actually exceed our expectations based on the strong customer demand, the way the qualifications went and then the ramp -- manufacturer ramp. So we were over $400 million for that business in the fourth quarter.
And then going into the first quarter, as we look at the business, server seasonality, call it, something around, let's call it, high single digit, low double digit. There are also some other pieces of the data center business. I think the key piece of it is, we had originally expected the ramp to be a little bit more shallow of our MI300X. And what we're seeing now is the supply chain is operating really well and the customer demand is strong. And so we will see MI300x increase as we go into the first quarter and things are going relatively well. Yes. Aaron, I'll give you some color about client seasonality and others. So Client is very similar to server. Typically, Q1 is high single digit to low double digit. That's consistent with the past. On the Embedded side, it's very consistent with what we said in the past and consistent with what you see in the industry is Embedded business is going through a bottoming process. And we think Q1, it will have a low double-digit sequential decline. That's Embedded.
On the Gaming side, Lisa mentioned during her prepared remarks is we have the late stage of product cycle in the year 5 of gaming console. But at the same time, we're also having inventory at the customers. So the combination of those impact, we expect the Q1 gaming sequential decline probably more than 30%. So hopefully, that helps you a little bit. Yes. Very helpful, Jean. And as a quick follow-up, I'm just curious, the traditional server demand that you see, I know when we look at server CPU, shipments are down north of 20% year-over-year. Are you seeing any signals or how are you thinking about a recovery in that traditional, call it, non-AI general-purpose server market as we move through '24? Sure, Aaron. So look, I think I agree with your characterization of the 2023 demand, although we did see some strong progress in the second half of the year, especially as customers in cloud and enterprise adopted our Genoa and our Zen 4 family. So going into 2024, I would say the traditional server market is probably still mixed, especially into the first half of the year. There's still some cloud optimization going on as well as sort of enterprise being a little bit cautious.
That being the case, though, we also see opportunities for us to continue to grow share in the traditional server business. I think our portfolio is extremely strong. The adoption of Genoa and Bergamo as well as our new Siena  product lines are getting a lot of traction. And then we also see Turin, our Zen 5 product, coming in the second half of the year. So even in a mixed demand environment, I think we're bullish on what traditional server CPUs can do in 2024. And the next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Lisa, I'm wondering if you can give us a little bit of sense in terms of the milepost that you're kind of marching toward on this $400 billion TAM that you have for 2027. For example, do you think you can gain share at a rate that's kind of similar to the rate that you gained share for server CPU? Or I guess, maybe asked a different way, is it reasonable to kind of look at your consumer GPU share of 20-plus percent? Is that a reasonable bogey? Or do you have aspirations higher than that perhaps? Yes. Thanks, Tim, for the question. I would say a couple of things. First of all, we're really pleased with the progress that we've made in our Data Center GPU business. I think the ramp that we've seen, the customer traction that we've seen even in the last few months, I think, has been great and that gives us a lot of confidence in the ramp of this business. I think the beauty of the AI market here is it's growing so quickly that I think we have both the market dynamic as well as our ability to gain share in that framework.
The point I will make is, our customer engagements right now are all quite strategic, dozens of customers with multigenerational conversations. So as excited as we are about the ramp of MI300, and frankly, there's a lot to do in 2024, we're also very excited about the opportunities to extend that into the next couple of years out into that '25, '26, '27 time frame. So I think we see a lot of growth. I think It's a little early to make market share projections, but I would say it's a significant growth driver given the market demand as well as our own product capabilities. Jean, I guess, as a follow-up, I know that you don't want to guide the full year, but I'm wondering if I can pin you down just a touch on maybe a milepost that you're kind of marching to for 2024 growth is up 20% for the whole company. Is that a reasonable target? And then I guess within Data Center, if you just add the incremental Data Center GPU revenue and you assume that the server business grows a little bit, it seems like that should maybe double year-over-year. But I'm kind of wondering if you can give us any ranges on those numbers. Tim. Thank you for the question. Yes, we're not guiding a year. It's very early of the year, literally January. I think the way to think about it is, Lisa mentioned it during her prepared remarks, we feel pretty good about both our Data Center and Client business to grow in 2024. Of course, the largest incremental revenue opportunities are going to come from Data Center between both the server side gaining more share and the data center GPU side with a significant ramp of our MI300. I think that's how we think about it.
We do have a headwind from Gaming segment, we do think year-over-year, we will see very significant double-digit decline on the Gaming segment. And at the same time, Embedded is going through the bottoming process. We do think the second half will see the recovery. So those are the puts and takes I can talk about it. And the next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with TD Cowen. Lisa, I wanted to ask, I mean, there's been so much focus and scrutiny as there should be on the really exciting progression with MI300. And I mean we've progressed over the last 6 months from, I think, some doubts in the investment community to software and your ability to ramp the product. And now you've proven that you're ramping it with, I think, you said dozens of customers, right, across different end markets.
What I'm interested in hearing a little bit more about and you guys have been open about what some of the forward programs in your traditional server business look like from a road map perspective. I'd be interested to hear how you're thinking about the road map in your MI accelerator family? Is it going to -- they're going to continue to be parts that are CPU and GPU together? Is it primarily a GPU only road map? What kind of cadence are you thinking about? Just any kind of color you can give us on some of the forward road map trajectory for that program would be really helpful. Yes. Sure, Matt. So I appreciate the comments. I think the traction that we're getting with the MI300 family is really strong. I think what's benefited us here is our use of chiplet technologies, which has given us the ability to have sort of both the APU version as well as the GPU version, and we continue to use that to differentiate ourselves. And that's how we get our memory bandwidth and memory capacity advantages.
As we go forward, you can imagine like we did in the EPYC time frame, we plan multiple generations in sequence. That's the way we're planning the road map. One of the things I will note about the AI accelerator market is the demand for compute is so high that we are seeing sort of an acceleration of the road map generations here, and we are similarly planning acceleration of our road map. I would say that we'll talk more about the overall road map beyond MI300 as we get into later this year, but you can be assured that we're working very closely with our customers to have a very competitive road map for both training and inference that will come out over the next couple of years. Just as a follow-up, I guess one of the questions that I've been getting a lot in different forms is with respect to the $400 billion TAM that you guys have laid out for 2027. Maybe you could give us a little look under the hood as to, I guess, the -- I've got 100 versions of the same question, which is how the heck did you come up with that number. So if you could give us a little bit more in terms of are we talking about systems and accelerator cards? Are we talking about just the silicon? Are we talking about full servers? And what kind of sort of unit assumptions, any kind of thing that you can give us on market sizing or what gives you the visibility so early into this generative AI trend to give a precise number 3 years out? That would be really, really helpful. Sure. Well, Matt, I don't know how precise it is, but I think we said approximately $400 billion. But I think what we need to look at is growth rate and how do we get to those growth rates. I think we expect units to grow sort of substantial double-digit percentage. But you should also expect that content is going to grow. So if you think about how important memory and memory capacity is, as we go forward, you can imagine that we'll see acceleration there in just the overall content as we go to more advanced technology nodes.
So there's some ASP uplift in there. And then what we also do is we're planning longer-term road maps with our customers in terms of how they're thinking about sort of the size of training clusters, the number of training clusters. And then the fact that we believe inference is actually going to exceed training as we go into the next couple of years, just given as more enterprises adopt. So I think as we look at all those pieces, I think we feel good that the growth rate is going to be significant and sustained over the next few years.
In terms of what's in that TAM, it really is accelerator TAM. So within accelerators, there are certainly GPUs, and there will also be some ASICs that are -- or other accelerators that are in that TAM. As we think about sort of the different types of models from smaller models to fine-tuning of models to very -- the largest -- large language models, I think you're going to need different silicon for those different use cases. But from our standpoint, GPUs are still going to be the sort of the compute element of choice when you're talking about training and inferencing on the largest language models. And the next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. I think you talked about the MI300 cloud workloads being kind of split between the more customer-facing workloads versus internal. Can you talk about how you see the breakdown of that? And how is your ecosystem progressing? This is a brand-new chip, it seems impressive that you're able to support kind of a broad range of customer-facing workloads in cloud. Yes, sure, Joe. So yes, look, we are really happy with how the MI300 has come up, and we've now deployed and working with a number of customers. What we have seen is certainly ROCm 6 has been very important as well as the direct optimization with our top cloud customers. We always said that the best way of optimizing the software is working directly on the most important workloads. And we've seen performance come up nicely, which is what we expect, frankly, with the GPU capabilities that we would have to do some level of optimization, but that optimization has gone well.
I think to your broader question, the way I look at this is there are lots of opportunities for us to work directly with large customers, both on the cloud side as well as on the enterprise side who have specific training and inferencing workloads. Our job is to make it as easy as possible for them. And so our entire tool chain, all of our -- sort of the overall ROCm suite has really gone through significant progress over the last 6 to 9 months. And then we're also getting some nice support from the open source community. So the work that Hugging Face is doing is tremendous in terms of just real-time optimization on our hardware, our partnership with OpenAI on Triton and our work across a number of these open source models has helped us actually make very rapid progress. Great. And for my follow-up, I guess, a lot of the forecasting of your business that I'm hearing is coming from supply chain, and we're sort of hearing AMD's building AX in Asia. I guess how would you ask us to think about that? Are you looking at being kind of sold out for the year and so the supply chain would be close to revenue? Are you building for the best case scenario? Just I worry about sometimes expectations when people hear these supply chain numbers. And I'm just curious how you would bridge the gap. Yes. So I mean, Joe, I think we updated our revenue expectations this quarter from our original number of $2 billion to $3.5 billion to try to give some bounding on some of the discussion out there. The way to think about the $3.5 billion is these are customers that we're working with who have given us firm commitments on what they need. As you know, the lead times on these products are quite long. So it's important to have those forecasts in early. And we have a strong order book. So that gives us good confidence to exceed the $3.5 billion.
From a supply chain standpoint, our goal is always to build more supply. We -- and so from that standpoint, we have also worked with our supply chain partners and secured significant capacity. Think about it as first half capacity is tight and more comes on in the second half of the year, but we've certainly made more progress there. So we do have more supply, and we're going to continue to work with our customers on their deployments, and we'll update that number as we go through the year. And the next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. I had one on the MI300 as well, Lisa. I guess, first of all, how should we think about the quarterly trajectory beyond Q1? You talked about Q1 being up sequentially. Is it fair to assume kind of a straight line as we progress through the balance of the year? Or is it more second half skewed? How should we think about that?
And I guess more importantly, some of the cloud potential customers that have yet to officially sign up for -- sign off on the MI300. I guess what's the sticking point? Is it just a function of time and you just need a little bit more time to go back and forth and tweak things? Or is there a software kind of concern? I guess what's holding them back at this point? Yes, Toshiya. Thanks for the question. So first, on the MI300 trajectory, I think you would expect that revenue should increase every quarter from now through sort of the end of the year, but it will be a bit more second half weighted. And part of that is just customers as they're finishing up their qualifications in their lines as well as sort of how our supply chain is ramping. So yes, it should increase each quarter, but be a bit more second half weighted.
And then to your comment about customers. Look, we're engaged with all of -- sort of the large customers. These are all folks that know us really well, given our deep relationships in EPYC. I think people just have different adoption cycles as they consider what they're trying to do in their road map. But I view this as still very, very early innings for us in this space. And I think a question was asked earlier. I think the key is this is not just about an MI300 conversation, but it really is about sort of our long-term multigenerational road map. And so that's the context on which we're working with our largest customers as well as, as you know, there's a lot of demand coming from folks that are more AI-centric and not necessarily typical cloud customers, but more enterprise or, let's call it, AI-specific companies that we're also very well engaged with. Got it. That's super helpful. And then as my follow-up, maybe one for Jean on the gross margin side. You're guiding Q1 to 52%. Curious -- again, I'm sure you're not going to give quantitative guidance beyond Q1, but how to think about the trajectory for Q2 and beyond. I'm pretty sure you're working through some kinks as it pertains to the Instinct ramp. Hopefully, that improves over time. So that should be a tailwind. FPGAs, perhaps the second half turns for the better, and you've got server CPU volume growth throughout the year. So it feels like you've got multiple tailwinds as we think about gross margin progression on a sequential basis. But what are the potential headwinds as we move throughout 2024? Yes, Toshiya, thank you for the question. Yes, you're absolutely right. We have some puts and takes that impact our gross margin. We guided the Q1 120 basis points higher than Q4 sequentially, primarily because of the higher Data Center contribution actually more than offset the decline of Embedded business in Q1.
Going forward, the way to think about it is, as you said, is the major driver is going to be Data Center business is going to grow much faster than other segments. That mix change will help us to expand the gross margin nicely. I think you also are spot on, on the Embedded coming back in second half, which will be a tailwind. With the Data Center GPU, we are at the very early stage of ramp.
We are improving testing time yield and continue to expand gross margin, and we expect it to be accretive to corporate average. So those are all the tailwinds coming in the second half. I would say, the headwinds side continue to be in the first half where we see Embedded business not only in Q1, we see sequential decline. Q2 probably are going to be sequentially flattish versus Q1. That is a headwind for us because it does have a very nice gross margin. But overall, we feel pretty good about the trajectory of the gross margin improvement, especially second half. And the next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. I want to get into the competitive environment. First, on the Instinct side of things, how that's going. It doesn't seem to be slowing down your ramp whatsoever. But then also on the straight server CPU side of things, Lisa, you said you're gaining share in that area. But as we think about future road maps, pricing incentives, those sorts of things, any meaningful change in the competitive environment that you're seeing through 2024? Sure, Ross. So look, I think the environment for us is always competitive. So I think that has not changed. If I look at the Instinct side, I think we have -- I think we've shown that MI300 and our road map are actually very competitive. There are some places where, let's call it, it's more even like in the training environment. But as we look at the inferencing environment, we think we have significant advantages. And that's shown through in some of our customer work. So we think for both training and inference, we will continue to be very competitive.
And then as you go into the CPU side, again, from our view, with each generation of EPYC, we've continued to gain share. I think we exited the fourth quarter at record share for AMD, and we're still quite underrepresented in enterprise. So I think there's an opportunity for us to continue to gain share as we go through 2024. From a competitive standpoint, what we see is Zen 4 is extremely competitive right now with Genoa, Bergamo, Siena. And as we go in to Turin, we're deep in the design in cycle for Zen 5 and Turin, and we feel very good about how we're positioned. I guess as my follow-up, on the data center side, another theme that's been pervasive throughout 2023, at least was the GPU side clouding out the CPU side. You mentioned that there is still a little bit of cloud digestion going on within your EPYC business. But where do you see that standing? I know you're going to gain share, et cetera, but you guys clearly benefit from the Instinct side of the data center GPU side, but what about on the CPU side of things? Is that headwind now behind us? Or is it still an issue? I think we expect the CPU business from a market standpoint to grow, Ross, as we go into 2024. I think the rate and pace of growth will depend a little bit on the macro and just overall CapEx trends. But from our standpoint, we are starting to see some of our larger customers plan their refresh cycles. There's a lot of, let's call it, older equipment that has yet to be refreshed. And the value proposition for refresh is so strong because the energy efficiency and sort of the footprint of the newer generations are so much better than sort of the 4- or 5-year old infrastructure that we do see that refresh cycle happening as we get into 2024. I think the exact timing, we'll have to understand more as the market evolves as we go through the year. And the next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. So first one, Lisa, from -- you gave us a $2 billion plus number for MI before. Now you have raised it to over $3.5 billion. And I'm curious what drove the change? Was it incremental demand signals? Was it supply? And can you supply more if, let's say, demand is $4 billion or $5 billion or $6 billion, right? What is the limitation? And sort of related to that, on the competition side, your competitor will launch their B100 later in the year. Do you think that will change the competitive landscape in any way? Yes. Sure, Vivek. So I think what we said is as we went from $2 billion to $3.5 billion, it really is mostly customer demand signals. So as orders have come on books and as we've seen programs move from, let's call it, pilot programs into full manufacturing programs. We have updated the revenue forecast. As I said earlier, from a supply standpoint, we are planning for success, and so we worked closely with our supply chain partners to ensure that we can ship more than $3.5 billion, substantially more depending on what customer demand is as we go into the second half of the year. And then in terms of, again, road maps, as I said, we're very focused on a competitive road map that sort of what the next generations are beyond MI300. So I do believe that we have a strong road map in place and continue to work with our customers to sort of adopt our road map as quickly as possible. Got it. And longer-term question, Lisa, if I look at the success that AMD has enjoyed, it's many factors, but a few of them included your early adoption of chiplets and the strong partnerships we have had with TSMC. But now we are seeing your x86 competitor, Intel, also adopt chiplet or tile technology as they call it. And then I think recently, the manufacturing update they gave, they said they are 2 years ahead in terms of incorporating gate all around and backside delivery. So let's assume they are right and they have either caught up to TSMC or maybe they are ahead, what impact does that have on AMD in kind of the medium to longer term? Yes. Sure, Vivek. Look, we're always looking at what's next, right? So on the chiplet technology, I mean, we're sort of on the fourth generation of the chiplet technologies. I think we've learned a lot about how to optimize performance there. We are very aggressive with our adoption of leading-edge technology as it's needed. But I think those are only a few of the pieces.
We're also focused on continuing to innovate on architecture and design. So I think the longer-term question that you asked is, I think we're expecting that the competition is going to be on a similar process technology. And even in that case, I think we feel like we have a very strong road map going forward, and we'll continue to drive both the CPU and the GPU road map very aggressively. And the next question comes from the line of Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler. I have 2 questions. Let me start off with the accelerator side. The question we get a lot from our customers is they want to understand the value proposition of the MI300. So Lisa, I was hoping you could give us some understanding of price versus power comparison or compute power. And then today, are you seeing your customers that are buying the MI300, are they primarily buying it for inferencing today? Or are they using it primarily for tooling? And maybe for Jean. Jean, do you think is it possible for MI300 to finish the year at a run rate of about 1.5 billion? Okay, Harsh. So let me start. Your question about the value proposition for MI300. Again, customers are using it for different reasons, but I presume that there is a performance per dollar benefit to using AMD. So that's one piece of it. The other piece of it, though, is we intrinsically have more free bandwidth and memory capacity on MI300X compared to the competition. And what that means is for large language models that are many tens of billions of parameters, you make -- you could potentially do the workload in fewer GPUs. So it's a substantial system savings and allows you to do much more work within the same system.
In terms of what customers are using MI300 for today, I would say there are a number of customers using it for large language model inferencing. And there are also customers that are using it for training. So I think the whole point is being a strong partner. When you put these AI systems in place, they are sometimes mixed-use systems, so they would be used for both training and inference. John, we have time for 2 more questions. Yes, Harsh, let me answer your question about the MI300. Exiting Q4 2024, is it possible get to 1.5? It is possible, right? Because Lisa mentioned earlier, we'll see sequential increase each quarter and more back-end loaded in second half. And we do have supplies more than 3.5 billion. And of course, we'll continue to make progress with our customers. So the math, yes, it's possible. But right now, we are really looking at focusing on the execution of the current 3.5 billion-plus. And the next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. For the first one, you had talked about that you had expected a more shallow ramp of the MI300, and it's clearly doing better than that. So is some of the upside, I guess, in the near term, is that being pulled forward from the second half? Or is this like a step-up? Or is it more of a step-up in demand both in the first half and the second half relative to what you were seeing before? Like how do I interpret that like shallow comment that you made? Sure, Stacy. I don't think it's a pull forward of demand. I think what it is, is we want -- we wanted to see how long it would take for customers to fully qualify and get their workloads performance. So that depends a lot on the actual engineering work that's done. And now that we're, let's call it, a quarter later, we've seen that it's gone really well. So it's actually gone a bit better than our original forecast. And as a result, we've seen stronger demand signals and customers are gaining confidence in their ability to deploy a significant number of MI300s this year. Got it. For my follow-up, I want to ask Matt's question a little more directly. You didn't quite answer it. The $400 billion number that you've got out there, is that just silicon in chips? Or is there hardware and servers and stuff like that in that number as well? Like what's in that number? Yes. I thought I had answered it. But yes, I'll answer it again. It is accelerator chips. It is not systems. So think of it as GPUs, ASICs that will be there, those types of things, but includes -- obviously, it includes memory and other things that are packaged together with the GPUs. Yes, memory will be quite significant, right? So memory is a big portion of it too. And the final question comes from the line of Chris Danely with Citi. I guess a question for Lisa. As MI300 revenue ramps, how do you see the customer concentration, let's say, a year or 2 from now? Do you think you'll have 1 or 2 customers that are in double digits or 1 or 2 that are half the revenue? Or do you think it will be totally fragmented? I don't think it will be 1 or 2 that are half the revenue, Chris. I think we're building this as a -- really, we're happy to see sort of the broad adoption. As always, with sort of the large cloud partners, we might see sort of 1 or 2 that are higher than others, but I don't think you see the type of concentration that you mentioned. Great. And then just to follow up on somebody else's question on sort of Intel's road map versus TSMC. So I'm sure you're intimately familiar with TSMC's manufacturing road map, and we've all seen Intel open up the kimono on what they expect to happen over the next couple of years. I mean do you think Intel is going to close the gap somewhat with your foundry over the next couple of years? Or do you think they'll be able to maintain the lead? Yes. Look, I feel very good about our partnership with TSMC. They continue to execute extremely well. We'll see what happens over the next few years. But I'd like to kind of reemphasize what I said earlier, even in the case of process parity, we feel very good about our architectural road map and all of the other things that we add as we look at our entire portfolio of CPUs, GPUs, DPUs, adaptive SoCs and kind of put them together to solve problems. I think we feel really good about what we can do with our customers. So we're always going to be paying attention to sort of the process race, but I think we feel very good about sort of our strategy and how do we continue to sort of push the envelope on the computing road maps. Okay. And that is the end of the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to the AMD team for any closing comments. Great, John. That concludes today's call.

With that, I will hand the call over to Lisa. Thanks, Mitch, and good afternoon to all those listening today. This is an incredibly exciting time for the industry as the widespread deployment of AI is driving demand for significantly more compute across a broad range of markets. Under this backdrop, we are executing very well as we ramp our data center business and enable AI capabilities across our product portfolio.
Looking at the first quarter, revenue eased to $5.5 billion. We expanded gross margin by more than 2 percentage points and increased profitability as Data Center and client segment sales each grew by more than 80% year-over-year. Data Center segment revenue grew 80% year-over-year and 2% sequentially to a record $2.3 billion. The substantial year-over-year growth was driven by the strong ramp of AMD Instinct MI 300x GPU shipments and a double-digit percentage increase in server CPU sales. We believe we gained server CPU revenue share in the seasonally down first quarter led by growth in enterprise adoption and expanded cloud deployments.
In cloud, while the overall demand environment remained mixed, hyperscalers continue adopting fourth-gen EPYC processors to power more of their internal workloads and public instances. There are now nearly 900 AMD-powered public instances available globally as Amazon, Microsoft and Google all increased their fourth-gen EPYC processor offerings with new instances and regional deployments.
In the Enterprise, we have seen signs of improving demand as CIOs need to add more general purpose in AI compute capacity while maintaining the physical footprint and power needs of their current infrastructure. This scenario aligns perfectly with the value proposition of our EPYC processors. Given our high core count and energy efficiency, we can deliver the same amount of compute with 45% fewer servers compared to the competition, cutting initial CapEx by up to half and lowering annual OpEx by more than 40%. As a result, enterprise adoption of EPYC CPUs is accelerating, highlighted by deployments with large enterprises, including American Airlines, DBS, Emirates Bank, Shell and ST Micro.
We're also building momentum with AMD-powered solutions powering the most popular ERP and database applications. As one example of the latest generation of Oracle Exadata, the leading database solution used by 76 of the Fortune 100 is now powered exclusively by fourth-gen EPYC processors. Looking ahead, we're very excited about x-gen family of EPYC processors featuring our Zen 5 core. We're widely sampling turn and the silicon rate. In the cloud, the significant performance and efficiency increases of turn position us well to capture an even larger share of both first and third-party workloads.
In addition, there are 30% more turn platforms in development from our server partners compared to fourth-gen EPYC platforms, increasing our enterprise SAM with new solutions optimized for additional workloads. Churn remains on track to launch later this year.
Turning to our broader data center portfolio. We delivered our second straight quarter of record data center GPU revenue as MI300 became the fastest ramping product in AMD history, passing $1 billion in total sales in less than 2 quarters. In cloud, MI 300x production deployments expanded at Microsoft, Meta and Oracle to power generative AI training and inferencing for both internal workloads and a broad set of public offerings.
For the Enterprise, we're working very fly with Dell, HPE, Lenovo, Super Micro and others as multiple MI300x platforms enter volume production this quarter. In addition, we have more than 100 enterprise and AI customers actively developing or deploying MI300X. On the AI software front, we made excellent progress adding upstream support for AMD hardware in the open AI Triton compiler, making it even easier to develop highly AI software for AMD platforms.
We also released a major update to our ROM software stack that expand support for open source libraries, including VLLM and frameworks, including JAKs, adds new features like video decode and significantly increases generative AI performance by integrating advanced attention algorithm support for sparsity and FPA.
Our partners are seeing very strong performance in their AI workloads. As we jointly optimize for their models, MI300X GPUs are delivering leadership inferencing performance and substantial TCO advantages compared to H100. For instance, several of our partners are seeing significant increases in Token beckon when running their flagship LLMs on MI300x compared to each H100.
We're also continuing to enable the broad ecosystem required to power the next generation of AI systems including as a founding member of the Ultra Ethernet consortium working to optimize the widely adopted Ethernet protocol to run AI workloads at data center scale. MI300 demand continues to strengthen. And based on our expanding customer engagements, we netback data center GPU revenue to exceed $4 billion in 2024, up from the $3.5 billion we guided in January. Long term, we are increasingly working closer with our cloud and enterprise customers as we expand and accelerate our AI hardware and software road maps and grow our data center GPU footprint.
Turning to our client segment. Revenue was $1.4 billion, an increase of 85% year-over-year, driven by strong demand for our latest generation resin mobile and desktop processors with OEMs and in the channel. Client segment revenue declined 6% essentially. We saw strong demand for our latest generation Ryzen processors in the first quarter. Ryzen desktop CPU sales grew by a strong double-digit percentage year-over-year and Ryzen mobile CPU sales nearly doubled year-over-year as new Ryzen 80-40 notebook designs from Acer, Asus, HP, Lenovo and others ramped.
We expanded our portfolio of leadership enterprise PC offerings with the launch of our Ryzen Pro 8000 processors earlier this month. Ryzen Pro 80-40 mobile CPUs delivered industry-leading performance in battery life for commercial notebooks. And our Ryzen Pro 8000 series desktop CPUs are the first processor to offer dedicated, on-chip AI accelerators in commercial desktop PCs. We see clear opportunities to gain additional commercial PC share based on the performance and efficiency advantages of our Ryzen Pro portfolio and an expanded set of AMD-powered commercial PCs from our OEM partners.
Looking forward, we believe the market is on track to return to annual growth in 2024, driven by the start of an enterprise refresh cycle and AI PC adoption. We see AI as the biggest inflection point in PC since the Internet with the ability to deliver unprecedented productivity and usability gains. We're working very closely with Microsoft and a broad ecosystem of partners to enable the next generation of AI experiences powered by Ryzen processors, with more than 150 ISVs on track to be developing for AMD AI PCs by the end of the year.
We will also take the next major step in our AI PC road map later this year with the launch of our next-generation Ryzen mobile processors, coding strict. Customer interest in strict is very high based on the significant performance and energy efficiency uplifts we are delivering. Design win momentum for premium notebooks is outpacing generations as strict enables next-generation AI experiences in laptops that are thinner, lighter and faster than ever before. We're excited about the growth opportunities for the PC market. And based on the strength of our Ryzen CPU portfolio, we expect to grow revenue share this year.
Now turning to our Gaming segment. Revenue declined 48% year-over-year and 33% sequentially to $922 million. First quarter semi-custom SoC sales declined in line with our projections as we are now in the fifth year of the console cycle. In Gaming Graphics, revenue declined year-over-year and sequentially. We expanded our Radeon 7000 Series family with the global launch of our Radeon RX 7900 GRE and also introduced our driver-based AMD fluid motion frames technology that can provide large performance increases in thousands of games.
Turning to our Embedded segment. Revenue decreased 46% year-over-year and 20% sequentially to $846 million as customers remain focused on normalizing their inventory levels. We launched our Spartan Ultrascale+ FPGA family with high I/O counts, power efficiency and state-of-the-art security features, and we're seeing a strong pipeline of growth for our cost optimized embedded portfolio across multiple markets.
Given the current embedded market conditions, we're now expecting second quarter embedded segment revenue to be flat sequentially with a gradual recovery in the second half of the year. Longer term, we see AI at the edge as a large growth opportunity that will drive increased demand for compute across a wide range of devices. To address this demand, we announced our second generation of Versal adaptive SoCs that deliver a 3x increase in AI tops per watt and a 10x greater scaler compute performance compared to our prior generation of industry-leading adaptive SoCs.
Versal Gen 2 adaptive SoCs are the only solution that combine multiple compute engines to handle AI preprocessing, inferencing and post processing on a single chip, enabling customers to rapidly add highly performant and efficient AI capabilities to a broad range of products. We were pleased to be joined at our launch by Subaru, who announced they adopted Versal AI Edge series Gen 2 devices to power the next generation of their iSIGHT ADAS system.
Embedded Design win momentum remains very strong as customers adopt our full portfolio of PGAs, CPUs, GPUs and adaptive SoCs to address a larger portion of their compute needs.
In summary, we executed well in the first quarter, setting us up to deliver strong annual revenue growth and expanded gross margin driven by growing adoption of our instinct, EPYC and Ryzen product portfolios.
Our priorities for 2024 are very clear: accelerate our data center growth by ramping instinct GPU production and gaining share with our EPYC processors. Launch our next-generation Zen 5 PC and server processors that extend our leadership performance and expand our adaptive computing portfolio with differentiated solutions.
Looking further ahead, AI represents an unprecedented opportunity for AMD. While there has been significant growth in AI infrastructure build-outs, we are still in the very early stages of what we believe is going to be a period of sustained growth driven by an insatiable demand for both high-performance AI and purpose compute. We have expanded our investments across the company to capture this large growth opportunity from rapidly expanding our AI software stack to accelerating our AI hardware road maps, increasing our go-to-market entities and partnering closely with the largest AI companies to co-optimize solutions for their most important workloads. We are very excited about the trajectory of the business and the significant growth opportunities ahead.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jean to provide some additional color on our first quarter results. Jean? Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results and then provide our current outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. We delivered strong year-over-year revenue growth in our Data Center and Client segments in the fourth quarter and grew 230 basis points of gross margin expansion. For the first quarter of 2024, revenue was $5.5 billion, up 2% year-over-year as revenue growth in the Data Center and the Client segment was partially offset by lower revenue in our Gaming and Embedded segment.
Revenue declined 11% sequentially as higher data center revenue resulting from the ramp of our AMD Instinct GPUs was offset by lower gaming and Embedded segment revenues. Gross margin was 52%, up 230 basis points year-over-year, driven by higher revenue contribution from the Data Center and Client segment, partially offset by lower Embedded and Gaming segment revenue contribution.
Operating expenses were $1.7 billion, an increase of 10% year-over-year as we continued investing aggressively in R&D and marketing activities to address the significant AI growth opportunities ahead of us. Operating income was $1.1 billion, representing a 21% operating margin. Taxes, interest expense and other was $120 million. For the fourth quarter of 2024, diluted earnings per share was $0.62, an increase of 3% year-over-year.
Now turning to our Reportable segment, starting with the data center. Data Center delivered record quarterly segment revenue of $2.3 billion, up 80%, a $1 billion increase year-over-year. Data Center accounted for more than 40% of total revenue, primarily led by the ramp of AMD Instinct GPUs from both cloud and enterprise customers and a strong double-digit percentage growth in our server process revenue as a result of growth across our sample products.
On a sequential basis, revenue increased 2%, driven by the ramp of our AMD Instinct GPUs, partially offset by seasonal decline in server CPU sales. Data center segment operating income was $541 million or 23% of revenue compared to $148 million or 11% a year ago. Operating income was up 266% year-over-year due to operating leverage even as we significantly increased our investment in R&D.
Client segment revenue was $1.4 billion, up 85% year-over-year, driven primarily by Ryzen 8000 series processors. On a sequential basis, Client revenue declined 6%. Client segment operating income was $86 million or 6% of revenue compared to an operating loss of $172 million a year ago driven by higher revenue.
Gaming segment revenue was $922 million, down 48% year-over-year and down 33% sequentially due to a decrease in semi customer and Radeon GPU sales. Gaming segment operating income was $151 million or 16% of revenue compared to $314 million or 18% a year ago.
Embedded segment revenue was $846 million, down 46% year-over-year and 20% sequentially as customers continue to manage their inventory levels. Embedded segment, operating income was $342 million or 41% of revenue compared to $798 million or 51% a year ago.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. During the quarter, we generated $521 million in cash from operations, and free cash flow was $379 million. Inventory increased sequentially by $301 million to $4.7 billion, primarily to support the continued ramp of data center and client products in advanced process node.
At the end of the quarter, cash, cash equivalent and short-term investment was $6 billion. As a reminder, we have $750 million of debt maturing this June. Given our ample liquidity, we plan to retire that utilizing existing cash.
Now turning to our second quarter 2024 outlook. We expect revenue to be approximately $5.7 billion plus or minus $300 million. Sequentially, we expect data center segment revenue to increase by double-digit percentage, primarily driven by the data center GPU ramp. Client segment revenue to increase. Embedded segment revenue to be flat. And in the Gaming segment, based on current demand signals, revenue to decline by significant double-digit percentage.
Year-over-year, we expect our Data Center and Client segment revenue to be up significantly driven by the strength of our product portfolio. The Embedded and the Gaming segment revenue to decline by a significant double-digit percentage. In addition, we expect second quarter non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 53%. Non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.8 billion. Non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 13% and the diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.64 billion shares.
In closing, we started the year strong. We made significant progress on our strategic priorities, delivering year-over-year revenue growth in our data center and the client segment and expanded the gross margin. Looking ahead, we believe the investments we are making will position us very well to address the large AI opportunities ahead.
With that, I'll turn it back to Mitch for the Q&A session. Thank you, Jean. Paul, we're happy to poll the audience for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Lisa, my first question is on the MI300. You're taking up the full year outlook from $3.5 billion to $4 billion. I'm curious what's driving that incremental $500 million in revenue? Is it new customers? Is it additional bookings from existing customers? Is it more cloud? Is it more enterprise, if you can sort of provide color there, that would be helpful. And then on the supply side, there's been headlines or chatter that CoWoS and/or HBM could be a pretty severe constraining factor for you guys. If you can speak to how you're handling the supply side of the equation, that would be helpful, too. And then I have a quick follow-up. Great. Thank you, Toshiya, for the question. Look, the MI300 ramp is going really well. If we look at just what's happened over the last 90 days, we've been working very closely with our customers to qualify MI300 in their production data centers, both from a hardware standpoint, software standpoint. So far, things are going quite well. And what we see now is just greater visibility to both current customers as well as new customers committing to MI300. So that gives us the confidence to go from $3.5 billion to $4 billion. And I view this as very much -- it's a very dynamic market, and there are lots of customers, we said on the -- in the prepared remarks that we have over 100 customers that we're engaged with in both development as well as deployment. So overall, the ramp is going really well.
As it relates to the supply chain, actually, I would say I'm very pleased with how supply has ramped. It is absolutely the fastest product ramp that we have done. It's a very complex product, chiplets, CoWoS, 3D integration, HBM. And so far, it's gone extremely well. We've gotten great support from our partners. And so I would say, even in the quarter that we just finished, we actually did a little bit better than expected when we first started the quarter. I think Q2 will be another significant ramp. And we're going to ramp supply every quarter this year. So I think the supply chain is going well. We are tight on supply. So there's no question in the near term that if we had more supply, we have demand for that product, and we're going to continue to work on those elements as we go through the year. But I think both on the demand side and the supply side, I'm very pleased with how the ramp is going. And then as my follow-up, I was hoping you could speak to your Data Center GPU road map beyond the MI300. The other concern that we hear is your nearest competitor has been pretty transparent with their road map and that extends into '25 and oftentimes '26. So -- and maybe this isn't the right venue for you to give too much. But beyond the MI300, how should we think about your road map and your ability to compete in Data Center? Yes, sure. So look, Toshiya, when we start with the road map, I mean, we always think about it as a multiyear, multigenerational road map. So we have the follow-ons to MI300 as well as the next, next generations well in development. I think what is true is we're getting much closer to our top AI customers, they're actually giving us significant feedback on the road map and what we need to meet their needs. Our chiplet architecture is actually very flexible. And so that allows us to actually make changes to the road map as necessary. So we're very confident in our ability to continue to be very competitive. Frankly, I think we're going to get more competitive. Right now, I think MI300x is in a sweet spot for inference, very, very strong inference performance. I see as we bring in additional products later this year into 2025, that, that will continue to be a strong spot for us. And then we're also enhancing our training performance and our software road map to go along with it. So more details to come in the coming months, but we have a strong road map that goes through the next couple of years, and it is informed by just a lot of learning in working with our top customers. Our next question is from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. The non-AI side of the data center business, it sounds like the enterprise side has some good traction even though the sequential drop happened seasonally, Lisa. But I was just wondering what's implied in your second quarter guidance for the data center CPU side of things? And generally speaking, how are you seeing that whole kind of GPU versus CPU crowding out dynamic playing out for the rest of 2024? Yes, sure, Ross, thanks for the question. I think the -- our EPYC business has actually performed pretty well. The market is a bit mixed. I think some of the cloud guys are still working through sort of their optimizations. I think it's different by customer. We did see here in the first quarter, actually some very nice early signs in the enterprise space, sort of large customers starting refresh programs. The value proposition of general is very, very strong, and we're seeing that pull through across the enterprise. In the second quarter, we expect overall data center to be up strong double digits. And then within that, we expect server to be up as well. And as we go into the second half of the year, I think there are a couple of drivers for us. We do expect some improvement in the overall market conditions for the server business. But we also have our Turin launch in the second half of the year that will also, we believe, extend our leadership position within the server market. So overall, I think the business is performing well, and we believe that we're continuing to be very well positioned to gain share throughout the year. And I guess as my follow-up, just switching over to the client side. I noted you guided it up sequentially. Any sort of magnitude around that for the second quarter and perhaps more importantly [Technical Difficulty] [Audio Gap] both opportunity in, let's call it, the near term and even more so in the medium term. I think the client business is performing well, both on the channel and on the MNC side. We expect clients to be up sequentially in the second quarter. And as we go into the second half of the year, to your question about units versus ASPs, I think we expect some increase in units as well as ASPs. The AI PC products, when we look at the strict products, it's they're really well suited for the premium segments of the market. And I think that's where you're going to see some of the AI PC content strongest in the beginning. And then as we go into 2025, you would see it more across the rest of the portfolio. Our next question is from Matt Ramsey with TD Cowen. Lisa, I have sort of a longer-term question and then a shorter-term follow-up one. I guess the -- one of the questions that I've been getting from folks a lot is, obviously, your primary competitor has announced, I guess, a multiyear road map, and we continue to hear more and more from other folks about internal ASIC programs at some of your primary customers, whether they be for inference or training. I guess it would be really helpful if you could talk to us about how your conversations go with those customers, how committed they are to your long-term road map, multigeneration, as you described it. How they juxtapose doing investments of their internal silicon versus using a merchant supplier like yourselves and maybe what advantages the experience across a large footprint of customers can give your company that those guys doing internal ASICs might not get? Yes. Sure, Matt. Thanks for the question. So look, I think one of the things that we see and we've said is that the TAM for AI compute is growing extremely quickly. And we see that continuing to be the case in all conversations. We had highlighted a TAM of let's call it, $400 billion in 2027. I think some people thought that was aggressive at the time. But the overall AI compute needs, as we talk to customers is very, very strong. And you've seen that in some of the announcements even recently with some of the largest cloud guys.
From my view, there are several aspects of it. First of all, we have great relationships with all of sort of the top AI companies. And the idea there is we want to innovate together. When you look at these large language models and everything that you need for and inferencing there, although -- there will be many solutions. I don't think there's just one solution that will fit all. The DPU is still the preferred architecture, especially as the algorithms and the models are continuing to evolve over time. And that favors our architecture and also our ability to really optimize CPU with GPU. So from my standpoint, I think we're very happy with the partnerships that we have. I think this is a huge opportunity for all of us to really innovate together. And we see that there's a very strong commitment to working together over multiple years going forward. And that's, I think, a testament to some of the work that we've done in the past, and that very much is what happened with the EPYC road map as well. I appreciate that, Lisa. As my follow-up, a little bit shorter term. And I guess having followed the company super closely for a long time. I think there's been -- there's always been noise in the system from whether the stock price is $2 a share or $200, there's been kind of always consistent noise with the other. But the last 1.5 months has been extreme in that sense. And so I wanted to just -- I got random reports by inbox about changes in demand from some of your MI300 customers or planned demand for consuming your product. I think you answered earlier about the supply situation and how you're working with your partners there. But has there been any change from the customers that you're in ramp with now or that you soon will be of what their intention is for demand? Or in fact, has that maybe strengthened rather than gone down in recent periods because I keep getting questions about it? Sure, Matt. Look, I think I might have said it earlier, but maybe I'll repeat it again. I think the demand side is actually really strong. And what we see with our customers and what we are tracking very closely is customers moving from, let's call it, initial POCs to pilots to full-scale production to deployment across multiple workloads. And we're moving through that sequence very well. I feel very good about the deployments and ramps that we have ongoing right now. And I also feel very good about new customers who are sort of earlier on in that process. So from a demand standpoint, we continue to build backlog as well as build engagements going forward. And similarly, on the supply standpoint, we're continuing to build supply momentum. But from a speed of ramp standpoint, I'm actually really pleased with the progress. Our next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. I apologize if I missed this earlier, but I know last quarter, you talked about having a -- securing enough capacity to support significant upside to the ramp of the MI300. I know that you offed your guide now to $4 billion. I'm curious how you would characterize the supply relative to that context offered last quarter as we think about that new kind of target for? Would you characterize it as still having supply capacity upside potential? Yes, Aaron. So we've said before that our goal is to ensure that we have supply that exceeds the current guidance, and that is true. So as we've upped our guidance from $3.5 billion to $4 billion, we still -- we have supply visibility significantly beyond that. Yes. Okay. And then as a quick follow-up, going back to an earlier question on server demand, more traditional server. As you see the ramp of maybe share opportunities in more traditional enterprise, I'm curious how you would characterize the growth that you expect to see a more traditional server CPU market as we move through '24 or even longer term, how you'd characterize that growth trend? Yes. I think, Aaron, what I would say is there are -- the need for refresh of, let's call it, older equipment is certainly there. So we see a refresh cycle coming. We also see AI head nodes as another place where we see growth in, let's call it, the more traditional SDU market. Our sweet spot is really in the highest performance, sort of high core count, energy efficiency space, and that is playing out well. And we're also -- we've traditionally been very strong in, let's call it, cloud first-party workloads and that is now extending to cloud third-party workloads where we see enterprises who are, let's call it, more of a hybrid environment, adopting AMD both in the cloud and on-prem. So I think overall, we see it as a continued good progression for us with the server business going through 2024 and beyond. Our next question is from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Lisa, I just wanted to go back to the supply question and the $4 billion outlook for this year. I think at some point, there was a suggestion that the $4 billion number, right, that there are still supply constraints. But I think at resent point, you said that you have supply visibility significantly beyond that. Given that we are almost at the middle of the year, I would have thought that you would have much better visibility about the back half. So is the $4 billion number of supply constrained number? Or is it a demand constrained number? Or relatively, if you could give us some sense of what the exit rate of your GPU sales could be. I think on the last call, $1.5 billion was suggested. Could it be a lot more than that in terms of your exit rate of MI for this year? Yes. Vivek, let me try to make sure that we answered this question clearly. From a full year standpoint, our $4 billion number is not supply capped -- I'm sorry, yes, it's not supply cup. It is -- we do have supply capability above that. It is more back half weighted. So if you're looking at sort of the near term, I would say, for example, in the second quarter, we do have more demand than we have supply right now, and we're continuing to work on pulling in some of that supply. By the way, I think this is an overall industry issue. This is not at all related to AMD. I think overall, AI demand has exceeded anyone's expectations in 2024. So you've heard it from the memory guys. You've heard it from the foundry guys. We're all ramping capacity as we go through the year.
And as it relates to visibility, we do have good visibility into what's happening. As I said, we have great customer engagements that are going forward. My goal is to make sure that we pass all of the milestones as we're ramping products. And as we pass those milestones, we put that into the overall full year guidance for AI. But in terms of how customer progression things are going, they're actually going quite well, and we continue to bring new customers on and we continue to expand workloads with our current customers. And so hopefully, that clarifies the question, Vivek. Maybe one not in MI, but maybe on the embedded business. I think you sound a bit more mature about Q2 and the second half rebound, which is similar to what we have heard from a lot of the auto industrial peers. But where are you in the inventory clearing cycle? And if embedded has a somewhat more measured rebound in the back half, what implication does that have on gross margin expansion? Can we continue to expect, I don't know, 100 basis points a quarter in terms of gross margin expansion because of the data center mix? Or just any puts and takes of embedded and then what it means for gross margins in the back half? Vivek, thank you for the question. I think the embedded business declined a little bit more than expected, really due to the weaker demand in some of the markets, very specifically, communication has been weak. And some pockets of industrial and automotive, as you mentioned, it's actually quite consistent with the peers. Second half, we do think the first half is the bottom of embedded business and will start to see gradual recovery in the second half. And going back to your gross margin question, is when you look at our gross margin expansion in both Q1 and the guide Q2, the primary driver is the strong performance on the data center side. The data center will continue to ramp in second half. I think that will continue to be the major driver of gross margin expansion in second half. Of course, if embedded is doing better, we'll have a more tailwind in the second half. Our next question is from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. I also wanted to ask about your data center GPU road map. The customers that we talk to say that they're engaged, not just because of MI300, but really because of what's coming. And it seems like there's a big demand shift to rack scale systems that try to optimize performance per square foot given some of the data center and power constraints. So can you just talk about how important systems are going to be in your road map? And do you have all the pieces you need as the market shifts to rack scale systems? Yes, sure, Timothy. Thanks for the question. For sure, look, our comers are engaged in the multigenerational conversation. So we've definitely going out over the next couple of years. And as it relates to the overall system integration, it is quite important. It is something that we're working very closely with our customers and partners on. That's a significant investment in networking, working with a number of networking partners as well to make sure that the scale-out capability is there. And to your question of do we have the pieces. We do absolutely have the pieces. I think the work that we've always done with our Infinity Fabric as well as with our Pensando acquisition that's brought in a lot of networking expertise. And then we're working across the networking ecosystem with key partners like Broadcom and Cisco and Arista, who are with us at our AI data center event in December. So -- our work right now in future generations is not just specifying a GPU. It is specifying, let's call it, full system reference designs, and that's something that will be quite important going forward. And then just as a quick follow-up. I know this year it looks like it's going to be pretty back-half loaded in your server CPU business just like it was last year. I know you kind of held our hands at about this time last year sort of on what the full year could look like and how back-end loaded it could be. So I kind of wonder, could you give us some milestones in terms of how much server CP you could grow this year, how back-end loaded it could be it is like up 30% this year for your server CPU business year-over-year. Is that a reasonable bogey? I just wonder if you can kind of give us any guidance on that piece of the business? Yes. I mean, I think, Tim, I think the best way to say it is our data center segment is on a very, very strong ramp as we go through the back half of the year. Server CPUs, certainly data center GPUs for sure. So I don't know that we're going to get into specifics, but I could say in general, you should expect overall at the segment level to be very strong double digits. Our next question is from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. I wonder if you could address the profitability of MI300. I know you said a couple of quarters ago that it would eventually be above corporate average, but it would take you a few quarters to get there. Can you talk about where you are in that? Yes. Thank you, Joe. Our team has done an incredible job to ramp MI300. As you probably know, it's a very complex product, and we are still at the first year of the ramp both from yield, the testing time and the process improvement, those things are still ongoing. We do think over time, the gross margin should be accretive to corporate average. Great. And then a separate follow-up. On the tour and transition on server, I know when you had transitioned in generally, you said it could take a little while that there were significant platform shifts and things like that. Turn seems to be much more kind of ecosystem compatible. How quickly do you think you might see that product ramp within our server portfolio? Yes. Joe, I think from what we see, look, think Turin is the same platform so that does make it an easier ramp. I do think that general and Turin will coexist for some amount of time because customers are deciding when they're going to bring out their new platforms. We expect Turin to give us access to a broader set of workloads. So our SAM actually expands with Turin, both in enterprise and cloud. And from our experience, I think you'll see a faster transition than, for example, when we went from Man to General. Our next question is from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. For my first one, I wanted to address the MI300 ramp into Q2. So you said you've done $1 billion, give or take in cumulative sales, which puts it at maybe, I don't know, maybe $600 million in Q1. You're guiding total revenues up about $225 million into Q2, but you've got client up, you've got traditional data center up. You've got embedded flat. Gaming is going to be down, but I'd hazard a guess that the client and traditional data center offset it, if not more. Does the MI300 ramp into Q2? Is it more or less than the total corporate ramp that you've got built into guidance right now that you're expecting? . Stacy, thanks for the question. You always ask question. So I think in general, it is one the data center GPU ramp more than the overall company's $200-some million ramp. Okay. So that means gaming must be down like a lot, right, if clients as the data Yes, you're right. Gaming is down similar zip code like  So maybe -- yes, maybe let me give you some color about the gaming business, right? If you look at the gaming, the demand has been quite weak, that's quite very well known and also their inventory level. So based on the visibility we have, the first half both Q1, Q2, we guided down sequentially more than 30%. We actually think the second half will be lower than first half that's basically how we're looking at this year for the gaming business. And at the same time, Gaming's gross margin is lower than our company average. So overall, will help the mix on the gross margin side, that's just some color on the gaming side. But you're right, Q2 game is down a lot. Got it. That's helpful. For my second question, I wanted to look at the near-term data center profitability. So operating profit was down 19% sequentially on 2% revenue growth. Is that just the margins of the GPUs filtering in relative to the CPUs? And I know you said GPUs would eventually be above corporate average. Are they below the CPU average -- I mean they clearly are, I guess, in the near term, but are they going to stay that light? Yes. I think you're right. It's the GPU gross margin right now is below the data center gross margin level. I think there are 2 reasons -- actually, the major reason is we actually increased the investment quite significantly to, as Lisa mentioned, to expand and accelerating our road map in the AI side, that's one of the major drivers for the operating income coming down slightly. On the gross margin side, going back to your question, we said in the past and we continue to believe the case is. Data center GPU gross margin over time will be accretive to corporate average, but it will take a while to get to the server level for gross margin. Our next question is from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. On your data center GPU segment and the faster time to production shipments, given you just up your full year GPU. How much of it is faster bring up of your customers' frameworks driven by your latest software platform and maybe stronger collaboration with your customers' engineers just to get them to call faster? And how much of it is just a more aggressive build-out plan by customers versus their prior expectations given what appears to be a pretty strong urgency for them to move forward with their important AI initiatives? Harlan, thank you for the question. What it really is, is both us and our customers feeling confident in broadening the ramp? Because if you think about it, first of all, the Roam stock has done really well. And that we're doing is hand in hand with our customers to optimize their key models. And it was important to get sort of verification and validation that everything would run well and we've now passed some important milestones in that area. And then I think the other thing is, as you said, there is a huge demand for more AI compute. And so our ability to participate in that and help customers get that up and running is great. So I think overall, as we look at it, this ramp has been very, very aggressive as you think about where we were just a quarter ago. Each of these are pretty complex bring ups. And I'm very happy with how they've gone. And by the way, we're only sitting here in April. So there's still a lot of 2024 to go, and there's a great customer momentum in the process. Yes, absolutely. Just going back just kind of rewinding back to the March quarter. So similar to the PC Client business, right, which declined at the low end of the seasonal range. If I make certain assumptions around your data center GPU business, x that out of data center. It looks like your server CPU business was also down at the lower end of the seasonal range. By my math, it was down like 5%, 6% sequentially. Is that right? And that's less than half the decline of your competitor? And if so, like what drove the less than seasonal declines? I assume some of it was share gains, it sounds like enterprise was also better looks like you guys did drive a little bit more cloud instance adoption, but anything else that drove to a slightly better seasonal pattern in March for data center? -- over? Yes. Harlan, this is Jean. I think the server business has been performing really well. Year-over-year, it actually increased a very strong double digit, I think, sequentially. It is more seasonal, but we feel good about continue gaining share there. And if I'd just add, Harlan, to your question, we did see strength in enterprise in the first quarter. And I think that has -- that offset perhaps some of the normal seasonality. Our next question is from Tom O'Malley with Barclays. I just wanted to ask on the competitive environment. Obviously, on the CPU side, you had a competitor talk about launching a high core count product in the coming quarter, kind of ramping now and more so into Q3. You've seen really good pricing tailwinds as a function of the higher core capital. Can you talk about what you're seeing in that market? Do you think that there's any risk for more aggressive pricing, which would impact your ASP ramp for the rest of the year? Yes. When we look at our server CPU sort of ASPs, they're actually very stable. I think we -- again, we tend to be indexed towards the higher core counts. Overall, I would say the pricing environment is stable. This is about sort of TCO for sort of the customer environment and sort of our performance and our performance per watt, our leadership, and that usually translates into CCO advantage for our customers. Helpful. And then just a broader question to follow up here. So I think you got asked earlier about the importance of systems. But on your end, how important is the Open Ethernet consortium to you being able to move forward to systems? I know that today, you obviously have some internal assets and then you can partner with others. But -- is there a way that you could be competitive before there is an industry standard on the Ethernet side? And can you talk about when you think the timing of that kind of consortium comes to market and enables you to maybe accelerate that road map? Yes. I think it's very important to say we are very supportive of the open ecosystem. We're very supportive of the Ultra Ethernet consortium. But I don't believe that, that is a limiter to our ability to build large-scale systems. I think Ethernet is something that many in the industry feel will be the long-term answer for networking in these systems, and we have a lot of work that we're doing with internally as well as with our customers and partners to enable that. Our last question is from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler. Lisa, I had two. One is for you and one perhaps for Jean. So we recently hosted a very large custom GPU company for a call. And they talked about kind of mega data centers coming up in the near to midterm, talking about not potentially in the 100,000-plus range and maybe up to 1 million. So as we look out at these kinds of data centers from an architectural standpoint, it's not a situation where Winner takes all where if somebody gets in they kind of get all the sockets? Or will the reliance where your chip perhaps or your board can be placed right next to somebody else's board maybe on a separate line. Just help us understand how something like that would play out if there's a there's a chance for more than 1 competitor to play in such a large data center? Yes. So I'll talk maybe a little bit more at the strategic level. I think as we look at sort of how AI shapes up over the next few years, there are customers who would be looking at very large training environments and perhaps that's what you're talking about. I think our view of that is, number one, we view that as a very attractive area for AMD. It's an area where we believe we have the technology to be very competitive there. And I think the desire would be to have optionality in terms of how you build those out. So obviously, a lot has to happen between here and there. But I think your overarching question of is it winner takes all. I don't think so. That being the case, we believe that AMD is very well positioned to play in those, let's call it, of very large-scale systems. That's wonderful. And then maybe a quick one for Jean. So Jean I put everything into the model that you talked about for June, I get about more or less a $400 million rise in the June quarter over March. You mentioned that both MI300 and EPYC will grow Curious if you could help us think about the relative sizing of those 2 segments within the growth? I'm getting -- the point I'm trying to make is I'm getting roughly about a $900 million number for MI300 for June. Is that -- am I in the ballpark? Or am I way off here? We're not going to guide a specific segment below the segment revenue. I think the most important thing is that we did say data center is going to grow double digit sequentially. I will leave it over there. Subsegment, there are a lot of details. There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to hand the floor back over to management for any closing comments. Great. That concludes today's call. Thanks to all of you for joining us today. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",this is a live call and will be replayed via webcast on our website . this is an exciting time for the industry as the widespread deployment of AI is driving demand for significantly more compute across a broad range of markets .,0.0
2024-07-30,30,7,2024,139.75,-0.12765291721478134,0.0,1.0,Earnings Call Transcript Q2-2024,"Greetings, and welcome to the AMD Second Quarter 2024 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce to you Mitch Haws, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you, Mitch. You may begin. Thank you, and welcome to AMD's Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. By now, you should have had the opportunity to review a copy of our earnings press release and the accompanying slides.

Participants on today's conference call are Dr. Lisa Su, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and Jean Hu, our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer. This is a live call and will be replayed via webcast on our website.
Before we begin, I would like to note that Dr. Lisa Su will attend the Goldman Sachs Technology Communacopia and Technology Conference on Monday, September 9; and Mark Papermaster, Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer, will attend the Deutsche Bank Technology Conference on Wednesday, August 28.
Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of today and as such, involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statement in our press release for more information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. With that, I'll hand the call over to Lisa. Thank you, Mitch, and good afternoon to all those listening today. We delivered strong second quarter financial results, with revenue coming in above the midpoint of guidance and profitability increasing by a double-digit percentage driven by higher-than-expected sales of our Instinct, Ryzen, and EPYC processors. We continued accelerating our AI traction as leading cloud and enterprise providers expanded availability of Instinct MI300X solutions, and we also saw positive demand signals for general purpose compute in both our client and server processor businesses.
As a result, second quarter revenue increased 9% year-over-year to $5.8 billion as significantly higher sales of our Data Center and Client processors more than offset declines in Gaming and Embedded product sales. We also expanded gross margin by more than 3 percentage points and grew EPS 19% as Data Center product sales accounted for nearly 50% of overall sales in the quarter.
Turning to the segments. Data Center segment revenue increased 115% year-over-year to a record $2.8 billion, driven by the steep ramp of Instinct MI300 GPU shipments and a strong double-digit percentage increase in EPYC CPU sales. Cloud adoption remains strong as hyperscalers deploy 4th Gen EPYC CPUs to power more of their internal workloads and public instances. We are seeing hyperscalers select EPYC processors to [indiscernible] portion of their applications and workloads, displacing incumbent offerings across their infrastructure with AMD solutions that offer clear performance and efficiency advantages.
The number of AMD-powered cloud instances available from the largest providers has increased 34% from a year ago to more than 900. We are seeing strong pull for these instances with both enterprise and cloud-first businesses. As an example, Netflix and Uber both recently selected 4th Gen EPYC public cloud instances as one of the key solutions to power their mission-critical customer-facing workloads.
In the enterprise, sell-through increased by a strong double-digit percentage sequentially. We closed multiple large wins in the quarter with financial services, technology, health care, retail, manufacturing, and transportation customers, including Adobe, Boeing, Industrial Light & Magic, Optiver, and Siemens. Importantly, more than 1/3 of our enterprise server wins in the first half of the year were with businesses deploying EPYC in their data centers for the first time, highlighting our success attracting new customers while also continuing to expand our footprint with existing customers.
Looking ahead, our next-generation Turin family featuring our new Zen 5 core is looking very strong. Zen 5 is a grounds-up new core design optimized for leadership performance and efficiency. Turin will extend our TCO leadership by offering up to 192 cores and 384 threads, support for the latest memory and I/O technologies, and the ability to drop into existing 4th Gen EPYC platforms. We publicly previewed Turin for the first time in June, demonstrating our significant performance advantages in multiple compute-intensive workloads. We also passed a major milestone in the second quarter as we started Turin production shipments to lead cloud customers. Production is ramping now ahead of launch, and we expect broad OEM and cloud availability later this year.
Turning to our Data Center AI business. We delivered our third straight quarter of record Data Center GPU revenue with MI300 quarterly revenue exceeding $1 billion for the first time. Microsoft expanded their use of MI300X accelerators to power GPT-4 Turbo and multiple copilot services, including Microsoft 365 Chat, Word, and Teams. Microsoft also became the first large hyperscaler to announce general availability of public MI300X instances in the quarter.
The new Azure VMs leverage the industry-leading compute performance and memory capacity of MI300X in conjunction with the latest ROCm software to deliver leadership inferencing price performance when running the latest frontier models, including GPT-4. Hugging Face was one of the first customers to adopt the new Azure instances, enabling enterprise and AI customers to deploy hundreds of thousands of models on MI300X GPUs with 1 click.
Our enterprise and cloud AI customer pipeline grew in the quarter, and we are working very closely with our system and cloud partners to ramp availability of MI300 solutions to address growing customer demand. Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Super Micro all have Instinct platforms in production, and multiple hyperscale and Tier 2 cloud providers are on track to launch MI300 instances this quarter.
On the AI software front, we made significant progress enhancing support and features across our software stack, making it easier to deploy high-performance AI solutions on our platforms. We also continued to work with the open source community to enable customers to implement the latest AI algorithms. As an example, AMD support for Flash Attention 2 algorithm was upstreamed, providing out-of-the-box support for AMD hardware in the popular library that can increase training and inference performance on large transformer models.
Our work with the model community also continued accelerating, highlighted by the launches of new models and frameworks with day 1 support for AMD hardware. At Computex, I was joined by the co-CEO of Stable Diffusion to announce that MI300 is the first GPU to support their latest SD 3.0 Image Generation LLM. Last week, we were proud to note that multiple partners use ROCm and MI300X to announce support for the latest Llama 3.1 models, including their 405 billion parameter version that is the industry's first frontier-level open source AI model.
Llama 3.1 runs seamlessly on MI300 accelerators. And because of our leadership memory capacity, we're also able to run the FP16 version of the Llama 3.1 405B model in a single server, simplifying deployment and fine-tuning of the industry-leading model and providing significant TCO advantages. Earlier this month, we announced our agreement to acquire Silo AI, Europe's largest private AI lab with extensive experience developing tailored AI solutions for multiple enterprise and embedded customers, including Allianz, Ericsson, Finnair, Karber, Nokia, Philips, T-Mobile, and Unilever. The Silo team significantly expands our capability to service large enterprise customers looking to optimize their AI solutions for AMD hardware. Silo also brings deep expertise in large language model development, which will help accelerate optimization of AMD inference and training solutions.
In addition to our acquisitions of Silo AI, Mipsology, and Nod.ai, we have invested over $125 million across a dozen AI companies in the last 12 months to expand the AMD AI ecosystem, support partners, and advance leadership AMD computing platforms. Looking ahead, from a road map perspective, we are accelerating and expanding our Instinct road map to deliver an annual cadence of AI accelerators, starting with the launch of MI325X later this year. MI325X leverages the same infrastructure as MI300 and extends our generative AI performance leadership by offering twice the memory capacity and 1.3x more peak compute performance than competitive offerings.
We plan to follow MI325X with the MI350 series in 2025 based on the new CDNA 4 architecture, which is on track to deliver a 35x increase in performance compared to CDNA 3. And our MI400 series powered by the CDNA Next architecture is making great progress in development and is scheduled to launch in 2026.
Turning to our AI solutions work. Broadcom, Cisco, HP Enterprise, Intel, Google, Meta, and Microsoft, all joined us to announce Ultra Accelerator Link, an industry standard technology to connect hundreds of AI accelerators that is based on AMD's proven Infinity Fabric technology. By combining UALink with the widely supported Ultra Ethernet consortium specification, the industry is coming together to establish a standardized approach for building the next generation of high-performance data center AI solutions at scale.
In summary, customer response to our multiyear Instinct and ROCm road maps is overwhelmingly positive and we're very pleased with the momentum we are building. As a result, we now expect Data Center GPU revenue to exceed $4.5 billion in 2024, up from the $4 billion we guided in April.
Turning to our Client segment. Revenue was $1.5 billion, an increase of 49% year-over-year, driven by strong demand for our prior generation Ryzen processors and initial shipments of our next-generation Zen 5 processors. In PC applications, Zen 5 delivers an average of 16% more instructions per clock than our industry-leading previous generation of Ryzen processors. For desktops, our upcoming Ryzen 9000 series processors dropped into existing AM5 motherboards and extends our performance and energy efficiency leadership across productivity, gaming, and content creation workloads.
For notebooks, we announced our Ryzen AI 300 series that extends our industry-leading CPU and GPU performance and introduces the industry's fastest NPU with [ 50 tops ] of AI compute performance for Copilot+ PCs. The first Ryzen AI 300 Series notebooks went on sale over the weekend to strong reviews, and more than 100 Ryzen AI 300 Series premium, gaming, and commercial platforms are on track to launch from Acer, ASUS, HP, Lenovo, and others over the coming quarters. Customer excitement for our new Ryzen processors is very strong, and we are well positioned for ongoing revenue share gains based on the strength of our leadership portfolio and design win momentum.
Now turning to our Gaming segment. Revenue declined 59% year-over-year to $648 million as semi-custom SoC sales declined in line with our projections. Semi-custom demand remains soft as we are now in the fifth year of the console cycle, and we expect sales to be lower in the second half of the year compared to the first half. In gaming graphics, revenue increased year-over-year, driven by improved sales of our Radeon 6000 and 7000 Series GPUs in the channel.
Turning to our Embedded segment. Revenue decreased 41% year-over-year to $861 million. The first quarter marked the bottom for our Embedded segment revenue. Although second quarter revenue was flattish sequentially, we saw early signs of order patterns improving and expect Embedded revenue to gradually recover in the second half of the year. Longer term, we are building strong design win momentum for our expanded Embedded portfolio. Design wins in the first half of the year increased by more than 40% from the prior year to greater than $7 billion, including multiple triple-digit million-dollar wins, combining our Adaptive and x86 compute products.
We announced our Alveo V80 accelerators that deliver leadership capabilities in memory-intensive workloads and entered early access on next-generation edge AI solutions with more than 30 key partners on our upcoming 2nd Gen Versal Adaptive SoCs.
Last week, we also announced Victor Peng, President of AMD, would retire at the end of August. Victor has made significant contributions to Xilinx and AMD, including helping scale our Embedded business and leading our cross-company AI strategy. On a personal note, Victor has been a great partner to me, ensuring the success of our Xilinx acquisition and integration. On behalf of all of the AMD employees and Board, I want to thank Victor for all of his contributions to AMD's success and wish him all the best in his retirement.
In summary, we delivered strong second quarter results and are well positioned to grow revenue significantly in the second half of the year, driven by our Data Center and Client segments. Our Data Center GPU business is on a steep growth trajectory as shipments ramp across an expanding set of customers. We're also seeing strong demand for our next-generation Zen 5, EPYC, and Ryzen processors that deliver leadership performance and efficiency in both Data Center and Client workloads.
Looking ahead, the rapid advances in generative AI and development of more capable models are driving demand for more compute across all markets. Under this backdrop, we see strong growth opportunities over the coming years and are significantly increasing hardware, software, and solutions investments with a laser focus on delivering an annual cadence of leadership data center GPU hardware, integrating industry-leading AI capabilities across our entire product portfolio, enabling full stack software capabilities, amplifying our ROCm development with the scale and speed of the open source community, and providing customers with turnkey solutions that accelerate the time to market for AMD-based AI systems.
We are excited about the unprecedented opportunities in front of us and are well positioned to drive our next phase of significant growth. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jean to provide some additional color on our second quarter results. Jean? Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results and then provide our current outlook for the third quarter. We are very pleased with our overall second quarter financial results that came in above expectations. On a year-over-year basis, Data Center segment revenue more than doubled, Client segment revenue grew significantly and we expanded the gross margin by 340 basis points.
For the second quarter of 2024, revenue was $5.8 billion, up 9% year-over-year as revenue growth in the Data Center and the Client segments was partially offset by lower revenue in our Gaming and Embedded segment. Revenue increased 7% sequentially, primarily driven by growth in the Data Center and Client segments revenue. Gross margin was 53%, up 340 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by higher Data Center revenue. Operating expenses were $1.8 billion, an increase of 15% year-over-year as we continue to invest in R&D to address the significant AI growth opportunities ahead of us and enhanced go-to-market activities. Operating income was $1.3 billion, representing a 22% operating margin. Taxes, interest expense and other was $138 million. Diluted earnings per share was $0.69, an increase of 19% year-over-year.
Now turning to our reportable segments. Starting with Data Center, Data Center delivered record quarterly segment revenue of $2.8 billion, up 115%, a $1.5 billion increase year-over-year. The Data Center segment accounted for nearly 50% of total revenue, led primarily by the steep ramp of AMD Instinct GPUs and a strong double-digit percentage EPYC server revenue growth. On a sequential basis, revenue increased 21%, driven primarily by strong momentum in AMD Instinct GPUs.
Data Center segment operating income was $743 million or 26% of revenue compared to $147 million or 11% a year ago. Operating income was up more than 5x from the prior year, driven by higher revenue and operating leverage even as we significantly increased our investment in R&D. Client segment revenue was $1.5 billion, up 49% year-over-year and 9% sequentially, driven primarily by AMD Ryzen processor sales. Client segment operating income was $89 million or 6% of revenue compared to an operating loss of $69 million a year ago.
Gaming segment revenue was $648 million, down 59% year-over-year and 30% sequentially. The decrease in revenue was primarily due to semi-custom inventory digestion and the lower end market demand. Gaming segment operating income was $77 million or 12% of revenue compared to $225 million or 14% a year ago.
Embedded segment revenue was $861 million, down 41% year-over-year as customers continued to normalize their inventory levels. On a sequential basis, Embedded segment revenue was up 2%. Embedded segment operating income was $345 million or 40% of revenue compared to $757 million or 52% a year ago.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. During the quarter, we generated $593 million in cash from operations, and free cash flow was $439 million. Inventory increased sequentially by $339 million to $5 billion, primarily to support the continued ramp of Data Center GPU products. At the end of the quarter, cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were $5.3 billion. In the second quarter, we returned $352 million to shareholders, repurchasing 2.3 million shares, and we have $5.2 billion of authorization remaining. During the quarter, we retired $750 million of debt that matured this past June, utilizing existing cash.
Now turning to our third quarter 2024 outlook. We expect revenue to be approximately $6.7 billion, plus or minus $300 million. Sequentially, we expect revenue to grow approximately 15%, primarily driven by strong growth in the Data Center and Client segment. We expect Embedded segment revenue to be up and the Gaming segment to decline by double-digit percentage. Year-over-year, we expect revenue to grow approximately 16%, driven by the steep ramp of our AMD Instinct processors, and a strong server and client revenue growth to more than offset the declines in the Gaming and the Embedded segment.
In addition, we expect third quarter non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 53.5%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.9 billion, non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 13%, and the diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.64 billion shares. Also during the third quarter, we expect to close the acquisition of Silo AI for approximately $665 million in cash.
In closing, we made significant progress during the quarter toward achieving our financial goals. We delivered record MI300 revenue that exceeded $1 billion and demonstrated solid traction with our next-gen Ryzen and EPYC product. We expanded gross margin significantly and drove earnings growth while increasing investment in AI. Looking forward, the opportunity [indiscernible]  will remain focused on executing to our long-term growth strategy while driving financial discipline and operational excellence. With that, I'll turn it back to Mitch for the Q&A session. Thank you, Jane. John, we're happy to poll the audience for questions. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Congratulations on these results. Lisa, I wanted to ask you about MI300, how you see it playing out sequentially for the rest of the year. I guess there's about $2.8 billion left to hit your annual target. So I'm wondering if you see things picking up in the fourth quarter and how that's going sequentially.
And if you don't mind, I wanted to also ask about next year if you see potential for rapid growth. You're probably aware of some of the chatter out there, and I just was wondering if you're already seeing signs that you can grow significantly, given your road map for next year. Yes. Great, Ben. Thanks for the question. So first of all, on sort of MI300 and the customer evolution, we're very happy with how MI300 has progressed. When we started the year, I think the key point for us was to get our products into our customers' data centers, to have them qualify their workloads, to really ramp in production and then see what the production capabilities are, especially performance and all of those things.
And I can say now being sort of more than halfway through the year, we've seen great progress across the board. As we look into the second half of the year, I think we would expect that MI300 revenue would continue to ramp in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. And we're continuing to expand both current deployments with our existing customers as well as we have a large pipeline of customers that we're working through that are getting familiar with our architecture and software and all that stuff.
So I would say overall, very pleased with the progress, and really continuing right on track to what we expected from the capabilities of the product. As we go into next year, I mean, one of the important things that we announced at Computex was increasing and expanding our road map. I think we feel really good about our road map. We're on track to launch MI325 later this year, and then next year, our MI350 Series, which will be very competitive with Blackwell solutions. And then we're well on our way to our CDNA Next as well.
So I think, overall, we remain quite bullish on the overall AI market. I think the market continues to need more compute. And we also feel very good that our hardware and software solutions are getting good traction, and we're continuing to expand that pipeline. And the next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Congrats on the quarter as well. I guess sticking on the Data Center side, as we look forward and you think about the full year, I'm curious of how you're currently thinking about the EPYC server CPU growth expectations as we go forward. And any kind of updated thoughts on your ability to kind of continue to gain share in the server market? Just kind of just update us on how you see the server market playing out over the next couple of quarters. Yes, sure, Aaron. Thanks for the question. So we're very pleased with the progress that we've made with EPYC. I think a couple of things. First of all, in terms of competitive positioning and just the traction in the market, our 4th Gen EPYC between Gen 1 Bergamo is really doing very well. We've seen broad adoption across cloud. And then we've been very focused on enterprise as well as third-party cloud instances. And as I said in the prepared remarks, we're starting to see very nice traction in enterprise with both new customers as well as existing customers, and then for third-party cloud adoption, also a good pickup there as well. So I think overall, I think our  EPYC portfolio has done well.
Going into the second half of the year, I think we also feel good about it. There are a couple of positives there. We see -- first of all, the market looks like it's improving, so we have seen some return to spending in both enterprise and cloud. And so I think those are positive market trends. And then in addition to that, we are in the process of launching Turin. So we started production here in the second quarter and we're on track to launch broadly in the second half of the year. We'll see some revenue of Turin in the second half of the year contributing as well. So overall, I think the server market and our ability to continue to grow share in the server market is one of the things that we see in the second half of the year. And the next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Lisa, I wanted to ask about the Data Center GPU road map. As you said, 325 launching later this year, so I guess I had 2 questions. Does the greater than $4.5 billion, does that include any revenue from 325? And can you talk a little bit more about 350? Obviously, we're seeing a big rack scale or shift toward rack-scale systems for the competition's product. And I'm wondering if that's what 350 is going to look like. Is it going to have liquid cooling and is it going to have a rack scale aspect to it? Yes, absolutely. So let me start with your original question. I mean, I think looking at 325X, we are on track to launch later this year. From a revenue standpoint, there will be a small contribution in the fourth quarter but it really is still mostly the MI300 capabilities. And 325 will start in the fourth quarter and then ramp more in the first half of next year.
And then as we look at the 350 Series, what we're seeing and the reason we call it a series is because there will be multiple SKUs in that series that we'll go through the range of, let's call it, air-cooled to liquid-cooled. In spending time with our customers. I think there are people who certainly want more rack level solutions, and we're certainly doing much more in terms of system-level integration for our products. You'll see us invest more in system-level integration.
But we also have many customers who want to use their current infrastructure. I think the beauty of the MI350 series is it actually fits into the same infrastructure as the MI300 series. And so it would lend itself to, let's call it, a pretty fast ramp if you've already invested in 300 or 325. So we see the range of options, and that's part of the expansion of the road map that we're planning. And the next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Congrats on the strong results. Well, Data Center is obviously very important. I just want to pivot to the Client side. Lisa, can you talk about the AI PC side of things? How you believe AMD is positioned? Are you seeing any competitive intensity changing with the emergence of ARM-based systems? Just wanted to see how you're expecting that to roll out and what it means to second half seasonality. Yes. Sure, Ross. So first, we're very pleased with our Client business results. I think we have a very strong road map, so I'm very pleased with the road map. The Zen 5-based products, we're launching both notebook and desktop in this -- in the middle of this year. What we've seen is actually very positive feedback on the product. So we just actually launched the [ first strict spaced ] notebooks over the weekend. They went on sale. You may have seen some of the reviews. The reviews are very positive.
Our view of this is the AI PC is an important add to the overall PC category. As we go into the second half of the year, I think we have better seasonality in general, and we think we can do, let's call it, above-typical seasonality, given the strength of our product launches and when we're launching. And then into 2025, you're going to see AI PCs across sort of a larger set of price points, which will also open up more opportunities.
So overall, I would say the PC market is a good revenue growth opportunity for us. The business is performing well. The products are strong. And we're working very closely with both the ecosystem partners as well as our OEM partners to have strong launches here into the second half of the year. And is the ARM side changing anything or not really? Look, I think at this point, the PC market is a big market and we are underrepresented in the market. I would say that we take all of our competition very seriously. That being the case, I think our products are very well positioned. And the next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Lisa, I wanted to maybe draw a parallel between the Instinct portfolio that your company is rolling out now and what you guys did 5 or 6 years ago with EPYC. And I remember when the Naples product launched, there was a lot of, I would say, reaction positively and negatively and sort of sentiment around where your road map might go to relatively small perturbations in what the volumes were.
Super early, but if I remember back to that, what was the most important was that was the toehold into the market for long-term engagement, both on the software side and the hardware side with your customers 2, 3, 4 generations forward. So is that an accurate parallel to where you guys are with MI300? And maybe you could talk about the level of engagement, the intensity of engagement, the breadth of it across the customer base with 350 and 400. Yes, absolutely, Matt. So look, as I said earlier, we're very pleased with the progress that we're making on the Instinct road map. This is absolutely a long-term play so absolutely, you're correct. It has a lot of parallels to the EPYC journey, where you really have to -- you gain more opportunities, broader workloads, larger deployments as you go from generation to generation. So we are playing the long game here.
Our conversations with our customers, so I would start with first, in the near term, we had some very key milestones that we wanted to pass this year. And as I said, they related to getting hardware in volume in multiple hyperscalers as well as large Tier 2 customers. We've done that. We've now seen our software in a lot of different environments, and it's matured substantially. ROCm is in very, from a standpoint of features, functions, out-of-box performance, getting to performance with customers, we've gained a lot of confidence and learned a lot in that whole process.
The networking aspects of building out the rack scale and the system-level items are areas that we're continuing to invest in. And then the point of having long-term conversations across multiple generations is also really important. So I think all of those things have progressed well. We view this as very good progress for MI300, but we have a lot more to do. And I think the various road maps will help us open up those opportunities over the next couple of years. And the next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Lisa, there seems to be this ongoing industry debate about AI monetization and whether your customers are getting the right ROI on their CapEx. And today, they have these 3 options, right? They can buy GPUs from your largest competitor with all the software bells and whistles and incumbency, or they can do custom chips or they can buy from AMD.
So how do you think this plays out next year? Do you think your customers, given all this concern around monetization, does it make them consolidate their CapEx around just the other 2 suppliers? How is your visibility going into next year, given this industry debate? And how will AMD continue to kind of carve a position between these 2 other competitive choices that are out there? Yes, sure, Vivek. Well, I mean, I think you talk to a lot of the same people that we talk to. I think the overall view on AI investment is we have to invest. I mean, the industry has to invest. The potential of AI is so large to impact the way enterprises operate and all that stuff. So I think the investment cycle will continue to be strong. And then relative to the various choices for the size of the market, I firmly believe that there will be multiple solutions, whether you're talking about GPUs or you're talking about custom chips or ASICs, there will be multiple solutions.
In our case, I think we've demonstrated a really strong road map and the ability to partner well with our customers. And from the standpoint of that deep engagement, hardware, software co-optimization is so important in that. And for large language models, GPUs are still the architecture of choice. So I think the opportunity is very large. And I think our piece  of that is really strong technology with strong partnerships with the key AI market makers. And the next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. I also wanted to ask about MI300. I wonder if you could talk about training versus inference. Do you have a sense -- I know that a lot of the initial focus was inference, but do you have traction on the training side? And any sense of what that split may look like over time? Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Joe. So as we said on MI300, there are lots of great characteristics about it. One of it -- one of them is our memory bandwidth and memory capacity is leading the industry. From that standpoint, the early deployments have largely been inference in most cases, and we've seen fantastic performance from an inference standpoint.
We also have customers that are doing training. We've also seen that from a training standpoint, we've optimized quite a bit our ROCm software stack to make it easier for people to train on AMD. And I do expect that we'll continue to ramp training over time. As we go forward, I think you'll see -- the belief is that inference will be larger than training from a market standpoint. But from an AMD standpoint, I would expect both inference and training to be growth opportunities for us. And the next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. I had a question on the MI300 as well. Curiously, if you're currently shipping to demand or if the updated annual forecast of $4.5 billion is in some shape or form supply constrained, think last quarter, you gave some comments on HBM and CoAs. Curious if you could provide an update there.
And then my part B to my question is on profitability for MI300. I think in the past, you've talked about the business being accretive and improving further over time as you sort of work through the kinks, if you will. Has that view evolved or changed at all, given sort of the competitive intensity and your need to invest, whether it be through organic R&D or some of the acquisitions you've made? Or are you still confident that profit margins in the business continue to expand? Yes. Sure, Toshiya. Thanks for the question. So on the supply side, let me make a couple of comments and then maybe I'll let Jean comment on sort of the trajectory for the business. So on the supply side, we made great progress in the second quarter. We ramped up supply significantly exceeding $1 billion in the quarter. I think the team has executed really well. We continue to see line of sight to continue increasing supply as we go through the second half of the year.
But I will say that the overall supply chain is tight and will remain tight through 2025. So under that backdrop, we have great partnerships across the supply chain. We've been building additional capacity and capability there. And so we expect to continue to ramp as we go through the year. And we'll continue to work both supply as well as demand opportunities, and really that's accelerating our customer adoption overall, and we'll see how things play out as we go into the second half of this year. Yes. On your second question about the profitability, first, our team has done a tremendous job to ramp the product MI300. It's a very complex product so we ramped it successfully. At the same time, the team also started to implement operational optimization to continue to improve gross margin. So we continue to see the gross margin improvement. Over time, in the longer term, we do believe gross margin will be accretive to corporate average.
From a profitability perspective, AMD always invests in platforms. If you look at our Data Center platform, especially both the server and the Data Center GPU side, we are ramping the revenue. The business model can leverage very significantly even from GPU side. Because the revenue ramp has been quite significant, the operating margin continued to expand. We definitely want to continue to invest as the opportunity is huge. At the same time, it is a profitable business already. And the next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. I wanted to dig into the Q3 guidance a little bit, if I could. So with Gaming down double digits, it probably means you've got close to $1 billion of growth revenue across Data Center, Client, and Embedded. I was wondering if you could give us some color on how that $1 billion-ish splits out across those 3 businesses. Like if I had 70% of it going to Data Center and 20% going to Client and 10% going to Embedded, like would that be like way off? Or how should we think about that apportioning out across the segment? Yes. Maybe Stacy, let me give you the following color. So the Gaming business is down double digit as you state. Think of it as the Data Center is the largest piece of it, Client next. And then on the Embedded side, think of it as single-digit sequential growth. Got it. So I mean within that Data Center piece then, how does that split out? I mean, is the bulk of it [indiscernible] Instinct? Or is it sort of equally weighted between Instinct and EPYC? Or like again, how does it -- again, if you got, I don't know, $400 million to $600 million of sequential Data Center growth or something like that, how does it split up? Yes. So again, without being that granular, we will see both -- certainly, the Instinct GPUs will grow and we'll see also very nice growth on the server side. And the next question comes from the line of Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler. Lisa, from my rudimentary understanding, the large difference between your Instinct products and the adoption versus your nearest competitor is kind of rack level performance and that rack level is the structure that you may be lacking. You talked a little bit about UALink. I was wondering if you could expand on that and give us some more color on when that might -- when that gap might be closed. Or is this a major step for the industry to close that gap? Just any color would be appreciated. Yes. So Harsh, overall, maybe if I take a step back and just talk about how the systems are evolving, there's no question that the systems are getting more complex, especially as you go into large training clusters, and our customers need help to put those together. And that includes the sort of Infinity Fabric-type solutions that are the basis for the UALink things as well as just general rack level system integration.
I think what you should expect, Harsh is, first of all, we're very pleased with all of the partners that have come together for UALink. We think that's an important capability. But we have all of the pieces of this already within sort of the AMD umbrella with our Infinity Fabric, with the work with our networking capability through the acquisition of Pensando. And then you'll see us invest more in this area. So this is part of how we help customers get to market faster is by investing in all of the components, so the CPUs, the GPUs, the networking capability as well as system-level solutions. And the next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Jefferies. I just want to ask another question on MI300. Just curious if you can kind of characterize the makeup of the customers in the first half. I know you had, end of last year, a government customer. Is there still a government contingency? And kind of the second part of it is really you've invested in all these software assets. Kind of curious the challenge of ramping the next wave of customers. I know there's been a lot of talk on some hardware challenges, memory issues and such, but then you're investing in software. I'm sure that's a big challenge, too. Just kind of curious what the biggest hurdle is for you to kind of get that next wave of customers ramp. Yes. So Blayne, a lot of pieces to that question so let me try to address them. First, on your question about, I think you're basically asking about the supercomputing piece. That was mainly Q4 and a bit in Q1. So if you think about our Q2 revenue, think about it as almost all AI. So it's MI300X, it's for large AI, hyperscalers as well as OEM customers going to enterprise and Tier 2 data centers. So that's the makeup of the customer set.
And then in terms of the various pieces of what we're doing, I think first on your question about memory, I think there's a lot of noise in the system. I wouldn't really pay attention to all that noise in the system. I mean, this has been an incredible ramp. And I'm actually really proud of what the team has done in terms of just definitely fastest product ramp that we've ever done to $1 billion here in the -- over $1 billion in the second quarter and then ramping each quarter in Q3 and Q4.
In terms of memory, we have multiple suppliers that we've qualified on HBM3. And it's a tricky -- memory is a tricky business but I think we've done it very well and that's there. And then we're also qualifying HBM3E for future products with multiple memory suppliers as well. So to your overarching question of what are the things that we're doing, the exciting part of this is that the ROCm capability has really gotten substantially better because so many customers have been using it.
And with that, what we look at is out-of-box performance, how long does it take a customer to get up and running on MI300? And we've seen, depending on the software that companies are using, particularly if you're based on some of the higher-level frameworks like PyTorch, et cetera, we can be out-of-the-box running very well in a very short amount of time, like, let's call it, very small number of weeks. And that's great because that's expanding the overall portfolio.
We are going to continue to invest in software, and that was one of the reasons that we did the Silo AI acquisition. It's a great acquisition for us. 300 scientists and engineers. These are engineers that have experience with AMD hardware and are very, very good at helping customers get up and running on AMD hardware. And that's -- so we view this as the opportunity to expand the customer base with talent like Silo AI, like Nod.ai which brought a lot of compiler talent. And then we continue to hire quite a bit organically. So I think Jean said earlier that we see leverage in the model, but we're going to continue to invest because this opportunity is huge, and we have all of the pieces. This is just about building out scale. And the next question comes from the line of Tom O'Malley with Barclays. I'll give you a breather from the MI300 for a second, but just to focus on Client in the second half. No problem. Focused on Client in the second half, you kind of said above-seasonal for September, December. You're obviously launching a new notebook, desktop product, but you're also talking about AI PC. Could you just break down where you're seeing those above-seasonal trends? Is it the ASP uplift you're getting from the new products? Is it a unit assumption that's coming with AI PC? Just any kind of breakdown between those 2 and why you're seeing it a little bit better. Sure, Tom. So I think you actually said it well. We are launching Zen 5 desktops and notebooks with volume ramping in the third quarter. And that's the primary reason that we see above-seasonal. The AI PC element is certainly 1 element of that, but there is just the overall refresh. Usually, desktop launches going into a third quarter are good for us, and we feel that the products are very well positioned. So those are the primary reasons. And our final question comes from the line of Chris Danely with Citi. Just a question on gross margin. So if we look at your guidance, it seems like the incremental gross margin is dropping a little bit for Q3. Why is that happening? And then just a follow-up on another part of the gross margin angle. Have you changed your gross margin expectations for the MI300? Has the accretion point moved out a little bit? Yes, Chris, thanks for the question. I think, first, we have made a lot of progress, as you mentioned, this year to expand our gross margin from 2023 at a 50 percentage point to, we actually guided 53.5% for Q3. The primary driver is really the faster Data Center business growth. If you look at the Data Center business as a percentage of revenue from 37% in Q4 last year to now close to 50%. That faster expansion really helped us with the gross margin.
When you look at the second half, we'll continue to see Data Center to be the major driver of our top line revenue growth, will help with the margin expansion. But there are some other puts and takes. I think Lisa mentioned the PC business actually is going to do better in second half, especially typically, seasonally, it tends to be more consumer-focused. So that really is a little bit different dynamics there.
Secondly, I would say Embedded business, we are going to see Embedded business to be up sequentially each quarter. But the recovery, as we mentioned earlier, is more gradual. So when you look at the balance of the picture, that's why we see the gross margin -- the pace of the gross margin changed a little bit, but we do see continued gross margin expansion. As far as MI300, we are quite confident over the long term, it will be accretive to our corporate average. We feel pretty good about the overall Data Center business to continue to be absolutely the driver of gross margin expansion. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mitch for any closing comments. Great. That concludes today's call. Thanks to all of you for joining us today.
