Joining the call today are our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dan Arnold; and Chief Financial Officer, Matt Audette. Dan and Matt will offer introductory remarks and then the call would be opened for questions. The company would appreciate if each analyst would limit their questions to one question and one follow-up.
The company has posted its earnings press release and supplementary information on the Events section of investor.lpl.com. Today's call may include forward-looking statements, including statements about LPL Financial's future revenue, expenses, and other financial and operating results, business strategies and plans, as well as other opportunities and potential risks that management foresees. Such forward-looking statements reflect management's current estimates or beliefs and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially.
The company refers listeners to the Safe Harbor disclosures contained in the earnings press release and the company's latest SEC filings to appreciate those factors that may cause actual financial or operating results or the timing of matters to differ from those contemplated in such forward-looking statements. During the call, the company will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures governed by SEC Regulation G. For any reconciliation of such non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP figures, please refer to the company's earnings release, which can be found at the company's website, investor.lpl.com.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Arnold. Thank you, Sanya, and thank you to everyone for joining our call. We began 2018 with another quarter of business and financial growth. We focused on our strategic priorities of growing our core business, onboarding and assimilating NPH advisors, and executing with excellence. Altogether, we feel good about the progress we made and the results we generated in the first quarter.
Let's now turn to our business results, starting with our advisors. Their differentiated solution in the marketplace was recently recognized in a third-party study by Cogent. It found that retail clients ranked the LPL advisors first in net customer loyalty among 30 leading distributors. This is a testament to the appeal of our advisors business model and the quality of the service they provide.
Moving to Brokerage and Advisory Assets, we finished the quarter with $648 billion or 22% from a year ago, and up 5% from the fourth quarter. This was driven by a combination of organic growth and the onboarding of NPH assets. Looking in more detail at organic growth, total net new assets were $2.9 billion. This was primarily driven by advisory net new assets of $6.9 billion, or a 10% annualized growth rate. As a result, advisory assets are now 47% of our total assets prior to NPH. On our corporate advisory platform, annualized growth was 11%, supported by the strategic pricing changes that went into effect in January.
Additionally, centrally managed inflows were nearly $2 billion this quarter, as advisors continued to leverage our outsourced portfolio management services to drive scale into their business. Our recruiting efforts contributed to our net new assets, as we recruited approximately $4 billion of assets in the first quarter, while production retention was 96%. We believe these first quarter results are consistent with our strategy to drive greater utilization of our advisory, corporate, and centrally managed platforms.
Turning to NPH, we had $36 billion in net new assets this quarter, primarily driven by the second wave of advisors who onboarded in February. Looking at both waves together, we have added approximately $70 billion of assets and 1,900 advisors, and we continue to expect total net new assets from NPH to be up to $75 billion. We're excited about the quality of the advisors we attracted and the opportunities to support them as they leverage our platforms and services. Additionally, during this acquisition, we created new capabilities, strengthened our M&A acumen, and identified areas of opportunity that will enhance our future advisor onboarding, either in recruiting or M&A.
Moving to our financial results, we continued to drive growth and operating leverage in the first quarter. Gross profit increased 23% year-over-year, driven by double-digit growth in advisory fees, trailing commissions, sponsor revenues, and cash sweep. As for sales commissions prior to NPH, they were up sequentially for the second straight quarter. We also remain disciplined on expenses, this combination led to EPS of $1.01, which is nearly twice our level from a year ago. Matt will review our financial performance in greater depth.
Now that we have reviewed our business and financial results, I'd like to discuss our strategic priorities starting with core business growth. We remain focused on driving organic growth, as well as exploring M&A opportunities that align with us strategically, financially, and operationally. With respect to organic growth, we are focused on helping advisors differentiate and win in the marketplace by providing them with enhanced capabilities and competitive pricing. Looking more specifically at capabilities, we continued to enhance solutions and tools to help our advisors effectively serve their clients and contribute to their growth.
As a reminder, in 2016, for advisors on our corporate platform, we rolled out a mutual fund no-transaction-fee program or NTF network. This lowered the cost of and simplified access to active management for retail clients and help drive greater mutual fund flows. This summer, we plan to roll out a similar NTF network on our hybrid platform. This new offering is a more competitive solution for advisors and their clients. We believe it will be one of the most compelling mutual fund NTF lineups available in the marketplace.
In the near term, we expect the financial impact to be roughly neutral for us, as we anticipate lower transaction revenue will be offset by increased sponsor revenue, but over time, we expect this capability will enhance the appeal of our advisory solutions and of active management, both of which can increase our gross profit.
Let's next turn to pricing. Over the last few years, we have lowered the costs for advisors to outsource their portfolio and risk management through our centrally managed and corporate advisory platforms. These changes have contributed to greater utilization and growth of assets on these platforms. Building on these outcomes, in January 2019, we will extend this strategy. We will lower the price of our corporate platforms for advisors with $25 million to $50 million in advisory assets. We believe this will attract more assets to the corporate platform, as additional advisors can now more cost effectively outsource risk management to us.
In the first quarter, we also continued to innovate with our recruiting strategy, including a temporary increase in transition assistance. As context, we have a structural advantage over our competitors, as the combination of our scale and self-clearing capabilities make assets on our platform more valuable. We also have a strong balance sheet that positions us to invest in organic growth. As a result, we are testing the impact of a temporary increase in recruiting transition assistance for advisor practices that would use more of our services. With this approach, we are staying financially disciplined while generating a compelling return on investment. While we are early in our efforts, we believe this will contribute to future organic growth.
Let's now turn to our second strategic priority, executing with excellence. We are focused on increasing the quality of our technology and service, and making it easier for advisors and their clients to do business with us. We are modernizing our service model to take friction out of client interactions, and provide timely and relevant information when and where our clients need it. Aligned with this focus, we launched our 100 wins in 100 days initiative, with the goals of simplifying policies and procedures, enhancing our ClientWorks technology platform, and improving service interactions. For example, in April, we introduced a more efficient trading experience that reduces the number of steps necessary to execute a trade by over 80%. Over time, we expect wins like these will have a compounding effect that can enhance our advisor's experience, simplify our operating environment, and support long-term growth. We plan to invest over $100 million in technology this year to support these and other initiatives.
Before closing, I thought it would be helpful to update you on a few regulatory topics. First, you may have read about our blue sky settlement framework. As context, this matter is a historical control issue related to certain individual equity and fixed income transactions, which represent a relatively small part of our business. The vast majority of our business, including most exchange listed securities, mutual funds, annuities and insurance, is not in that (00:09:49) issue with this matter. We are now focused on offering remediation to any investors who may have been affected. We take our compliance obligations seriously, and we have invested in our compliance and risk management capabilities, which are helping us address this matter. Matt will cover how to think about this financially.
Next, let's turn to the fiduciary standard for brokerage accounts. It appears the DOL fiduciary rule will likely be vacated, while the SEC has introduced a proposal for a best interest standard for brokerage accounts. As a reminder, we believe in a higher standard of care and preserving choice. In preparation for the DOL rule, we implemented many product disclosure and operational changes across our brokerage platform, both for retirement and taxable accounts. As a result, we believe our advisors are well-positioned to support their clients and differentiate their practices, regardless of the outcome of the SEC rule. We will actively work with the SEC to provide our prospective and insight, as they continue their progress on a best interest standard.
Finally, FINRA issued a proposal to reduce broker-dealer oversight responsibility on outside advisory activity. We are supportive of the concept of this rule, which preserves choice for advisors and how they operate their practices and serve their clients. Strategically, we are also well-positioned to support our advisors, as offering both a corporate and a hybrid platform enables choice. From a financial perspective, our hybrid RIAs have only $10 billion of assets at outside custodians, and we charge about $2 million annually to oversee those costs.
As for timing, because of the regulatory rulemaking and public comment process, we may not have a final rule for an extended period of time. Irrespective of the timeline, we're committed to working with FINRA on this matter and continuing to provide choice to our advisors.
In summary, we are pleased to start the year with another quarter of business and earnings growth. We plan to remain focused on our strategic priorities of growing our core business and executing with excellence. We believe our strategy positions us well to serve and support our advisors drive profitable growth and create long-term shareholder value.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt. Thank you, Dan. And I'm glad to speak with everyone on today's call. We had a good start to the year in Q1, nearly doubling earnings per share from a year ago. We continued to grow assets and gross profit, while remaining disciplined on expenses to drive operating leverage. As a result, our Q1 EPS prior to intangibles was $1.11. Additionally, if we look at our results prior to NPH, EPS prior to intangibles was $1.36. We are pleased to start the year with a strong business and financial outcomes.
Let's now go to our business results in greater depth, starting with Brokerage and Advisory Assets. We finished the quarter at $648 billion, up $32 billion or 5% sequentially, driven by organic growth and NPH onboarding, partially offset by lower equity markets. Total net new assets were $38.9 billion for the quarter, including $2.9 billion of organic net new assets, and $36 billion from NPH.
Now let's look at our organic growth in more detail. Net new advisory assets were $6.9 billion or a 10% annualized growth rate. This included $2.2 billion in conversions from brokerage to advisory, and advisory assets prior to NPH increased to 47% of total assets. Within advisory, two-thirds of our inflows were on the corporate platform, totaling $4.3 billion or an 11% annualized rate. As for centrally managed platforms, inflows increased to $1.8 billion or a 22% annualized rate. These results highlight three positive trends that benefit our gross profit return on assets over time, more assets converting from brokerage to advisory, and within advisory, more assets moving on to our corporate and centrally managed platforms. We are pleased with the progress we made this quarter, as our investments and enhanced capabilities and lower price help drive growth.
Turning back to our results, Q1 net new assets from NPH included $29.9 billion of brokerage, and $6.2 billion of advisory assets. In total, we have onboarded $70.2 billion through the end of Q1, and we continue to expect up to $75 billion of total assets to transfer, as we have some remaining direct brokerage business from Wave 2 that we expect to transfer in the second quarter. We are also seeing NPH assets begin to convert from brokerage to advisory, with $0.3 billion in the first quarter, bringing our total conversions to $2.5 billion for Q1.
Let's next turn to Q1 gross profit. It was $464 million, up $61 million or 15% sequentially. Prior to NPH, it was $440 million, up $41 million or 10% from Q4, with increases across all of our major gross profit categories.
Moving to commission and advisory fees, net of payout. They were $136 million in Q1, up $31 million or 30% sequentially. Prior to NPH, they were up $22 million or 22% sequentially, primarily driven by higher advisory fees and trailing commissions, which rose along with average asset levels. Sales commissions prior to MPH also increased slightly, despite two fewer trading days than in Q4. And as a reminder, our payout rate increases seasonally from Q1 to Q2. Last year, it increased by about 80 basis points, which amounted to a $7 million increase in production expense.
Turning to the corporate platform price reductions which Dan covered, the lower pricing we announced last year went into effect this January, and increased our commission and advisory expense by about $3 million in the first quarter. We are seeing positive results, as corporate advisory net new assets are growing at nearly double the rate they were in Q4 2016. As a quick note, that pricing change is reflected as an increase in production bonus payout, which is a component of our total payout rate. Year-over-year, the bonus payout rate increased by about 30 basis points, primarily driven by this pricing change. The new pricing change that Dan highlighted for 2019 will go into effect next January, and we estimate it will initially reduce gross profit by about $2 million per quarter.
Overall, we believe this lower pricing will make our corporate platform even more compelling, grow at a faster rate, and benefit our gross profit return on assets. As for asset-based fees, which include sponsor and cash sweep revenues, sponsor revenues were $115 million, up $10 million from Q4, primarily driven by higher asset levels, as well as favorable repricing within our sponsor contracts.
Moving to cash sweep revenues. They were $104 million, up $16 million or 18% sequentially, as higher short-term interest rates increased our yields. Client cash as a percent of assets finished Q1 at 4.6%, down from 4.8% in Q4. This Q1 level was primarily driven by investors remaining highly engaged in the market, as well as NPH assets that onboarded, having lower cash as a percent of assets than our overall average.
Looking at Q1 cash sweep yields, our ICA yield was 152 basis points, up 20 basis points from Q4, primarily driven by benefits from the December and March rate hikes. As we think about our Q2 ICA yield, we will have the remaining benefit of the March rate hike, partially offset by an increase in client deposit rates that went into effect in April, equivalent to a deposit beta of about 25% or 6 basis points on average. Assuming no further benefits from interest rate increases or changes to our deposit rates, we anticipate our Q2 ICA yield will be in the mid-160-basis-point range.
Moving on to Q1 transaction and fee revenues, they were $117 million, up $14 million or 13% sequentially, primarily driven by two factors. First, Q1 is seasonally better for both transaction volumes and IRA fees. Second, volatility was elevated, especially in January and February, and that led to high transaction levels. Looking at Q1 in more detail, transaction revenues increased $8 million sequentially, and IRA fees were up $2 million.
Looking ahead to Q2, we would expect a seasonal decrease in IRA fees. As for volatility, we already saw return to normalized levels in March and April. So if we see those levels continue in Q2, we would also expect transaction revenue to return to lower levels.
Now turning to expenses, starting with core G&A. In Q1, core G&A expense was $201 million, including $6 million of NPH onboarding costs and $13 million of NPH run rate costs. Prior to NPH, core G&A was $182 million, down slightly from Q4. As we look ahead to core G&A prior to NPH for the rest of the year, we continue to expect to increase our investments over Q1 levels as planned. As for ongoing core G&A from NPH, we expect our run rate to be about $15 million per quarter. Additionally, we will have some remaining NPH onboarding costs through the rest of the year. Altogether, we continue to expect $800 million to $830 million of core G&A for 2018.
Moving on to Q1 promotional expenses. They were $67 million, up $7 million or 12% sequentially. Prior to NPH costs, promotional was $34 million in Q1, down $3 million or 9% sequentially. As for NPH promotional costs, they were $33 million, primarily driven by onboarding costs and cash assistance, as well as $4 million of forgivable loan amortization.
Looking ahead to Q2, prior to NPH, our promotional expense will be driven primarily by transition assistance, which varies quarter-to-quarter depending on our level of recruiting success. Additionally, we expect our conference expenses to increase by about $6 million, as we held one of our major advisor conferences in April. As for NPH promotional expenses, we expect the quarterly run rate going forward to be approximately $7 million, primarily driven by forgivable loan amortization.
Turning now to regulatory expenses. They totaled $6 million for Q1, up $1 million sequentially, primarily driven by the increase in captive insurance premiums that we mentioned last quarter. Additionally, as Dan said, we have agreed to general terms with state regulators on a legacy matter. We expect the majority of these costs will be covered by our captive insurance company over the next few years, along with some costs we expect to cover within our existing spending plans, as we work to remediate any client transactions that may be affected. And as a reminder, the nature of regulatory expenses makes them inherently difficult to predict. Our actual expense could move up or down in any given quarter or year based on the size and timing of the matters and available captive coverage.
Moving to share-based compensation, it was $6 million in Q1, up $1 million from the prior quarter, driven by the timing of annual grants. Looking ahead, we anticipate our Q2 level will be similar to Q1.
Turning to amortization of intangibles, it was $13 million in Q1, up $3 million sequentially, as we recorded the intangibles from the first half of the NPH purchase price in December. We recorded the second half in Q1, and we continued to expect run rate expense of about $16 million per quarter, starting in Q2. As for interest expense, it was $30 million, up $1 million sequentially, driven by increased short-term interest rates. Looking ahead, we expect Q2 interest expense to increase $2 million to $3 million sequentially, as LIBOR rates rose throughout Q1, and our floating rate debt (00:22:09) repriced in late March.
Turning to taxes. Our Q1 effective rate was 22%. This is below our expected range of 27% to 29% because of two discrete items, stock option exercises and a state tax matter in which we prevailed. Going forward, a range of 27% to 29% is still the best way to think about our tax rate for the rest of the year.
Turning now to our run rate NPH EBITDA, which is prior to onboarding costs and cash financial assistance. Our prior estimate of $85 million of annual run rate EBITDA was based on the macro environment at the time of the transaction last August. Since then, we've had two rate hikes, and the S&P has increased, but cash as a percent of assets has declined. Taking these factors together, we now estimate annual run rate EBITDA accretion of $90 million. As for timing, we continued to expect to reach the run rate by the end of the year, and in Q1, we generated approximately $7 million of run rate EBITDA or roughly $26 million on an annualized basis.
Moving on to capital management. Our balance sheet remained strong in Q1, as our net leverage declined to 2.5 times. Cash available for corporate use was $474 million, up $34 million from Q4. We also repurchased $61 million of shares in Q1, approximately twice the amount from last quarter. And we paid $23 million in regular quarterly dividends. We feel good about our capital deployment in Q1, and our priorities remain: investing for organic growth, taking advantage of M&A opportunities if they arise, and returning capital to shareholders.
In closing, we are pleased to have delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results in Q1. We remain focused on growing assets and gross profit, staying disciplined on expenses to create operating leverage, and deploying capital to drive growth and shareholder returns.
With that, operator, please open the call for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from Steven Chubak of Nomura Instinet. Your line is now open. Hi. Good afternoon. Hey, good afternoon. So, Matt, wanted to start off with a question on deposit beta, some of your competitors have cited some early signs of upward pressure on pricing just given higher yields on cash alternatives. You've retained your guidance of 25% to 50% medium term. I'm just wondering if that 50% terminal beta, is that still a reasonable expectation at your end? And then just separately, it looks like the DCA and money market yields had exceeded their initial caps, I know you highlighted changes to the ICA fee rates recently. How should we think about the new caps on those two items as well? Sure. So I think on the 25% to 50% beta, I think that's still our view. I mean, I think when you look at the six hikes we've had in this cycle, I think it's probably played out as one would expect, right. The first few hikes folks really – most folks didn't move as you were coming off the bottom, and then over the last three hikes, I think you've seen people start to move up. So this most recent hike for us, at 25%, I think that made sense to us, and I don't think we have any different view on the 25% to 50%, and we really haven't seen any change in behavior. So I think we feel confident about that, but also, I'd just emphasize that's why it's a range, right, it's a range at 25% to 50%.
On the money market, I think the rates on money markets, really the caps haven't changed, that's more about the mix of balances in those different accounts, right, different accounts have different caps, so it ends up being a weighted average number, that's the only thing that would impact it there. And then DCA, so DCA, as a reminder, I'm sure you know, is a fee per account, it's not basis points on the balances themselves. So that rate can move around, the fee per account cap hasn't changed. We effectively hit it with this last rate hike. So going forward, the economics, they are going to be more about the number of accounts based on that fee. So I think that covers the three questions, right. You caught me there with a bunch of nested questions within, but I'm going to ask my follow-up here, and I want to leave it to just one. But you spoke of your capital management priorities, including M&A, I'm just wondering, given your experience with NPH, the higher accretion target's certainly encouraging. How does that inform your appetite, and then just related to that, how should we think about, given some of the favorable tailwinds both markets and rates, inform potential willingness of acquisition targets to sell at the 6 to 8 times EBITDA you've cited in the past? Yeah. So I'll go first, and, Dan, obviously jump in. I mean, I think when we think about the M&A, our thoughts on the M&A environment haven't changed. I would tell you, as a high level point, the NPH acquisition, I think, just validated our view that when you look at our space, it's ripe for consolidation. And if we can do something that's a match to us both financially, operationally, and strategically, if all those things line up, I think we would be interested. So I don't – Dan, if you'd add anything to that? Yeah, no, I think that's well-said. And as you see, we – from a readiness standpoint, I think we always got to be thoughtful about are we ready from a financial standpoint and operationally, and we think the balance sheet is well-positioned for us to be nimble and agile relative to a potential opportunity of most any size. I think from an operational standpoint, we still think about making sure that when we start integration work that we're in a good place to do that well, and we still think more towards the end of the year as being a relevant timeframe for readiness there. That's great, guys. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on a strong quarter. Yeah, thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Katz of Citigroup. Your line is now open. Okay. Thank you as well for taking the questions this evening. Just sort of coming back to (00:28:36) Debbie Downer after a good quarter as well, but if I look at the financial advisor count stripping out the onboarding of NPH and also look at what looks like to be a flattish amount in March, how do you think about organic growth away from the transaction and what would be the catalyst to get both of those items going? Yeah, Bill, so a couple things, this is Dan, so let me take a stab at that first, and Matt, you certainly add any color to this. So with respect to the advisor count, NPH, it was down to 84 for the quarter. That was primarily due to a large number of low-producing advisors who did not renew their licenses and many exited the industry. From a timing, that typically occurs sometime in the December to January timeframe, this year, we saw more of that occur in January than we did in December. So that's creating some noise, if you will, with respect to advisor counts in the quarter.
Of course, the other things that impacted the advisor count is our standard retention, which was in the 96% range of prior-year production, and then we recruited $4 billion of assets, both of which are important parts of our formula for organic growth. I think if you look at the NNA for the quarter, that was roughly $3 billion, which was primarily driven by advisory flows. There were $4 billion of brokerage outflows for the quarter, and I think you saw a good bit of noise in the brokerage outflows in March. You also had a bit of lumpiness in March relative to attrition, and again, I think if you look at it over the full quarter, as we said, it was 96%, but a bit of lumpiness in March, so that had some noise, if you will, with respect to just that particular month.
With respect to growth though overall and our focus, right, we are very much focused on our core growth in our core markets, and that comes from us focused on adding new advisors, certainly helping and supporting our existing advisors grow, and then retaining what we have. And so that hasn't changed and we think that you've seen building momentum over the past few quarters, and we feel good as we go forward about using that same formula to drive growth in our core markets. Okay. It's helpful. And then just a follow-up, as you – there's been a lot of discussion on just sort of the economic outlook for the hybrid platform in general, whether it be the OBA, which I think you still help to address (00:31:11), as well as I think a sizable RIA that's looking to potentially move out on its own. So if you just (00:31:19) maybe step back and help us understand the structural drivers for hybrid, and then the sort of second part of that question, also sorry for the nested question, how do we think about the gross profit ROA given the sort of shift in the recruiting dynamic as well as some of the pricing changes? Thank you. Yeah. So there's a lot there. So if I don't get it all, I will do my best, and please, you can – I guess – we can get it right on the question. But, look, there is a – we have a great belief and the opportunity to continue to grow advisory assets. It roughly represents 70% of new flows coming in to the business today, and we think that having both our hybrid RIA and our corporate platforms are really important. They broaden the versatility and the appeal, if you will, of more client – more advisors to our platforms. And so, we think that's a good thing from a strategic and a positioning standpoint of which to cast that broad net. It gives our advisors lots of flexibilities to how they may choose to use us and leverage the capabilities of our platform.
So we will continue to invest in both to ensure that they create an opportunity to help advisors differentiate and win across both platforms. I think what you see us trying to do is make both of those platforms more appealing. In the last couple of years, we've made significant investments in the corporate RIA to bring down its cost to add capabilities and investment content to it. And I think this has worked well both in terms of giving advisors the capabilities they need, but coupled with also the rising sort of complexity, the regulatory environment, not having to take on a regulated entity themselves and leveraging that corporate RIA at a lower price or a lower cost has been a good trade for them.
So we will continue to make those same investments to make that solution more appealing. At the same time, there are advisors who have larger practices and feel like that that hybrid RIA platform gives them the either needed flexibility or the better economics of which to manage their practice. We recognize that that will be right for a certain set of advisors, and so we've tried to build that platform such that we can provide the appeal and flexibility to those types of advisor. And so strategically, that thinking is what is driving our approach to both those offerings and how we may engage and think about serving and supporting clients.
I think to your second question, which was built around how do we think about serving these larger enterprise clients or these bigger clients, I think that we continue to see them as a great opportunity, a great partner. We don't see any specific concern over another large enterprise. We made the policy change that we did last year that helped strengthen our overall alignment with these large enterprises, and they've been good partners at helping us work through those changes, and now we're committed to helping them grow just like any other practice. And again, in that spirit, we'll invest in both corporate and hybrid platforms to help them win, so I hope that answered that broad question. Thanks so much. Yeah. Thank you. Our next question comes from Conor Fitzgerald of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Hey. Dan, appreciate your comments on increasing transition assistance to try and attract more advisors in the near term, so maybe just two questions on that. Any sense of how impactful you think this could be on increasing your net new asset rate, and then if you like the financial characteristics of the offering in terms of the tradeoff for higher transition assistance versus growth, why not make it more permanent? Is there something you're seeing in the market that's maybe making you more excited to do this now? Yeah. Good question, Conor. So our principle here is to use our strength in a more agile way, right, so we're experimenting with different strategies that we believe will be effective in the current environment. And so this quarter, we were really focused on exploring, simplifying our message, leveraging our balance sheet, as we mentioned, and then reducing complexity for advisors in motion. And our sales cycle is a bit longer, so it's too little early to assess the effectiveness of it. But as we progress, I think that's exactly what we'll do, we'll assess the outcomes of this effort, this initiative. And to the extent that it's successful and we get a more informed view as to the outcomes, I think then we would think about pivoting our strategy longer term based on that insight and that learning, so think about it as an iterative process, if you will. And I don't know, Matt, do you want to add anything else to that? Sure. I mean, I would just emphasize that from a financial discipline perspective, Conor, I mean, we are focused on deploying capital where it drives the best returns. We think that's organic growth. And one of the biggest buckets and opportunities to do that in organic growth is transition assistance. And we come at this from a – with financial discipline of just underwriting at a return that we think is quite compelling. So I think to build on Dan's point, if we continue to see this is compelling, then I think we'll make a judgment call at that time whether it makes sense to keep going. Hopefully that answers your question, Conor. It does. Thanks. And then, Matt, maybe one for you. I know you've talked about one of the reasons why most of your ICA contracts are tied to short-term rates is that's a preference for most of the banks. So just want to get an update on any of that – if any of that is changing, or if banks are starting to potentially be willing to enter into more longer duration contracts. And just your updated thoughts on how you're thinking about positioning the balance sheet and the interest rate sensitivity of the company as short-term rates continue to normalize here. Yes. So I think where we are today hasn't – it hasn't changed much, right. I think the – when you look at the different types of interest rates that our balances are tied to, ged funds is the largest, and the others are still on the short end of the curve, so (00:37:38). So that hasn't really changed.
I think when I just think about our long-term perspective, I think we're going to be cognizant of where we are on the rate cycle, and to state the obvious, when you're at zero or near zero rates, there's very little risk to the downside, and if you pick a number or whatever number you think terminal fed funds is, if you're out at that level, the risk to the downside is much higher. So I think we recognize that, and I think our view – we'll ultimately have a view on where we would prefer to be. And then you just have to match that up to what the market's willing to provide. So I think that's our long-term view where we are right now as we continue to be positioned on the short end of the curve, and that's where we like to be. Really helpful color. Thanks. Yeah. Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Mewhirter of SunTrust. Your line is now open. Good afternoon. I had a one sort of a – almost a trivial question, but it's been kind of bugging me. And the other one's more a broad strategic question. First, with the trivial question, I noticed you've been running at about $10 million a quarter of other revenues, and it was only about $0.5 million this quarter. And I just wasn't sure whether that was just flat out noise or whether you had recast a portion of those other revenues into another category, and if it is just noise, would we expect a rebound in that line? Hey, Doug, it's Matt. So are you referring to interest income and other, that row? For just the – the other – so the other line, $593,000 for – in your income statement. Interest income, net of interest expense was $7.8 million. Yeah. We'll follow them (00:39:32). Yeah. What page are you on? I'm not sure what number you're looking at. We can follow up later. It's not a huge issue. You're on the... Yeah. I got you. No, there is nothing going – that line item is where – I'm sorry, I was looking at the management P&L on slide 9. So on page 6, so that's where the mark-to-market shows up on the advisor deferred comp, and so you see that move around a lot. We net that number together with the interest income, net of interest expense above it on the management P&L. So that number is offset typically in the payout. So I'd just encourage you to look at the slide or page 9 view, where that noise gets netted out in gross profit. So there's nothing to be concerned about there. Okay. It's very helpful. And, Dan, with the new SEC rule or the SEC proposal, I should say, is that affecting how you're doing product development? I know you would – been very encouraged by the progress in your Mutual Fund Only platform, which you had taken a lot of time to build. I didn't know whether you would make an adjustment midstream, you would stay the course with that, or you would maybe look to build some sort of alternative which may fit the SEC rule better, or do you think it's just a good product to any kind of compliance environment? Yeah. Good question. And I think our principle around Mutual Fund Only solution, which we think is a really creative solution and it has lots of appeal to it, we still believe that, and what we were doing was trying to time that relative to the regulatory change. And hence since (00:41:13) the date moved around, we would tend to alter and adjust the rollout plans associated with it, certainly with the DOL rule likely being vacated and now the SEC taking up the rulemaking process.
Again, we're on pause to try to figure out and get better clarity of the SEC's rule itself, and then ultimately the timing of it. That will then allow us to then better understand how to pivot relative to any adjustments in the products – in that product or in that product development we would need to make or how – or if we would use the solution. So, it's a bit of a wait and see to get more information and insight around the rule itself before we can make those determinations. Okay, thanks. That's all my questions. Thank you. Our next question comes from Ann Dai of KBW. Your line is now open. Hi, thanks, and good afternoon. Maybe a question for Dan. So, I just wanted to kind of go back and reflect on NPH now that we're mostly closed and you've got some more meaningful perspective on the advisor feedback from that transaction. Guess, I'm just wondering if you could give us some of the pros and cons or maybe lessons learned from the deal and what you take away from that for future deals? Yeah. So, maybe at a high level, I think as we think about the deal, we went into it as an opportunity of course to learn with the thoughtfulness of building some acumen that we could then use on a go-forward basis. So, that was our premise going in. As we reflect back on it, I think that ultimately, the deal structure and valuation certainly ended up proving to be a solid one. When we looked back over our recruiting strategy associated with that deal, I think we learned some things and some lessons relative to the value of simplicity and speed with respect to those recruiting efforts.
We try to approach the onboarding and integration of those advisors in a very different way than we had ever had before with any transaction, making sure we had enough resources both to innovate as well as to add incremental human capital to support that integration and onboarding process, and I think we got some things, interesting things right with respect to innovation. We've got some good lessons learned around data, and quite frankly, the conversion of direct assets. So those may be some places where we think about ever in the situation in the future of an M&A opportunity, where we may tweak or iterate on our approach to improve and enhance both our retention rates, as well as the quality of the onboarding experience. Okay. That's very helpful color. I appreciate that. My follow-up is just on a couple of ratios. So first on the base payout ratio, it looks like that was roughly flat quarter-over-quarter, and I think just with the price decrease in the SAM portfolio, I would have expected that to come up with it. So was there anything specific to NPH assets coming on board or something else that impacted that? And then same on corporate, it felt like corporate advisors' fee rates ticked up a little, so anything specific there as well? Sure, Ann. This is Matt. So on the SAM pricing increase, that actually shows up in the production base bonuses rate. So if you look in the release, that's why that year-over-year was up 33 basis points. It was almost entirely for that pricing increase showing up there. On the corporate side, it's really mix and primarily the growth we've seen in the centrally managed platforms, the fees for that show up in that line item. So it's really a mix and really the success and growth of centrally managed that drove that second increase. Okay. That's it for me. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Devin Ryan of JMP Securities. Your line is now open. Great. Thanks. So good afternoon. Maybe just a follow-up here on the SEC best interest, appreciate some of the comments that you made, and it seems like the industry is pretty supportive, and the devil will still be in the details. But what other considerations should we be thinking about from this? I don't know if it's higher costs or any changes in relationships with third-party manufacturers. And then maybe on the other side of that, are there opportunities like, for example, if RIA are held to (00:45:52) higher licensing standards or continuing education, maybe that reduces some of the appeal of being kind of a pure RIA, which maybe would be good for you guys? So just trying to think about some of the considerations there. Yeah. So, Devin, I think that it's a little hard, because it's early in the process, right. We do think having the SEC work on this and creating consistency across both qualified and non-qualified is smart, it's helpful both in terms of how the advisor would work and manage their clients in it. And I think it's helpful for the overall industry in how we supervise and manage that business. So I think that is a positive thing basically all the way through the ecosystem, right. Certainly, the way that this rule would potentially be enforced is we think much more reasonable and aligned with historically how we've provided or held accountable the compliance with regulation, so we like that pivot in that shift, which we think is a good thing.
With respect to the utilization of the mix between brokerage and advisory, I think we believe in the preservation of choice. We think the approach that the SEC is taking has a great respect for providing and maintaining that choice, which again we think is a really good thing for clients, and we think it's a good thing for advisors and we will continue to make sure that we ensure that our advisors can provide that choice. And I think that would be reasonable then to assume that this mix between advisory and brokerage would continue. It's hard to predict exactly what that exact mix would be, but I think it's reasonable to believe that those dually registered advisors, that would be an appealing option to have to be dually registered, and that they would continue to use both types of solutions.
I think with respect to the utilization of advisory going forward, we see that as a big place of innovation and a place to continue to expand how we serve and support advisors' needs there, such that to the extent that you can create great value for those advisors to deliver to their clients across whether that be more (00:48:13) advisory or brokerage, we think is ultimately the key driver of what we do. And then certainly we can use the regulatory environment as a way to ensure both that we comply, but also that we take those capabilities and we're able to use them in a differentiated and appealing way. Got it. Great. Thanks, Dan. And maybe just a quick follow-up here, appreciate the detail on the asset (00:48:36) business activity asset. I guess (00:48:39) $2 million, can you remind us what that number is, and just want to make sure there's no other kind of administrative fees connected to that? Thank you. Yeah, I think the question around the rule itself would be that if broker-dealers didn't have to provide oversight of the outside business activity associated with their advisory business, that the oversight that we provide to all platform assets and the fee that we charge for that would be eliminated. That's the premise of this.
And so, as you know, we have a small amount of advisory assets that are held off-platform in our hybrid RIAs, and that's where we were referencing roughly $10 billion, that does not show up in our asset count, obviously. And so we roughly charge $2 million a year associated with those assets. So that's the $2 million in revenue that would go away, assuming that we end up in a place where the rule ultimately goes through.
We think there will be a lot of dialogue and a lot of discussion and debate around the merits of this rule, and whether or not that will occur, which will typically create an extended timeline of which we think this dialogue and debate will go on. We're supportive of the premise of the rule and believe that our capabilities around our advisory platforms, both the hybrid and the corporate, and our custodial capabilities create sort of an advantageous set of capabilities that we believe we can use to differentiate regardless of the outcome. Got it. Okay, great. Thanks for disclosure. Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Hi. This is Jordan Friedlander filling in for Craig Siegenthaler. Just a quick one for me here. Given the rising rate backdrop as well as the DOL rule being vacated, could we see a continued pickup in variable annuity sales? Yes, it's a good question, and I think when we think about the overall commissions, right, Matt referenced some growth in our overall commissions, both sequentially and year-over-year, much of that was driven by NPH, but when you peel that back, we've seen sequential growth ex-NPH for the past two quarters in commissions. If you look at first quarter, that was primarily driven by mutual funds, which we think is indication of increasing use of active management.
As we look forward, I think that we do believe that there could be some momentum building around variable annuities for two reasons. The more volatility you see in the marketplace, the more downside protection benefits that the variable annuities offer are more appealing. And then I think the second thing is, as you say with the higher interest rate environment, typically there's a correlation between product innovation in that VA space, and with product innovation with more appealing downside protection and capabilities and benefits, that's logical to think that that could create some momentum in variable annuity sales. Great. Thanks, Dan. Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Shutler of William Blair. Your line is now open. Hey, guys, good afternoon. On the transition assistance offered to NPH advisors, $31 million was cash, $66 million forgivable loans. I think I heard you say, Matt, that NPH is going to drive about $7 million a quarter of higher amortization, so does that mean the average investing period is two and a half years roughly for NPH on the forgivable loans, and why – if so, why is it so short? Yeah. So I think there's a little bit of noise in that, I'd tell you, it's more in the – it's a little bit longer than that in the three zone (00:52:46), and I think transition assistance in (00:52:49) the amount of time is really on an advisory-by-advisory basis. So I think it's just reflective of how that dialogue went, but it's a little bit longer than that, more in the three-year range. Okay. Fair enough. And then, Matt, on the ICA, I mean, you talked about some of that being based on one (00:53:07) three-month LIBOR, with the changes that we've seen in LIBOR rates over the last couple of quarters, I guess, how much incremental benefit could you realize if you shifted more assets to be based on LIBOR? Is that a possibility going from 152 to mid-160 basis points just seems maybe a little less than you'd expect given the move in LIBOR? Thanks. Yeah. So I think the key on that guidance was assuming no additional benefits from interest rates or changes to our deposit rates. So we're not going to – we're not trying to forecast or predict where interest rates go. I think to state the obvious, if fed funds goes up and if LIBOR goes up, that rate would go up. But I think that's just reflective of getting the full benefit of the rate hike that we just had. It's just of course (00:53:56) it'd be hard to predict where the curves go and what incremental benefit we could get. (00:54:03) from the first quarter basically? No, I would just take the mid-160 basis points is to say, assuming no incremental benefits other than the hike that we saw, that's what we would expect. So if you see – if you assume another hike or you're assuming some benefits from LIBOR, then it would be above that. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Thanks. So this topic was alluded to earlier, but I don't think we really got into the specifics, and that relates to press reports tied to the potential departure of independent financial partners from LPL. So I just want to give you guys a comment to maybe talk about whether those press reports were accurate. And then, for us, how should we be thinking about the financial impacts to you guys from that departure? Yeah. So let me start with that, and then Matt – I'll turn it over to Matt for the financial color on it. So the press reports are accurate in terms of IFP was a unique situation where we were not strategically aligned with them. Consequently, we've mutually decided to part ways. They are starting their own broker-dealer that will likely take a full year to set up. In the meantime, we're working with their advisors to help them understand their choices associated with affiliation, and we believe we have a compelling offer to stay with LPL, so we'll see how that plays out over the next 12 months, and I think, Matt, you may want to give some color on financials. Yeah. Sure. So they have about $12 billion in AUM with us, roughly evenly split between brokerage and advisory. The return on those assets are below the average return that we have, so just to get a (00:55:53) little directional input there. And I just – how to think about it, I'd just emphasize what Dan just closed with. We believe we've got a really compelling offer to stay at LPL, and we'll just see how that plays out over time. What's the timing, guys? Do you have a sense of the timing of when the departure might occur? It's hard to be exact because they are creating their broker-dealer, so we've agreed to have them stay on our platform as they make the preparations to do that, that's why we said directionally, it'll take 12 months, that's not meant to be exact, but I think that's a fair sort of directional way to think about it. Got you. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Just curious if you could talk a little bit about the competitive environment today for recruiting new advisors. How that's evolved over the past 6 to 12 months, do you see fewer or more advisors moving today, and who do you see yourselves competing with most out there in the marketplace today for those advisors? Yeah, so I think if you go back to the traditional source of our recruits, I'll answer that part of it first, we continue to see opportunity to recruit both from independents – or sorry, advisors that are independents that may be looking to make a change or look for a broker-dealer that may have more capabilities or larger scale and stability. So that tends – continues to be a source of opportunity for us. We also have the opportunity of recruiting those advisors that may be leaving an employee-based model or warehouse and looking to go independent.
So we still leverage that structural trend, and of course, on our institution side of the house, we continue to see banks and credit unions who were either exploring getting into this business, which is a much smaller percentage, or those that are again maybe looking for a broker-dealer with a bit more capabilities. So those still continue to be good sources of opportunities for us, and we focus across the board on them.
I think with respect to the overall recruiting environment, when we came into first quarter, we had still a bit of a headwind from our focus on NPH, and I think we've seen good steady building of momentum throughout the quarter. And we certainly see people who are out in the marketplace exploring their options and alternatives. But we still see that our model resonates, and when you look at the combination of value and capabilities with the price associated with it, that still tends to be an appealing scenario. I do believe that typically, you run into a bit less advisor movement in first quarter, as it's tax season, and people tend to focus on – advisors tend to focus on a lot of servicing of their IRAs and qualified accounts in first quarter.
The second thing that occurs is typically when there is volatility in the market, you get a little less movement, as well as people are focused on serving and supporting those clients or a little less flexibility in making a strategic pivot in their practice. So hopefully that gives you a little color. But we continue to summarize, we continue to see opportunity across those three traditional markets we recruit in, whereas typically seeing the same competition that's out there, and we're still seeing appeal associated with our model. Great. Thanks for the color. And just as a quick follow-up for the – on the net new – on the advisor side of the business, net new advisor (sic) [advisory] (00:59:44) assets coming [indiscernible] (00:59:45), can you just give us a sense of how much is coming from increased wallet share amongst the existing customer base versus net new assets coming from new customers at your advisors? Yeah. Sure, I mean, I think directionally, and we think about it as – we call it same-store or new (01:00:06) store, from a same-store standpoint, I'd say that was, call it, two-thirds this quarter was the driver from there. And has that changed much over the past 12 months or so? Two-thirds same-store? Yeah, I think that we continue to invest in both the capabilities we have to support and help our advisors' growth, and we've seen that same-store number build over the past year and make a bigger contribution to that overall net new assets than perhaps it traditionally or historically has. And so we're encouraged with that trend. I think if I was going to give you a directional trend around it, perhaps it would be more like half to two-thirds, just building on Matt's comment, that gives you a sense of the order of magnitude that I'm talking about. Great. Thanks for the color and taking my questions. Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Hi. Thank you for squeezing me in here at the end. In terms of legal, we saw some legal headlines this quarter on some legacy issues, Dan, I think you mentioned one. I'm curious to what extent you're seeing an uptick in legal engagement on more current issues. So I guess, first, have you seen any legal action as the broker protocol unwinds? And then two, given the volatility in the market, there's definitely losses on things like fix and (01:01:38) cryptocurrencies, are you seeing more legal either increase or engagement here either? Thanks. Yeah. So let me answer specifically, and I'll walk back up to maybe the initial question you asked, which is a bit more macro, so specifically, with respect to protocol issues, we're not, we recruit from both protocol and non-protocol firms, we historically have done that. So we kind of understand that process. So we've seen nothing tick up there.
We are not allowing cryptocurrency trading within our ecosystem. So we're seeing nothing there associated with that more speculative investment. On a macro level, I think that we have not seen any outsized or step function change in overall concerns, risks, or challenges associated with our overall macro business from a risk standpoint. As a regulated entity, there's always things that come up from time-to-time, but nothing that has been either outsized or out of the ordinary relative to more current activity as you asked. Okay. Awesome. Thank you very much. Thank you. And this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Arnold for any closing remarks. Yes. Thanks, Sanya. And I just wanted to thank everyone for taking the time to join us this afternoon. We appreciate it, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thanks so much. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.","today's call may include forward-looking statements, including statements about future revenue, expenses, and other financial and operating results, business strategies and plans . the company has posted its earnings press release and the company's latest filings to appreciate those factors that may cause actual results to differ materially .",1.0

Today's the call – joining the call today are our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dan Arnold; and Chief Financial Officer, Matt Audette. Dan and Matt will offer introductory remarks and then the call will be opened for questions. The company would appreciate if each analyst would limit their questions to one question and one follow-up.
The company has posted its earnings press release and supplementary information on the Events section of the company's website at investor.lpl.com. Today's call will include forward-looking statements, including statements about LPL Financial's future revenue, expenses, and other financial and operating results, outlook, business strategies and plans, as well as other opportunities and potential risks that management foresees.
Such forward-looking statements reflect management's current estimates or beliefs and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. The company refers listeners to the Safe Harbor disclosures contained in the earnings press release and the company's latest SEC filings to appreciate those important factors that may cause actual financial or operating results or the timing of matters to differ from those contemplated in such forward-looking statements.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Arnold. Thank you, James, and thank you to everyone for joining our call today. In the second quarter, we remained focused on our strategic priorities of growing our core business and executing with excellence, while continuing to assimilate advisors from NPH. This focus, combined with a supportive macro environment, led to another quarter of business and financial growth.
Let's review our second quarter progress, starting with our advisors, where I want to take a moment to highlight some recent external recognition. Over the last quarter, LPL advisors were named to both the Forbes Top Women Wealth Advisors list and the Barron's Top Women Financial Advisors list. In addition, several LPL financial institution clients were named by Bank Investment Consultant magazine to its Top Program Manager list. This type of recognition reflects the quality of the advisors we serve, as well as our emphasis on diversity and inclusion to attract more advisors and clients to LPL.
Moving to our second quarter financial results, we continued to grow and generate operating leverage. Gross profit increased 24% year-over-year, driven by growth across all of our revenue lines. We also remained disciplined on expenses. This combination led to second quarter EPS of $1.30, up more than 70% from a year ago. Matt will review our financial performance in greater depth.
Second quarter business performance was the primary driver of these financial results. Brokerage and advisory assets were $659 billion, up 22% year-over-year. This increase in assets was driven by a combination of organic growth, onboarding of NPH assets, and market growth. Organic net new assets were $1 billion, including net new advisory assets of $4.1 billion, which translates to a 6% annualized growth rate. The key drivers of our second quarter organic growth were $6 billion of recruited assets and solid asset gathering by existing advisors. Asset growth was reduced by outflows from a small group of hybrid firms. Our overall production retention was 96% year-to-date. At the same time, we continue to see increasing use of our advisory, corporate, and centrally managed solutions, which enhances our return on assets.
Looking more closely at NPH, we completed the onboarding of the remaining assets from this transaction. For the second quarter, we had $1.5 billion of net new assets associated with NPH, bringing our total to $72 billion. Advisors from NPH are now actively running their practices on our platform and are beginning to use our suite of services. They ramped up faster than we expected, which is a testament to their focus on the transition and a commitment to maintaining continuity for their clients.
As a result, we reached our year-end goal of $90 million of run-rate EBITDA in the second quarter. Looking forward, we will continue to partner with these advisors to help them take full advantage of our platform and capabilities.
Let's now turn to our strategic priorities, which, as a reminder, are driving growth in our core business and executing with excellence. With respect to core business growth, we think about that primarily in terms of adding new advisors, helping existing advisors grow, and driving a better return on assets. So with respect to adding new financial advisors, let me turn to recruiting. We had a solid second quarter with performance improving each month. This was driven by the return of our business development team's full focus on recruiting, and the emerging benefits of reengineering our sales processes and capabilities across the recruiting team.
Given the building momentum in the second quarter and the interest generated by our temporary increase in transition assistance, we feel well-positioned with a solid pipeline entering the third quarter. In addition, we look forward to having Rich Steinmeier join us next month as our new Head of Business Development. Rich brings a diverse set of skills, an outside perspective and a track record of success. We believe his leadership will help us achieve greater growth moving forward.
In terms of our broader growth strategy, we view M&A as a strategic lever to bring assets onto our platform and expand our capabilities, as long as opportunities that we see align with us strategically, financially and operationally. We will also look to leverage and deploy the experience we gained through the NPH acquisition in any future transactions.
With respect to same-store sales, we are investing in capabilities to help our advisors differentiate and win in the marketplace. In that spirit, we are working to help them execute by modernizing their practice management and by digitizing their businesses. These two things will drive efficiency, scalability and simplicity into their practices.
Let me provide a little color on modern practice management. We piloted our virtual admin service first, and we used the insights from this pilot to enhance our thinking and iterate on the solution. We are now in the market, offering advisors access to administrative support, who are fully trained on LPL processes and systems. This enhances the efficiency of the advisor's practice, while also avoiding the challenges of sourcing, hiring and managing personnel.
In addition to virtual admin, we have three more virtual services in the pilot stage. First, our virtual chief marketing officer is designed to help advisors find and win new clients, as well as better serve and communicate with existing clients. Second, our virtual chief financial officer aligns advisors on a plan to drive value into their practices, by becoming more efficient, improving business mix and stimulating growth.
As part of this effort, we are also providing advisors with capital for practice expansions or acquisitions. Third, our virtual chief technology officer will more efficiently and effectively set up, manage and maintain local advisor practice technology, including computers and phones. Altogether, we believe our suite of virtual services will help advisors simplify, scale, lower costs and accelerate growth within their practices.
A second set of capabilities we are working on is digitizing advisors' practices across their technology stacks and workflows. As an example, this month, we announced that we are building improved end-to-end capabilities inside the ClientWorks. These capabilities will provide a consistent and integrated experience across the advisors' entire lifecycle with their clients, from pursuing prospects to providing ongoing service and support. We are also moving to a more open architecture environment by establishing both new and enhanced integrations with a select group of third-party technology providers. This allows advisors to access ClientWorks data within the tools they value most.
Let's now turn to our second strategic priority, executing with excellence. We remain focused on enhancing our technology and making it easier for advisors and their clients to do business with us. With respect to our ClientWorks technology solution, it is our core operating platform that we will continue to invest into and evolve over time. We have set up those investments in three phases, which we are pursuing in parallel. First, we are executing immediate tactical improvements to the functionality, performance and resiliency of the system. Second, we are working on ClientWorks version 2.0, which focuses on streamlining and increasing the efficiency of major system components. And then third, we have started work on ClientWorks version 3.0 to reimagine primary workflows from an advisor's point of view. We believe all of these efforts, combined with our increased levels of technology investment, can drive greater growth and improve service experience and increased efficiency in advisors' practice.
Let's next move to ease of doing business. We are focused on providing personalized service, making things simple for our advisors, and turning advisor problems into opportunities. Over the past quarter, we completed our initiative to make 100 improvements in 100 days. We implemented changes that could be made quickly to policies, procedures and technology. We used this initiative as a catalyst to begin transforming our culture and capabilities to better serve and support our advisors and their clients.
In the spirit of continuous improvement, we recently kicked off the next wave of 100 improvements. We are also building a roadmap to redesign our service model, including incorporating lessons from leading scalable service models from outside our industry. We believe this combination of activities will leverage the benefits of our scale to deliver a simpler, more personalized experience for our advisors and their clients.
In summary, we're pleased to deliver another quarter of business and financial growth. We plan to remain focused on our strategic priorities of growing our core business and executing with excellence. We believe our strategy positions us well to serve our advisors, drive profitable growth and create long-term shareholder value.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt. Thank you, Dan, and I'm glad to speak with everyone on today's call. We had another strong quarter in Q2. We continued to grow assets and gross profit, while remaining disciplined on expenses to drive operating leverage. As a result, our Q2 EPS prior to intangibles was $1.42, up 76% year-over-year. We are pleased with these results as we continue to focus on our strategy of growth and execution.
Let's look at our business results in greater depth, starting with total brokerage and advisory assets. We finished the quarter at $659 billion, up $12 billion or 2% sequentially, driven by organic growth, onboarding the remaining NPH assets and market appreciation. Total net new assets were $2.5 billion for the quarter, including $1 billion of organic net new assets and $1.5 billion from NPH.
Looking at organic growth in greater detail, net new advisory assets were $4.1 billion or a 6% annualized growth rate. This included $1.5 billion in conversions from brokerage to advisory.
Looking at the mix of our advisory inflows, over 75% of our net new advisory assets were on the corporate platform, totaling $3.6 billion or a 9% annualized rate. Our centrally managed platforms continued to grow as well, with inflows of $1.5 billion or approximately a third of our net new advisory assets this quarter.
Turning to our NPH results, Q2 net new assets were $1.5 billion, including $1.3 billion of brokerage and $0.2 billion of advisory. In total, for this transaction, we onboarded approximately $72 billion of assets. As for accretion, we generated approximately $23 million in run-rate EBITDA this quarter or $92 million on an annualized basis, above our year-end outlook of $90 million. We delivered this run rate earlier than expected, as NPH advisors ramped up their business faster than we anticipated.
As we have now finished onboarding NPH assets and reached our EBITDA outlook, going forward, we plan to end our pro forma reporting and focus on our consolidated results, including NPH.
Before moving on, I also want to highlight that we've added recruited assets to our disclosures this quarter to provide additional insight into our recruiting results. This metric represents the estimated amount of assets we expect to ultimately transfer onto our platform, from advisors that moved their licenses to us during the quarter. The assets from new advisors typically come onto our platform over the two quarters to three quarters after their licenses transfer, so this metric is a good leading indicator of the contribution of recruiting to net new assets.
Now let's turn back to our Q2 results, starting with gross profit. It was $483 million, up $19 million or 4% sequentially. Prior to NPH, it was $440 million, flat to Q1, as higher cash sweep revenues were offset by the seasonal increase in production bonus, as well as lower transaction and fee revenues. Gross profit from NPH was $42 million, up $18 million sequentially, primarily driven by increased activity from advisors who joined our platform. We also continued to see positive trends in our business mix, as more assets move to advisory, corporate and centrally managed platforms.
Moving to commission and advisory fees net of payout, they were $126 million in Q2, down $9 million or 7% sequentially, as the typical seasonal increase in production bonus expense more than offset growth in commission and advisory fees. Looking at sales commissions in more detail, they were $197 million in Q2, up $9 million or 5% sequentially, primarily driven by increased activity from NPH advisors. Prior to NPH, sales commissions were $170 million, down $3 million or 2% sequentially. Looking ahead, we typically see a seasonal decline in sales commissions from Q2 to Q3, which has averaged about 10% over the past few years. And as a reminder, our production bonus expense increases seasonally throughout the year as advisors achieve higher levels of production. For example, from Q2 to Q3 last year, our production bonus rate increased by about 50 basis points, or $3 million. As for asset-based fees which include sponsor and cash sweep revenues, sponsor revenues were $117 million, up $2 million from Q1, primarily driven by higher average asset levels.
Moving to cash sweep revenues, they were $121 million, up $17 million or 17% sequentially, as higher short-term interest rates increased our yields. As for client cash balances, investors remained engaged in the market in Q2 and also withdrew money for tax season, so cash as a percent of total assets declined to 4.3%. Looking at Q2 cash sweep yields, our ICA yield was 179 basis points, up 27 basis points from Q1. As a reminder, our ICA balances are mostly indexed to Fed funds, but we also have some indexed to 1-month and 3-month LIBOR, as well as a small amount of fixed rate balances.
And in Q2, while average Fed funds increased about 25 basis points due to the March and June rate hikes, average LIBOR increased by a greater amount, as it rose in anticipation of the June rate hike. So about half of the ICA yield benefit of the June rate hike actually showed up in Q2. As we think about our Q3 ICA yield, we will have the remaining benefit of the June rate hike.
In connection with this rate hike, we increased client deposit rates equivalent to a deposit beta of about 25%, or 6 basis points on average. So assuming no further benefits from interest rate increases or changes to our deposit rates, we anticipate our Q3 ICA yield will be in the mid- to upper-180 basis point range.
Turning to DCA, as a reminder, DCA revenue is based on a fee per account rather than a rate on balances, and the fee moves along with changes in the Fed funds target range. And with the June rate hike, we had reached the cap on what we earn on DCA.
In July, we increased the cap to a level that is consistent with our ICA max yield. With these changes, we will now have upside of about $5 million per rate hike on DCA revenue. So taken together with our ICA deposit beta outlook, we estimate gross profit upside of approximately $35 million to $45 million per rate hike.
Moving on to Q2 transaction and fee revenues, they were $116 million, flat with Q1. Prior to NPH, transaction and fee revenues were $110 million, down $4 million sequentially primarily from lower trading revenue. Looking ahead to Q3, we have our national advisor conference, so we expect conference revenues will increase by approximately $3 million sequentially. We anticipate this will be partially offset by a seasonal decline in IRA fees of $2 million. I would also note that transaction revenue could decline in Q3, as Q2 trading volumes remained above our historical average, and we tend to see a decline in activity over the summer months.
Now turning to expenses, starting with Core G&A. In Q2, Core G&A expense was $192 million, including $4 million of NPH onboarding costs and $12 million of NPH run-rate expense. Prior to NPH, Core G&A was $176 million, down $6 million from Q1, primarily driven by two factors. First, we had a typical seasonal decline in payroll taxes. Second, we also had more of our technology resources working on product development this quarter, which drove more capitalization than in the prior quarter. So in total for the first half of the year, Core G&A averaged just under $200 million per quarter. As we look ahead to the second half, we plan to invest more in service and technology.
Within service, we increased hiring at the end of Q2, and the associated costs will increase our Q3 run rate. And for technology, we plan to increase our level of development work in the second half. As a result, we are tightening our full-year Core G&A outlook range to $805 million to $825 million, which translates to an average of about $210 million per quarter for the second half.
Moving on to Q2 promotional expenses, they were $43 million, down $24 million or 36% sequentially. Prior to NPH costs, promotional was $36 million in Q2, up $3 million sequentially, primarily driven by higher conference expense. As for NPH promotional costs, they were at a run rate of $7 million, primarily from forgivable loan amortization.
Looking ahead to Q3, we expect conference expense will increase by approximately $8 million driven by our Focus conference. Additionally, we see positive momentum building in our recruiting pipeline which could increase transition assistance in Q3. I would also note that we have been recruiting larger advisors who tend to receive transition assistance as forgivable loans. That trend could drive transition assistance higher in the future, as the impact would be expensed over the period of the loan, which is typically several years.
Turning now to regulatory expenses, they totaled $8 million in Q2, up $2 million sequentially, primarily driven by captive insurance deductibles related to our state blue sky settlements, which we discussed last quarter. As a reminder, we expect most of the settlement expense will be covered by our captive insurance company or existing spending plans. Given that we expect all the jurisdictions to participate in this matter, the small individual deductibles added up to drive the overall increase in regulatory expense this quarter. Looking forward, the nature of regulatory expenses continues to make them inherently difficult to predict. Our actual expense could move up or down in any given quarter or year, based on the size and timing of matters and available captive coverage.
Looking at depreciation expense, it was $22 million in Q2, up $2 million sequentially, driven by our increased investments in technology. Going forward, we expect depreciation to continue to grow as we invest more in technology. Turning to taxes, our Q2 effective rate was 27%, in line with our expected annual rate of 27% to 29%.
Moving on to capital management, our balance sheet remained strong in Q2, and our net leverage ratio declined to 2.3 times. Cash available for corporate use was $446 million, down $28 million from Q1. Turning to capital deployment, we continued to invest in organic growth and return capital to shareholders. For capital returns, we paid $22 million in regular quarterly dividends in Q2. We also increased our share repurchases to $117 million, roughly double our Q1 amount.
Looking forward, we plan to continue investing to drive organic growth, M&A where appropriate, and returning capital to shareholders. Specific to share repurchases, just note that the actual amount we repurchase could vary in any given quarter, depending on the size and timing of our buyback program and the movement in our stock price.
In closing, we are pleased to have delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results. We remain focused on growing assets and gross profit, staying disciplined on expenses to create operating leverage, and deploying capital to drive growth and shareholder returns.
With that, operator, please open the call for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from Bill Katz with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate the enhanced disclosure. Just maybe starting there, as you look at sort of the FA count sequentially, that was modestly lower and continue to see a much better trend elsewhere. So I was wondering if you could help sort of triangulate between sort of that lead indicator you highlighted in terms of recruited AUM, how that might spill into FAs, and then within that, how much was maybe desired attrition versus just sort of undesired attrition? And so, Bill, it's Dan. Thanks. Let me take a couple of those and then certainly, Matt, you provide any color around that. And if I didn't get it all, Bill, just come back it, it's not on purpose. So let's take the assets for a minute inside the quarter, I think the question around net new assets for the quarter. I think when you look at second quarter, they came in around $1 billion, which were a little lighter than our average for the last couple of quarters, where you saw that more in line around $3.5 billion. So the key drivers of that $2.5 billion differential, one, was the $1 billion of tax deferred payments in April, and then you had about $1.5 billion of outflows of assets associated with a small group of hybrid RIAs.
And as we went through strategic changes last year, I think for purposes of aligning both the corporate RIA and hybrid RIA for profitable growth, which we've seen continued growth in both, we teased out just some – where we didn't have alignment with a small group of hybrid RIAs, and they're the group that are driving those outflows in this quarter. You're likely to see that same level of outflows in both the next two quarters. That said, I think we're obviously committed strategically to offering both the corporate RIA and the hybrid platforms. We'll continue to invest in both and make sure that our advisors can differentiate and win.
So, hopefully, that answers your question around maybe some of the NNA and questions around desirable assets that may have – where we saw outflows. If I missed any of the rest of your question, just please fill it in. Yes. I thank you for that. I was actually more interested – and that's very helpful, but more interested in sort of the FA count, just sort of having sort of a minus 18 or so quarter-to-quarter decline, and similarly related to I guess the RIA outflows.
Maybe my other follow-up, and we can sort of talk offline, the other follow-up circles back to capital management. So maybe two-part question, Matt. First one is, is there a way we should be thinking about some kind of combined payout ratio of either adjusted earnings or free cash flow to maybe help model repurchase? And then, the broader question is, as you think about M&A, how does the pipeline look, if you will, and how has that changed, if at all, given that seems like a large property went for what looks to be a pretty big multiple to a private equity sponsor? Yes. So taking both of those, so I think with respect to share repurchase, I don't think there's a classic payout rate to think about in forecasting that going forward. I think when we think about where we want to deploy capital, it's, first and foremost, for organic growth. I think you've seen us do a lot of that this quarter.
Dividends are something that I think are a lot more stable, not just for us but for most folks. They're typically flat to a little bit up. And share repurchases are naturally just going to move more up and down on an individual quarter basis, just depending on what's going on in that quarter. So I think I would just emphasize that we think returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases is a good use of our capital, but it's just tough to predict on an individual quarter basis how that would go.
I think on the M&A side, I think just to emphasize what Dan said in the prepared remarks, I think when we look at M&A, we think it's a good use for our capital and it's a good way to grow the platform, but it's got to be a good match financially, strategically and operationally. And if it's not a match there, I don't think we're interested, and if it is, we are. And I think that'll be our philosophy now and going forward. And, Bill, let me just add to your FA question, I missed that in the first part of your question I apologize. I think, yes, we were down 18 advisors within the second quarter. When you back out NPH, we had a net gain of 35 advisors. Obviously, that's driven through both recruiting and then any advisors that may have left the platform to get to that net number. I think when you look at the NPH advisors, they were down 53, and most of that is just noise around your typical post transaction cleanup. A great example of that would be reclassifying some of the advisors' license that came over to admin status. I think you'll see that as more just noise around the cleanup. So perhaps that ex-NPH number is the way to think about the quarter growth in advisors and reflective of the recruiting efforts. That's actually very helpful color. Thank you so much, guys. Thank you. Our next question comes from Ann Dai with KBW. Your line is now open. Hi, yes. This is actually Matthew Gruseke on the call for Ann. I know we talked about the deposit betas being – coming in at about 25%. I think prior guidance was a 25% to 50% range long-term. Do you anticipate further rate hikes? Any kind of color on what you might see coming forward? Yes, sure. This is Matt. I mean I think our long-term view on a 25% to 50% beta is unchanged, right. And I think when you look at this rate cycle, we've averaged about 10% through the cycle overall, and the last two have been at 25%, so you've kind of seen that building up.
And I think I'd also highlight that the 25% is an average, right. So we price deposits based on the amount of deposits. When you look at it across that spectrum, smaller accounts are a much lower beta in the 5% range versus the much larger balances are more like 50% to 60%. So there's certainly a range of betas, but on average, we've seen it at 25% for the last couple, and our view on the long-term is really unchanged at 25% to 50%. Thank you. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Hey guys, it's Craig Siegenthaler here. Hi, Craig. So the brokerage to advisory migration just slowed a little bit in the quarter. And in the quarter it also looks like the dealer world has probably died here. I'm just wondering if you think the brokerage to advisory migration will continue to decelerate or if this is more of just a one quarter blip? Yes, it's Dan, I wouldn't read too much into one quarter and try to draw any conclusions or trends associated with that. I think you do have the ongoing dynamic of a general transition from brokerage to advisory and I think about that as more the macro demand at the end client level.
We do believe that as we get clarity around the regulatory environment associated with brokerage commission – brokerage products and solutions and commissions that that does make it more predictable and probably a bigger utilization of brokerage than we probably see today. But I wouldn't read too much into the quarterly blip. I think you have those two good dynamics ongoing and we believe those dynamics will stay in place and the ultimate outcome of that mix will be very similar to the dynamics we've seen over the last year. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Christian Bolu with Bernstein. Your line is now open. Good afternoon Dan and Matt. Just a follow-up on the M&A question. Can you just speak to the broader competitive landscape for M&A deals? I think in addition to the large property that was referenced earlier on, we've seen other private equity led deals that have happened. Just trying to understand your thought process and passion upon these deals. Was it a financial issue or operational or something else, just trying to understand how you're evaluating deals here? Yes, so maybe I'll give a little color and then Matt please add anything to it. So, we can't speak to any specific deal. That said, from a conceptual standpoint, we continue to see opportunity associated with M&A to add assets to our platform.
We also think because of our vertical integration, our assets work more ultimately on our platform and we think our opportunity to pull through both revenue synergies and expense synergies create a compelling scenario for us and an opportunity.
And again if we can find that right strategic alignment, operational alignment and financial, then we think that we have interesting prospects and opportunities of which to capitalize on any potential property that may be available in this space.
And so we continue to explore those possibilities out in the market to the extent that we have something that's interested. Then I think we would ultimately look to try to pursue it. I don't know Matt, if you want to add anything to that. No, well said. I mean I would just emphasize around all of that and we're going to continue to be disciplined and patient. And if something is a match, I think we'd be interested. Okay and just a quick follow up. Client cash as a percentage of client asset continues to reach new lows for you guys and I guess the industry as a whole, I guess competitor speaking to yield seeking behavior as one of the drivers. Curious if you're seeing that at LPL also. And then given Matt you got a forecast and can you just jump in sort of a framework to help us think about how low client cash could go. Yes, I mean, I think Chris you said it well. We're seeing it across our space and we don't -- what we see is investor engagement, right. When you look at the money and where it's going, I mean the levels of net buying we see in the last – as we've moved into this rate cycle have been nearly double that we see before that. So we it going into the market. I don't have a forecast or prediction for you on where it's going. I would just emphasize that overall it's a good thing, like high levels of investor engagement in deploying the money, it's a positive overall. Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Shutler with William Blair. Your line is open. Hi, guys. Good afternoon. On the NPH, you reached the $90 million annual run rate of EBITDA in Q2. Is that – how much of that is because there's kind of a new run rate, the run rate is actually higher than that, and how much of it's just timing because, I guess that – guesstimate the higher rates have helped quite a bit? Yes, Chris. I mean, so the June hike was really had – really a minor impact on NPH in the quarter. I'd put it at say maybe $1 million, right. So instead of $92 million, prior to that move you'd be at $91 million. It was really about the NPH advisors just ramping up on our platform and getting to work for their clients earlier than we thought. So it is more about that. So is the run rate higher then, other than the rate hike or not? No, I think – well, I'd say broadly. The run rate is $92 million, and there will be a little bit of benefit as the second – the rest of the benefit from the rate hike comes into the next quarter. That's included though in our overall guidance on ICA yields for next quarter.
I would emphasize that the opportunities on NPH are similar to the opportunities that we have in our business overall, of continuing to have assets move from brokerage to advisory, continuing to move within advisory on to the corporate platform or centrally managed platforms. So, I think those are all opportunities at NPH. But from a current run rate standpoint, it's $92 million plus with the benefits of the rate hikes that are in the overall guidance we gave. Okay. And then, Matt, on the transaction and fee line in Q2, can you give us some sense to quantify how much the trading related revenue came in higher than your expectation? I think so. I mean, I think when you look at it flat quarter-over-quarter, you had some of the NPH benefit in there that drove that line up about 3%. We also had some of the conference revenue. We had one of our larger conferences in the quarter that moved it up 1%.
And then transactions were down to offset that, so down by 4%. So, I think that's still a little bit higher than we would have typically seen in Q2. That's why we expect a little bit of a decline next quarter, but hopefully that helps give you some idea of the changes there. All right. Thanks. I'll hop back in the queue. Thanks. Thank you. Our next question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Your line is now open. Hey, great. Good afternoon, guys. The first question here, so as you mentioned in the prepared remarks, so the new kind of Head of Business Development, it was a former Chief Digital Officer. And I'm curious I mean, I know technology integration is not a new theme here, but it's important for the company. So I guess what changes with the perspective that comes from someone with that background, or I'm just trying to think about if this is a strategy change or what to read into it? Yes. This is Dan. I wouldn't read anything into it. I think, we went into that with a very clear profile that we're looking for, which is a general manager framework and that's what we were after and I think if you look at his diversity of skills and his track record of success, you begin to see someone who does have strategic agility, someone who solves problems and is very accountable, someone who operationally can get you from point A to B, and then someone who can lead people very effectively. And that's the general management framework that I looked for and he has those attributes, and that's what attracted us to him.
We want someone who is an extraordinary leader, a big asset lead who can help us think about doing things in a different way to drive better results going forward. So hopefully, that provides you some helpful color. Yes. It's great. Thanks. And then just a follow-up here, just on expenses, I appreciate some of the commentary on kind of the back half of the year and the full year kind of range that you provided today. How should we think about maybe the base heading into next year? I don't want to get too far out of ourselves, but it seems like there's a little bit of a step up into the back half. And so, is that kind of a good way to think about the launching point with some of the technology initiatives that are now starting to flow through the P&L? Or just trying to think about some of the moving parts here from 1H to 2H. Yes, Devin, I mean I think we'll give 2019 guidance at a later point. And I think the individual quarters, we've always had some seasonality in moving in individual quarters. So, I think you just have to wait and see, and we'll give guidance on 2019 later in the year. Okay. Great. Thanks. And I figured I'd try there. But just one more quick one. Just securities based loans, I'm curious where you guys think you are in education with advisors on that product? I know there has been a recent initiative with Goldman. I'm curious if that changed the trajectory at all there? And I'm just trying to think about the long-term opportunity just given that it has been a product that the industry has embraced and has done recently well for some of your peers. Yes, I think, we've certainly been thinking through that opportunity set, sort of assess the marketplace and the success that we were seeing in certain parts of the industry. So, we are optimistic that by providing that additional service, not only does it create a better experience for the end investor and a leverage point for our advisors but, as you say, drives additional economics.
I think it's very early in terms of the overall educational process and opportunity. And we're certainly having dialog with advisors as they're using it and trying to experiment with it and learn with it. And I think it'll be something that we sort of learn into. But we are optimistic that there is an opportunity for advisors to leverage that to better serve the clients, and because of that value, drive economics with it. Great. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Hi. This is Bill Cuddy filling in for Ken. So first, core managed portfolios continues to grow. As we think about the long-term growth potential for that portion of your business, what would be the upper limit for centrally managed portfolios as a percent of total advisory assets? Yes, it's a fair question. Look, I think we don't necessarily, I think, think about it in that way. I think one of the things that we continue to do is invest in our overall advisory platform because if $7 out of every $10 are going to the advisory platform, we see that as a place for advisors to differentiate and continue to win. And we look at the centrally managed platform as a great leverage point for our advisors when they want to outsource certain components of the overall administrative and operational efforts around managing the portfolio, right. And we are continuing to invest and continuing to enhance this. So we'll deliver new capabilities in the second half of the year that continue to enrich its value and I think appeal to our advisors. That said, we're also investing in our rep-driven platforms.
And so, I would look at it more from a macro advisory standpoint. And again, I think as we continue to enhance the capabilities associated with these platforms and find more ways of which to offload administrative and operational tasks from our advisors, they're going to use these platforms more robustly. And so, I think with the pricing changes and the enhancements we've made to investment content and features within the centrally managed platform, that's where you've seen the growth over the last two years.
And so there's – we believe there's no reason to continue if we create more value. We continue to leverage our scale to drive down lower prices that you don't continue to get a healthy mix and utilization of those platforms. I know that's more of a macro sort of qualitative directional way to think about it, but hopefully that gives you some color. Yes, that's helpful, recognizing that it's a hard question to actually pinpoint a number on. And then, so my second question, could you just elaborate on how the recruiting pipeline looks for this year relative to last year? So, Matt had mentioned larger advisors. Are there other metrics such as production or advisory to brokerage mix changing over time? And relatedly, Dan, you had mentioned your temporary transition assistance initiative, is that driving a change in the types of advisors that you're seeing in your recruiting pipeline? Thank you. Yes. Let me take that one first. I think we obviously offered that as a way to experiment and challenge our own strategic agility relative to an opportunity set. And so that was time-bound and we had some early interest on that. And I think it's too early to draw any conclusions from it. I think we'll see more clarity in activity in the third quarter, so probably have a better point of view on that at the end of next quarter relative to your question. That said, we offered that in a broad way across the board to the industry. So I don't necessarily see that as a change or relative to the overall mix of advisors that we would attract. I think it more helps us understand the elasticity of demand, if you will, relative to utilization of transition assistance and simplified pricing.
I think relative to your question around the pipeline and maybe the characteristics around it, my word, not yours, so if I don't get that right, please guide me differently. But look, we continue to recruit, both in the independent space for those advisors who may be looking for a broader set of capabilities, the benefits of vertical integration, the benefits of our own advisory platform, better pricing in that advisory space. And so we continue to recruit in the independent space. We also recruit in that employee base model to independent model structural trends, so whether that's from the wires or the regionals. And we continue to see opportunity and progress occurring from those places. And those are two of the historically consistent places we've pulled from. And so we don't see a big difference in the overall historical mix in terms of the advisors that we're attracting.
I think as Matt said, we're seeing a mix of larger advisors. And I think that's more just coincidental to opportunity out in the marketplace. And I wouldn't read anything into a shift in our strategy or something that's really driven that. I think we're casting a broad net and think we've got broad appeal in our model, and we like how it's positioned. We continue to test our own go-to-market strategy just to try to optimize it. But I think those things are leading to a pipeline that would look similar to what we've had in the past in terms of the advisors that are in it.
I do think we've worked on picking a good team and continually trying to make it better with respect to new training, giving them new techniques and capabilities like data or new selling systems to enrich how they perform in their own roles. We want to take the opportunity and try to maximize it and put them in a position of executing extraordinarily well. So, we continue to invest there and we do believe that's beginning to have some benefit on the growing pipeline. So, that was probably more than you look for, but hopefully that was helpful. No. It's helpful. Thanks, Dan. Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Hey, it's Zach Feierstein going in for Mike. Just a quick question on the advisors brought over from NPH. How are you thinking about the stickiness of those advisors maybe say three years out? We saw 53 leave this quarter. How should we think about that going forward to think about some softness or some color on that would be great? Yes, so I would be careful concluding 53 left. As I said earlier, I think most of that was just customary post-transaction clean up and as we say, reassigning some of those licenses to administrative roles at which they should have been put in when they first came over. So, I wouldn't read anything into that.
We think that we have a compelling value proposition. We think if we serve them well, give them the capabilities they need to solve the problems and challenges and opportunities for their clients, and do that all at a good price, then we think we have a good chance to have higher retention rates, just like we do in our core business. Remember, these advisors' profile were very similar to the LPL advisors' profile. So, we think we're well positioned to continue to serve them and support them going forward. And Matt, just going back to the cash levels. If they continue to drift lower as they have across the industry, would you consider maybe changing your pricing or making sort of changes to attract more cash, or any color on that would be great. Sure. I mean, I think our pricing is – and we set our deposit pricing in line with the market. I'll just emphasize it's not a cash rate or interest rate sensitive product, right. This is about whether cash is deployed in the market or not. I don't think it's folks sitting there trying to get a higher rate.
I think we feel good about our deposit betas and where we're positioned. And just a reminder, it's a range. It's a 25% to 50% range and we're right now at the lower end. So I just encourage you to think about it that way. Great. I appreciate it. Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. So, I'd like to turn it back over to Mr. Arnold for closing remarks. Thanks, James. And I just wanted to thank everyone for taking time to join us this evening and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Have a good day. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. Please disconnect now and have a great day.","today's call will include forward-looking statements, including statements about LPL Financial's future revenue, expenses, and other financial and operating results, outlook, business strategies and plans . the company will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures governed by SEC Regulation G .",1.0

Joining the call today are our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dan Arnold; and Chief Financial Officer, Matt Audette. Dan and Matt will offer introductory remarks and then the call will be open for questions. The company would appreciate if analysts would limit themselves to one question and one follow-up each.
The company has posted its earnings press release and supplementary information on the Investor Relations section on the company's website investor.lpl.com.
Today's call will include forward-looking statements, including statements about LPL Financial's future financial and operating results, outlook, business strategies and plans, as well as other opportunities and potential risks that management foresees.
Such forward-looking statements reflect management's current estimates or beliefs and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. The company refers listeners to the Safe Harbor disclosures contained in the earnings press release and the company's latest SEC filings to appreciate those important factors that may cause actual financial or operating results, or the timing of matters to differ from those contemplated in such forward-looking statements.
During the call, the company will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures governed by SEC Regulation G. For a reconciliation of such non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP figures, please refer to the company's earnings release, which can be found at investor.lpl.com.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Arnold. Hey, thank you, Andrew, and thank you to everyone for joining our call today. In the third quarter, we remained focused on our strategic priorities of growing our core business and executing with excellence. This focus combined with strong investor engagement and a supportive macro environment led to another quarter of business and financial growth.
Let's review our third quarter progress starting with our advisors. LPL advisors continue to be recognized for the quality of the advice they provide to millions of Americans. Over the last quarter, our advisors were named to both the Barron's Top Independent Financial Advisor list and the Forbes Next-Gen Wealth Advisor list. We are proud to see our advisors recognized for the important work they do to help their clients achieve their life goals and dreams.
We are also seeing the ongoing change in the landscape of investor demographics. We expect advisor practices to evolve in order to meet the market opportunity created by serving more diverse clients. Thus, we are investing to be a destination of choice for a diversity of advisors, as exemplified this quarter by our addition of an all-woman firm and a team of Hispanic advisors. To support this investment, we have created a program to attract and grow advisor practices that are best positioned to serve the changing investor marketplace. We believe these diversity and inclusion efforts can be a differentiator for our advisors.
Now moving to our third quarter financial results, we continued to generate growth and operating leverage. Gross profit increased 27% year over year, as a result of growth across all revenue lines. We delivered operating leverage by staying disciplined on our expense management, while increasing investment in organic growth. As a result, third quarter GAAP EPS was $1.19, up more than 80% from a year ago. Matt will review our financial performance in greater depth.
Let's now turn to our third quarter business performance, starting with Brokerage and Advisory Assets. They were $681 billion, up 22% year over year, as a result of organic growth assets from NPH and market appreciation.
Organic Net New Assets were $4.4 billion in the third quarter, which translates to a 3% annualized growth rate. This included net new advisory assets of $5.1 billion or 7% annualized growth rate. As for our asset mix, advisors continue to use more of our Advisory, Corporate and Centrally Managed solutions, which enhances our return on assets.
Let's now move to our strategic priorities of growing our core business and executing with excellence. With respect to core business growth, we think about that primarily as increasing assets by adding new advisors and helping existing advisors grow, as well as driving a better return on assets. We see encouraging performance across all three of these areas.
Today, we will focus our remarks primarily on our efforts to add new advisors to our platform. Now, let's start with our recruiting results. Recruited Assets were $9.1 billion in the third quarter, up from $6 billion the last quarter. Now this continues the positive trend in our recruiting results, as we've moved through the year. There are a number of factors that have contributed to this increase. First, over the last six months, we have been focused on improving the efficacy of our business development program by reengineering sales processes and enhancing the team's capabilities; second, we adjusted our go-to-market approach by using data analytics to better focus our efforts; third, we are leveraging our digital capabilities to provide scalable messages as a complement to traditional one-on-one dialogue.
We'd like to enhance performance we have seen to-date from these efforts and we'll continue to sharpen our skills as we go forward.
In addition to investing in the capabilities of our team, we've also worked to position both our Corporate and Hybrid Platforms for profitable growth. We made a number of changes that included aligning transition assistance and recruiter compensation with financial returns; we also simplified and lowered corporate pricing; introduced new capabilities; and added a requirement that advisors joining the Hybrid Platform have a minimum of $50 million of Advisory Assets. As a result of these efforts, we have seen an increase in the volume of our recruiting. And we've attracted a mix of advisors, who use more of our services and drive the higher return on assets.
As we assess the contributions from the respective changes, the key drivers were the transition assistance, recruiter compensation, pricing and new capabilities. And we will continue those practices going forward. The change that did not contribute as much was the minimum asset requirement for our Hybrid Platform. As a result, we have removed this requirement effective earlier this week.
We believe this modification better positions our Hybrid Platform for profitable growth, while maintaining our recruiting momentum on the Corporate Platform. As we look ahead, we feel good about our fourth quarter pipeline and the team's direction and ability to capitalize on our opportunities.
Now, as a complement to our recruiting efforts, we are experimenting with another opportunity to add advisors to our platform over the long-term. Across our industry, we anticipate a shortage of advisors to meet the growing demand for advice. In order to help meet this demand, we believe we have an opportunity to bring new advisors to our industry in a new way.
As a result, earlier this year, we began pairing a group of new to the industry advisors with seasoned LPL advisors. This structure helps new advisors learn the profession in a hands-on environment, and it also helps existing advisors with another lever of growth and a potential succession path.
This experiment has given us perspective and insight that culminated in our announcement last month of our new Independent Advisor Institute. This program will drive the expansion of our experiment of bringing new advisors to the industry. After we complete the next iteration of this experiment, we believe we will be positioned to scale the program in the future. We look forward to sharing updates on our progress as we move forward.
In addition to recruiting and training new-to-the-industry advisors, we continue to view M&A as a strategic lever for growth, as well as for expanding our capabilities. As we consider potential opportunities, we remain focused on ensuring they are aligned with us strategically, financially and operationally.
Let's now turn to our second strategic priority, executing with excellence. We remain focused on making it easier for advisors and their clients to do business with us and enhancing our technology. With respect to ease of doing business, we are working to create a differentiated service experience at scale. We are doing this by building an end-to-end continuous improvement program, reimagining our service model, and transforming our culture.
Since the beginning of the year, we have delivered hundreds of enhancements to our advisor experience. The next phase of our effort is formalizing a dedicated team that is focused on harnessing the powerful feedback from our advisors and channeling it into continuous improvement that is repeatable, sustainable and focused on impactful solutions.
In addition, we're beginning to redesign our service model by pairing technology-enabled help with highly-trained human expertise to ensure consistent, accurate, and efficient service for our growing advisor base. To support all of these efforts, we are driving a foundational transformation of our culture. We are taking a scientific approach to infuse a client-centric mindset, logic-based thinking, and mission-driven alignment in everything we do. This transformation involves the addition of new capabilities for our managers with regard to how we hire, develop, and retain talent.
And while there is work to do, the feedback from our advisors has been encouraging. They are telling us that we are focused on the right things and that they are seeing improvement. We will maintain our focus and continue our progress to deliver a differentiated service experience that will help our advisors accelerate their pace of winning in the marketplace.
Now, let's turn to enhancing our technology, which is primarily focused on ClientWorks, our core operating platform that we will continue to invest in and evolve over time. Over the past three quarters, we have released a steady stream of tactical enhancements to Version 1.0, which increased the functionality, performance, and resiliency of the system.
In September, we started delivering new capabilities as part of Version 2.0, including a streamlined new account opening experience, enhanced client and account dashboards, a consolidated annual client review, and an embedded advisor feedback portal.
Looking to next year, we have a vision for Version 3.0 that includes more third-party integrations, enhanced advisory offerings, advanced planning tools, and new mobile and texting capabilities. Going forward, we plan to continue to invest in ClientWorks, as well as our broader technology capabilities, to help our advisors drive scalability, efficiency, and growth in their practices.
In summary, we are pleased to deliver another quarter of business and financial growth. We plan to remain focused on our strategic priorities of growing our core business and executing with excellence. We believe our strategy positions us well to serve our advisors drive profitable growth and create long-term shareholder value.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt. All right. Thank you, Dan. And I'm glad to speak with everyone on today's call. We had another strong quarter in Q3, growing both assets and gross profit. We also increased our level of investment to drive organic growth, while remaining disciplined on expenses to generate operating leverage. As a result, our Q3 EPS prior to intangibles was $1.32, nearly double our level from a year ago. We are pleased with these results as we continue to focus on our strategy of growth and execution.
Let's look at our business results in greater depth, starting with Total Brokerage and Advisory Assets. We finished the quarter at $681 billion, up $22 billion, or 3% sequentially, driven by market appreciation and organic growth. Total Net New Assets for Q3 were $4.4 billion, which is the highest level of quarterly organic inflows since we began tracking this metric in 2015. I'd also note that this result includes absorbing $2.4 billion of outflows related to a small group of hybrid firms that we discussed last quarter. So organic growth was even higher prior to those outflows.
Looking at organic growth in greater detail. Net New Advisory Assets were $5.1 billion or a 7% annualized growth rate. This included $1.7 billion in conversions from brokerage to advisory. These results were primarily driven by inflows to our Corporate Advisory Platform.
Our Centrally Managed Platforms continued to grow as well with inflows of $1.8 billion or approximately one-third of our Net New Advisory Assets this quarter. These results highlight three positive trends that benefit our gross profit return on assets over time. More assets converting from brokerage to advisory, more growth in Corporate Advisory, and greater usage of our Centrally Managed Platforms.
Now, let's turn to our Q3 results, starting with gross profits. It was $493 million, up $10 million, or 2% sequentially. This was driven by increases in advisory fees and cash sweep revenues, partially offset by a seasonal increase in production bonus expense.
Moving to commission and advisory fees net of payout, they were $123 million in Q3, down $3 million, or 3% sequentially, as the typical seasonal increase in production bonus expense more than offset growth in commission and advisory fees.
Looking at commission and advisory fees net of payout on a year-over-year basis, they were up $27 million or 28%, primarily driven by NPH assets, and greater use of our Corporate and Centrally Managed Advisory Platforms.
Looking at sales commissions in more detail, they were $194 million in Q3, up $33 million or 21%, year over year. Of that increase, 18% was related to the full ramp of NPH assets and 3% was from core business growth. This was the strongest organic sales commissions growth on a year-over-year basis in four years.
Looking ahead to Q4, we anticipate production bonus expense will continue increasing seasonally, as advisors achieve higher levels of production throughout the year. As context, from Q3 to Q4 last year, our production bonus rate increased by about 30 basis points or $3 million. As for asset-based fees which includes sponsor and cash sweep revenues, sponsor revenues were $122 million, up $5 million from Q2, primarily driven by higher average assets, as well as growth on our no transaction fee mutual fund platforms.
Moving to cash sweep revenues, they were $127 million, up $6 million or 5% sequentially, as higher average short-term interest rates increased our yields. As for client cash balances, they were $28.2 billion, down $0.4 billion from Q2. However, I would note that the majority of the decline was in July, and we actually saw an increase in September. And so far in October, we have seen a further increase in balances.
Next, I want to provide some additional color on a new metric we have added to our disclosures this quarter: Net buying and selling activity. This metric provides insight into our level of investor engagement as well as dynamics around our cash sweep balances. As you can see in our new disclosure, investor engagement has increased meaningfully over the past two years with average net buying more than double 2016 average levels. This increase is the primary driver of our lower cash sweep balances, as investors put more money to work in the market. We hope you find this new disclosure helpful.
Turning back to our results in cash sweep yields. Our Q3 ICA yield was 189 basis points, up 10 basis points from Q2, primarily from the remaining benefit of the June rate hike. Looking ahead to our Q4 ICA yield, we recently increased our deposit rates equivalent to a deposit beta of about 30% or 7.5 basis points on average. So the net benefit of the September rate hike will be approximately 18 basis points. And of that, some benefit showed up in Q3 balances that are indexed to LIBOR. Given those factors and assuming no further interest rate increases or changes to our deposit rates, we anticipate our Q4 ICA yield will be around 200 basis points.
One more item of note on cash sweep; I wanted to give you a sense of our strategic positioning in the interest rate management capabilities. Historically, the mix of our cash sweep balances has been mostly tied to short-term rates. This was a conscious choice as interest rates were early in the cycle. However, as we move deeper into the cycle, we thought it was important to highlight that we have the ability to place more of our deposits at longer-term fixed rates, as the bank demand for fixed rate agreements is strong.
I would also note that we recently moved $1 billion of our cash sweep balances to fixed rate agreements with an average maturity of around three years. This brings our total fixed rate balances to just above 10% of the ICA portfolio. We will keep you updated as our thinking and mix evolve over time.
Let's now move on to Q3 transaction and fee revenues. They were $119 million, up $2 million or 2% from Q2. This increase was primarily driven by $5 million of conference revenue, partially offset by a seasonal decline in transaction revenue. Looking ahead to Q4, we do not have any major conferences in the quarter. So we expect conference revenue to decrease by approximately $5 million.
Now, turning to expenses, starting with Core G&A. In Q3, Core G&A expense was $209 million, up $17 million from Q2. This was primarily driven by our planned increase in service and technology to help drive organic growth. As we look at our expenses for the year, our Q3 results were in line with our expectations. With one quarter left, we are further tightening our full-year Core G&A range to $810 million to $820 million. This translates to a Q4 Core G&A range of $208 million to $218 million, which includes seasonal increases such as client statements and professional fees, as well as the continuation of our planned investments for organic growth.
As we look forward to 2019, I wanted to share some context on how we are thinking about our spending plans. As a reminder, our long-term cost strategy is to deliver operating leverage by prioritizing organic growth investments, driving productivity and efficiency, and adapting our expense trajectory as the environment evolves. This year's investments in technology and service are driving growth. And we see opportunities to continue that growth into next year.
To give you a sense of our current thinking, we expect our Core G&A growth to be around 5%, slightly more than our 2018 growth rate. We look forward to sharing a more specific outlook with you after we finalize our plans later this year.
Moving on to Q3 promotional expenses, they were $53 million, up $9 million, or 21% sequentially. This was primarily driven by our Focus Conference in Q3, as well as higher transition assistance from our increased levels of recruiting. Looking ahead to Q4, we expect promotional expense to decrease by about $4 million. As we anticipate lower conference expense, partially offset by increased transition assistance loan amortization and seasonal marketing expenses.
Moving on to the capital management, our balance sheet remained strong in Q3. Cash available for corporate use was $392 million, well above our target of $200 million. As for our leverage ratio, it was 2.2 times, down 0.1 sequentially, as we continue to grow earnings.
Turning to capital deployment, our priorities remain investing for organic growth first and foremost, conducting M&A when appropriate, and returning capital to shareholders. Looking at organic growth, our investments are focused on recruiting new advisors to LPL, helping existing advisors grow, and enhancing our technology.
In total, we are on track to invest more than a $0.25 billion across these areas this year; a level of investment that we believe is helping our advisors win in the marketplace.
In addition to our investments for organic growth, we've returned excess capital to shareholders by paying $22 million in regular quarterly dividends and deploying $122 million in share repurchases. Year-to-date, we have deployed $300 million into share purchases, and we have $200 million of authorization remaining. If we continued at our recent pace, we would complete it in about two quarters.
Given our expected levels of cash generation and our view that our stock is a compelling buy, we are working on a new share repurchase authorization. We'll provide you with more detail after we complete this work.
As a final point, I want to share that we have scheduled our next Investor and Analyst Day for Wednesday, May 22, 2019 in New York City. We look forward to providing more details as we get closer to the event.
In closing, we are pleased with our continued strong business and financial results. We remain focused on growing assets and gross profit, investing for organic growth while staying disciplined on expenses, and deploying capital to drive growth and shareholder returns.
With that, operator, please open the call for questions. Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Christian Bolu with Bernstein. Your line is now open. Good afternoon, Dan. Good afternoon, Matt. Wanted to dig into your gross profit ROA trends. That is one of the biggest pushbacks I get on the stock. So I guess slide 11 on your deck is quite instructive. I guess year-over-year gross profit ROA was up 1.3 basis points. But all of that was cash sweep. So ex-sweep it's fairly stable-ish and this is in the backdrop where presumably you're growing higher ROA businesses, whether it's the Corporate Platform, Advisory, Centrally Managed.
So I guess the question is really, why aren't we seeing like better Core gross ROA growth? And then in a less favorable micro backdrop, i.e. flat markets, flat rates, how do you think about growing the business? Thank you. Yeah, sure. Thanks, Chris. I mean, I think we're – I'd emphasize, we're excited about the trends in the business. We're excited about the higher ROA assets that are coming onboard to your point. And when you look at those trends year over year, I mean I just encourage you we quote our return on assets overall, but keep in mind each of those categories don't necessarily move in line exactly with assets.
So as an example, if you look at commission and advisory fees, which are the primary area that move based on our asset levels, we've had a nice improvement year over year from 6.9 basis points to 7.3 basis points. And if you look at an area where visually you see some compression on the transaction and fees, well that's an area where transactions are driven more by activity levels and fees are driven more by the number of advisors we have as opposed to the assets they have with us. So there is a little bit of noise in that, but I think it takes away from the core headline that we're driving assets into higher ROA areas of our business. Okay. Thank you. And then on the cash – no, thanks for the color on the net buying and also the October levels being higher. I know you can never say never, but best you can tell, have we seen the worst of the cash levels declining, i.e. have we passed the worst here or the bottom here? And maybe if you can think like most of the maybe yield-seeking or non-transactional cash is of the platform and we're bottomed out here? Yeah. So Christian, it's Dan. Maybe I'll take that one and then Matt, you please jump in with any color. I think, look, when we think about the primary driver of the cash balances, I think we look to investor sentiment as the gauge there. And I think as that disclosure reflects that you mentioned you see strong investor engagement that quite frankly has picked up over the past two years, and with that, we think that leads to putting more money to work in the overall investors accounts and thus, that has the opposite impact on the cash balances and that's the primary driver.
And I think if you believe that the economy continues to chug along in a solid way, then you would I think expect to see investor engagement hanging in there and continuing to be robust in creating discretionary income that can be put to work. I think that said, certainly the market or the equity markets' performance also has an impact on investor engagement. And in many cases and times of volatility, we actually see some people move to the sidelines and you see a greater allocation of assets to cash and you certainly see more trading activity occur as advisors tend to rebalance portfolios.
And I think we see some of that trend occurring in October correlated with this velocity or in the marketplace. And so – and that's a long-winded way of saying, I can't predict exactly whether we've bottomed out yet or not, but those are the drivers around we think about our cash balances, and how we think about potentially the movement of them going forward.
I do believe that since you've been in a protracted strong period of investor engagement, that perhaps new money being put to work is new money that's being attracted and coming in versus rebalancing portfolios, so that may be one way to think about the ongoing pressure on the cash balances versus what we've seen over the past two years. I don't know Matt, if you want to add anything to this? No, nothing else. Well said. Yeah. That's very helpful. Thank you very much. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citi. Your line is now open. Okay. Thank you very much for taking the questions and also appreciate the disclosure, very helpful for context and color. So just on your comments Matt around the extension on the ICA that seems to be an incremental positive given it's so late in the rate cycle. Have you done any stress work around your core deposit base to think about how far you might be able to go without taking on any kind of sort of liquidity risks within the cash sweep AUM in total? Yeah. I mean, I think to – I think getting on your question (29:12), Bill, is what's the most or the highest percent fixed you could have in the portfolio just given the nature of the movements of cash back and forth on a daily basis. I think that's the question. Exactly. Yeah. And I think in that regard our sweep is no different than others right. When other folks are looking at the fixed versus floating percent, I think that almost everybody will have a certain percent that remains in floating purely from liquidity purposes, separating apart from their view on the interest rate risk exposure that they want to have. And I think we bring to it that same lens. So I don't think we're any different than anybody else. Okay. And then just a follow-up question on the organic growth, certainly September trends look to accelerate nicely off of what you were sort of experiencing previously and I assume a number of different headlines since the quarter has closed, so maybe a two-part question. One is all that new growth that's been announced, I presume that's not part of the 9/30 (30:08) number. But maybe just stepping back more broadly, I know Dan has spent a lot of time early talking about another bunch of iterations of new opportunities. But is there anything you can point to here in terms of market share or specific aspects of new technology or products that is driving such growth? And maybe if you could comment a little bit on the brokerage side, which actually turned positive in September as well? Thanks. I know it's in there, so I apologize. Yeah. No. So sorry if I missed some of it. But let me take a swing at that and then again Matt you fill on anything that you think I may have missed or you could add color to.
So look, when we think about organic growth, we're encouraged by the results in Q3 and it's a number one priority, it's a big part of our strategy, we continue to focus on it, and we'll continue to work to drive that higher. I think as Bill ask, one of the key drivers of that organic growth is certainly the assets that we attract to the platform, right, and we think about that across three areas.
The new assets that we attract through new advisors, helping our existing advisors grow their business, and then of course the retention of our advisors. And in Q3, I think we had pretty solid performance across all three of those lenses. If you look at just a couple of them maybe to highlight, so on the recruiting front, I think we continue to focus on how do we improve the efficacy of the performance of our recruiting and business development teams such that we can make the most out of their capabilities and we continue to work on that. We've seen good progress there and a really good improvement in their overall performance. So that's encouraging, if you think about that in a sustainable way.
I think we continue to work on the appeal of the model too, and whether that's tweaking pricing or adding new capabilities or even working on the service and the technology front, are ways of which we drive the appeal of the business. And I think our continued focus on improving the service and improving ClientWorks, are two great examples that help the appeal of the model.
And then finally, I think when you think about existing advisors, what are we doing to support and help them to position them to grow going forward. And here, think about digitizing their practices, such that we make them more efficient, i.e. lower their cost and scalability. Two, we continue to add to our advisory platform capabilities that help them differentiate their advice such that they're positioned to win going forward, and then this evolution of their overall practice management, so that they run a better or higher performing practices. And so that's where we're really focused from investments and capabilities that we've been delivering throughout the year, and we will continue that going into 2019. So I think those are some of the key drivers of the organic growth.
And look, we feel good about the third quarter. As I said, I think it's an indication of maybe some of the manifestation of our strategy and some of the investments that we're making, and we feel confident that we can continue to improve that number going forward. So I hope I got some of that, Bill. That's very helpful color. Thank you very much. I appreciate taking all the questions. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Hi. Good afternoon. So wanted to start off with a question on Core G&A. Really appreciated the early guidance and the early look on expense growth for next year. It does sound like the 5% growth actually does contemplate a very healthy level of investment. So I was hoping Matt you could speak to the amount of flexibility that that target affords you if the revenue backdrop ends up being a bit more challenge? Yeah, I think a couple of things. I mean, I think first and foremost, it's good to think through how our model reacts in a challenging or a down market, right? There is some natural hedges and offsets that are built in. So if you have a decline in markets like we saw the past few days prior to today, while your asset base revenues will decline, there is typically offsets from cash balances going up and trading levels going up as advisors rebalance their portfolios. So I just start with – I think our business model makes us less susceptible to those movements than it would otherwise be.
I think on the Core G&A front, given that I think two things; one, we always maintain flexibility, it's key to our philosophy and principles around expenses that we can adjust, given the environment that we're in. But I think what you hear us saying today is the investments we've been making primarily in service and technology are really working well. And I think we're excited about that, and we want to continue that. And if for some reason the environment doesn't allow for that level of investment, well then we'll prioritize and adjust, but that's not how we feel today. I think we feel really confident that those investments are the right things to do. Okay. And just one follow up for me on capital management. Really nice to see all of the investments that you've made really driving healthy levels of organic growth. It does look to us like there is more than enough capacity to support your organic growth needs, just given the level of free cash flow generation. And as we think about other capital return priorities, balancing M&A versus buyback, I was hoping if you can give us an update given how much your stock has come in, whether you'd look to tactically get much more aggressive here or is the M&A landscape starting to look sufficiently compelling where you might be able to get more attractive properties on the cheap. Yeah. I mean, I think a few things. I mean, I think on M&A, I think we've talked a lot about how we think that can complement our strategy and that is something that is hard to predict. And if there's something there that makes sense versus something that doesn't. And I think we've had a good acquisition on the NPH front that was a great success. So I think we've always got M&A in our focus. That being said, on share repurchases, I think that kind of build on what you said, our model positions us really well to generate excess cash that we can deploy as opposing to having to keep it on the balance sheet like some other models.
And that excess cash, above and beyond, what we're investing first and foremost for organic growth, we have been deploying into share repurchases. I think we think our stock is an attractive buy. To your point on over the last month, it's even a more attractive buy. And if you look at the pace we've been buying at, that would afford us a couple more quarters of share repurchases under our current authorization. So we're doing work on determining what a new authorization would look like. So we're not ready to talk about that today, but when we do complete that work, I think we'll share and update that. Very much looking forward to the update. Thanks very much for taking my questions. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Thanks. Good evening, everyone. I just wanted to come back to the improving brokerage net new asset trend that just inflected positive in September, and this also comes back to a comment in the Raymond James call earlier today. But it looks like the migration from commissions may be slowing. So do you think this is a case on the macro front? And also, at LPL specifically, what other factors have been driving this recent improvement in brokerage NNAs that we saw over the last couple of months? Yeah. So let me take a stab at some of that. And again, Matt, you provide any quantitative support to any of the commentary. So look, when we think about brokerage, as always, we've maintained a position of supporting both advisory and brokerage. We think that's best to advisors to have different options to meet the wide variety of different clients that they may serve and support, and we continue to make sure that we want to do that well. So the support, the investment, the resources there to efficiently and effectively provide those types of solutions, we've maintained both with respect to advisory and brokerage.
And I think what you're seeing is a couple of things occurring. One, a little less pressure on the regulatory front relative to brokerage products and still some uncertainty around exactly what Reg BI will derive with the SEC's work. But a little less onerous sort of overture around that has helped with respect to interest in those brokerage products and being able to deploy them without some real fearful regulatory environment on the other side of that is helpful to the mindset of the advisors.
I think secondly, you've seen some innovation in products across the annuity space that is helping – I don't want to say annuity – I mean fixed and variable annuities that is helping advisors take some solutions that are creating a more interesting and compelling value to clients and that certainly is helping with respect to some momentum building around brokerage products. And I think quite frankly just a resetting in the industry of commission rates and maybe some of the structure around how these products are offered, which just make them more of an interesting viable long-term solution that create value for clients.
And so with that foundational and fundamental shift, I actually think the advisors are now finding a new rhythm as to how to use them and effectively support their clients' needs with them. So I think that has some sort of contribution perhaps on the margin around the edges. But I think those were the biggest drivers that you're seeing – beginning to see a higher utilization of brokerage solutions again to help clients with respect to their needs.
Now, you may find a varying allocation of assets and solutions across the different product categories based on the equity market performance or interest rate environment, so we do see some of that moving around. But I think this sort of stable and growing demand for brokerage products is an encouraging start. It's probably too early to call it trend, but it is an encouraging step forward. I don't know Matt if you want to add anything to that. No. Well said. Thanks. It's helpful, Dan. And just as my follow-up, on the better recruiting results, can you shed some light on which type of firms the advisors are joining LPL from, especially if there's anything surprising those trends outside of the big three? Yeah. I think no news flash here. The traditional places that we've tended to focus and recruit from are still places that continue to contribute to that overall effort. So think about the warehouses, think about other independents as bringing the primary sources of those new advisors. We continue to work with our model to really explore how we expand the versatility of it. So it creates an appealing scenario for even more potential advisors. And we continue to explore and work on that and experiment with that and hopefully we'll have some new and interesting opportunities in 2019 that will broaden that appeal even further. But today that's where the primary source of those advisors come from. Thanks, Dan. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Your line is now open. Great. Good afternoon, guys. Hey, good afternoon. Maybe a couple of more here on recruiting. So good to see the net advisor additions and thanks for all the detail on the pipeline. When we think about the net head count trends, how should we be thinking about any departures from IFP? I know there has been some headlines recently. But do you guys have any updated expectations on retention there now that we're a couple of quarters away (42:13) from the news that they're leaving to launch a new broker dealer? Yeah. So specifically with respect to IFP, I think to answer your question in short, we feel that's going well. To give you some color and some context around that, I think as a reminder to everyone, IFP was a large enterprise where we teased out, we weren't strategically aligned with them and we have mutually agreed to separate in their sort of next iteration. They're creating a broker dealer of which I believe will be operational, the first half of next year.
And to remind everyone from an asset standpoint, they've got about $12 billion in assets under management at the beginning of the year. And what we've been doing and what they've been doing is just making sure that the advisors know their options so they can make an informed choice about how they think about their affiliation going forward. And so at this point, I'd say roughly one-third of the advisors to our knowledge have made a decision.
And I think three out of every four has made the decision to stay on the LPL platform. So we feel pretty good about that progress. There's work to do, but I think so far we see a good trend. Okay. Great. I appreciate that color. And then a follow-up with the recruiting this quarter and having kind of net additions for the first time in a while, I guess something that we have to think about maybe more going forward is transition assistance coming through the system, or incremental transition assistance I think as you mentioned, Matt, for next quarter. So I know it depends on what channel advisors are coming in through. But maybe if you can – if you can just help us kind of think about incremental transition assistance from result, I guess this quarter and then maybe you kind of highlighted it for next quarter that that would be a contributor. And just anything else if you can kind of help us think about how to model that to the extent the pipeline materializes and net recruiting is the new trend here? Yeah, Devin. I mean, I think the key is and we've talked a little bit about it in the prepared remarks on how we've aligned transition assistance with our profitability, right? So we pay more for folks who join the Corporate Platform versus the Hybrid Platform. We think they're both aligned well for both. I would say the vast majority of transition assistance now is in the form of loans, the expenses incurred over time. So I think when you think about it from an individual quarter basis, I think we'll keep you updated like we did this quarter on what we expect for the following quarter. But I think the P&L impact over the long-term is consistent with the length of the loans, which are typically five years. So they won't have a short-term P&L impact. Got it. Very helpful. Last just real quick modeling one here as well, just with some of those market movement, you had a big market move-up in the third quarter and obviously, we're starting this quarter with kind of a tougher start. And so some of the business drivers like trailing commissions or asset-based fees, can you maybe just give us a rough math if possible around every percent movement in market at least today. I know you guys have kind of given it before. But just to kind of think about on those several items just given that we've seen some volatility in both directions over the past couple quarters. Yeah, sure, Devin. I mean, I think as you know well, the business model has some natural hedges in it. So when assets move down, I think the rule of thumb we give is every 100-point move in the S&P would be about $20 million decline in EBITDA related to the asset side. But then that is would be offset by any movements into cash and the sweep revenues associated with that, and then typically any transactions from the trading levels that would typically increase in an environment like that. And I think what we've seen so far in October is what you would typically expect that cash balances have moved up a little and trading levels have moved up a little. So those would be offset to that. But if you're looking for a rule of thumb simply on the asset side, it would be about that $20 million. Great. Really, appreciate. Thanks for all the questions. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Thanks guys. On the outlook for expenses for next year, and I'm sure you don't want to go into specifics at this time, but kind of bigger picture – can you talk a little bit about what the main drivers of that growth are? And then maybe helping to answer that question a little bit, is it possible to identify how much of that growth is maintenance versus what you would perhaps classify as growth spend? Yeah, I mean, I think I'll start. And the categories are similar to what we're focused on in 2018, which is investments in service and investments in technology. And I think the deeper we get into our investments in organic growth, I think the more they get allocated to new capabilities and things that are going to make our advisors' practices and lives better and more efficient. There's always maintenance every year. But I think the incremental growth when I think about next year is on new capabilities and more efficient experiences really focus on making our advisors more efficient. Okay. And as it relates to technology once you guys get through ClientWorks 3.0, how do you think you will compare the industry as it relates to technology and capabilities? Yeah. So I think, Chris, when you think about 3.0, we think about our objective and our vision creating an industry-leading platform. And that would be a big step towards that outcome. And you've got your core operating platform and then you've got all the other elements that we're building as part of that platform like the third-party integration concepts that we've talked about, a lot of the improvements in the overall workflows and advisory platforms, integrating in financial planning tools, proposal generation, so there's a lot of new elements that are going into that overarching platform we call ClientWorks. And so we feel like we would be a big step forward towards creating an industry-leading platform. If we're not there, we feel like we would be at the high quartile of options that are out there. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Shutler with William Blair. Your line is now open. Hey, guys. Good afternoon. So Dan, I guess first just regarding the elimination of the $50 million threshold you put in place a year ago. Could you just talk about what didn't work or what changed, because I don't think that hurdle was never going to be positive for the recruiting head count, but you're essentially I think banking that the profitability of the new advisors would outweigh the opportunity costs of fewer advisors. So maybe just a little bit more detail on the thought process there? Thank you. Yeah. Yeah, thanks. And so obviously, we were looking at it from very much a strategic standpoint and context. And right, we were positioning, trying to position both platforms for growth. As we said earlier, we think that's really important to create the versatility on our platform, to create a greater appeal to a greater number of advisors. And so we're very much have committed to having both successfully grow as we move forward.
And we turned a number of dials in order to try to experiment and explore what would work best in order to achieve the positioning that we were trying to, right? And so you had TA adjustments, you had pricing adjustments, you had new capabilities that we rolled out to the different platforms, et cetera. And I think we always went into it with this notion that we were going to assess the trends that we were seeing with respect to our execution and our progress along the way and try to understand, which dials made the most sense relative to what we were trying to achieve.
And I think when you step back and you looked at this desire to create a good momentum for growth on our Corporate RIA. And at the same time make sure you have a very competitive Hybrid Platform that also is contributing and attracting new advisors. Well then, we kind of determined which ones were having the most contribution. And when you step back and looked at it, the Hybrid RIA Platform or the minimum on it didn't have a lot to do with the mix between going Corporate versus Hybrid. And if it was acting as a governor on the overall growth of our Hybrid Platform, then it made a pretty much of a no brainer to remove it, such that we still get the healthy mix of advisors going to the platform that serves them best, but we also create a little momentum around our growth. And so that was the concept and that was the iteration that we took. So think about it as a strategic iteration that we just learned and we took that insight and made the adjustment going forward that we thought was best strategically. Okay. Thanks, Dan. And then on the ICA the fixed rate portion I think I missed this, Matt. But what exactly are you investing in there and how much better is the yield today versus the 190 bps in the ICA overall? Yeah. I think, Chris, when you think about our program, these are more – all the sweep funds they're just placed with third-party banks, right? They're making the investments not us. So it's just a matter of the tenure of the agreement and the type of fixed – the type of interest rate that you negotiate with that bank. So think about it that way. For this one it is small, right. So it's $1 billion, it was about on average a three-year fixed rate. So I think you can just look at the yield curve and what the difference between short-term LIBOR is and a three-year fixed rate and that'd probably give you a good idea of the difference. Okay. Thanks a lot. Yes. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Can you just help frame out the profitability of the recruited asset pipeline that you guys have relative to some of the recent departures especially in light of some of the recruiting offers you guys have out there in the marketplace today too? Yeah. So let me take part of that, because I think you're making an assumption that may not be accurate, but let me clarify that for you and then certainly, Matt, you can talk about profitability, if you want.
So with respect to our transition assistance, I think there is an implication that we're paying higher rates and I think that's probably not the right takeaway. I think what you should think about differently is us again thinking about our TA in a more strategic way. And we had historically paid the same transition assistance for someone joining the Corporate Platform as the Hybrid Platform. However, advisors that join the Corporate Platform use more of our services and thus drive more profitability, right? So what we did was we shifted and pivoted away from that historical way of doing transition assistance. And what we did was we aligned our transition assistance to the relative returns on these platforms.
So what you got was a higher TA rate now that we pay for Corporate, a lower TA rate for Hybrid Platforms. But if you took the historical mix of Hybrid versus Corporate advisors who joined the platform and applied the aggregate TA rate, you're going to find a very similar rate that you had historically. So that may help you just at least think about the transition assistance and kind of how we're approaching it. I'm not sure if you want to speak to profitability on top of that. Yeah. I mean, the only thing I'd add is when you look at the $9 billion of recruited AUM for the quarter and to Dan's point on profitability of Corporate versus Hybrid, I would just highlight that the vast majority of that $9 billion are folks that join the Corporate Platform, so the profitability would be consistent with that platform, which is a little higher. Got it. Okay. And that kind of I guess partially answers my follow-up question just in terms of the mix, and the recruited platform sounds like, I think you said like 90% Corporate. I guess how does that compare against what you've been pulling in over the past say 12 months and what your expectation as you forward from here and then also overlaid with how you're thinking about average return on client assets as well, revenue return (55:14)? With respect to your first question around the mix year-to-date, it's similar to maybe a little bit more on the Corporate Platform than we've seen year-to-date. I think as we think about that number going forward, we don't have a specific target in mind. Now that we've adjusted the transition assistance, aligned with the relative returns on the two different platforms, we're indifferent relative to exactly what that outcome is and what that mix is. I think what we want to do is make sure that we've got an appealing model that has the capabilities that the advisors need to be successful on either model. And believe that because we're building one chassis, we can invest in one platform and apply those investments to both the Hybrid and the Corporate. So we like that dynamic. And I think you'll see us approach it in that way. So I hope I've answered your question. Great. Thank you. Thank you. And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to President and CEO, Mr. Dan Arnold for closing remarks. Yeah. So thanks everyone for taking the time to join us this afternoon, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Have a great day. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.","today's call will include forward-looking statements, including statements about management's current estimates or beliefs . the company will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures governed by SEC regulations .",1.0

Joining the call today are our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dan Arnold; and Chief Financial Officer, Matt Audette. Dan and Matt will offer introductory remarks and then the call will be opened for questions. The company would appreciate if analysts would limit themselves to one question and one follow-up each.
The company has posted its earnings press release and supplementary information on the Investor Relations section of the company's website investor.lpl.com.
Today's call will include forward-looking statements, including statements about LPL Financial's, future financial and operating results, outlook, business strategies and plans, as well as other opportunities and potential risks that management foresees.
Such forward-looking statements reflect management's current estimates or beliefs and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. The company refers listeners to the Safe Harbor disclosures contained under the caption forward-looking statements and the earnings press release as well as the company's latest SEC filings to appreciate those important factors that may cause actual, financial, or operating results, or the timing of matters to differ from those contemplated in such forward-looking statements.
During the call, the company will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures governed by SEC Regulation G. For reconciliation of such non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP figures, please refer to the company's earnings release, which can be found at investor.lpl.com.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Arnold. Thank you, Latif, and thank you, everyone for joining our call today. In 2018, we remained focused on our strategic priorities of growing our core business and executing with excellence.
This focus positioned us to grow organically, complete the onboarding of NPH, stay disciplined on expenses and benefit from a favourable interest rate environment. This combination led to EPS prior to intangibles of $5.33, up over 80% from the prior year.
Now, let's look more closely at our progress in fourth quarter, starting with our financial results. Gross profit increased 26% year-over-year as a result of growth across all of our major revenue lines.
And we also stayed disciplined on our expenses while increasing investment in organic growth. As a result, fourth quarter EPS prior to intangibles was $1.49.
Moving to our fourth quarter business performance, our brokerage and advisory assets were $628 billion, up 2% year-over-year. This increase was driven by the combination of organic growth and assets from NPH, which was greater than the impact of lower equity markets.
In the fourth quarter, organic net new assets were $5.9 billion, which translates to a 3.5% annualized growth rate. This included advisory inflows of $5 billion or 6.5% annualized growth rate. As for our asset mix, advisors continue to increase their use of advisory, corporate and centrally managed solutions, which enhance our return on assets.
We also want to share some perspective on the market volatility in the fourth quarter. Now while we are not immune to market movements, our diversified revenue streams provide some natural hedges. We saw this in December, when our client cash balances and transaction volumes increased as equity markets declined.
We also positioned our balance sheet and cash sweep portfolio to operate better in volatile markets by lowering our leverage and create increasing the duration of our ICA balances. This combination of our business model and balance sheet strength increases our capacity to absorb short-term market volatility while continuing to invest to execute our strategy and drive long-term growth.
Now let's move to our strategic priorities of growing our core business and executing with excellence. With respect to core business growth, we think about that primarily as adding new advisors, helping existing advisors grow and driving a better return on assets. Today, we will focus our remarks on recruiting new advisors and providing new capabilities that help existing advisors to differentiate and grow their businesses.
In the fourth quarter, our recruited assets were $8.6 billion bringing us to $27.3 billion for the year, which was the highest annual total we have recorded. The primary drivers of our improved outcomes were enhancing the performance of our business development team as well as aligning our transition assistance with financial returns. We believe these types of structural changes will drive more sustainable and repeatable results going forward. As we look ahead, our pipeline looks solid and we believe our team is executing well on those opportunities.
Let's next move to our efforts to provide new capabilities that help our advisors differentiate and win in the marketplace. In order to do this, we are focused on three key areas: digitizing advisor practices to lower their costs and increase their scalability, enriching the quality of advice as a catalyst for growth, and modernizing practice management so they can optimize how they execute their business.
As part of these efforts, our vision is to digitize the five primary workflows and advisor practices. The first one is transforming how advisors turn prospects into clients.
We are working to integrate this multi-step process into a single digital workflow with several components including CRM; goals based planning, portfolio analytics, proposal generation and client on-boarding. For each step, we'll provide our advisors with the required technology at no charge.
To accelerate the delivery of this technology, we acquired AdvisoryWorld and its industry-leading solutions for proposal generation, investment analytics and portfolio modeling. We believe this digital workflow will help our advisors to increase the efficiency and scalability of their practices which in turn will help them grow.
We're also helping our advisors to enrich quality of their advice by embedding a planning-centered approach in the ClientWorks. As context across the wealth management space retail investors are evolving from focusing on a savings target to planning for life goals. To position our advisors to more easily address, these changing needs next month we will roll out a new goals based planning solution. This will enable our advisors to more efficiently take a planning-centered approach with all of their clients as it will be embedded in ClientWorks and provided at no cost. We believe this solution will help our advisors differentiate and win in the marketplace which will contribute to our long-term growth.
Let's now turn to our second strategic priority executing with excellence. We think about this as enhancing ClientWorks, driving continuous improvement, evolving our service model and transforming our culture. ClientWorks is our core operating platform that we will continue to invest in and evolve over time. Within version 1.0 we focused on improvements that increase the functionality, performance and resiliency of the system.
In Version 2.0, we are increasing the value of our platform to advisors by introducing new capabilities. In the fourth quarter, these capabilities included streamline account transfers enhance search and navigation and new client reporting.
We also continue to plan for Version 3.0 with the goal of turning ClientWorks into an industry-leading platform. We envision that this platform will integrate with third parties in a broader ecosystem and incorporate additional features such as machine learning, artificial intelligence and advisor control over workflows.
Turning to continuous improvement, our focus last year was on delivering improvements that help streamline processes, modernize policies and enhance ClientWorks. As a result, our service performance improved through the year. While operational volumes increased, call volumes decreased, which was primarily driven by fewer service escalation and ClientWorks becoming easier to use.
These trends reinforce our progress on taking friction out of our system. To ensure that continuous improvement becomes a permanent capability, we made a structural change by establishing a dedicated team to continue making improvement while also addressing larger more meaningful opportunities.
Examples of these include, upgrading our annuity order entry system and improving operational efficiencies on our advisory platforms. We will stay focused on consistently delivering improvements that will continue to make it simpler and easier to do business with us.
Looking ahead, we have a large agenda for our service model. Our aspiration is to deliver a differentiated service experience to our advisors that they can't get anywhere else in the wealth management space. And this vision, led us to rethink our service model and to leverage outside end thinking to learn how respected companies in other industries manage their service experiences.
Starting this year, we intend to evolve our current service model to more of a customer care model. Our vision is to deliver a multi-channel service experience, where our advisors can get answers to their questions using a variety of different service channels and methods.
The new model will leverage artificial intelligence and other digital solutions to ensure they get the right information in a consistent way that is more accurate and more accessible. This gives us the flexibility to improve the use of our human resources. Instead of a call center model, we can shift to more of a case management model, where highly skilled and highly trained professionals are accountable for managing our advisors' inquiries from start to finish.
This vision for a new service model was the catalyst for a change in the senior leadership team of our service trading and operations organization. We've hired Dayton Semerjian as a Managing Director and Chief Customer Care Officer, who will join the management team on February 28.
Dayton is a 30 year customer service veteran, who helped implement and lead a customer care model at CA Technologies. He also has prior experience at Intel and Oracle. As part of this transition, Tom Gulley will be retiring in March. We thank Tom for his many contributions over the past three years and we wish him well in his retirement.
Before closing, I want to review our efforts to transform our culture, which is instrumental to executing our strategy. We're taking a structured approach by instilling a client-centric mindset, logic-based thinking and mission-driven alignment.
We took an important step in this journey late last year when we introduced a new mission statement. We take care of our advisors, so they can take care of their clients. We wanted to make it simple and clear to all of our employees that we are here to serve and support our advisors.
Looking ahead, the work on our culture will focus on introducing new behavior-based values, evolving how we attract and develop extraordinary talent to our service teams and creating new rewards and recognition programs that reinforce the culture we want to shape. We believe our efforts to transform our culture will instill the mindset and capabilities that will set the foundation for success for many years to come.
In summary, we are pleased to deliver another quarter of business and financial growth as part of a solid year. We plan to remain focused on our strategic priorities of growing our core business and executing with excellence. We believe this focus positions us well to serve our advisors, drive profitable growth and create long-term shareholder value.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt. Thank you, Dan, and I'm glad to speak with everyone on today's call. We finished 2018 with another strong quarter of business and earnings growth. We grew assets organically, acquired AdvisoryWorld and stayed disciplined on expenses to drive operating leverage. As a result, our Q4 EPS prior to intangibles was $1.49, nearly double our level from a year ago. We are pleased with these results, as we continue to focus on our strategy of growth and execution
Let's now review our Q4 business results in greater depth, starting with total brokerage and advisory assets. We finished the quarter at $628 billion, down 8% sequentially, driven by the decline in equity markets. Total net new assets for Q4 were $5.9 billion, which was our highest level of quarterly growth and we continued our trend of increasing net new assets throughout 2018.
Looking at organic growth in greater detail. Net new advisory assets were $5 billion, or a 6% annualized growth rate. These results were primarily driven by inflows to our corporate and centrally-managed platforms. Our results also included $1.4 billion in conversions from brokerage to advisory. These results highlight three positive trends that benefit our gross profit return on assets over time, assets converting from brokerage to advisory, growth in corporate advisory and greater usage of our centrally-managed platforms.
Now let's turn to our Q4 financial results, starting with gross profit. It was $508 million, up $15 million, or 3% sequentially. This was primarily driven by increases in cash sweep and transaction revenues, partially offset by lower trailing commissions and sponsor revenues.
Moving to commission and advisory fees net of payout, they were $151 million in Q4, up $28 million from Q3. The increase was driven by a lower payout rate, as the market declined in Q4 drove a negative mark-to-market impact to our advisor deferred commission expense. As a reminder, this decline is offset in other revenue, so the net effect on gross profit is zero. Prior to deferred commission expense, net commissions and advisory fees were down $3 million, primarily driven by the seasonal increase of production bonus expense.
Looking ahead to Q1, I would highlight that advisory fees are primarily priced off of prior quarter corporate advisory assets, and they declined by about 7% in Q4. Also, we previously announced that we would broaden the price reduction on our corporate advisory services effective January 1. This pricing investment will reduce gross profit by about $2 million per quarter initially. Over time, we believe the improved pricing will attract additional assets to our platform which would offset the cost at this investment.
Turning back to Q4 and asset-based revenues. Sponsor revenues were $118 million, down $4 million from Q3, primarily driven by lower average assets. Moving to cash sweep revenues. They were $148 million, up $21 million, or 16% sequentially, as both our yields and balances grew in Q4.
Looking at cash rebalances; they were $34.9 billion, up $6.7 billion sequentially. This was primarily driven by advisors repositioning client portfolios to hold more cash.
Looking ahead, advisors have begun moving their client back into the market and cash sweep balances have decreased by over $2 billion so far in January. Looking at our cash sweep yields for Q4, our ICA yield was 215 basis points, up 26 basis points from Q3.
This increase was driven by the fed rate hikes in September and December and the progress we made on our ICA duration extension program. As a reminder, last quarter will begin shifting our ICA portfolio to have more fixed rate balances as we are deeper into the interest rate cycle.
During Q4, we executed several more fixed rate contracts which brought our mix of fixed rate balances up to about 35% of our ICA portfolio. Looking ahead we do not have many ICA contracts up for renewal in 2019. So, while we expect to increase our fixed rate balances even further over time, we do not have many opportunities to shift additional balances this year.
Looking ahead to our Q1, ICA yield, we will have the full quarter benefit from the balances we moved to higher fixed rates in Q4 as well as the December rate hike, partially offset by a recent increase in deposit rates. Given those factors and assuming no further interest rate expenses or changes to our deposit rates, we anticipate our Q1 ICA yield will be around 240 basis points.
Let's now move on to Q4 transaction and fee revenues. They were $119 million, up slightly from Q3 as the expected $5 million decline from conference revenue was more than offset by increased transaction revenue from heightened levels of market volatility.
Now turning to expenses, starting with Core G&A. In Q4, Core G&A expense was $216 million including $2 million related to our acquisition of AdvisoryWorld. Prior to those costs Core G&A, increased $5 million sequentially. This is primarily driven by our investments in service and technology. For full year 2018, Core G&A prior to costs related to AdvisoryWorld was $817 million which was within our outlook range of $810 million to $820 million.
Looking forward to 2019, we plan to stay disciplined on expenses while continuing to invest in technology and service to help drive growth. Our spending plans are unchanged from our initial outlook range of $845 million to $870 million.
However, we are updating our outlook to include annual operating expenses for AdvisoryWorld which are approximately $5 million. This slightly increases our 2019 Core G&A outlook to a range of $850 million to $875 million. And as a reminder, Q1 can be one of the higher quarters of the year given the seasonal increase in payroll taxes.
Moving on to Q4 promotional expenses, they were $45 million, down $7 million or 14% sequentially. This was primarily driven by a decrease in conference expense, slightly offset by increased transition assistance.
Looking ahead to Q1, we expect conference expense will increase by about $6 million as we have one of our larger advisor conferences of the year in March. We also expect transition assistance amortization to increase by about $2 million, driven by our fourth quarter recruiting.
Now turning to regulatory expenses, they totaled $10 million for Q4, up $2 million from Q3. The increase was primarily driven by a matter for which a portion of the expense was not eligible for captive coverage.
As a reminder, the nature of regulatory expenses makes them inherently difficult to predict. Our actual expense could move up or down in any given quarter or year based on the size and timing of matters and available captive coverage.
Moving to share-based compensation expense. It was $5 million in Q4, down $1 million from Q3. Looking ahead, the timing of our equity grants typically makes fourth quarter share-based compensation the lowest level of the year. In the first quarter, the highest level of the year. So as we look at Q1 we expect share based compensation to increase by a few million dollars sequentially.
As for interest expense, it was $32 million in Q4 relatively flat to Q3. Looking ahead to Q1, we expect interest expense to increase by about $2 million as LIBOR rates rose in Q4 and our loans reset towards the end of the quarter.
Looking at our EBITDA margins relative to our gross profit. Over the past year, we generated EBITDA of $866 million, up 40% from the prior year. Over the same period, our EBITDA margin was 44.4%, up 470 basis points year-over-year as we continue to manage expenses to drive operating leverage.
Moving on to capital management. Our balance sheet remained strong in Q4. Cash available for corporate use was $339 million and our credit agreement net leverage ratio was 2.1 times, down 0.1 times from Q3 which is at the lower end of our target range of two times to 2.75 times.
Turning to capital deployment. Our priorities remain investing for organic growth first and foremost taking advantage of M&A opportunities if they arise and returning capital to shareholders. Looking at our organic growth, our investments are focused on recruiting new advisors to LPL, helping existing advisors grow and enhancing our technology.
As for M&A, we deployed $28 million to acquire AdvisoryWorld. This investment will accelerate our development in industry-leading digital workflows that could help our advisors more efficiently turn prospects into clients. In addition to our investments for growth, we returned excess capital to shareholders in Q4 through $118 million of share repurchases and $22 million of dividends. Our continued repurchases reduced our average share count to 88.2 million in Q4 down 2% sequentially and 5% year-over-year.
For 2018, we returned more than $0.5 billion to shareholders through $418 million in share repurchases and $88 million of dividends. Also as a reminder in early December, we announced that we increased our share repurchase authorization to $1 billion and we anticipate completing it over roughly two years. Just note that the pace of our repurchases could vary from quarter-to-quarter depending on all other capital allocation opportunities we have across organic growth and M&A as well as movements in our stock price.
In closing, we are pleased we have delivered strong business and financial results for Q4 and 2018. We remain focused on growing assets and gross profit, investing to drive organic growth while staying disciplined on expenses and returning excess capital to shareholders.
With that, operator, please open the call for questions. Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Thanks. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. So wanted to kick things off with a question on the recruitment outlook. So I guess, first off, just want to congratulate you on the record quarter of organic and new asset growth. Certainly, you're seeing a lot of really good progress there. But Dan, I was hoping to get your updated thoughts on the current competitive landscape for recruitment, and maybe how we should think about the sustainability of that fourth quarter recruiting momentum, and the impact that you might have seen from the market volatility? Yeah. So let me take maybe the second part of your question, and then I'll circle back with the first one. So I think if you look at forward, as I said in the remarks, we feel good about our pipeline. It looks solid. So with a little color as to how we think about that and why we think about? Well, maybe you look at the end of the second half of the year, those were Q3 and Q4 were our best recruiting quarters on record, so we've got a lot of momentum as we entered the year.
I think we're also challenging ourselves to think about how do we produce at a pace bigger and stronger than that. And I think, so we entered into 2019 with that momentum, but with a challenge that how do we continue to think about improving what we do to drive bigger and stronger results with respect to recruiting. And so, when we sort of peel that back and look at that I think the primary drivers of those results in the second half of the year or the continued work and evolution of the performance of our business development team matched with aligning transition assistance to financial returns. And those are structural changes that we actually think are repeatable and sustainable, and we carry forward into the New Year. And again, continue to work on improving and enhancing our performance.
So based on that context and based on our goals relative to recruiting, we feel good about sustaining that pace and continuing to work to challenge ourselves to produce higher and better results with respect to recruiting. So that's the kind of the second half of your question. If I miss something, I'm happy to come back to it.
The first part of your question relative to the competitive landscape, we continue to look at the competitive space and our go-to-market today is based on offering a traditional corporate RAA solution and institutional solution and a hybrid solution. We think that's a smarter go go-to-market strategy for us. It gives us nice breadth and reach into the marketplace, and ensures that we've got an appealing model to a broad set of prospective advisors.
And we're very committed to continuing to evolving and investing in each of those models. I think when we see where our opportunity is coming from it continues come from other independents who see LPL there’s an opportunity to perhaps enhance – have an access to an enhance set of capabilities. We continue to benefit from the movement from an employee-based model to an independent model, so we see success in recruiting both from the warehouses and the regionals. So that sort of competitive landscape and opportunities set, remains pretty consistent as it has in the past. Let me pause there and see if I missed anything in your question? That was a very positive update, Dan. And thank you so much for that. Maybe just switching over to you Matt, just wanted to dig into some of the commentary you gave on the ICA cash extensions. Certainly, the 240 basis points guide was a nice surprise. I was hoping you can provide some detail on really three key inputs as we look to build out the model. One is the current spread differential on fixed and floating balances. The second is the level of ICA extensions up for renewal this year. And the third is just a longer term, how we should think about the optimal target of fixed versus floating? So current spread differential, one; two, the level of ICA extensions for this year; and third, the long-term target fixed versus float? You're challenging me with three-part question, Steven. This is exciting. I'll take that. So, when you look at the current spreads, if you look at just where we executed in the fourth quarter, we did in early December and we put in the key metrics where we executed duration of around four years. If you look at where the swap curve was at that point, it was in the low 300 range when the fed fund was in the low 200s. So it's about 100 basis points spread at that time.
And when you look at that today at certain points of the curve, it's flat to inverted, so it’s in the, call it may be 20 basis point range, depending on what spot you look at. So it's really come back pretty meaningful, but I'm sure it's not a surprise to you. But where we execute at least going from 10 to 35 was before that occurred, which is one of the big drivers of that 240 basis points.
I think when we look at the level of – so part one. So, part two, the level of opportunity in 2019 there is really very little. We had a lot of opportunity in Q4 as we had contracts coming up for renewal. We really don't have a meaningful amount in 2019. I mean, there's always tactical things that you could do. But I wouldn't assume that much is going to happen there.
Over the longer term, I think we want to get to a higher percent fixed, we're at 35% and longer term I think we think something higher than that make sense. But I don't have a number for you today, but I would emphasize wherever we do land, will likely to target range and not a specific amount, because we want to be flexible.
And while we think long-term being in high fixed percent makes sense, but at the same time we always want to make sure we can move back and forth depending on where the market is as the last five, six weeks are perfect example with those strong movements in the yield curve. So I think I got all three of them. Nailed all three. Thanks so much for that, Matt. Appreciate you taking the questions. Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Katz with Citi. Your line is open. Okay. Thanks very much for taking the questions. Just staying on the core deposit theme for a moment, thanks for the guidance. Just one thing, in the supplement I presume the difference between the guidance last quarter and this quarter might be the net effect of the expansion program. Just want to make sure if that's true, but more broadly if we're now sort of phasing a flatter yield curve with the potential for rate cuts into 2020, what if any happens behaviorally in terms of core deposit trends in your minds? Yeah, I think on the change in guide, I think you're referring to the $35 million to $45 million probably going down $15 million to $25 million and that's exactly it. It was the change in fixed rates.
On behavior, I mean, I don't think we see really any difference in behavior. I mean when you think about it from a high level and cash rebalances these are relatively small balances, they are operational cash awaiting for deployment or held for a position like we position for the market like we saw in December. It's really not a lot of rate-sensitive cash.
Maybe the final point I would highlight if you look in the key metrics that we did put out on that same page you're referring to on left-hand side, the last couple of hikes including the most recent one, we’re operating at around a 30% deposit coif or deposit beta. And that's on average at the higher balances, we've got a higher beta, the lower balances are lower and we really haven't seen that move of late and don't expect it too either. Okay. And then just maybe Matt another question for you just -- and Dan as well. But just in terms of the capital triangulation, I guess on one hand you're seeing really good return on investment from the technology and other investments you’re making, and on the other hand your gross profit is improving and your stock has bounced back a little, but where are you between M&A, the need for that just given the really strong organic growth trends that are developing versus the buyback at this point in time? Yes, Bill. I'll start it off. I think when you think about our capital allocation framework and even factoring the dynamics that you just walked through, it really is unchanged. I mean I think the investments in allocating capital for organic growth we think is by far the best return on capital.
And I think you're starting to see that bear out in the results and a lot of things that Dan talked through in his prepared remarks are where and how we're deploying capital to drive a better experience and capabilities and service experience or customer care experience for our advisors and that really has a great return on capital.
On the M&A side, I think our philosophy is unchanged. We think that is an area that can help add to our growth. We'll look at it from a financial lens or strategic lens and operational lens and we'll do things like you saw us do with AdvisoryWorld this quarter. We can do a capability acquisition that helps move the strategy forward.
So, I don't think we see that really unchanged. I think that the third area on share repurchases, you see us consistently deploying capital on the share purchases in the low $100 million per quarter range. And if you take our point on $1 billion authorization over two years, it's about that level with the caveat that, of course, it can move around.
So, I think we feel good about how and where we're deploying capital and most notably, on organic side and the results are coming from it. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler of Credit Suisse. Your question please. Good evening everyone. For my first one, we just want to get update on IFP and your ability to retain your advisors? Yes, sure I'll take that one, it’s Dan. And so, in short, we're making progress and the retention rates are similar to what we talked about last quarter. So, with that as context, let me give you a little more color and just as a reminder, if you look at the assets, IFP started out this process around $12 billion of Brokerage and Advisory Assets.
The advisors managing those assets need to make a decision by somewhere in the first quarter that timeframe can vary as to whether they will stay with us or change broker dealers.
To-date the advisors did manage about two-thirds of those assets have made the decision and approximately 75% of those assets are staying with us. Now that still leaves about a third of the advisors that are working through the process and we're focused on making sure we're educating them on what their options and alternatives are in the spirit of helping them make an informed choice.
So, hopefully, that gives you a good update as to where we are. I think the actual date that -- of transition is subject to when IFP will be ready to start their own broker/dealer. So, there's not a perfect science around -- in the first quarter, but that's our best estimate. Thanks Dan. And just as my follow-up. You made several tweaks to your transition assistance offering last quarter and I just wanted to see if you could comment on if you've seen any changes in your recruiting results so far just based on those changes? Yes. So, I'll provide some color and then Matt you please add anything that you think is helpful. I think as we think about our transition assistance, I think the core principle is aligning that transition assistance with financial returns, right? And we've continued to tweak that experiment as to how we position that out in the marketplace.
But I do think at the end of the day with respect to being smarter around how we align that around financial returns that does have a bigger contributor on the heavier mix of corporate RAA versus hybrid RAA that we saw pretty much for the balance of last year and certainly in the second half of the year. So I think that's probably the biggest place that you see some realignment or rebalancing based on those changes. I don't know Matt, if you want to add anything to that. No. Again, you need to keep going. Thanks, guys. Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Hey. Hey, guys. Good evening. Hey, Alex. First question for you guys around the trends in recruited assets. The data you guys provided was quite helpful again so around $9 billion, I guess, for the last two quarters in a row. How much of that is reflecting -- how much of that is already reflect, and I guess in client asset balances and any sort of breakdown you guys can help us think through brokerage versus advisory and sort of the impact these assets might have on the gross profit ROA as they come in? Yes, Alex, so I'll start. I mean, I think our typical ramp on recruited -- new advisory coming onboard, those are the assets that come over in the first six months. So I think that's probably the best proxy to give you how that ramps, so similar dynamic last quarter for the $9 billion that the six months following that. And advisors typically come in throughout the quarter. The only nuance in the fourth quarter is December as usually, a little bit slower especially the second half really no advisors can move.
I think from a mix standpoint, we typically see on the recruiting side, the brokerage mix is a little bit higher than our overall mix. And then overtime as we've talked through you do have some brokerage advisory conversions, but from a recruiting asset standpoint, the brokerage mix is usually a little bit higher. Got it. And then just a follow-up question around the ICA dynamic. Can you guys talk a little bit about what’s going on with bank competition for brokerage deposits sort of kind of like the spread that is paid over benchmark rates today? Whether or not there is an opportunity to pick up a little bit an incremental yield that way? And if there is no more interest rate hikes in the cycle, should we think about the to 240 ICA yield you highlighted is kind of reasonable run rate for the rest of the year or there is something that could move sort of up or down? Thanks. Yes. I think on the bank demand or competition for deposits, I think, over the past several years, you've definitely seen that move up I mean, just using spreads over fed fund on those type of deposits as a proxy. You go back to before rate started moving up and they were – move bouncing around in the 5 basis points to 10 basis points over fed funds. I think when we look at the market today, you can typically get in the 20-plus. There is -- its technical markets. It depends on who needs what when, but it's definitely moved up.
I think with respect to the 240 basis points, so that is our estimate assuming no more hikes, no more changes in deposit rates. There's always movements to your -- the first part of your question, there's always movements in funds even if we’re not fixing anything out or changing rates that way. Funds can be placed with different banks that can drive a little bit movement there, but that's probably relatively minor, but it could move a little bit. Great. Thanks very much. Next question comes from the line of Christian Bolu of Bernstein. Your line is open. Good afternoon, Dan and Matt. Good afternoon. Regarding growth clearly slowed meaningfully in December, you guys are tracking around 5% to 6% in the prior months. So curious what drove the slowdown in December? And then as we've seen equity markets lift up in January is growth going back to trend? Yeah. That's a good question. And I think as you said, if you take the quarter as a whole pretty solid quarter from NAA standpoint. We've seen a continued to trend upward, which is a good thing. I think we definitely saw a slowdown in December and that's not so illogical for a couple of reasons. One, you typically see the seasonal impact of the holidays to just reduce the number of opportunities for advisors to gather assets. You've also see a heavier focus on tax planning with the coming of the year-end, which again has a similar type of impact.
I think then you add to that the markets turned to the downside in December, which definitely had an impact on same-store sales. NNA, as advisors were focused on helping their existing clients going to manage through that market volatility. And we saw some of that continue into the early part of January. I think when you hit the mid-January though, we began to see same-store sales NNA ramping back up, and you add to that solid recruiting pipeline that we talked about. And we believe those are certainly two helpful factors that will contribute to solid NNA growth going forward. So, hopefully that helps? Yeah. That's a very helpful. And then maybe just a clean-up question here for Matt. Advisory yields that tick down a couple of basis points to, I guess, 103 basis points. And just curious like what drove that? Is that a good number to think about going forward? Yeah. I mean, I think that number naturally moves around from quarter-to-quarter. So basis point or two pick-up or drop down is pretty normal. When you look at on a full year basis 2018 versus 2017, it’s relatively flat. So I just look at that as more quarterly noise, and you could always have that in future quarters as well. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Shutler of William Blair. Your line is open. Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Hey, Chris. In recent weeks and months, I think we've seen one of the warehouses starting off at around see only RAA effort, a couple of your broker dealer or competitors are tapping into that area also. Just give us an update on whether you see yourselves playing in the fee only RAA space at some point, and if so how? Yeah. It's again a good question. And we think about our go-to-market strategy. We're constantly exploring where the opportunity set lies across the 300,000-plus registered advisors that are out in the marketplace, and where those opportunities are. And if we're not either competing in where advisors are moving from one model to another that would give us a challenge to think about that differently.
And so I think with respect then, that is a backdrop to how we think about that. We would tend to look at different models and explore how – should we add them to our portfolio, certainly, the RAA only or the fee-based only. We have a model today that exists where if someone wants to drop their broker license and they can continue to operate on our platform today. We can facilitate and support that type of solution. So we have a solution today.
What I would tell you though is the question we're challenging ourselves on is can we improve it? Can we retransform it? Can we materially rethink it such that we reposition it into a more compelling and competitive offering out in the marketplace? So we're in the process of doing just that. So more to come on that, but we do think it's an interesting possibility that we should be considering relative improving and enhancing our offering today. Okay. Thanks Dan. And then, if I could sneak in a couple of quick ones. What's the – what was the amount of advisory loans in the quarter that would show up on the cash flow statement? And can you talk about the reduction in the advisor headcount in the quarter? Thanks a lot. You take the loan one and I'll take the... Yeah. So Chris, the loan one we have – we have that information in the 10-K, we’ll have that for you today. It will be out soon. Could you – And Matt could you think about disclosing that going forward because it's an important number? Of course. All right. And with respect to – sorry, with respect to the advisor count decline, our advisor count for Q4 was down 65 and such things a bit illogical when you look at the solid quarter from a recruiting standpoint and the consistency around our retention from quarter-to-quarter.
So sort of give you the drivers around that 50 -- we had 50 advisors in the quarter left that were previously with IFP. They were retirement plan focused and didn't have a lot of assets from a brokerage and advisory standpoint, so they tend not to make a lot of difference on our advisory balances, but certainly they make noise in the advisor count.
The second driver was, we had about 30 advisors that left from the previously discussed small group of hybrids that we weren’t strategically aligned with and we've been going through the process of separation there.
And then finally, thirdly, we had kind of a typical yearend noise where you’ll have some low producing advisors that just decide to leave the business because they don’t want to go through the renewal process of their licenses and incur some fixed cost going into the next year. And that was about 30 advisors.
So when you begin to summarize those or sum those up that creates a noise in the overall numbers. When you back those out, the growth in terms of the number of advisors would correlate better with what you see from the asset growth, the NNA, the recruiting and retention. All right. Thanks a lot Dan. Thank you. Your next question comes from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo. Your question please. Thanks guys. So your cash balances -- customer cash balances they went up a lot in the quarter. At the same time, it looks like customers were actually net buyers of securities. So just wondering if you could explain that dynamic a little bit? I would think that, if advisors were net buyers, you wouldn't have such significant growth in the cash balances? Yeah. Sure Chris. So well said and if you look at -- we put in the key metrics, if you look at the month, when you saw the majority of that cash that grew, grew in the months of December but we actually had net selling for the first time in quite some time in the month of December. So that was the big primary driver that month.
And then, when you put it all together, at least when you look at the trends, we've been hovering in a net buying zone of $8 billion to $9 billion a quarter and with the less net buying in October, November as well as net selling in December that’s what dropped by about $7 billion quarter-over-quarter. So that's the change. That's probably the key driver what drove that cash up. Got you. That makes sense. And quick follow-up on your base payout rate, I know in any one quarter can kind of just jump around, if we think about the bigger trend here and your corporate advisory assets continue to grow faster than hybrid. Should we assume that that base payout rate picks up a little bit over time? Yes. I think historically, the mix there drove a little bit more change. When you look at the pricing changes we made in the past couple of years, really the difference between those two is a lot more minor, so it's not likely to be a big, big driver. Okay. Thanks a lot. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan of JMP Securities. Your line is open. All right. Great. Good afternoon, guys. Hey, Devin. Just another one, maybe on the ICA and just trying to understand the mechanics of the contracts and why there isn't much of extension this year. You still have roughly two-thirds that are tied to short-term rates, but it sounds like you still have a commitment for a fixed period of time. So I'm just trying to get a sense of what the average length on the short duration contracts is? And then, could you potentially extend duration with some of those existing banks? Or is that just not something we should be thinking about? Yes. So you hit it well on your question. Right? So even though there's contracts that are at floating rates. There's a commitment to have the funds there for a certain period of time. We didn't break out the exact duration of the rest of the contracts, but there's very little opportunity in 2019. But I think you're right.
On the second part of your question, there certainly can be opportunities. Right? Even if there's a commitment if the other side of the counterparty is interested in moving from floating to fixed, that certainly could happen. So was my point earlier or in the prepared remarks, that there might be some technical opportunities, but not materially.
Also, I’d add to that we'll keep in mind the interest rate environment, right. I think if we’re sitting here in early December with 100 point steepness in the curve, I think we might be more focused on that than where are sitting today, where it's only potential 20. So I think we're going to keep the interest rate environment in mind as well. Yes. Okay. It makes sense. Appreciate the color. And then, just a follow-up on the commissions. So trailing commissions step back because the market, which we get, but pretty healthy sales based activity, which I would have thought could have been a little bit quieter just as investors potentially reduced automatic allocations during the volatility and kind of derisked a bit. So I'm just curious, was that a seasonal or does it somehow benefit from volatility. And then really I'm just trying to get a better sense of what was helping new sales and if it speaks to anything that might be more sustainable in terms of a trend that you guys are seeing? Yes, those are great -- fair questions. And I think, as we think about that, you've seen quite frankly some stability in both the brokerage flows and the sales-based commissions really over the past three quarters.
And may be the primary drivers of that to think about is just as you recruit these new advisors, they're bringing new brokerage assets and that's going to create obviously more opportunities for commission-based activities.
I think, you also see, with maybe some progress on the regulatory front, more willingness to use brokerage with existing -- existing advisors using brokerage as a potential solution to help clients, and I think that's certainly been a contributor. And then finally, I think, some of the volatility that has occurred in September forward certainly gives the advisor more opportunities to potentially solve for different problems that are arising for clients, where commission-based solutions may be an opportunity. But I would think that more around the edges than the first two points that I made, which are probably more significant drivers.
The final thing that you see is, you always see a little seasonality in a traditional insurance in the fourth quarter, just the timing of some of these renewals and how that's done. So you get a little bit of lift, but again that's a minor point around the edges. So those first two drivers are the key ones. Okay, great. Last just quick modeling one here. We've seen a little bit of an uptick in regulatory charges, and we've seen that for some of your peers as well. And so I'm just curious if that speaks to something bigger going on we’re just intensifying once again around certain topics? Or is it really just kind of idiosyncratic, because you did have a reasonable step up in 2018 over 2017 I know specific situations, but just trying to think about the go forward, how you would be advising to model that? Yeah, I mean I think when you look at the year-over-year trend for us, it's more about the combination of our size and growth combined with our insurance captive or we increase the coverage there and therefore increase the premiums. That's really the primary driver. There's always going to be the potential for things to come up outside of that like we saw a little bit this quarter that you referenced, we talked about in prepared remarks.
And those are going to always be hard to predict and it always comes up. But I think from an overall standpoint, we feel good about the investments we've made in compliance and the technology that we're deploying there, and lowering our risk profile overall, and the driver for us of late has really been the captive premiums. Got it. Very helpful. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to circle back on the AdvisoryWorld acquisition. Just strategically, if you could just talk about curiously how you're thinking about making the technology-related acquisitions and allocating capital to that and the need to continually invest in the technology acquisition companies that you are acquiring versus say renting, licensing that software and you kind of get a benefit from going to a larger firm that has those capabilities and the scale to continually invest in core expertise in that area? Yeah, so there's a lot, so let me unpack some of that and if I miss some of it please just ask again. So, look with respect to AdvisoryWorld that was -- the logic and the strategy around that was an opportunity to take some really good technology that through an acquisition we could accelerate our speed to market relative to some of the work that we're doing around digitizing advisor practices. They feel the variety of different capabilities that we wanted in those overall workflows and so it made a lot of sense for us to take the acquisition route there, bring it then, work on, integrating very quickly, which we just did this week. So that's the first step in that integration was to get it into ClientWorks and make it easily accessible to our advisors, which were charging no fee for. And then that creates a brand in quick new leverage point for them as an example. There is more in the integration than that but that was the first step, which is encouraging.
And so again philosophy, accelerate the speed to market relative to some of these capabilities, take a good foundational platform that we know once inside, we can continue to improve and iterate on it and give something to our advisors that is going to materially help them operate their businesses. So that's the AdvisoryWorld story.
I would tell you that would hold true relative to other technology capabilities. I think, we think about the world through, yes, we have -- and make a big investment in our own technology organization to build and develop and that's an important component of our overall strategy, but we're also very open to looking at really good technology out in the marketplace that's either established and commercially available or even finding smaller organizations that are building new tools and capabilities that we actually can strike up a partnership with and have a big influence on the ongoing development. And integrate those into our ecosystem where it’s not just about, hey, I've access to that technology, but can I integrated in and really transform how the advisor works. That's what we think is the key. So, we'll continue to do that.
The final thing is as I think we do not believe that we have a corner on having all the capabilities that we need from a technology standpoint to figure out the future. It's a fast-moving marketplace. You've got to state nimble. You’ve got to stay agile. You’ve got to keep your head up in exploring your options and alternatives.
And so we've got strategic partnerships and access to places like Silicon Valley that may have certain expertise or capabilities to complement what we might do internally. It might go completely outside to develop some new capability that we bring in. So, we've got multiple ores in the water relative trying to increase the pace and the breadth of our technology innovation.
I think the one key point, I want to make sure I make clear to you is, we do all of that with a specific purpose. We go in trying to solve specific problems. We're not innovating for the sake of innovating. We're clear on what we’re trying to solve for. And then we work back from there, and I think that is an important point that keeps us focus and ensures that we’re optimizing the prioritization of the work on that portfolio. So, I hope I hit your question, if not, fire away. Indeed, super. Thanks so much for the color. If I could just ask a follow-up on a more of a modeling technical issue. Just on the production expense, can you just walk through the three pieces there in the production expense. We can maybe get a little bit better understanding there?
You’ve mentioned you have a separate commission expense little bit volatility in there. If you can just help flush out the mechanics of those three lines within the payout ratio and how to think about the level from here that would be helpful. Thank you. Yes. Sure. I mean -- I think the base payout rate is as defined, right, as the label lends itself. The production base bonuses are the bonuses that build throughout the year based on advisors' production. So, that's one where I'd encourage you to look at. If you're looking at page 14 of the release that trailing 12 months at the bottom of that table, kind of, gives you an idea knowing that it's going to build through each individual quarter.
The thing I would highlight there is our pricing changes do show up as an increase in the production base bonus, both the one that we did in 2018 and the one that we spoke about in the prepared remarks today that will begin in Q1 of 2019. So, when you look at that trailing 12 months last row, that's why you see that growing throughout the year.
The non-GDC sensitive payout, that's the item that I spoke about in the prepared remarks, where it’s really just a mark-to-market and it's a gross profit or revenue item that gets offset here. So, in thinking about payout, I'd just encourage you to look at the GDC sensitive payout line. That's the most relevant piece and below that's really mark-to-market noise. Great. Thank you very much. You bet. Thank you. And at this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Arnold for any closing remarks. Sir? Yes. Thanks so much, operator. And thanks to everyone for taking their time to join us this afternoon. And we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Have a great day. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.","today's call will include forward-looking statements, including statements about management's current estimates or beliefs . the company will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures governed by SEC Regulation G .",1.0

With that, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Arnold. Thank you, Carmen, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call. In the first quarter, we remained focused on our strategic priorities of growing our core business and executing with excellence. This focus, combined with strong investor engagement and the support of macro environment, led to another quarter of business and financial growth. Let's review our first quarter progress, starting with recent feedback from advisors at two of our larger conferences.
Advisers tell us their experiencing a renewed focus on them and how we are helping to expand their value through new capabilities and the way we're making it easier to do business by taking friction out of the system. They are enthusiastic about our continued focus on these areas and our vision to deliver an experience that is unique in the wealth management space.
Moving to our first quarter financial results, we continue to generate growth as gross profit increased 20% year over year. Additionally, while we invested for growth, we stayed disciplined on expenses to drive operating leverage. As a result, first quarter EPS prior to intangibles was $1.93, which was up over 70% from a year ago.
Turning to our first quarter business performance, our brokerage and advisory assets were $684 billion, up 6% year over year. This increase was primarily driven by a combination of organic growth and higher equity market levels. Looking more closely at first quarter organic growth, net new assets were $4 billion, which translated to a 2.5% annualized growth rate.
Organic growth strengthened throughout the quarter as we move beyond the impact of December volatility. This included positive trends and new store sales as prospective advisors reengaged in recruiting dialogues and in same-store sales as investors move back into the market.
Let's now turn to executing on our strategic priorities, starting with core business growth. We think about that primarily as adding and retaining advisors, helping our advisors grow and driving a better return on assets. To achieve these outcomes, we are investing in capabilities in three key areas: digitizing advisor practices, enriching the quality of advice and modernizing practice management.
Today, we want to highlight two of these areas. First, we continue to see a big opportunity to digitize key workflows that will help advisors transform their business. One of the most important workflows is turning prospects into clients. So in Q1, we introduced new CRM solutions, rolled our goals-based planning and as a results of our acquisition of AdvisoryWorld, integrated our new proposal generation solution.
With these separate capabilities integrated into one streamline workflow, our advisors can now more efficiently add clients to their practice. In addition to digitizing workflows, we are investing in new capabilities to enhance the value and flexibility of our advisory platforms. We recently introduced our advisor sleeve solution, which allows advisors to use their own asset allocation models in centrally managed platforms, while outsourcing to us the day-to-day work of portfolio allocation and trading.
This gives advisors another way to leverage our centrally managed platforms to meet client needs, while helping them drive efficiency in their practices. Pricing also remains an important strategic lever to help advisors differentiate and win. Over the past few years, we have developed one of the most robust no transaction fee mutual fund offerings in the marketplace. And we've seen advisors increase their utilization as a result. We now have a similar opportunity with ETFs.
In partnership with sponsors, later this year, we plan to reduce transaction charges on select ETFs from $9 to $5, which will provide advisors with simpler and lower advisory pricing for their clients. Financially, this offering will be roughly neutral for us, as we are in sponsor revenue from ETF manufacturers in place of transaction revenue.
We believe our investments and capabilities are helping advisors with what matters most to them, driving growth, creating scalability and lowering their cost. As a result, this makes our platform an increasingly compelling place for existing and prospective advisors to thrive, which in turn benefits our growth.
Let's now turn to our second strategic priority, executing with excellence. We think about this as enhancing ClientWorks, driving continuous improvement, evolving our service model and transforming our culture. We continue to invest in and evolve our ClientWorks technology platform to increase its value and differentiation.
In the first quarter, we completed ClientWorks 1.0, and now we are working to deliver new features as part of ClientWorks 2.0. The focus of version 2.0 is creating more streamlined and intuitive experiences across core functionality, such as new account opening, cash management and account transfers. Rolling out these enhancements will help advisors save time and increase their capacity to serve clients.
Turning to continuous improvement. One of the most important elements of this initiative is capturing advisor feedback and translating it into insights that we can learn from and effectively apply. In the first quarter, we launched the alpha version of our new transactional survey that enriches our feedback with real-time data.
Now this data will help us accelerate our learning, and thus make us more nimble and agile and continuously improving our operating platform. More broadly, we're working to transform our service model by moving from a traditional call center to a customer care approach.
At a high level, this customer care model has three primary elements, providing multiple channels for advisors to engage with us, intelligent routing of their inquiries and case management for complex issues. This model gives advisors simpler access to information and more accurate support without having to navigator a service center. We've seen this model work in other industries and we're excited to bring this solution to our advisors.
And before closing, I want to highlight our ongoing efforts to transform our culture, which is instrumental to executing our strategy. As a reminder, we are taking a structured approach by instilling a client-centric mindset, logic-based thinking and mission-driven alignment.
Last quarter, we rolled out a new mission. And this quarter, we are starting to bring the mission to life with a set of new values that will guide our behavior in decision-making in our daily work. Our advisors tell us they're excited about the cultural transformation that is taking hold and see it as a catalyst for continuing positive change in their service and experience.
In summary, we're pleased to deliver another quarter of business and financial growth. We plan to remain focused on our strategic priorities of growing our core business and executing with excellence. We believe this focus positions us well to serve our advisors, drive profitable growth and create long-term shareholder value.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt. All right. Thank you, Dan. And I'm glad to speak with everyone on today's call. We started 2019 with another quarter of business and earnings growth. We grew assets and gross profit and invested to drive growth, while still delivering operating leverage. As a result, our Q1 EPS prior to intangibles was $1.93, up 74% from a year-ago. We are pleased with these results and we continue to focus on our executing our strategy.
Let's now review our Q1 business results in greater depth, starting with total brokerage and advisory assets. We finished the quarter at $684 billion, up 9% sequentially, driven by the rising equity markets and organic growth. Total net new assets for Q1 were $4 billion, which translates to a 2.5% annualized growth rate.
Our pace of growth increased throughout the quarter as advisors return to asset gathering and recruiting ramped following the slowdown in December, driven by elevated market volatility. More specifically, net new assets were $0.7 billion in January, $0.9 billion in February and $2.3 billion in March.
We also continue to see positive mix shifts in Q1. Advisory assets increased to 46% of total assets, driven by a 7% organic growth rate. Within advisory, the majority of net new assets were on our corporate platform. And we added $1 billion of inflows to our centrally managed platforms.
Now let's turn to our Q1 financial results, starting with gross profit. It was $556 million, up $48 million or 9% sequentially. Looking at the components of gross profit, commission and advisory fees net of payout were $116 million in Q1, down $35 million from Q4. The decrease was driven by the standard mark-to-market of our advisor deferred commission program, which was $47 million this quarter.
As a reminder, this increase has offset entirely in other revenue, so the net effect on gross profit is zero. Prior to deferred commission expense, net commissions and advisory fees increased $12 million sequentially, primarily driven by the seasonal decline in production bonus expense.
Looking ahead, as a reminder, our production bonus payout rate increases seasonally from Q1 to Q2. I would also note that we had a $3 million benefit in Q1 related to our 2018 payout, which came in slightly below our expectations.
Turning back to Q1 and asset based revenues. Sponsor revenues were $123 million, up $5 million from Q4. The increase was primarily driven by a sponsor contract we renegotiated, which included a catch-up payment of $4 million related to 2018 activity.
Moving to cash sweep revenues, they were $173 million, up $25 million or 17% sequentially, primarily driven by higher ICA yields. Cash rebalances were $30.7 billion, down $4.1 billion sequentially from client net buying activity of $13 billion, which was the highest quarterly level we have seen.
Additionally, I would highlight that the decline in ICA was from our floating rate balances. So while we did not enter into any new fixed-rate agreements this quarter, our mix of fixed rate balances increased to about 40% of the ICA portfolio. As a reminder, we do not have many ICA contracts up for renewal in 2019. So while we expect to increase our fixed rate balances even further over time, we do not have many opportunities to shift additional balances this year.
Turning back to our cash sweep yields for Q1. Our ICA yield was 250 basis points, up 35 basis points from Q4. This increase was primarily driven by the full-quarter benefit of the fixed rate contracts we executed in Q4, higher average short-term rates and the higher mix of fixed-rate balances.
Looking ahead to Q2, we expect our ICA yield to decline slightly, driven by the full-quarter impact of our January increase in client deposit rates and the recent decline in LIBOR. Combining those two factors and assuming no further changes in the short-term interest rates, client deposit rates or fixed versus floating mix, we estimate our Q2 ICA yield will be in the mid-to-upper 240 basis point range.
Let's now move on to Q1 transaction and fee revenues. They were $122 million, up $3 million from Q4. The increase was primarily from seasonally higher IRA fees, partially offset by slightly lower transaction revenue. Looking ahead to Q2, we expect transaction and fee revenues to decline by roughly $6 million, primarily driven by seasonally lower transaction volume.
Now turning to expenses. Core G&A was $213 million in Q1, down $4 million sequentially. This was primarily driven by lower professional fees, partially offset by a seasonal increase in compensation expense. Looking ahead, we continue to anticipate full-year 2019 core G&A to be in a range of $850 million to $875 million. As for the timing of expenses, we expect them to ramp through the year as we continue investing in technology and service to help drive growth.
Moving on to Q1 promotional expenses. They were $51 million, up $6 million or 14% sequentially. This was primarily driven by increases in conference expense and transition assistance as expected, partially offset by seasonally lower marketing expense. Looking ahead, we expect Q2 promotional expense to be roughly in line with Q1.
Moving to share-based compensation expense. It was $8 million in Q1, up from $5 million in Q4. Looking ahead to Q2, we expect share-based compensation expense to be at a similar level to Q1.
Turning to depreciation and amortization. It was $23 million, up $2 million sequentially. We expect depreciation and amortization to rise over time as we continue to invest in technology to drive growth.
Looking at our EBITDA margins relative to our gross profit, it increased to 49.7% in Q1, as we grew gross profit and continued to invest to drive growth, while delivering operating leverage.
Moving on to capital management, our balance sheet remained strong in Q1. Cash available for corporate use was $376 million and our credit agreement net leverage ratio was down slightly to 2.05x.
Turning to capital deployment, our priorities remain investing for organic growth first and foremost. Taking advantage of M&A opportunities if they arise and returning capital to shareholders.
Looking at organic growth, our investments are focused on recruiting new advisors, helping existing advisors to grow and enhancing our technology. In addition to our investments for growth, we returned excess capital to shareholders in Q1. This included $125 million of share repurchases, in line with our plan to complete our $1 billion authorization over roughly two years.
Looking back over the last year, we repurchased 7.3 million shares or 8% of our total shares outstanding. In Q1, we also returned capital through $21 million of regular quarterly dividends.
In closing, we are pleased to have started 2019 with another quarter of strong business and financial results. We remain focused on growing assets and gross profit, investing to drive organic growth, while staying disciplined on expenses and returning excess capital to shareholders.
With that, operator, please open the call for questions. Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question is from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Hi, good afternoon. Dan, I wanted to start with a question on some of the drivers of the strong organic growth that you cited and improve momentum again in the quarter, certainly encouraging to hear. Now at the same time, there continues to be a lot of M&A activity in the space.
And I was wondering if you could provide some updated thoughts about your asset type for M&A? And separately, can you discuss some of the benefits you're seeing in advisor recruitment as a result of some increased consolidation, much of which has been driven by the thesis? Yes. So Steve, there's a lot there. So if I don't get it all, please just follow-up. So let me start with maybe your question around how we think about acquisitions versus organic growth. And I think as Matt just said in his remarks, that strategically our first priority remains organic growth, where we return on investment is the highest.
That said, I think we always are interested in potentially complementing that organic growth with some M&A opportunity should it occur and should it arise. With that lens that we always share with you that it's aligned strategically, financially and operationally.
And so we do believe there will be ongoing consolidation that will create opportunity for us to do an acquisition that would bring new advisors to the platform and so we will continue to explore those possibilities, again all with good discipline around how we think about that.
Now when those transactions occur, as you say, it does create recruiting opportunity out in the marketplace. So as we pivot over to how we think about recruiting, if you look at our recruiting over the last several quarters, we've had pretty strong results. In fact, we had a little over $7 billion and recruited AUM in the first quarter. And if you actually look back over the trailing 12 months, we had a little over $30 billion in recruited AUM. It's the first time we've ever had that.
And so I think you begin to sort of peel that back and go, hey, what's happening there? What do you think you're having success there? And there's a couple of things. I think part of that is as I've shared with you, we've been working hard to improve the efficacy of our own teams recruiting capabilities and business development capabilities.
And we've continued to evolve and transform how that group and unit works. And it's really encouraging to see the progress they're making, whether it be new sales processes and structures, new ways of which to use data and digital to better target the marketplace for opportunities. So we're seeing them continue to grow a healthier and healthier pipeline and do a better job of pulling through those prospects once they're in the pipeline.
You match that up with where we aligned our transition assistance with financial returns, and we think those two things bode well for our continued ability to recruit going forward, but also a more reflective of the success that we've had in the past other than any sort of circumstance out in the marketplace like a transaction they created a short run more episodic opportunity.
And again, I think that's what we're trying to do is build the fundamentals and foundation, so they're more reputable and sustainable predictor of your outcome versus just relying on some market circumstance.
That said, we don't ignore. If there's an opportunity out in the marketplace that comes, we certainly try to allocate resources to those opportunities. So hopefully that gives you a little answer of how we think about both M&A with - M&A specifically focused on advisor acquisition and then how we're thinking about recruiting.
Let me pause there. You may have had a question about organic growth, but I'll let you follow-up if you want me to drill down on that. Nice. It's really helpful color, Dan. I really wanted to focus on the M&A side. So I appreciate all that context. Matt, just a question for you. Given the macro backdrop has been quite volatile over the past six months, I was hoping to hear your perspective on how you're feeling at this point in the year?
And how it's going to impact your thoughts specifically around the areas like expanding capital management? Do you still feel good about the core G&A outlook and ongoing repurchases? And more specifically, was your original guidance dependent on continued rate hikes in 2019. Yes. So I feel good. And I think we're well positioned, especially given our business models get natural macro hedges built into it, as equity markets and cash rebalances tend to move in opposite directions. So maybe a little bit reminder, the sensitivity there, every 100-point move in the S&P is about a $25 million impact for us. And every $1 billion change in cash rebalances is about a $20 million impact, right.
So if you just look at the last two quarters, I think to the point of your question, when we look at Q4, we saw the S&P go down by about 300 points, but our cash balance has increased meaningfully, $5 billion just in the month of December, over $6 billion for the quarter.
And then when you look at this quarter Q1, you saw the markets recover and they were up almost in equal and offsetting amount at about 300 points and then cash rebalances went back into market declined by a little over $4 billion. So just looking at those moves over the last couple of quarters, you can see they roughly offset each other.
So I think getting to the core of your question from a strategic perspective for us, these natural hedges, combined with where we have the balance sheet positioned, which is a really strong position, I think allows us to consistently focus on our clients and what's best for them.
So investing in capabilities, investing in technology, investing in service, all things are going to improve their experience and we think drive growth over the long term. So we think it's really good. It's real differentiator for us and really a driver of growth over the long-term.
And I'd say the same thing plays through on the capital allocation side, whether it be share repurchases or as Dan was just discussing, M&A if it comes up, I think, we positioned ourselves well even with an environment like we saw over the last six months to be able to be consistent in a steady deployer of capital in all those areas. That's great, Matt. Thank you for taking my questions. Sure. Thank you. And our next question is from Bill Katz with Citi. Your line is open. Okay. Thank you very much for taking the questions. So just in terms of your opening commentary, Dan, it certainly seems like there's a lot of traction and new asset growth. How much of the investment spending and some of these technology enhancements you're making today, which sort of puts you in front of competition rather than sort of playing catch up, if you will? Bill, I think look, we're beginning on a journey from an investment standpoint, and you kind of look at that over a multiyear period of the time, right. It starts with your strategic framework and then how you think about allocating those resources. And I think certainly, we think we have good solid strings out in the marketplace and we continue to try to invest in those, such that they further help us differentiate and create more appeal in the model.
There's other places, where I think we acknowledged we had work to do, and we tend to run right at that and take that on and challenge ourselves to say how are we going to improve and enhance those capabilities, such that not only do we just catch up in that area or fill the gap, but we continue then to push it on forward in order to create a differentiated experience. So if I summarize that, then we tend to start with our strategy, which is focused on creating capabilities for our advisors to help them differentiate and win. We absolutely want to be a leader in that area.
And then secondly, we've been focused on how do we improve that advisor experience in the form of technology processes' capabilities, and we want to be a leader in that area. And so to the extent that we look at our opportunities to invest, we start there with the mindset being what's that journey to ultimately be the best, and so that's kind of how we frame up and think about allocating our capital and human resources toward those efforts.
I hope I answered your question. That's helpful. And just my follow-up, just in terms of where are we in terms of the IFP exposure? And then is there any way to sort of think about what kind of trends we're seeing into April and May? And related to them, I was a little surprised I didn't see a better commissions per advisor metric given the elevated buying. So was there any sort of adverse mix shift here? Was that maybe a part of the pricing change you made? Yes. Let me start with IFP, and then we'll try to walk those down. So with respect to your IFP question, I think, in short we - as sort of we closed that effort out, we'll end up retaining roughly two-thirds of the assets. So let me give you a little color as to how we walk down and get to that place.
So if you remember, if you look at the assets that IFP started with, it was about $12 billion of brokerage and advisory assets on our platform. Roughly, retaining two-thirds of those is $8 billion that will stay on our platform, which means roughly $4 billion will transition off.
About $0.5 million of that left in Q1, which means the remaining $3.5 billion will come out in Q2, probably more specifically in the May and June periods of time, associated with their transition date.
If you look at that through slightly different metrics, perhaps on an advisor basis, we retained a little more than 50% of the advisors, which would suggest we retained on balance the more productive advisors. So we think, all-in, that's a pretty good outcome. Hopefully, that answers your IFP question.
With respect to your organic growth question and sort of how are we thinking about things as we move into second quarter, I think again, Q1 was pretty strong. We had $4 billion of net new assets roughly annualized, 2.5% growth.
As we move into second quarter, we saw strengthening in Q1, which certainly takes us with momentum going into Q2. We delivered a number of capabilities in Q1 and early Q2, which certainly will support and enhance the appeal of the platform. You continue the good strong work of our organizations from an efficacy standpoint and their sales efforts. So we feel good about the prospects for organic growth in the second quarter.
There are a couple of items that I would call out that are just things to remember. One would be IFP and the $3.5 billion that will come out associated with that. And then as always, we have that seasonal tax period, where people are paying their taxes, and so you typically see the first half of April where people will be using some cash in their accounts to pay their taxes. So that's something to think about in Q2.
I hope that answers your questions on Q2. Matt, I'll let you take the third question, which is around advisor productivity. Yes. So Bill on commission advisory fees, I'll just highlight a couple of things. One, on the sales commission side, there's just two less trading days in the quarter than the prior quarter. And then just a reminder on the advisory fee side, the fees in Q1 are primarily driven on where assets ended the fourth quarter.
So what you see this quarter is the flow-through effect of the decline in the market in Q4, which all else being equal, you would see that we recover when you see results in Q2. So those are the two things that, I think, make that trend a little bit counterintuitive. Okay, perfect. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Thanks. So Dan, just a follow-up on your point around some of the seasonal factors in April, maybe just an update on where cash balances stand with you guys currently on the back of the tax season? And obviously, the markets have been reasonably robust, so presumably there has been more kind of deployment back in the market. Yes. So if I just drill down on April a bit, knowing that we'll give you our monthly metrics here in a couple of weeks. So let me give you a directional sense of how we think about April as context. As you say, you've got the tech seasonality going on in the height of the paying of those taxes in the first half of April. Certainly the equity markets moved up, which all-in-all is a good context for activity.
So I would say, given those two things, we saw what we would have expected in April. Asset levels moving up consistent with equity markets and good activity associated with investor reengagement or strengthening investor engagement. We certainly saw cash balances decrease in the month, given both tax payments and solid investor engagement. And then finally, the pace of M&A was solid in the second half of the month past tax season. So hopefully, that gives you, Alex, a little sense of some of the color around April. Great. No, that's definitely helpful. And then slightly bigger picture question. On the metric that you guys disclosed around recruited assets, did the pace that you alluded to on a net new asset recruiting kind of short up there as well, meaning that just kind of really accelerated toward the end of the quarter. And as we think about the next couple quarters, should we anticipate the recruited asset level kind of return to the run rate we saw in the back half of last year kind of $8 billion to $9 billion range? Yes. So we did see a pickup as we move through the quarter as you get further away from the volatility and advisors logically would reengage in those recruiting discussions and dialogue. That said, I never would suggest that one quarter would be predictive of another. I think with respect to recruiting rights, it's hard to define it within a 90-day period of time.
And that said, I would say our aspirations for working on new store sales and driving our recruiting efforts definitely have a desire to continue to increase them and our work is pointed toward continuing to improve that trend over time. That said, it's just hard to predict quarter to quarter. Got it. All right. Thanks very much. Thank you. And our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Thanks. Good evening. So we understand that 1Q was somewhat of an anomaly with the decline in client cash, just given the high starting point in December. But how should we think about further downside decline in cash and incremental sorting if the risk on backdrop here continues? Yes, Craig. I'll take that one. I mean, I think when you think about where cash can go from here, I mean, I think history is best guide and it's really market driven, right. When markets are increasing and growing like we're seeing right now, cash tends to get deployed in the market. And you've seen us kind of hover in that 4%, 4.5% range. And then when you have periods of volatility like we - clients typically hold more cash like we just so happen in December, where cash went from about 4.5% of AUM to 5.6 or 4 percentage point in just one month.
So I think those trends are probably the best thing to think about or look at from cash level standpoint. I would highlight that clients typically maintain some amount of cash in their accounts, just to facilitate trading and rebalancing and the paying of fees or queueing up cash to take disbursements. So if you look at our lowest level of cash balances, you go back to Q3 of last year, they were in the low 4% range, almost right at 4%. And I'd say that fell pretty close to the minimum level you would hold for those factors. So that's probably the best thing I can point to and give you some context there. And so Matt, I know you won't add LPLA in the last cycle. But if you - I don't know if you have the data, but if you think about 2006 and 2007, do you guys recall where client actually bottomed? And if it was higher than current levels, which, I think, it probably. Do you think the relationship here has changed? Or is it just a function of a tenurable market? Yes. I think the general performance of sweep accounts is pretty similar across our space. And I think where the lowest we've really gotten is what I just referenced last - from a percent of AUM was last year. On the other end of that, the highest cash ever got as a percent of AUM was just under 10% when volatility peaked at the end of the last cycle. So those are probably the two bookends I would think about on where cash could go. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Thanks. Hi, guys. Sorry if I missed it, but what drove the pretty large step-up in the DCA fee rate in the quarter? Was that all attributable to the moving interest rates? Yes, I mean… It seems like a large move. Yes. I mean, DCA has got two things. It always makes the moves in a short period of time, a little bit noisy. One, remember, the fees are a fee per account. So we quoted in basis points, but they're actually charged as a fee per account and balance has moved and went down. So you get a little bit of noise of that and the timing with which the fee change gets made following a rate hike that we had at the end of the fourth quarter. So it's those two things that make it a little bit noisy. But at its core, it's the rates went up and balances went down. So those are the two things that drove that up. Okay. In terms of your production expense, the production-based bonuses was actually a bit lower than we thought and kind of flattish year on year. But I thought there was a pricing increase that supposed to flow through there that which was going to push it up. So what was the offsetting factor there? Yes, Chris. So that was the $3 million benefit that I referred to in the prepared remarks. We ended up - our 2018 payout ended up being a little bit less than we had estimated. So you see that correction or that benefit coming through in that line. Without that, it would have been an increase as you suspected due to the pricing change because it does show up in that line item. So you'll see that increase next quarter. Got it. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question is from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Your line is open. Hey, great. Good afternoon, guys. Hey, Devin. Hey. Just another one here on cash and, I guess, yield expectations. I always appreciate the outlook. If the Fed is on pause for a while, do you see room to maybe bring down the cash pay rates? Or is there something you maybe look at for certain clients of segments that are less sensitive? Yes, Devin. I think our view on pricing deposits is unchanged even if the Fed is on hold for a while, right, which is first and foremost, we always look at the competitive set and on what our competitors are paying and what make sense for that product.
I think generally when you think about our product set, especially ICA and DCA, those are largely small balances that are operational cash that are not rate sensitive. And when we think about the pricing coefficients that we talked about for a while in that 25% to 50% range, I think that's the best way to think about it. And if the Fed is not moving and the market is not moving, I wouldn't anticipate that we would be moving either. Got it. Okay. Very helpful. And then with respect to employee headcount, obviously, continues to expand. I think that's consistent with all the comments on investing, and I think that's a good thing. When you look at kind of hiring moving forward, where are you guys, I guess, really most focuses it, areas of advisor, surveys or technology or somewhere else?
And then should we think about kind of the pace of headcount expansion from here more trending with advisor headcount? Or is there still a little bit of catch-up as you're just continuing to put a lot of investment into the system right now? Yes. It's a good question. And I think to answer your first question, you would continue to see investment in the areas of technology and service in terms of human capital and that obviously is consistent and aligned with our priorities. That said, the pace of the increasing of the headcount would be, I think, a mix of both investing into opportunities, which would drive some increase in that headcount.
Though there is offset as we pull through efficiencies from some of that technology that would enable us to automate things that may have been a manual process or you began to use robotics and machine learning, et cetera., that are bigger leverage points with respect to certain of your predictable and reputable type of processes. So in that spirit, we would expect our headcount trajectory to be at a lower trajectory than our advisor headcount growth. Got it. Great. Very helpful. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask about the flows in hybrid advisor channel. Looks like the flowed have continued to slow a little bit. Just wanted to take your updated thoughts around that and expectations as we look forward from here? Yes. No, again, we're very committed to offering both the corporate and the hybrid models. We think they're important with respect to ensuring that we have the versatility to meet the different preferences of advisors out in the marketplace and continue to invest in both.
I think you actually are beginning to see strengthening and growth returning to our hybrid model, which is a combination of both the investments that we're making in the platform and system, as well as, I think, where we didn't have necessarily strategic alignment with certain clients. And as you saw that pull-through mainly through the balance of last year, you're seeing less noisier environment and our investments in our platform will, we believe, support growth going forward in that channel. Got it. Okay. And then just a follow-up question on the centrally managed assets. I think you said about $1 billion flows into that. It's a little bit below $1.5 billion to $2 billion range, and I think, we've seen in recent quarters. So I just wondering what was driving the slowdown? And what sort of actions could you take to reaccelerate that growth? Yes. So first of all, we believe the centrally managed solutions deliver meaningful value for our advisors and their clients. And so as you said, we've increased the investment in that area over the last couple of years and you've seen actually movement from outflows to inflows on our centrally managed platform, which is certainly encouraging.
In fact, in the last year, centrally managed platforms made up about 30% of our net new assets in advisory, which Q1 actually wasn't far off from that overall target - sorry, certain level of performance. So Q1 is not as big of an anomaly. I think you perhaps have other factors like just lower NNA in Q1, and so consequently the managed platforms saw some sort of correlation of adjustment there.
That said, I think we see them as an opportunity of further growth and continue to invest in them. A great example would be in April, we just introduced our advisor sleeve solution, which I referred to in my remarks. We also created a new conversion tool, which makes it simpler for advisors to move accounts to our centrally managed platforms. So we think this ongoing innovation and investment in support of those platforms will continue to drive the appeal of them and higher utilization by advisors. Great. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question is from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Hi, good afternoon. Maybe first, the asset management industry has gotten approval for the nontransparent ETFs. Maybe what are your thoughts here on broker or advisor adoption? And if it does become popular, what might this mean for LPL? Yes. So we do think that the product category likely has some future, but that evolution won't happen overnight just like any other product. I think it requires extensive diligence and education to ensure that the industry gets it right in terms of optimally serving investors. So that will take some time to work through. That said, we certainly are already a large distributor of ETFs, especially on our advisory platforms and have working relationship with these sponsors, right.
So we're actively engaged with them and how do we think through innovating around these types of solutions. And we would look at this opportunity as a similar way to work with them on making sure that we position it as an appealing opportunity for advisors to use. So we see it as an opportunity for innovation and continuing to expand the value proposition of our advisors. Thanks. And then net new advisors were up 80. How did the terrible 4Q and maybe contrasting the great 1Q influenced the recruiting? And I think you guys mentioned that the cadence of that new assets was heavily weighted toward March, kind of building from January to February to March. Is that sort of the cadence you saw in recruitment, as well as there are stories here about recruitment kind of accelerating through the quarter? Yes. So recruiting definitely accelerated through the quarter as you said. The further you got away from the volatility in December, we some more engagement in recruiting, discussions and dialogue and certainly in a more normalized environment. As I said earlier, we feel good about the work that the leadership team is doing with our recruiting and business development teams in terms of improving the efficacy of their performance.
Since we've aligned our TA with financial returns, we think those two dynamics create much more of a reputable and sustainable way to think about levels of recruiting. So I think those are the ways that, we believe, will drive our performance aside from some big swing and volatility. So I think your thinking is right. Okay, great. Thank you very much. Thank you. And this ends our Q&A session. I would like to turn the call back to Dan Arnold for his final remarks. Yes. So thank you, and thanks everyone for taking time to join us this afternoon. Just as a reminder, we are holding our Investor and Analyst Day in New York on May 22. So we look forward to speaking with you then, as we'll discuss our business in greater depth.

As we discussed last quarter at our Investor Day, we believe thoughtful strategy combined with extraordinary execution and a mission driven culture will drive long-term growth and value. Working within this framework, we delivered another quarter of solid business and financial growth.
Let's review our second quarter results starting with the drivers of our business. We continued to focus on delivering organic growth and we are encouraged by the progress in the second quarter. Net new assets were $4 billion reflecting solid performance across new store sales, same-store sales and advisor retention. This organic growth combined with higher equity markets drove total brokerage and advisory assets to $706 billion exceeding $700 billion for the first time.
Turning to our financial results, we continued to generate top-line growth as gross profit increased 11% year-over-year, while continuing to invest in the business, we stayed discipline on expenses to drive operating leverage. As a result, second quarter EPS prior to intangibles was $1.85, which was up 30% from a year ago.
Looking more broadly at the marketplace, we continue to operate in an attractive market with supported secular trends towards independence and advisory solutions. Within this context, our market intelligence and our own advisor feedback indicate the best way to position our advisors to win the marketplace is to help them enhance the value of their advice and their capacity to serve more clients. To address this opportunity and accelerate our growth, we have organized our efforts into three strategic plays, which I will speak to now.
Our strategic play involves expanding our affiliation models beyond our traditional independent and institutional model platforms. As a reminder, we are developing new advisory oriented and independent employee models, which together more than doubled the size of our addressable market. With respect to our advisory oriented models, we are approaching the market in a differentiated way that moves beyond traditional models. Our vision is to deliver an integrated solution of custodial, advisory, brokerage and practice level services that make it easier for an advisor to enter and thrive in the independent channel.
At the same time, we are further enhancing this offering by reengineering key advisory policies and workflows to drive simplicity and efficiency into the day-to-day operations of these practices. While this offering is relatively new, we are encouraged by our growing pipeline of interested advisors.
Regardless of the affiliation model, we will continue to deliver more capabilities and lower prices to help our advisors provide more value to their clients and differentiate and win in the marketplace. The secular trend towards advisory solutions and the capacity challenges that many advisors face are leading more advisors to leverage our centrally managed platforms in order to outsource time intensive investment management tasks.
That said, there is a population of advisors that wants to maintain control of portfolio construction, while also benefiting from the administrative efficiency of centrally managed platforms. In order to meet the needs of these advisors, we developed our advisor sleeve solution within our centrally managed platforms. This enables advisors to maintain control of investment models, while saving time by outsourcing the trading and rebalancing work to us.
Now, while we are in the first wave of the rollout of advisors’ sleeve with 1,500 initial advisors, we are seeing two positive trends thus far. First, we are encouraged that these initial advisors have added approximately $600 million of assets into advisors’ sleeve. Second, while historical demand for centrally managed platforms has predominantly come from the corporate platform about 30% of advisors sleeve flows are coming from hybrid advisors. Together, these early trends demonstrate that advisors appreciate the ability to retain the investment management component of their value proposition, while also achieving greater efficiency.
Let's now turn to our second strategic play where we are working to create an industry leading service experience by driving continuous improvement, investing to differentiate client works and evolving into a client care model. With respect to client works, we continue to focus on Version 2.0, which aims to provide advisors with more streamlined and intuitive experiences.
In the second quarter, we enhanced the ability for advisors to personalize key dashboards and interfaces, so they have greater flexibility to configure their systems in a manner that is most efficient for them to serve their clients. Additionally, within the new account opening process, we are simplifying workflows and more efficiently capturing the data required to open an account.
Advisors tell us that these updates have significantly increased the simplicity and speed of opening new accounts, while enhancing the on-boarding experience for their clients. Looking ahead, we will continue to focus on creating a more personalized and flexible experience for our advisors also improving their efficiency.
Our third strategic play is about establishing a new layer of value in the independent marketplace. We hear from advisors that macro challenges are making it harder for them to operate their businesses. At the same time, consumer experiences in other industries are raising client expectations. We are helping our advisors turn this challenge into an opportunity by offering them a portfolio of new services including digitized workflows, virtual services and access to capital throughout their lifecycle.
This quarter we want to highlight our efforts on our virtual CFO offering. Through a series of experiments, we found that a CFO is an important partner and makes a strong contribution to an advisor's business. But in many cases advisors do not have access to a full time CFO. As a result, we have partnered with more than 50 advisors in a pilot to innovative solution that provides CFO capabilities in an affordable way. Consequently, we have hired and trained a group of CFO to support the financial management of our advisor practices for a monthly subscription fee at a big discount to hiring a full time CFO. By delivering real-time data, insights and strategic guidance, these CFOs help manage the day-to-day finances of our advisors’ businesses, while also increasing practice value.
At the end of the day, advisors tell us their virtual CFOs are helping them achieve outcomes that include lowering their cost, moving toward a more recurring revenue model and evaluating and executing on opportunities to acquire other practices. Our virtual CFO experience is consistent with the interest we see and the approach we're taking across the full portfolio of virtual services including virtual admin, CMO and CTO.
After working over the past year to validate that the value proposition of each of these services resonates with advisors and that we can consistently execute with high quality, we are now offering these solutions more broadly to the marketplace. Our jumping off point is the 400 subscribers, we currently serve across our virtual services portfolio, which is up from 300 last quarter. We're excited about the prospects to help a growing number of advisors to better operate their practices, increase their efficiency and drive growth.
I also want to take a few moments to highlight our ongoing efforts to transform our culture, which we see as a fundamental to driving long-term growth and value.
Now as a reminder, we are taking a structured approach by instilling a client-centric mindset, logic base thinking and mission driven alignment. Over the past quarter, we completed the first half of our rollout of a new set of behavioral based values, their guiding action and decision-making in our daily work. Additionally, nearly two-thirds of our management level employees have now been through a process designed training to help us apply Lean and Six Sigma principles in our work and with our teams.
As a result of these and other efforts, our advisors continue to tell us that they see the positive changes that our cultural transformation is driving most notably in their service experience.
In summary, we're pleased to deliver another quarter of business and financial growth. We remain focused on combining strategy execution and culture to serve our advisors drive profitable growth and create long-term shareholder value.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt. Thank you, Dan and I'm glad to speak with everyone on today's call.
We had another solid quarter in Q2. We grew assets and gross profit, invested to drive growth, delivered operating leverage and return capital to shareholders. As a result, our Q2 EPS prior to intangibles was $1.85, up 30% from a year ago. We are pleased to deliver these results as we continue to execute on our strategy.
Let's now review our Q2 business results in greater depth starting with total brokerage and advisory assets. We finished the quarter at $706 billion, up 3% sequentially driven by a combination of organic growth and higher equity markets. Total net new assets for Q2 were $4 billion, which translates to 2.3% annualized growth rate. These results included $1.2 billion of outflows related to the hybrid firm we previously discussed that form their own broker-dealer and departed. Prior to those outflows, total net new assets were $5.2 billion or 3% annualized growth rate.
Additionally, our pace of growth increased throughout the quarter, with net new assets of $0.7 billion in April, $1.4 billion in May and $1.9 billion in June. As a recruiting, we had a solid quarter with $8.5 billion of recruited AUM, which brought our trailing four quarter total to over $33 billion.
We also continue to see positive mix shifts in our business in Q2. Advisory assets increased to more than 46% of total assets primarily driven by advisory inflows of $6.6 billion, our fastest pace of growth in over a year. These results included $1.2 billion of inflows in our centrally managed platforms, which are now 14% of total advisory assets.
Before moving on to our financial results, I want to provide an update on our acquisition of Allen & Company. As a reminder, they have around 30 advisors serving $3 billion in client assets and will affiliate through our new independent employee model. Since signing in May, our planning and integration work has gone well, and we now expect to close by the end of Q3, which is a quarter earlier than we originally anticipated.
As for the financial benefit, we continue to expect to reach an annual run rate EBITDA accretion of about $5 million in early 2020. I also want to share that the more time we spend with Allen & Company, the more impressed we are with their culture and a high caliber of their team. We are excited to welcome them to LPL soon.
Now, let's turn to our Q2 financial results starting with gross profit. It was $536 million down $20 million or 4% sequentially primarily driven by production base payout ramping as expected. Year-over-year gross profit increased by $53 million or 11%, primarily from higher client cash and asset-based revenues.
Looking at the components of gross profit, commission and advisory fees net of payout were $129 million in Q2 down $8 million from Q1. The decrease was driven by seasonally higher production bonus expense partially offset by higher net commission advisory fees. As we look forward to Q3, I want to remind you that our production bonus payout rate increases throughout the year. As context from Q2 to Q3 last year, the production bonus payout rate increased by about 60 basis points or 6 million.
Before moving on, I want to highlight that we updated our management P&L this quarter to help make our results easier to follow. Historically, the mark-to-market revenue and expense related to our advisor deferred compensation program was recognized in two separate lines, production expense and other revenue. While the mark-to-market movements had no net impact on our financial results, they did create large swings within those lines. Given this, we consolidated both of these items into other revenue were they now offset each other.
We believe this change will provide a clearer view of our actual production payout rate which is the metric we focus on as management. We also updated the historical management P&L file on our Web site, so you can see our past results with the same view.
Moving on to asset-based revenues, sponsor revenues were $127 million in Q2 up $4 million from Q1. The increase was primarily driven by higher average asset levels as well as continued growth on our advisory no transaction fee platforms.
Moving to client cash revenues, there were $162 million down $11 million sequentially. The decrease was primarily driven by the typical seasonal decline in client cash balances due to tax payments in April. As we move beyond tax season, cash balances grew in both May and June.
Turning to client cash yields for Q2, our ICA yield was 249 basis points roughly flat to last quarter. Looking ahead to Q3 and assuming the Fed cuts interest rates by 25 basis points next week. We would expect our ICA yield to be around 240 basis points. This assumes our deposit betas are within our expectations of 25% to 50% and no further changes in interest rates or the mix of fixed versus floating rate balances.
Let's now move on to Q2 transaction fee revenues. There were $118 million down, $4 million sequentially primarily driven by seasonally lower transaction volumes in IRA fees. Looking ahead to Q3, we expect transaction and fee revenue to be relatively in-line with Q2 as we anticipate the seasonal decline and IRA fees and transaction volumes will likely be offset by fees generated from our national advisor conference.
Now let's turn to expenses starting with core G&A. It was $211 million in Q2 in line with our spending plans for the year. Looking ahead, as we are executing well on our investment in efficiency plans so far this year, we are tightening our 2019 core G&A range by $10 million Additionally, given that we now anticipate closing our acquisition of Allen & Company in Q3, we are updating our guidance to include estimated integration, an initial operating expenses of approximately $5 million.
Taken together, we expect our 2019 core G&A to be in the range of $860 million to $875 million or an average of about $222 million per quarter for the second half of the year.
Moving on to Q2 promotional expenses there were $41 million down $10 million sequentially as the key drivers for this area, transition assistance, marketing spend, and conference expense were all down from Q1.
Looking ahead to Q3, we anticipate promotional expense will be in the low $60 million range. The increase is primarily driven by the timing of our National Advisor Conference, which occurs in Q3 each year. Additionally, June was our strongest recruiting month of the quarter, so the associated transition assistance expense will ramp in Q3.
Moving on to capital management, our balance sheet remains strong in Q2. Cash available for corporate use was just under $300 million and our credit agreement, net leverage ratio was 1.99x.
Turning to capital deployment, our priorities remain investing for organic growth first and foremost taking advantage of M&A opportunities if they arise and returning capital to shareholders. Looking at organic growth, our investments are focused on recruiting new advisors, helping the existing advisors grow and enhancing our technology.
In addition to our investments for growth, we return excess capital to shareholders in Q2. This included 125 million of share repurchases in line with our plan to complete our $1 billion authorization over roughly 2 years. We also return capital through $21 million of regular quarterly dividends in Q2.
In closing, we are pleased to have delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results. We remain focused on growing assets and gross profit, investing to drive organic growth while staying disciplined on expenses and returning excess capital to shareholders.
With that operator please open the call for questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Thanks. Good evening everyone. So, it was nice to see the stronger recruited asset balances in the quarter and also the 1% increase in advisor count before the ISP departures. But I was just wondering, if you could give us an overall update on the recruiting pipeline and have you seen activity improve this year just because when you think of how the year started with the government shutdown, it looks like it slowed the breakaway broker trend. Hey, Craig. This is Dan. Let me take that one. I think on a headline basis, I would say the results have been solid thus far. The environment for recruiting is kind of in what I might call a neutral place and then we think and are very supportive and excited about our pipeline. So, let me give you a little color on each component.
If you look at the results over the last quarter, 8.5 billion of recruited assets as Matt pointed out in his remarks, which is we think a solid outcome. And if you look across the trailing 12 months, the 33 billion that we recruited is the most we've ever achieved. And so, again, we think those are reflective of solid results.
With respect to the recruiting environment and getting to your point around what's our thinking on that post maybe some of the complexity at the beginning of the year. I think if you look at the year-to-date results, you've seen the amount of movement out in the marketplace of advisors looking or exploring a different affiliation to have been stable to slightly down. So, if you think about that sort of macro environment you might have had a little bit of reduced opportunity over the past six months, at the same time though we're seeing our competitive positioning strengthening. So, we're actually seeing and getting swings at more opportunities given those advisors that are exploring to affiliate. And so consequently, we think that's certainly driving a strong pipeline as we look forward and you would expect that pipeline to exist within our traditional models, but we're also beginning to see a build in some of these new models, we've talked about. So, we're excited as we go forward and thinking about that pipeline. Hopefully that gives us some helpful color. Thanks Dan. Thank you. Our next question is from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Hey good afternoon. So, Dan, I want to start-off just with a bigger picture question. You had another strong quarter of organic growth good business momentum. Just given the evolving macro interest rate landscape how do you feel about the strategic implications for the business and your level of confidence in the ability to sustain some of that momentum? Yes. So, maybe as we think about the macro, let's start there and then we'll pull through how we think about that. And if we don't cover all of that Stephen then you can certainly follow-up with any clarity. So, as we think about the macro, I would my kind of headline on that would be, it's pretty solid it remains of what we might call a supportive state. If then I gave you some additional color around that we typically look at that through the macro through three lens. The first, the economy, right, and I think we see continued economic growth notwithstanding I think some of the thinking as we move forward about potential headwinds there. We continue to see a good steady and economic growth at a solid pace and certainly coming along with that the low one in employment is certainly a contributor towards creating discretionary income then people can think about putting to work in terms of investments. So, economy is moving along, and we think quite supportive to the macro.
The second element is the equity markets, and again, year-to-date, I think we've seen pretty strong performance in a low volatility type of environment. So, you take the economy and that performance in the equity markets and that typically leads to what we've seen, which is pretty solid engagement from investors. And we don't necessarily see that changing as we move forward. So, we feel pretty good about the opportunity set with respect to investor engagement.
When you look at those two economic factors though as they relate to advisors, it's probably a bit more of a neutral view. Certainly, the investor engagement is creating an opportunity for advisors to focus on gathering new assets and putting those assets to work. So that's favorable, but at the same time as we talked about those types of conditions will have sometimes advisors delay looking and exploring affiliating with a new partner or thinking about their business strategically. And so consequently, when you look at those two things, they may balance each other out into more of a neutral view. So, those are two components.
Maybe with respect to the third which is interest rates. Matt maybe you want to provide some color on that. Yes, sure. I think when we think about our positioning, I think we're positioned well for a range of macro environments including I think the one that's most assumed today, which is interest rates going down. And I'd highlight a couple dynamics there. First, and I think you know this well that we've moved a fair bit of our portfolio specifically, the ICA portfolio to fixed rate balances right. We're at about 40% of fixed rate, right. So, we have less of an impact from movements in short-term rates.
And then second, I just highlight that the impact on the market when the interest rate sentiment makes its way into the equity markets. If you just look at the month of June right is really where the interest rate curve and dynamic has really solidified. You saw the equity markets and specifically the S&P go up by about 200 points. And just a reminder on how that flows through our model, every 100 point move in S&P is about $25 million annual increase in pre-tax earnings, right. And you compare that to the impact of an interest rate cut about 25 basis point interest rate cut or reduction would be about a $10 million to $20 million annual impact, right. So, if you look at June, right, the market increase more effectively offset more than the impact of two cuts. So, I think we're pretty well positioned, but if you take -- if you take that right, the natural hedges in our market, you combine that with where the balance sheet is positioned, which is in a position of strength. It really puts us in a position in a place to focus on our clients, right, to the core of your question, how does this position us for growth?
Well, being in a place to focus on our clients and what's best for them, things like investing in capabilities, investing in technology, investing and service. We feel really good about being able to do that especially when you're talking about across a range of macro environments. We're not everybody is in a position to do that. So, we feel like it could be a key differentiator to be able to drive growth over the long-term. Thank you, both for that helpful contacts. Maybe this is my follow up for you Matt. The gross profit ROA x-cash, it did decline sequentially. So, you could speak to some of the factors that drove the sequential decline and whether you're still confident and consistent with what you said at Investor Day, in your ability to maybe hold the line on that metric and possibly even deliver some expansion given increased adoption of growth in centrally managed platforms in some of the other additional services that you guys cited? Yes, sure. I mean I think we still feel good about it. We feel good about our investments in that area to drive profitable long-term growth. I think we feel good about our efforts when you look at gross profit ROA x-cash, we should look at it over the last couple of years, we've gone from a place where that was consistently declining to something that's now stable and starting to grow, right.
When you look at this quarter, I think we continue to see positive trends, right, both Dan and I talked about them in the prepared remarks, growth in advisory, growth in centrally managed, we're starting to see early signs of growth in virtual services. So, we feel good about that. I think when we look at this metric, it's probably one best viewed on a trailing 12-month basis, right, versus a quarterly one and I recognize the quarterly one is the one that we give you. But doing it that way you can have a little bit annoyed.
So, let me give you couple of examples, right. When you look at advisory fees, right, those are mostly based off the prior quarters' balances. And when you have a quarter of growth like we had especially in the last month of the quarter like we had in June, those economics are going to flow through in the following quarter, right. You have a little bit of noise there and then because it's a quarter you end up analyzing that and kind of making the noise even a little bit louder.
Similar context on the base pay out rate that can move up or down 50 basis points really for a mix. We're at the higher end of that range this quarter. And again, you annualize it. So, you get a little bit of noise there. But, I'd say just overall, I think we feel good about the results, the strategy is driving, we've got the positive mix shift that we're seeing and the improvements that are really delivering and driving the return on assets and that's what we are going to stay focused on. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. You bet. Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Katz with Citi. Okay. Thank you very much for taking the questions as well. Just going back to the big picture question, Dan. As the business continues to migrate toward advisory, and then, within that toward corporate and a greater use of centrally managed planning. What do you think the outlook is for cash as percentage of client assets? Are we -- is there a structural component here that might limit the cyclical snapback as we think longer term? And then, underneath that does that create more pressure on the underlying yield of cash over time? Yes. So, Bill, couple of thoughts. At the at the macro level, I think certainly the trends towards advisory have probably a contributory nature to them relative to overall average balances in an account. Just in terms of that allocation of the overall portfolio having an access to and maintaining some cash balances in order to -- just do maintenance on the account itself. Fees and things of that nature as well as just in terms of some of the flexibility on how you manage that portfolio is usually helpful. And that relative to brokerage would lead to a greater expectation around overall balances in cash.
Centrally managed versus rep directed, I don't think we see a big difference in the amount of cash allocated to a portfolio. So just because someone might move or migrate from a rep directed to centrally manage wouldn't necessarily expect an increase in cash balances with that transition. But, do believe from brokerage to advisory you pick up a little bit of cash.
With respect to -- then you have to remember a lot of the cash that we use and have on as part of cash balances, sorry, that our clients use is more smaller balances, its maintenance on the accounts and that's not going to vary significantly relative to how one might think about investing the securities within our portfolio construction within an account. And so, don't think that we see a lot of fluctuation and/or influence if you will around one's allocation of those assets long-term. Certainly, if you get volatility in the market and you get people adjusting quickly relative to big market swings you might see some, but that's more noise around that overall transition of assets then it really is some structural change.
So, if I summarize that, I think you would see when you move from brokerage to advisory you probably do see an increase in overall cash balances with respect to overall how one might then allocate those assets within an advisory account. We don't expect to see a whole lot of influence relative to our cash balances because the majority of ours, they're from maintenance on an account. I hope that got to the heart of your question. That's very helpful. Thank you. And then maybe one for Matt. And thanks for taking the complexity of this question. So, a two-part question for you as well. In terms of your experience and maybe the answers haven't had it. How should we think about the core deposit matter assumptions in a potentially declining rate backdrop? Some of the other retail brokers have reported earnings already have sort of suggested much higher quite a positive bears would suggest the ability to pass on a greater level of the pricing back to the consumer if you will.
Obviously, you've had less deposit rate on the upside, but I'm wondering, if there is a little bit more asymmetric benefit to you on a downside? And then any way to think about client behavior into the month of July just between engagement versus cash balances? Yes, sure. Yes. I think the deposit betas on the way up and down. In our view is 25% to 50% is the right range. You can always have a wide range across different firms on individual moves, but I think at a high level we think 25% to 50% is where it was on the way up and we were closer to the low-end of that range and I think that that same logic would apply in our view on the way down.
With respect to July, I think what we've seen so far in July is really stability versus where the balances were in June. First month of every quarter, we always have the advisor fees that come out and reduce cash and we've seen that offset with some inflows and kind of we're net neutral to where we ended in June. That's helpful. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Hey guys. How is everybody doing? Question around Allen & Co. just maybe now that you guys seems like the deal is about to close a little bit sooner. I'm just curious to get your thoughts around. Similar type of deals going forward to kind of help you expand in this sort of newer employee base channel? And then, maybe you could remind us how the economics in that channel would work relative to the installed book? So, any sort of metrics around maybe like EBIT, ROA or something like that would be helpful just to kind of contextualize what this could mean for you guys over time? Yes. Let me take the first part of that, Alex, and then that you can follow-up on the question around the economics. So, I think with respect to the M&A environment, I would take you right back to our strategy as you know, and we certainly look at that opportunity as a complement to first and foremost our focus on organic growth. And with respect then to where we would tend to explore possibilities and opportunities, I think there are couple of transactions we've done in the last six months are a good reflection of that. You see it with respect to enhancing or accelerating the development of our capabilities into advisory world would be a good example of that.
And then, certain Allen & Co. is one that is a transaction born out of the growth opportunities associated with it. And we continue to be active in the marketplace looking across both of those landscapes for opportunities that would certainly help to drive out our strategy. And of course, as you all have heard us say many times over, the rigor around which we will look at those opportunities, they've got to be strategically operationally and financially aligned. And so, hopefully that gives you the color in terms of just how, a) We think about that M&A, and then, b) We are active in the marketplace looking for opportunities in either one of those categories. Yes. And then, I'll take the second part of your question, I think when we think about the economics kind of building on how we talked about this a little bit at Investor Day. I think as a general principle on premise right the more services we provide or the more that we do on behalf of our advisors that the higher the ROAs would be. And I think specific to this model, the ROAs you think would be much higher on the expenses to support them as their employers would also be higher. I think directionally even that we would anticipate would be a little bit better and if they were not an employee we're providing less services.
That being said, it's going to be impacted like any of our advisors would be by mix of brokerage versus advisory and things like that. So, I think as these come on to our platform and as we hopefully are able to build these opportunities more and more we'll get more specific on that. But, hopefully that helps to directionally. Got it. That's helpful. And then, one more specific question just kind of around the quarter and the outlook. So promotional expense, feels like it was lighter this quarter than normally despite the fact that you guys had quite a robust quarter of recruiting activity. I understand some of that happened later in June, but it was quite solid over the last couple of quarters now. So maybe help us understand really the drivers behind the ramp from kind of low $40 million to $60 million next quarter. And then just bigger picture, how do you guys think about promotion expense for the year and kind of year-over-year growth maybe beyond that? Thanks. Yes, sure. I think just to give a little bit more color on the quarter, right. The items within promotional expense are areas that can naturally move around in any given quarter, right. So, if you go through each of them transition assistance being the most notable one. We had a stronger recruiting quarter this quarter than last quarter and I would just emphasize that the strongest month within the quarter was June. So, you see that transition assistance really pick up next quarter.
The second is marketing, right. Marketing is an item by its nature that can move around a lot in an individual quarter and this quarter is just a little bit lower than what we typically see. And then, third conferences, right. We've got three major conferences that we usually talk about all of you on calls like this, but we run more than 30 overall, right. So, there can be individual things that happen in a quarter and for this quarter it's just the conference spend was a little bit lower.
So, when you take each of those items and you look to next quarter, the biggest driver really is our National Advisor Conference that can be up to $15 million of expense that we talk through each year. That's the primary driver, but you also have transition assistance that will ramp in marketing that will seasonally as we get into the second half of the year will typically pick up especially in Q4.
So those are the drivers, I mean I think the second part of your question asks on where transition assistance goes? I mean it's really tied to recruiting and I think we -- as Dan highlighted and I think the first question of the call I think we feel good about the pipeline. I just wouldn't get more specific than that other than to say promotional is really going to trend with recruiting. Noting there can be quarterly quarter noise depending on which months the recruiting happens in right. Great. All right. Thanks very much. Sure. Thank you. And our next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Thanks. Hey guys. So, you're at 3% organic asset growth excluding IFP. I'm wondering if you guys can share your thoughts about how you feel that growth rate compares to the independent channel more broadly? So, Chris, this is Dan. I hate to speculate because I don't have visibility into exact results or outcomes from the independent channel more broadly. That said, I think as we think about it there's three key drivers to organic growth. One is new store sales or how are we doing from a recruiting standpoint relative to others. And based on the public data that we can see and then certainly from our own insight and feedback and perspective from the industry, we think that we've got strong momentum there. And we've got some outperformance on a relative basis from a recruiting standpoint from a retention standpoint. I think in the 96% range including IFP, x that 97%, we think again that that tends to be a pretty strong performance on a relative basis.
Same-store sales are a little tougher a little harder to measure and see relative to others and a little bit tougher to get feedback and insight into what's exactly occurring. So, I can't speak to that one. And then, finally, on product mix which is also a contributor, I think we've got nice trends relative to the trend towards advisory using the corporate ROAs centrally managed. And I think we're seeing that type of trend in other places and so I think that's probably consistent relative to what we're seeing in other areas. So those are the -- maybe some of the drivers of the overall contributors to organic growth, maybe just give you a sense of a quick down on how we think about that. I'm not sure, if I answered your question though. You did. Appreciate that. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Great. Good afternoon guys. Good afternoon. I guess first question here just -- love to get some thoughts on your views of a private equity activity in the space. Clearly, it's picked up quite a bit over the past year and I'm just curious is that a good thing for LPL, is it raising the bar competitively for talent or capabilities? And that's kind of part one. The other part is, I would think that recruiting opportunities could be pretty material as a result of that to the extent any of these PE backed firms actually look to integrate some of the brokerages, which would create some breakage, I would think so. Just would love to kind of think through give that effect as it seems like it could have some puts and takes, but maybe be beneficial to the firm? Maybe some thoughts just on some of the principles that you raised. Regardless of maybe perhaps who the buyer is, I think couple of things anytime you have a change in ownership that creates some questions and some uncertainty about the future that tends to lead to an increase in advisors exploring what their options are. And as you say, if there evolves some sort of consolidation, when they're actually going to have to go through some work to make that transition well that will be that increases the percentage that look around materially. And so, no doubt, some of the just change in ownership all the way down to then the consolidating activity that may occur creates a recruiting opportunity. It also creates that complementary M&A activity that we talked about as well.
So, I think you're sort of assumptions or hypothesis there is spot on. Relative to the new owner, and then, they think about the business in the future. I think you've got a click down and look at the structure of the transaction itself, how much leverage are they using? How much leverage does that really then allow free cash flow to be created in the model? That then allows for the ability to invest back in the model. One may want to but if they can't create the cash flow necessary to do it, it creates complexity and even that aspiration or desire.
And then I also think you've got to look at what their view is from a timing standpoint and if their view is not a long-term one, but a short one, shorter term one, does that influence how they think about investing in that model and ultimately how they encourage leadership around that model. So, that may speak to a bit around a deal structure which is a knock-on effect to the actual activity on the front-end. Then you have the ability to invest in the model supported and the desire to do it on a go forward basis, which obviously would have influence on an advisor's experience and how they might think about the appeal of that particular model.
And then, maybe your final point around talent. I think it's interesting to see the transition of talent out in the marketplace. And I'm not so sure that the buyer themselves is a big driver of the future of that talent. There are expectations around the talent or who they might even think is the right profile to lead. I think those are really fair questions. We think there is a big transformation going on in terms of the talent that is necessary to drive success going forward.
We think the bar is much, much higher and you have to be much more thoughtful about that talent their capabilities and how you ultimately go attract them and then position them to contribute going forward. It's more complex than it used to be and sometimes actually this consolidation or transition of ownership can actually be quite disruptive to ever getting some continuity around building a leadership team that's going to evolve and grow and work as a team and attract the right types of capabilities whether that's inside this industry or outside.
So, I think that's how I think about the leadership of it probably not so much as who but is it disruptive to the ultimate building of a team that has great continuity and can lead the type of performance in a more complex world. I hope that answered your question. It did. Appreciate all that perspective. And just a quick follow-up, it looks like you guys had your best mutual fund sales-based commission quarter since 2016, that seems to be going all of a different direction than what we're seeing is some of the peers. I'm just curious what's driving that and whether that's just a blip, or if there's something else going on with that maybe go on in a different direction. I may answer that more broadly rather than just specifically around mutual funds. I do think you saw some quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year lift in overall brokerage sales. You'll look to mutual funds, you actually look at variable annuities are kind of an interesting place to peel back. I think when you look at that particular product category you had some product innovation going on at the end of the year where living benefits were enhanced in much of the spectrum of variable annuity offerings, which certainly make them more appealing to end investors.
You couple that with a little bit of clarity around Reg-BI and the regulatory environment around brokerage products in general. We're making investments to enhance the overall think about new account opening process in our systems and how we manage brokerage products, which we also think will help advisors then have more proclivity to use these solutions right. You take some of the friction out both from the regulatory uncertainty and operational processes. You package that with a bit of product innovation and you know I think it's encouraging to see it both inside this quarter, but also may create a platform to see some of that trend going forward. That's our hypothesis. I think it's logical we've got to see that play out, but that's how we're thinking about the sort of the commission sales or brokerage sales more broadly. Interesting, okay. Appreciate that. Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up on some of the color you mentioned earlier around the advisor recruitment pipeline. Just hoping to dig in there a little bit more and just understand how that pipeline stacks up versus like last quarter and a year ago. And if you could talk a little bit about where you find yourselves recruiting from these days, which channels you're seeing the most traction on recruitment and how that sort of channel mix has evolved over the past couple of years? Yes. So, there's a lot there. If I don't get it all, please just ask for clarity in the follow-on. So, I think look as we think about the recruiting pipeline and kind of the strength of it. There's two things that we continue to do is make sure we're competitively positioned with an appealing solution in the investments that we're making in our capability set we believe or helping us create a more appealing solution to attract more advisors and increase our pace of recruiting.
We've also been working hard to re-engineer, retool, our own capabilities around recruiting and materially change how we do that, thus to improve our own performance. You put those two things together and one within hypothesize or believe you've got the tools or the makings to continue to increase your recruiting capabilities as you go forward and that's exactly what we're trying to do.
And so, I talked about the 33 billion of trailing 12 recruited assets over the last year. We look at that and say okay, what do we do with those two things, I just mentioned to continue to try to increase or enhance that. And we challenge ourselves then to build pipelines that will help us do that. And so, we kind of think about our pipeline when we think about and we say that it looks pretty good. I think it reflects kind of that pace of recruiting that you see us doing now.
With respect to the characterization of the recruiting of the mix. I think we continue to see real strength in recruiting from the independent space as we invest in capabilities and further differentiate ourselves relative to independents. We think we've got an interesting appealing option in alternative that continues to fuel progress relative to our recruiting on the independent front.
There's some changes that we're making whether that be new models or enhanced capabilities that are intended to help us increase our participation in recruiting from employee-based models. And we're beginning as I mentioned earlier to see the pipeline build in some of our new models. And that's encouraging to see as a complement to our traditional models.
So maybe that gives you a little feel for where we're where recruiting from and also probably reflects how you should think about the pipeline and its makeup. I think I got everything. Yes, go ahead. I was just going to ask maybe just as a follow-on question around the advisor recruiting packages, just any color you could share in terms of how that is evolving and how that compares with others in the industry. I guess how much more attractive do you see your packages today versus others how that's evolving? And as you look forward given expectations for a falling rate environment late economic cycle, how do you expect these sort of packages to evolve? Yes. I think on principle, we take a returns-based focus on how we think about these packages right. We look at it as capital we're investing to drive organic growth. And we take a return to base construct a principle of which to shape that. That said let me let Matt give you the color as his group is involved in it on a daily basis in collaboration with our business development team. Yes, sure. I mean I think Michael we take as Dan said, we take a returns-based approach. We're pretty conservative. We don't assume a benefit from the macro. I think when you take the packages that we offer with those models, I think they're quite competitive in the marketplace.
And then I think when you start to think through the macro impact on that, I would just emphasize that the natural hedges in our model, right, those same hedges show up in the economics at an individual advisor level, right. So, our model is well positioned to withstand and has natural offsets to volatility in the macro. So, if you combine that with being fairly conservative and disciplined on the underwriting and you put those two things together, I think we make offers that we want to be able to be consistently in the market offering at levels that drive returns for our shareholders. Great. Thank you. Sure. Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Shutler with William Blair. Hey guys. Good afternoon. Couple on the ICA portfolio. So, Matt, how much of the ICA portfolio comes up for renewal in 2020 and could be fixed if you wanted it to be. And then, with the yield curve where is that. How does that change, how much of the ICA you would want to move to a fixed rate structure? Yes. Chris, I'm taking the second question, first, right. I think when we think about our goal for moving balances into fixed, it is really about enhancing the stability of our earnings and really kind of supporting that strong balance sheet objective, right. So, I think where the rate curve is really doesn't change that goal. And I think it does reduce and have less focus on any near-term tactical opportunities like -- if you were to focus on renegotiating an existing contract, right, in a steep yield curve that may be interesting versus with the one that we're in maybe not.
So, I think when you go back to the goal that I think is unchanged that we're focused on move into that 50% to 75% range, right. So that's unchanged, I think from an opportunity standpoint. As we've said in the past, there's no opportunities in 2019, the next ones are in 2020. And I think if you remember we walked through it in Investor Day, which really hasn't changed. But if you -- if we took every contract that matured in 2020 and move those into fixed, right, that can get us into that kind of midpoint of that range of 50% to 75%. So probably pretty easy to tell you to do the math and balances off of that. All right. Thank you. Sure. Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Allen with Compass Point. Evening guys. Got couple of quick numbers questions. Just want to ask on the advisory revenues that's mostly based off the prior period and asset levels, those are below 11% sequentially last quarter. This quarter the advisory fee revenues grew about 6%, so I'm just wondering if there's something else underneath the surface there, or if not, maybe less than a 100%. So, just a little bit of a disconnect between the two. Okay. Chris, it's the primary drivers just the timing right or it's not a 100% of the advisory assets are based on the prior quarter. There's portions that price throughout the quarter just the majority of them price at the beginning of the quarter, at the end of the last quarter. So, it's just noise from that. When you look at the growth from market growth, it again just emphasizing the asset levels from a market standpoint really grew in the month of June. So, you really don't see much of an impact of that. And that coupled with the M&A those are the key drivers. So, it's just the timing noise that's out there. Understood. Just two quick ones. Just other revenues now the kind of the payout adjustment there, is 10.7 million a good run rate to think about moving forward or anything any seasonality think about within that line? And also, the tax rate what's a good tax rate to assume moving forward? Yes. The tax rate we expect in the 27% to 29% range. I think you've seen us hover a bit below that the past couple quarters including this quarter and that was really driven from the tax benefits from stock-based compensation where usually see if you're going to get a benefit for that, it's usually around the time that things vest which is usually in the first half of the year. So, I think that's why you saw that.
I think when the other line item, I think you're looking at the GAAP P&L on Page 6 of the release, I think that's a relatively stable line. I'd encourage you look at the management P&L on Slide 8, we kind of combine that interesting come in there. And the interest income line items probably the one that might move a little bit more and that's just driven by the returns on our corporate cash combined with any balance sheet lending we do most notably margin in the broker dealer. So those would be the two things that would drive that. Both of those are relatively minor, so that's when you think about our P&L that we don't anticipate that line being that volatile. But, if it did move, it would be based on the drivers, I just highlighted. Got it. Thanks guys. Thank you. And our next question is from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe first financial planning software, we're seeing a land grab for those sort of financial planning software assets. So, maybe just start talk about your capabilities here. Are you seeing demand for greater or more sophisticated or better financial planning software? And then, maybe Schwab has launched a subscription model for financial planning. Does it differentiate a pricing model like subscription makes sense for LPL either here in financial planning or maybe elsewhere in the business? Yes. Ken, its Dan. Maybe your first one with respect to the financial planning solutions. We do think it's an important component of the value proposition of advisors starting with a planning orientation gives you a big context of which to create and add value over the long-term relationship with clients. We do think it's important. And we want to make sure that we can enable our advisors to simply and easily leverage and use that capability across the spectrum of their clients and 95% of the clients that we would see a more simplified needs-based tool that understands someone's risk profiles or goals and objectives and helps them specifically try to solve something.
For example, retirement or making a big purchase or something like that is going to be the right tool and the adequate tool. And I think we think it's really important that integration into your workflow simplicity and the access to that information sharing data with a solution and providing that free of charge are the keys of which to drive that type of utilization and give your advisor base a big leverage point there. And so, I think that's how you should think about 95% of the opportunities. Certainly, where you have more of what I might call the high net worth plus client, you need more complex planning. We use Wealth Vision which is a fully integrated version of eMoney and give our advisors access to that that they have to pay. They pay a subscription fee to have access to, but it is certainly a tool that as you know is well known in the space and in the industry and is a good leverage point for those high net worth plus clients.
So, what we've tried to do is give a full spectrum of different tools and capabilities to our advisors depending on the complexity of their client. And so that they can have a tool that can, a) Solve the problems of their client needs and do it really efficiently and cost effectively. And so that was the first part of your question, sorry, remind me the second one. Just seeing demand for more sophisticated financial planning software, you kind of touched on that, and then the subscription model? Yes. Thanks. And with respect to the subscription model, I think it's interesting. I'm not sure exactly how that plays out. In some cases, we have folks that use subscription models today relative to their planning value that they offer. As an example, with respect to an overarching relationship, because it's an interesting concept, we continue to assess it, look at it and really understand. Are you doing it as a way to level out fees across a relationship, or are you doing it to create some sort of differentiated experience. I'm not sure yet, if we've got a full viewer read on that. But I do think it's important that you position yourself with the flexibility to offer whether that be asset based whether that be commissions based or whether that be subscription based that you empower your advisors to position themselves to offer whatever makes the most sense for their value proposition in the marketplace. Okay. Great. Thank you. And then, just recruited assets number you're highlighting continues to look pretty good. Do you guys have a success rate there on the recruited assets like I assume there's some leakage when assets come over and do you measure yourself against any sort of leakage and is that leakage -- where might that leakage stand, and is the leakage getting sort of better or worse over time? Is that with respect to do, you mean in the recruiting process? So, you might have x amount of leads and how many do you close, or do you mean once you've onboarded them? Once you've onboarded them and there's a book of business that that they have that you would expect to come over from that point that's where I would assume that there is some leakage that they'll come over. They've got a certain amount of assets, but not all the assets sort of make it over. So, as we think about your recruited number, I assume that's sort of what you would hope to come over. But maybe it doesn't all come over if I'm thinking about the concept, correctly, but I could be wrong and maybe it all comes over. But if it's not, how should we think about leakage? Got it. Thanks for the clarification. You want to start with that Matt. Yes, sure. So, Ken just on the metric, I think that -- we factor in the amount that we think is going to come over into that metric, right. So, each recruit is not going to be exactly that number, some could be better, some could be a little bit worse. But the leakage as you described is already factored into that metric. Okay. Okay. Fair enough. Thank you very much. And thank you. This concludes our Q&A session. I would like to turn the call back to Dan Arnold for his final remarks. Thank you, operator and thanks everyone for taking the time to join us this afternoon and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Have a great day. And thank you ladies and gentlemen for participating in today's conference.

Joining the call today are our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dan Arnold; and Chief Financial Officer, Matt Audette. Dan and Matt will offer introductory remarks and then the call will be opened for questions. The company will appreciate if analysts will limit themselves to one question and one follow-up each. The Company has posted its earnings press release and supplementary information on the Investor Relations section of the company's website, investor.lpl.com.
Today's call will include forward-looking statements, including statements about LPL Financial's future financial and operating results, outlook, business strategies and plans, as well as other opportunities and potential risks that management foresees. Such forward-looking statements reflect management's current estimates or beliefs and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially.
The company refers listeners to the Safe Harbor disclosures contained under the caption Forward-Looking Statements in the earnings press release, as well as the company's latest SEC filings to appreciate those important factors that may cause actual financial or operating results or the timing of matters to differ from those contemplated in such forward-looking statements.
During the call, the company will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures governed by SEC Regulation G. For a reconciliation of such non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP figures, please refer to the company's earnings release, which can be found at investor.lpl.com.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Arnold. Thank you, Sherry, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. As we discussed each quarter, we believe it's awful combined with extraordinary execution and a mission-driven culture will drive long-term growth and value. Working within this framework, we delivered another quarter of solid business and financial growth.
Let's start with the review of the drivers of our business. We continue to focus on delivering organic growth, and are encouraged by the progress in the third quarter. The strength in new store sales and advisor retention, as well as solid same-store sales drove organic net new assets of $7 billion, which translates to a 4% annualized growth rate.
We also closed on our acquisition of Allen & Company, which added another $3 billion of assets that will transfer on to our platform later this year. The assets from organic growth and Allen & Company combined with the higher equity markets drove total brokerage and advisory assets to $719 billion, up 6% from a year ago.
Turning to our financial results, we had another quarter of solid topline growth as gross profit increased 10% year-over-year. We also continued to invest in the business, while staying disciplined on expenses to drive operating leverage.
As a result, third quarter EPS prior to intangibles was $1.71, which was up 30% from a year ago. Looking more broadly at the marketplace, we continue to operate in a large and growing market with favorable secular trends towards independence and advisory solutions.
In terms of the economic backdrop, while we see marketing sentiment driving volatility, many of the core drivers of the economy such as unemployment and wages remains solid and supportive of economic growth and investor engagement. So while we remain flexible in the event of changes in the macro environment, the strength of our balance sheet and of our business model positions us well to continue investing to drive organic growth.
With that in mind, we thought it would be helpful to use our strategic framework to provide some color on where we're investing and the benefits will look to derive as a result.
Our first strategic play involves winning in our traditional independent and institutional markets, while also expanding our affiliation models. With respect to our traditional markets, our business development team continues to innovate by reinvigorating recruiting partnerships with branches and third-party recruiters, enhancing referral programs for our advisors and finally, leveraging data and analytics to increase pipeline transparency, as well as to improve execution in sales and transitions.
As a result, we're generating more leads, winning at higher rates and onboarding assets more quickly. We see this reflected in our recruited AUM as our trailing 12-month total exceeded $30 billion for the third straight quarter.
Looking ahead to Q4, we continue to be encouraged by our pipeline and expanding capabilities and efficacy of our business development team. In addition to our business development efforts, adding differentiated capabilities is also one of the best ways to attract new advisors and to help existing advisors grow their business.
In that spirit, as consumer expectations evolved to increase omni-channel customized and personalized interactions, we aim to deliver an enhanced digital investor experience that will help our advisors win in the marketplace. As a part of that effort, this quarter we're rolling out a new mobile app for our advisors clients. This digital experience allows investors to customize and personalize the display of their account information to match their preferences. It is also integrated with our client goals functionality. So investors can measure progress related to their goals in real time.
Next year, we'll roll out version 2.0 that provides a more comprehensive view of clients' wealth through the aggregation of outside assets and offers enhanced client self-service capabilities. In the short run, this overall effort will enhance investor experience with deeper connections and more frequent interactions; longer-term, we see the potential to create a competitively differentiated experience that is modeled after digital innovators from outside our industry and positions our advisors to increase client loyalty, attract new clients and increase share wallet.
Let's now turn to our second strategic play, where we're working to create an industry-leading service experience by continuing to invest in ClientWorks and transforming our service model into a client care model. With respect to ClientWorks, we're focused on increasing the personalization and flexibility of the system to enhance our advisors’ service experience and help them gain efficiency in their practices.
As part of these efforts, last quarter, we introduced a new library of applications. Much like consumers use the iPhone app store, advisors can now choose applications from the library, add them to their ClientWorks pages and arrange them in ways that align how they run their practice. For example, one of the new applications offers advisors our real-time view of key practice data and analytics that provided at a glance insights for managing and growing their practice.
More broadly, advisors tell us that the additional ability to customize and personalize ClientWorks is enhancing their service experience and efficiency. As we develop our new client care model, one of the opportunities we see is expanding our digital capabilities. As part of these efforts, over the past six months, we experimented with artificial intelligence to machine learning in our new accounts organization by launching our first set of robots into our environment.
We're seeing early benefits in form of streamlining the process and expediting the time it takes to activate an account once it's been open, while our current process can take 24 hours to activate an account, the bots are enabling straight through processing to activate accounts in minutes. These initial experiments are triggering further exploration across the enterprise in an effort to more broadly apply the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning to enhance the client experience and the scalability of our model.
Our third strategic play leads us to reimagine the support offered to advisors in the independent model. In this play, we're focused on helping advisors more efficiently and effectively operate and grow their businesses by providing outsourced business services, digitized workflows, advisor focused capital solutions and lead generation.
Let me highlight our progress in one of these areas, outsourced business services. Now through a series of experiments, we determined that areas of expertise such as admin, marketing, CSO, and technology services are valuable leverage points for our advisors in running their business.
We then piloted these services over the past year to ensure that we could deliver them with high quality at an affordable price and make them easy to use. After completing the pilots in August, we rebranded this portfolio of services as LPL business solutions and officially rolled them out to our advisors at our national sales conference to illustrate the power and potential of these solutions.
I want to share a story of one of our advisors, Jim Miller and his practices based in Charlottesville, Virginia with $100 million of assets and he aspires to grow his business without compromising his client's experience. That led Jim to initially seek help through our CFO Solution. Through this partnership, his CFO helped him develop up a new pricing strategy, build a segmented client service model and identified better ways to manage his expenses.
Now Jim describes his CFO is one of the best resources he has ever had and thinks of her as a member of his management team. As a result of his experience with the CFO, Jim is now using our admin and marketing solutions as well.
Looking more broadly across our Business Solutions portfolio, we currently have over 600 subscribers and we're excited to help many more advisors like Jim that are operating practices, increase their efficiency and drive their growth.
In summary, we're pleased to deliver another quarter of business and financial growth. We remain focused on combining strategy, execution and culture to serve our advisors, drive profitable growth and create long-term shareholder value.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt. Thank you, Dan. And I'm glad to speak with everyone on today's call. As we review our Q3 results, we thought it would be helpful at first work through our framework for delivering long-term shareholder value, which is comprised of four objectives; growing assets organically and with complementary M&A; increase in our gross profit return on assets by expanding our services; investing to drive organic growth while staying disciplined on expenses; and returning excess capital to shareholders.
Taking a step back and looking at our Q3 results through this lens, we made progress in all four areas. We delivered the highest quarter of organic growth in our history and closed on our acquisition of Allen & Company, all while investing to drive growth and returning excess capital to shareholders. We're pleased with this progress as we work to generate long-term shareholder value.
Now let's review our Q3 results in greater depth, starting with EPS prior to intangibles, which was $1.71, up 30% from a year ago. Turning to total brokerage and advisory assets, we finished the quarter at $719 billion, up 2% sequentially. This increase was primarily driven by our organic growth, as net new assets were $7 billion or a 4% annualized growth rate.
We also added another $2.9 billion in net new assets from our acquisition of Allen & Company. We continue to expect to transfer these assets on to our platform by the end of the year and add roughly $5 million of run rate EBITDA by early 2020. As for recruiting, we had another solid quarter with $8.7 billion of recruited AUM in Q3 and $33 billion over the past year.
Looking at our business mix, we continue to see positive trends this quarter. Advisory assets increased to 47% of total assets, primarily driven by advisory inflows of $8.2 billion or at 10% annualized growth rate. Within our advisory platform, essentially managed net new assets were $1.9 billion or 17% annualized growth rate. This included greater use of our advisor sleeve capability, which we rolled out in Q2 and now has over $1 billion in assets.
Now let's move to our Q3 financial results, starting with gross profit. It was $543 million, up $7 million or 1% sequentially. The increase was primarily driven by higher advisory, sponsor and transaction and fee revenues, partially offset by the seasonal increase in production-based payout.
Year-over-year, gross profit increased by $49 million or 10%, primarily from organic growth and higher client cash revenues. These results contributed to our gross profit return on assets of 31.4 basis points over the last four quarters, which was up 0.3 basis points sequentially.
Looking at the components of gross profit, commission and advisory fees net of payout were $132 million in Q3, up $3 million from Q2. The increase was primarily driven by higher advisory fees, partially offset by seasonally higher production bonus expense.
Moving on to asset-based revenues. Sponsor revenues were $130 million in Q3, up $3 million or 2% sequentially, driven by the growth in average asset levels and greater usage of our no transaction fee mutual fund platforms. Turning to client cash revenues, they were $163 million, up slightly from Q2 as higher client cash balances more than offset the decline in short-term interest rates.
Moving to client cash yields. Our Q3 ICA yield was 241 basis points, down 8 basis points sequentially. The decline was primarily driven by lower average short-term rates following the fed rate cuts in July and September.
Looking ahead to Q4, we'll have the full quarter impact of the two fed rate cuts in Q3. Additionally, it is widely accepted that the fed will lower rates by another 25 basis points next week. If this occurs, we would expect our Q4 ICA yield to be in the low 220 basis point range. This assumes our client deposit beta continue to be within our expectations of 25% to 50% and no further changes in interest rates or the mix of or fixed versus floating rate balances.
Let's now move on to Q3 transaction fee revenues. They were $121 million, up $3 million sequentially. The increase was primarily driven by our national sales conference in August, partially offset by seasonally lower transaction volumes and IRA fees. Looking ahead to Q4, we do not have any large advisor conferences, so we expect a $5 million decline in confidence revenue.
Moving to interest income and other revenues, there were $14 million in Q3, down $2 million sequentially. These revenues are primarily driven by the interest we earn on our corporate cash balances as well as client margin balances. Looking forward to Q4, we anticipate they will decline by roughly $2 million, primarily driven by lower interest rates.
Now let's turn to expenses, starting with core G&A. It was $215 million in Q3, up $5 million sequentially as we continued our planned investments in technology and service to drive long-term growth. As we look ahead to Q4, we feel good about the balance of our investing plans and the related efficiencies we're delivering. As a result, we're lowering the top end of our 2019 core G&A range by $5 million, bringing our outlook to a range of $860 million to $870 million.
As we look forward to 2020, I wanted to share some context in how we're thinking about investing for growth. Over the last few years, we have increased our investments and we're seeing positive results, including increasing levels of organic growth. Given this, we plan to continue growing our investments in 2020 at a similar pace to our growth rate in 2019. As we think about the mix of that growth, we'll likely maintain our technology spend in the $150 million range, while slightly increasing our core G&A growth rate.
We will of course, remain dynamic for changes in the macro environment. But based on what we see today, we're excited about our opportunities to invest. We look forward to sharing more specific outlook with you after we finalize our plans later this year.
Moving onto Q3 promotional expenses. They were $62 million, up $20 million sequentially, driven by our national sales conference as well as higher transition assistance and marketing expense. Looking ahead to Q4, we anticipate promotional expense to decrease to the low $50 million range, as we have no major conferences in Q4.
Moving on to capital management. Our balance sheet remains strong in Q3. The cash available for corporate use was $227 million and our credit agreement net leverage ratio was 2.0 times. Turning to capital deployment. Our priorities remain investing for organic growth first and foremost. Taking advantage of M&A opportunities when appropriate and returning capital to shareholders.
Looking at organic growth, our investments are focused on recruiting new advisors, helping existing advisors grow and enhancing our technology. In addition to our investments for growth, we returned excess capital to shareholders in Q3. This included $130 million of share repurchases, roughly in line with our plan to complete our $1 billion authorization over two years. We also returned capital through $20 million of regular quarterly dividends in Q3.
In closing, we're pleased to have delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results. We remain focused on growing assets, increasing our gross profit return on assets, investing to drive organic growth, while staying disciplined on expenses and returning excess capital to shareholders.
With that, operator, please open the call for questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bill Katz with Citi. Okay. Thank you very much for taking my question this evening. And may be start off Dan, you sort of kicked off net new asset growth and certainly nice to see that hitting mid-single digit level particularly given some of the mix macro backdrop underneath that.
So I appreciate you still laying that two or three initiatives, I just looked out over the next 12 to 24 months, which of these probably had the most impact in driving the net new growth, and then underneath that is there still going to be more in the advisory side? Yeah. So thanks, Bill. Good question. Yeah, so with respect to organic growth, as I think we both reinforced in our remarks, it's a big priority for us and we're encouraged by the progress we've made over the last couple of years. But we absolutely have a focus and an aspiration to grow the results from here.
I think when we think about that approach, we kind of look at it over three fronts, you've got new store sales, same-store sales and retention. And with respect to new store sales, we've got good momentum there. I think it has – we mentioned, if you look back over the past 12 months, we've recruited roughly $33 billion of assets.
If we went back to at this time last year and looked at trailing 12 months from that period, you would have only seen about $26 billion of recruited assets, so that just reinforces I think the trajectory and the momentum we have.
I think going forward the build on those results, I would think about primarily two to three. One, we're focused on continuing to invest and enhance the efficacy of our own business development capabilities that way we win higher rates. Two, we continue to invest in capabilities that help our advisors differentiate and that helps us attract more advisors; and then finally, as we expand and add these new affiliation models that helps us broaden our market opportunity. So those are the, kind of, the drivers of what I would call new stores sales.
I think second thing, if you move to retention, that's been an interesting positive trend over the last two years where we've actually improved our retention about 1.5%. It steadily improved throughout 2019. And in fact, this past quarter, it's the best it's been over that period of time.
And so again encouraged about our progress we're making there and that strategic play where we're focused on delivering an industry-leading client experience, we think is the key to continuing to improve retention, and I think we can continue to enhance where we are today through investing in ClientWorks and developing this new service model that I referenced.
And then finally, same-store sales, I think that's been steady and a narrow range over the last couple of years and we're really challenging ourselves to rethink and innovate there and that's what our third strategic play is all about, which is really challenging us to deliver some new capabilities, think about helping advisors, digitize the practice these business solutions that we talked about, capital allocation programs for advisors and even beginning to innovate around lead generation all are meant to support same-store sales more systemically. So those are the sort of the oars we have in the water that are trying to ultimately drive that number up from where it is today. I hope that answers your question. That's helpful. And then maybe one for Matt, just a follow-up, little bit of long winded questions, I apologize. So as I look at the supplement and I look at the decomposition of the gross profit ROA. And I strip out the impact of client cash that ratio has been about flatten out number of quarters.
So on the one hand, I hear the good growth, the pickup in some of the gross profit ROA dynamics underneath that, but then I also hear a lot of spending going on, so maybe two-part question, what gets the gross profit ROA to move up all else being equal, and then how much flex do have against that incremental spend as you look out for next year if the revenue backdrop and some to be little bit weaker than maybe what you are cost for. Sure, Bill. So then on the gross profit, I mean, I just emphasize when you look at the ROA overall, it is growing, right, at 31.4 basis points up from 31.1 and you're right that growth has been on the cash side, but I just keep in mind that cash growth has not -- doesn't come just from increases in short-term interest rates.
When you look at the couple of things I would highlight when we think about the shift from brokerage to advisory and we have higher returns on the advisory side, a lot of that is from the cash balances where you tend to have higher cash on the advisory side.
I'd also highlighted the fixed rate balances, so we're getting to a lot more and much stable place for returns and that shows up in that cash line. So, it's not subject to the short-term rate movements. So I would just keep that in mind.
When you do look at that subtotal, below cash as you highlighted, I highlighted couple of things, just look at quarter-over-quarter was down 0.1 basis points, and that was really from the transaction fees line, which is not an AUM baseline, right, transactions are based from activity, the fees are really based on advisor account.
So, from our standpoint you take a step back, I mean, we feel good about the results of the strategy is driving, right? And Dan just covered a lot of it as well answering the first question from things like the growth in advisory, the growth we saw the past three years and especially this quarter and centrally managed, and that early results we're seeing on the business solutions side.
I think just continued focus and success on those over time. I think what really serves our advisors well and help them grow and we serve them well, and they grow, we grow. So, I think that's how we think about that. That's really what underpins the investment plans that I walked through in the prepared remarks for 2020.
And I think when we think about it the macros in a more challenging place to the second part of your question we’ve got a flexible cost structure where we can adjust in different market environments. But that being said, I think when you look at the investments we've been making, they really are driving organic growth. So I think we would think long and hard before pulling that back.
And then when you think about how our business model would operate in a changing macro, which is -- which could likely be driven by interest rates as well as or the equity market. I know we have covered them several times, and we got a lot of natural hedges in our business model from things like when interest rates go down, you typically see the equity markets go up and good proxy for us as the S&P 500 where 100 points improvement there equals or even more than offset the impact from interest rate decrease.
Then you add to that the strength of the balance sheet where we're from a cash position, where we're from the leverage position at the low end of our range. We just feel like we're in a really good position to drive those investments and make those investments to drive growth.
And then maybe finally, I just highlight an environment like that, those can be some of the best environments to really invest and drive growth from the long-term. From things like recruiting and M&A opportunities, where advisors and smaller broker-dealers are going to seek a more stable place to be, the pricing of those and that environment both recruiting M&A could be more compelling for the buyer.
And then finally, just a competitive advantage of being able to invest, and again, focus on our advisors to deliver capabilities and service that helps them compete in an environment where others which struggle to do so. I think you can get the overall picture here. I think we feel passionate about the investments we're making. At the same time, we've got the ability to slowdown where it makes sense. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. So I wanted to start off with a question on cash balances. Certainly encouraging to see the uptake in cash this quarter, I was hoping you could speak to your outlook for cash growth and confidence that 4% cash flow you’ve said in the past you continue to hold, and whether we should expect to see any change in client behavior as if I continues to cut interest rates as a potential hedge? Yes, Steve. So this is Matt. I think there is not a lot of rate sensitivity there. So I think the customer behavior is not something we see changing. I think it's more about just a natural amount of cash that you need, and this is operational cash to manage the account, and you see that move in at the low end of that range as you referenced in your question around 4%. And even as we're growing, we're still at that low end of the range at 4.3%.
So, I think the rate environment doesn't cause us to have a different view on kind of cash balances. And they can ebb and flow, but I think we're probably sitting towards the lower end of the historical range. So, we don't see a ton of pressure to downside, but we're not seeing anything new that will give us concern there. Got it. And just my follow-up, just want to ask a question on the regulatory outlook, given the uncertainty ahead of the upcoming election, how does senior leadership preparing for potential changes in regulations such as the DOL and how do you foresee that impacting your business whether positively or negatively? Yeah. So let me take that one. So maybe with respect specifically to the fiduciary rule, and I'll use that as proxy for how we think about it more broadly. I think what you're asking is, with the change in leadership in the government, you might have a different regulatory environment that you have to deal with, and in this case, perhaps the fiduciary rule standard reemerges as something to think about or consider utilize across all of our business.
And so, though we think Reg-BI better outcome for investors, that scenario should emerge, we tend to think about that across some two lens. One, we think about it as more technically, which is about how you prepare for something like that and the necessary investments to do that. And then I think we think about it strategically.
So again, using the fiduciary standard as an example, I think from a tactical standpoint you look at that, and given the preparation that we went through for the prior version of the fiduciary rule and then with Reg-BI I think we’ve done the vast majority of what's needed. So any remaining cost would be mostly contained in our run rate spend or in our -- sort of our planned approach to our capital allocation.
From a strategic standpoint, I think we believe that absolutely maintaining choice for advisors, clients is in their best interest. So you would see us continue to offer both advisory and brokerage solutions.
And I think that leads though to some interesting potential trends with that strategic posture in that approach. I think, one, you would see more of our direct brokerage assets move on to our platform. You would see a higher use of advisory solutions. And ultimately, I think it serves potentially for industry consolidation that would likely be positive both from recruiting and an M&A standpoint.
So when we step back and sort of look at that, I think it has some interesting possibilities of which we’d say, how do we think about your capital allocation relative to the regulatory space. And we always do that as a discipline in our capital investments. Two, it would probably reinforce the fact you continue to make investments in your advisory platforms which we're doing.
And then finally, I think it further reinforces what Matt was saying earlier, is that there could be an opportunity to accelerate market share growth in a scenario like that and having strong and flexible balance sheet and business model to step into that, would certainly make sense to explore.
So I think that's how we think about that potential change in the future. I hope that answers your question. Thanks for the helpful color. Thank you. Our next question comes from Gerald O'Hara with Jeffries. Great, thanks for taking the question. I know it's still early, but with the Allen & Company deal now closed perhaps could give a little context just to how you are thinking about further expansion of that employee channel or early feedback or any kind of an additional data points just to give us a sense of where that would trend? Yes, happy to do that. And I think with respect to Allen & Company, we closed that in the third quarter as we referenced and we'll be transitioning those assets under our platform in the fourth quarter. So that's the focus now is, making that successful transition over and positioning them to successfully operate on our core platform.
At the same time, we've continued to develop sort of and round out the capabilities set we need to enter into this employee structured model. We’ve also had hired a leader for that business model to make sure that, we continue to innovate around it, that we're packaging and pricing it in the right way, and that we finalized our go-to-market strategy such that I think in the 2020 as when we began to go to the marketplace with the new solution both leveraging the Allen & Company acquisition and their footprint.
As well as bringing the model more broadly to the marketplace. And we think that has some really interesting possibility. Our early research and surveying of the marketplace certainly, I think reinforces the concept and the hypothesis around the value. And in 2020, we'll work on taking that with the marketplace and executing on that. So excited about the opportunities there. That's helpful. And then maybe one for Matt, just with respect to the ICA fixed rate balances as appose to ratio of fixed to floating, I know – sort of target range of 50% to 75% has been illustrated for next year, but kind of curious, if you -- are you kind of set on getting into that midpoint of the range or sort of playing it kind by year by market with backdrop? And then if you could maybe give us any sort of sense of how those maturities might be kind of paced throughout the course of the year that would be helpful. Thank you. Yes, sure. I mean, I think, when you look at our fixed rate balances now at about 40%, that's about $9 billion of balances. I think, we look at our target, right. I think we feel good and comfortable about our target range of 50% to 75%. And when forming that target, I think we thought about it in a range of different interest rate environment. So I think we certainly contemplated a lower interest rate environment and does that range make sense in that environment as well and we think it does because you come back to kind of the core point, which is really just to reduce the volatility and increase the stability of our earnings.
So putting us in a place to even further focus on our advisors and helping them serve their clients. So that's the concept, so it's unchanged in this environment. I think, when you look at next year – just using in terms of dollars, we got about roughly $5 billion of balances that will have the opportunity to move into fixed if we think that makes sense next year which kind of puts you in low 60% or mid-60% range. And I think I would think about the opportunity to do that of roughly evenly throughout the year little bit of ups and downs this quarter, but I think good way to think about is evenly over the year. It will make judgments based on where we're at that time make sense to do, but I would say we're still focused on 50% to 75% even in this environment is the right range to get to. Great Thanks for taking my questions. Sure. Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Crédit Suisse. Hey, thanks. Good evening, everyone. Hi, Craig. So just given that you recruited balances AUA balance has been so strong now for 6 quarters, can you just remind us how you adjusted your transition assistance over the last couple of years? And also, how is the competitive environment evolved from all the wealth managers as you compete for new financial advisors? Matt, you want to take the first part of the question. Yes, sure. We haven't made any changes really recently, I think the changes we made maybe if you go back year or two really just about aligning the transition systems to return, And I think we’ve been doing that fairly consistently. We haven't really seen really rate change in really any meaningful way in the market it's really just a aligning to the assets that are coming on to our platform.
And I think one of the things that perhaps stand right next is I think what we have seen in the recruiting success is many things on both our business development team and the capabilities and the service experience on our platform. Well said, Matt. I don't have anything add to that other than you asked about competitive landscape and I don't think we have seen a material systemic shift in the transition assistance rates across the board. You see certain companies doing certain things are trying to experiment and/or making pivots because of some other business circumstance, but I think systemically we've seen a pretty stable over that period of time. Got it. And just as my follow-up here, I have another one on gross profit ROI, I think we all know the accretive migrations and you guys have covered them well. But can you just flush out any uncertainty relating to pricing pressure just given what we're seeing from some other competitors in wealth management segment that are in different channels here? Yes, let me start with at least how we think about some of the pricing changes and then I think that we certainly can pull it back or tie it back to how you think about the gross profit ROA. So look, the pricing changes that are occurring in the marketplace, we look at those as I think just more about the world we live in and the industries, most industries go through some type of trends and changes and evolution in terms of pricing. And then in this case, I think, we have seen this trend occurring in – fist in start over the past 25 years, you saw some in the late part of the last century, you saw it reemerge prior to 2008. We've seen I think, in the last 4 years to 5 years where some of that started out in passive investing and then you have seen others make some changes most recently.
I think, if you take the changes that occurred across your self-directed players, I think first and foremost, those have a much bigger impact across because that self-directed marketplace and perhaps the end client is much, much more price-sensitive there. And that has a really small impact on our business, there's more because we don't operate in the self-directed market as you know, it has more of the residual impact on us serving RIAs that we custody their assets for.
So when we see something like that are occurring, I'll use this example, as to how we think about these pricing changes, it's more going on across the entire industry, we look at pricing as a strategic lever, and absolutely think about how the to consider that across our three strategic plays and how to best position it to serve and support our advisors to help them differentiate and win.
And so, if you look in the last couple of years, we've made pricing adjustments as a part of our strategy in order to help drive growth in areas like our advisory platforms and transaction costs, and that's been roughly on an order of magnitude or an average of about $15 million investment a year.
So I think as we go forward and we think about our strategy, as we move into 2020, I would just give you a little color that we will likely approach it in a very similar way, i.e., we're like you to focus in those areas of the advisory platform and transaction charges and secondarily it would be at a similar magnitude or impact.
And so, that's kind of how we think about pricing, is absolutely a strategic lever. We always consider it as a part of executing our strategy and it gives you a little bit of trend on how we've done it over the past three years and kind of how we're thinking about it as we move into 2020. I hope that was helpful.
Do you want to tie anything back to ROA or how it implies to your gross profit ROA? No. I think I summarized it well; the zone that we would be thinking about is the number that you said, so nothing to add. Hopefully, that was hopeful, Craig. Thanks, guys. Very comprehensive. Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Great. Hey, guys. Good afternoon. So maybe just following on the last question, with respect to the e-brokers decision to cut pricing to zero and commissions for equity in half, any way we can think about the impact of ticket charges for you guys, if you can emphasize that. And is that one of the sort of investments you're contemplating as you are looking out into next year? Yes. So, I think, from a context standpoint, again, it's -- the impact on us is more of around where we custody assets for RIAs. And, so it's a smaller level of impact and we absolutely have taken those data points and put them into our overall strategic considerations around how we reduce pricing to best support our advisors and is a part of that prioritization stack. I think, you'll likely see us thinking about that and doing something to address that. It fits well inside that framework that I mentioned earlier. Got it. And then, a follow-up question for Matt. I understand it's still early, as you guys think about 2020 on expenses, but could you just talk a little bit about what kind of macroenvironment does that guide contemplate? And when you talk about to obviously be nimble and aware of the environment if things get a little bit tough for you, you have the ability to pull back. What sort of growth algorithm are you solving for? Is that EBITDA margin within a certain range? Or improving EBITDA margin? How can we put some sort of framework around your thinking on how much you could pull back as the environment gets tougher? Yes. I mean, I think, I'd just emphasize that we've given you a little early indication as to where our thinking is, right? So we'll give you our finalized plans in a future day, likely on the next call. I think the environment we're thinking through, we always look at a range of environments.
I think every time we lay out our investing plans, we stage them so we have the ability to pause if the environment deteriorates. And we also, I'd just emphasize, when we look at the investments we're making, we look at it from a return based perspective.
So when you've got in front of you investments that can drive value for our advisors and help them serve their clients and drive organic growth, and choose between that and just maintaining an op margin certain amount, right, when looking at those two things and you look at the returns they are usually pretty clear what make sense to do versus what does it.
So, I think as I put it in the bucket of a high-class problem, or we've got investments that are really the driving value and we just think long and hard about pulling those back. That being said, the macro can be in a range of scenarios, and I would just emphasize, we've got the ability to adjust our spending plans at the same time, we're always focused on in delivering efficiency, so we are in a – you've got scenarios, like if you go back to 2016 as an example, where you kept expenses relatively flat, we were still investing, we were still growing the technology portfolio. So I'd just emphasize that as well. Great. That's helpful context. Thanks. Thank you. Our next question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. Most of my questions have been asked, I just have one around just consolidation in the space, it seems higher markets and interest rates may build out some of the inferior or subscale broker models that you competing against, I'm curious with rates tuning here, whether you are seeing any early indications of more interest to sell the business, or even what expect to see sellers picking up just as obviously their businesses face more pressure than maybe they had anticipated and so a combination would make more sense in that type of backdrop? Yeah. So, with respect to M&A, we view it as a complement to our organic growth, and then we're in the marketplace exploring potential opportunities given that concept. Certainly, Allen & Company is an example of some of the opportunity will you see in that case a very well-run smaller company, who saw opportunity of which to leverage some of our scale and capabilities, of which to enrich just how they serve and support their clients. Our hypothesis would be similar to yours that as the environment gets tougher, you tease out probably some challenges of smaller organizations to have a harder time, with respect to driving earnings and cash flow and being able to reinvest in the business, and the hints our reason for being in the marketplace, and exploring those possibilities.
So we think the Allen & Company concept is a great example, how we think about that. And we continue to be in the market exploring potential possibilities. We're also look at M&A, with respect to, if we can accelerate our capabilities development and evolution then we also are looking for opportunities of which to enrich our value proposition and again advisory world was a great example of that. So there is the two places, I think we're more most interested in the marketplace. Okay. Great. And then just going back to some of the comments on pricing evolution we basically didn't confirm on this call yet, but UBS just made an announcement on their SMA pricing, I guess, is not completely clear, all the nuance of that, but I'm curious, whether you are seeing any potential I guess, change or pressure in that part of the business as well? And as you said, I don't know that, we have exact clarity on what's been done. We have a hypothesis that they eliminated their SMA Manager fee, where they were the Manager versus the third-party. And to give you a little bit more color on that, typically with an SMA you've got an advisory fee that reflects the value that the advisors providing and then sometimes you can have a separate fee for the Asset Manager in those type vehicles., and I think it looks to us they've just eliminated the Manager fee, when they are the Manager and haven't necessarily adjusted the advisory fee perhaps that gives the advisors some more flexibility then is to how they prize that to the end client. That's what looks like occur to us.
As I shared with you earlier, we've been investing over the last several years from a pricing standpoint focused around our advisory platforms and transactions, and I think it was roughly two, maybe three years ago, we eliminated the management fee and/or strategist fee where we were helping construct the portfolio, if LPL was helping do that, we went to zero on that, some of our third parties have followed on that as well, which again, we did it because we felt it was a great advantage for our advisors, should be able to use that lower cost structure as a way to create more value for their clients and differentiate themselves. So if that's what they have done, I think perhaps it makes logical sense just where the marketplace is and I don't think it would have a lot of impact on us because I think we've already made that move. That said, I may have wrong what they've done I hope that helps. Yeah, very helpful. Appreciate that. Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Thanks guys. Another question on pricing changes, pricing pressures, the 1% management fee rate roughly that you guys earn on fee-based accounts. Certainly not at a bounce with what other broker-dealers charge, but if you look at that rate and you think about that rate relative to other areas of financial services and just given the broader pressure that pricing pressure in financial services more broadly, how much longer do you think that rate can hold? I guess, is the question, I mean, it's been remarkably stable I think over the last call it, three, four years he doesn't seem to be impacted by some of the pricing changes you've implemented. So if you can give us some your thoughts on that that would be appreciated? Yes, sure. Let me take a stat of that. If I don't get it all please follow. Look, I think with respect to that price as it exists quarter, one place you do is you look across your competitive set and where the majority of our advisors operate in the massive fluent and fluent segments of the marketplace. It seems to be a very competitive offering and as you said, there is a good stability over the years. I think for the most part advisors had to deal with any pricing sensitivity, it's been more as one-off and they view adjustments to passive investment is a way to try to solve for that. So, I do think from a competitive standpoint, and where things exist today. It's a competitive offering. That said, as we go forward, I think it's always a fair way to think about price, and I think in the advise space, value drive price, and what I mean by that is the sensitivity and the appeal around the value that you can deliver someone, if you can help me set-up a plan to help me achieve my life goals and dreams, if you can help me solve problems or long life's journey, if you can make sure that you execute my plans, so I don't make a misstep because I didn't do what needed to be done and you are there to make sure I execute well. Those are really valuable opportunities for our advisors to deliver and maintain really important value.
And some of that, you might be able to automate, some of that, it's harder to automate, but we all got to be saying how do we make it more efficient and effective to deliver that, and then at the same time, I think you got to be constantly looking for can I expand my value proposition, can I focus on somewhere and solve unique problems that others can't. And we actually believe advisors that do that, we're trying to help as many advisors that have a desire and appetite to do that, we think that they will protect most of their pricing power.
And again, at the end of the day, advise space, we believe is driven by value. We believe that all segments of the marketplace up to this point has demonstrated they prefer to have a human that they can trust, that is a professional to help and support them to do that and, then if we wrap technology around them to help enrich the value proposition, personalization, easier access, solving more complex problems and making them more efficient, we think ultimately it's a really compelling and interesting opportunity set, they can preserve most of their pricing power and where they can, we can drive efficiencies into their overall operations. I hope that helps. Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Hey. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to follow-up on the some of the strength and the recruited assets, I know you guys have touched on that a little bit earlier, but just hoping for a little bit more color in terms of which specific channels parts of the industry you guys are seeing more success than others as if from IBD space or more from the wires and any particular color you are able to share on the pipeline in terms of where that stand stay versus a year ago? Yes. Yes. Good question. So, look, I think the headline is, we see the recruiting environment for us healthy and we feel good about our pipeline, I think if I had color to that for you, we certainly see the continued a trend towards independence, remaining consistent and strong.
The advisor movement what we call advisor churn has been stable, but slightly below average, but we have kind of stepped into that and challenged ourselves to just improve our win rates and improve how we do things and if we're better at that than that only makes it an opportunity as those churn rates may be returned to the norm.
And then I think we see opportunities to continue to win in the independent space where advisors who are looking for a more capabilities are attracted to our model and our solution, we see the opportunity to continue to win from leaving the employee-based model, coming to the independent model and hits the reason we're rolling out our two new affiliation models to better position us there, those that are advisory centric and those that are have that feel of an employee-based model.
So, to summarize, we feel good about where the performance of our business development team and their continued evolution as a high-performing team, we like how we're positioned well in the independent space, and we like new affiliation models we'll be able to we believe compete for a full spectrum of our advisors leaving employee model. Okay. Just maybe a quick follow-up question. You guys described and talked about the growth and outlook certainly interesting given some of the structural trends benefiting the overall industry. I guess, what risk you see to that outlook, is it more about rates from lower or political regulatory risk, is it pricing, how are you thinking about that relative to the broader structural trend and growth opportunity? I think that we think about that in a couple of places, certainly the regulatory environments always question as we covered earlier, that you got to pay attention to, and I think not knowing exactly what that looks like, it makes preparational tougher, it doesn't mean that you just don't set up with several different sort of options and how you consider and try to best prepare for that, but we do believe it will require continued investment to improve the efficiency and efficacy of which we manage risk.
We actually then flip down on its size and see how do we turned that into an opportunity. If it's hard, it doesn’t mean it’s a problem. If you can flip it on its side and you can use robotics or artificial intelligence to do that more effective than others at a lower price than you can use that advantage and push that down through your model as an example. But that's certainly one of them.
I think another one is just the pace of change and having the agility and nimbleness to execute well in a place where I believe you're only going to see change, go faster and faster and magnitude of that change is going to be bigger and bigger, so you had depth to be filtering out that which is not important focus on what is and make sure your organization has the ability to make the pivots and focus on continuous improvement and always be pulling more and more technology, automation, and digital capabilities to its environment.
We think that's really important for scalability and I think that is what our cultural transformation is all about is trying to position our enterprise to do well in an environment like that, but I think that's in the challenging environment. So, we think that's an important thing to think about and if you don't do that well, I think that emerges as a risk to your point earlier. So, I'll pause there, but those are a couple. Okay, great. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Shutler with William Blair. Hey guys. Good afternoon. Couple of quick ones. So, first on the commentary around the outsourced business services, Dan. Just give us a little more detail on how you're pricing those services? How much revenue you're generating per advisor? Yes. So, those are subscription-based services and just as -- again as a reminder, for everyone, these are what we were calling all old virtual services that we rebranded as business solutions and this is where we found that if we can provide that expertise at affordable enough way then we can give access to that expertise to our advisors where the may not have been able to tap into that, think about having a CFO is a leverage point to help you think about your business as an example.
And so our concept would be first and foremost, we want to do that to set them up to improve and enhance their growth rates. And to the extent, that we're successful systematically doing that, that probably is the biggest return on that effort.
That said, what we have done, is looked at these as stand-alone business solutions. And looked at the economics of them to say can we generate a contribution for that incremental value.
And so one of the things that we have done is our principal has been let's go in and experiment where the affordability levels are for those advisors, where is their great leverage point for them to get access to the solution and this service, and then challenged ourselves to operate underneath that in a way that creates profitable contribution.
So the pricing around those on average, you should think about is, think about that is like $1,500 a month to $2,000 a month for any of those services or an individual service. So if I can get access to a CFO for $20,000 to $24,000 a year. And I can get that expertise and only paying for the portion of the portion of the CFO that I need.
I don't need a whole one, that's the concept it may cost me $100-plus-thousand to afford a CFO for my business. And if I can get access to it for 20 to 24, that ends up being a really good trade for them. And if we can offer rate that's been profitability that creates some incremental earnings contribution for us, from that incremental value, but the biggest gain comes from helping with advisors grow their business. I hope that helps. Yeah. It's definitely helpful, Dan. And then, on a separate topic, I am just thinking about gross profit ROA here. Would you see the advisors that you have been adding over the last year or so pulled a similar, higher or lower amount of cash on average than your core basic advisors, just trying to understand if that is a material part of when you talk about recruiting more profitable advisors, that's a key component of it or not. I don't think we have exact answer to that. Here is the way I would think about that in and Matt you add whatever. Look, what we do know is that our recruiting classes on average, they are mix of advisory business to brokerage business.
This is our average and if that's the case then that mix of business has a big determinant on their cash balances. So I would think they would look more like what our average is today, then necessarily a big variance from there. But I don't know, Matt, you want to add some color. Yeah. I am just emphasize the brokerage versus advisor, there is really driver, the difference in cash rates, so the most higher percent of advisory, slightly higher cash balances, you're going to have due to the nature of that. So I think that's probably think I'll look at, as supposed to the timing of when the advisors came on board. All right, thanks a lot. Thank you. I'm showing no further questions in the queue at this time. I'll now like to turn the call back to over to Mr. Dan Arnold, for any closing remarks. Yeah, hey, I just want to thank everybody for taking the time to join us this afternoon. We know you're busy. And we appreciate it. And we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thanks. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Arnold. Hi. Thank you Catherine and thanks to everyone for joining our call today. As we discuss each quarter, we believe a thoughtful strategy combined with extraordinary execution and a mission-driven culture will drive long-term growth and value. Working within this framework, we delivered another quarter of solid business and financial growth.
Let's start with the review of the drivers of our business in the fourth quarter. Organic growth combined with higher equity markets drove total brokerage and advisory assets to a new high of $764 billion. With respect to organic growth, strength in new store sales and advisor retention as well as steady same-store sales drove fourth quarter net new assets of $8.8 billion, which translates to a 4.9% annualized growth rate. For the year, organic net new assets grew at 3.8%, up from 2.3% per year ago.
Turning to our financial results. We continue to drive solid topline growth with gross profit up 6% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and 12% for the year. We also remain focused on investing in the business while staying disciplined on expenses to drive operating leverage. As a result, fourth quarter EPS, prior to intangibles, grew 13% year-over-year to $1.68 and contributed to a 35% increase for the full year to $7.17.
Looking at the marketplace more broadly, we continue to operate in a large and growing market with favorable secular trends towards independence and advisory solutions. In terms of the economic backdrop, our current view is that many of the core drivers of the economy such as employment and consumer spending combined with renewed business investment are solid and supportive of economic growth and investor engagement. So while we remain flexible, in the event of changes in the macro environment, the strength of our balance sheet and business model positions us well to continue investing to drive organic growth.
With that in mind, we thought it would be helpful to use our strategic framework to provide some color on where we are investing. Our first strategic play involves winning in our traditional independent and institutional markets while also expanding our affiliation models. With respect to our traditional markets, the efficacy of our business development team and our differentiated capabilities drove solid recruiting outcomes within the quarter and for the year. Fourth quarter recruited AUM was over $10 billion bringing our full year total to $35 billion, both of which are the highest levels we have recorded.
We also continue to make progress on the development of our new affiliation models. This quarter, I will highlight our new premium offering. After bringing this model to market in the third quarter, it has been well received and generated good feedback from prospective advisors. We now have our first couple of committed practices which we expect will join over the next few months and we are encouraged by our growing pipeline of interested advisors. As we look ahead, we believe enhanced performance in our traditional markets combined with new affiliation models can drive our recruiting results over time.
We also continued to invest in capabilities and pricing to help our advisors differentiate and win in the marketplace. Over the past several years, our pricing investments have been focused on our advisory platforms and transaction costs. In 2020, we are taking the same approach in light of the continued secular industry trends towards advisory solutions and lower retail trading commissions. As a part of this effort, in the fourth quarter, we rolled out a no transaction fee ETF offering that builds on the success of our no transaction fee mutual fund solution. We made this offering available on both our corporate and hybrid advisory platforms in order to extend the benefit of lower ETF pricing to all of our advisors.
Now let's turn to our second strategic play where we are working to create an industry-leading service experience that enhances our ability to attract and retain advisors. As context, at the beginning of 2018, we launched our ease of doing business program, which focused on investing to enhance and differentiate client works and making continuous improvements to the advisor experience. As a result, we drove our NPS score up by 45 points over the past two years.
As we move into 2020, not only are we continuing the ease of doing business program, but we are also adding a new effort transforming our service offering into a client care model. This includes providing multiple channels for advisors to engage with us, intelligent routing of their inquiries and case management for complex issues. In the fourth quarter, we made progress in the development of our client care model by piloting our interactive voice response system and scaling our case management team into an enterprise-wide capability.
Through ongoing dialogues as well as NPS and transactional surveys, we hear from our advisors that their service experience continues to improve. We remain focused on listening to and applying their feedback as we work to deliver a client care model that is unique to the wealth management industry and can further enhance our service experience, advisor retention and NPS results.
Our third strategic play is focused on helping advisors in the independent marketplace enhance how they grow, protect and operate their businesses. In that spirit, we are helping them with new innovations such as outsourced business solutions, digitized workflows, advisor focused capital solutions and lead generation. This quarter, I want to highlight the progress we have made on digitizing advisor workflows.
As a reminder, we are focused on automating the six primary workflows where advisors spend approximately 80% of their time. At this point, we are roughly halfway through the overall initiative. A notable fourth quarter milestone was our integration of a free embedded CRM solutions powered by Microsoft as well as two leading third-party offerings from Salesforce and Redtail. This is important because the CRM module is a foundational component of all the workflows. Together, these three integrated CRM offerings provide several benefits to advisors including greater flexibility to use the best solution for their practices, the opportunity to lower cost with a free option and more effectively leveraging client data to drive efficiency across all of their workflows.
Over the past quarter, we achieved another number key milestone by integrating financial planning capabilities, which are used in the workflow that turns prospects into clients. And we did this by integrating three financial planning offerings, our free goals based planning solution and two leading third-party options from MoneyGuide and eMoney. Much like our CRM offering, this suite of integrated financial planning tools provides advisors with greater flexibility, lower costs and an expanded solution set to help clients invest for the goals that mean the most to them.
As we continue to work to digitize the rest of the primary workflows, advisors will be able to continue to enhance the efficiency and scalability of their practices. This, in turn, will better position them to deliver greater value to their clients and grow their businesses.
In summary, we are pleased to deliver another quarter and year of business and financial growth. We remain focused on combining strategy, execution and culture to serve our advisors drive profitable growth and create long term shareholder value.
With that, I will turn the call over to Matt. All right. Thank you Dan. And I am glad to speak with everyone on today's call.
Looking at our 2019 results, we are proud of what we accomplished within our framework for driving long-term shareholder value. Organic asset growth and recruiting reached their highest quarterly and full year levels in our history. This combined with M&A and higher equity markets drove total assets to more than three quarters of $1 trillion. We also continued to invest for growth while staying disciplined on expenses to drive operating leverage.
Additionally, we increased the fixed rate portions on our ICA balances and corporate debt, which further reduced our sensitivity to short term interest rates. At the same time, we remained active on the capital deployment front, returning over $0.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Overall, we feel good about the results our strategy is driving and our positive momentum as we head into 2020.
Now let's turn to our results, starting with EPS prior to intangibles. It was $1.68 in Q4, which brought our full year total to $7.17, up 35% from a year ago. Looking at assets, we finished the quarter with total brokerage and advisory assets of $764 billion, up 6% sequentially and 22% year-over-year. Total net new assets were $8.8 billion in Q4 or a 4.9% annualized growth rate. And recruited assets were $10.6 billion in Q4, which brought our full year total to $35 billion, up 28% from a year ago.
Looking at our business mix. We continued to see positive trends this quarter. Advisory assets increased to 48% of total assets, primarily driven by advisory inflows of $9.6 billion or an 11% annualized growth rate. Within our advisory platforms, centrally managed net new assets were $2 billion or a 17% annualized growth rate.
Now let's move on to our Q4 financial results. Gross profit was $538 million, down $4 million or 1% sequentially. Looking at the components. Commission and advisory fees net of payout were $134 million in Q4, up $2 million from Q3. The increase was primarily driven by higher advisory fees, partially offset by seasonally higher production bonus expense.
Moving on to asset-based revenues. Sponsor revenues were $134 million in Q4, up $4 million or 3% sequentially, primarily driven by higher average asset levels and greater usage of our no transaction fee platforms.
Turning to client cash revenues. They were $155 million, down $7 million or 4% from Q3. The decline was primarily driven by lower short term interest rates, partially offset by higher average cash sweep balances.
Looking at ICA balances. They were $24.4 billion at the end of Q4, up $2.2 billion or 10% sequentially. Total fixed rate ICA balances also increased to $12.3 billion, up $3.3 billion from Q3 as we continued our duration extension program. This brought our mix of fixed rate balances to more than 50% of the ICA portfolio and into our target range of 50% to 75%.
Looking at client cash yields. Our Q4 ICA yield was 222 basis points, down 19 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by the three Fed rate cuts in July, September and October. Looking ahead to Q1, we will have the remaining effect of the October rate cut. I would also highlight that the growth in balances in Q4 was in floating rate contracts which have a lower yield than our overall ICA portfolio. Given these factors, we expect our Q1 ICA yield to be around 210 basis points. This assumes no further changes in short-term rates, client deposit rates or the mix of our fixed versus floating rate balances.
Moving on to Q4 transaction and fee revenues. They were $118 million, down $3 million sequentially. The decrease was primarily driven by lower conference revenues following our national sales conference in Q3. This decline was partially offset by growth in our business solutions, which reached approximately 650 subscribers at the end of the year. I would also highlight that we launched our no transaction fee ETF platform towards the end of the fourth quarter. So Q1 will be the first quarter with the full run-rate impact of this program, which we estimate will reduce transaction revenues by $2 million to $3 million per quarter.
Now let's turn to expenses, starting with core G&A. It was $230 million in Q4, bringing our full year core G&A to $868 million, which was within our outlook range of $860 million to $870 million. Turning to 2020, we plan to continue to focus our investments on areas that will drive organic growth. A few of our priorities for this year are enhancing capabilities for our advisors, expanding our affiliation models and scaling business solutions. And as we shared last quarter, we expect to grow our investments at a slightly faster pace this year.
More specifically, we are planning for 2020 core G&A in the range of $915 million to $940 million. We will of course remain flexible to respond to changes in the environment. But based on what we see today, we are excited about our opportunities to invest to continue driving organic growth. As for Q1, we expect core G&A to be in a similar range to our fourth quarter total of $230 million, as our additional growth investments will likely be offset by a sequential decline in variable compensation.
Turning back to Q4 promotional expenses. They were $51 million, down $11 million sequentially. This was driven by lower conference expenses following our national sales conference in Q3, partially offset by higher transition assistance. Looking ahead to Q1, we anticipate promotional expense will increase to around $60 million, as we have two of our largest advisor conferences of the year in Q1.
Looking at share-based compensation expense. It was $7 million in Q4, relatively flat to Q3. Looking ahead, Q1 tends to be our highest quarter of the year given the timing of our annual stock awards. So we anticipate this expense will increase by a few million dollars sequentially.
Turning to interest expense. It was $31 million, down slightly from Q3. The decrease was driven by lower average interest rates, mostly offset by $2 million of debt refinancing costs. As for Q1, we expect interest expense will be approximately $30 million given our current debt balances and interest rates.
Moving on to our balance sheet. It remained strong in Q4. Cash available for corporate use was $204 million and our leverage ratio was 2.05 times.
Turning to capital deployment. Our priorities remain investing for organic growth first and foremost, taking advantage of M&A opportunities when appropriate and returning capital to shareholders. Looking at organic growth, our investments are focused on recruiting new advisors, helping existing advisors grow and enhancing our technology.
In addition to our investments for growth, we returned excess capital to shareholders. This included $120 million of share repurchases in Q4, which brought us to $500 million for 2019. This drove our share count down by 7% year-over-year and kept us on track to complete our $1 billion authorization over roughly two years. We also returned capital through $20 million of regular quarterly dividends in Q4, which brought us to $83 million for the full year. In total, our 2019 capital returns to shareholders were $583 million or approximately $6.89 per share.
In closing, we are pleased to have delivered another quarter and year of strong business and financial results. We remain focused on growing assets and gross profit, investing to drive organic growth while staying disciplined on expenses and returning excess capital to shareholders.
With that, operator, please open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Bill Katz with Citi. Your line is open. Okay. Thank you very much for taking the questions this evening. So Matt, maybe to start off where you left off when you were on expenses. Can you just sort of walk us through maybe a little more specificity about what helps define the ranges between low and high and like what your macro framework is? And then within that, can you maybe quantify how much the conference spending is in Q1? Sure. So I think on the second point, the conference spending is the primary driver of the increase. I mean there may be a little bit from transition assistance naturally but I think the conference is the primary component of that. I think on the spending, Bill, I think when you look at where we were spending in 2019 in the areas of capabilities and technology and service, those are really the big contributors that were helping drive organic growth.
So we pivot and look towards 2020. It's really those same categories that we are focused on. And a little bit more color on some of the things we are focused on from building on and developing the new affiliation models, from scaling up business solutions and really interesting in the advisory platforms. And I think when you look at the range of spending, I think there is a handful of things. There are things the drive that range like variable comp.
There is things where we lay out our spending and gate the spending throughout the year. So if we see a pull back in the macro or the investments are as compelling as we thought, we can land towards the lower end of that range. And if the macro is supportive and the investments are compelling and we have even more opportunities that could push us towards the high end of the range. And so hopefully that helps give you a little color on how we choose that. Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just as a follow-up in terms of client behavior into the New Year. I was just sort of wondering if you could maybe speak to engagement levels, whether it be net buying and where trending of sort of cash balances to potentially offset the shrinkage on the yield? Yes. Sure. I think we will release January metrics in February, as you know. But I think what we have, kind of some color on what we have seen so far. As I think we have seen what you would expect in a market that's up. So we have seen strength in assets and assets increasing. We have also seen some of that customer cash or that sweep that we saw grow in December go back into the market. I would say, we have got a couple days to go but I would say cash is, I would call it, down slightly in January versus December. But again, I classify it, as we are seeing what you would expect to see in an upmarket and we will give you the metrics of that in February. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Hi good afternoon. So Matt, why don't I start off with a question just on the ROA outlook. You had another strong quarter of growth in centrally managed as well as advisory assets. I know that those channels have historically translated into better gross profit ROA, especially relative to some of your peers. This quarter, we saw a little bit more pressure on that line, at least relative to what we have seen recently and was hoping maybe unpack just where some of the components resulted in that contraction? Yes. Sure. I think when you look at gross profit year-over-year, whether the quarter year-over-year or the full year, we are seeing nice growth there, right. The quarter is up 6% versus Q4 last year. The year is up 12% year-over-year. But when you look at that metric, market movements can create some noise, right. Not all the revenue streams in there are driven by asset movements. Things like transaction and fees and even the client cash revenues themselves.
So when you look at what happened in Q4, equity markets were up pretty large. They were up 9%. If you look at the full year, they were 30%, right. So while market movements and market increases are definitely good for the business, when you look at that metric when not all the revenue streams are driven by that, it can create some noise.
Now you see the opposite effect, right. When you look at the end of 2018, when you had a drop in the markets, we saw some ROA increase there. So I will just keep that in mind when you are looking at that particular metric that there can be noise from the market even when we are in a quarter we are having all the positive drivers that you highlighted.
So maybe Dan, if there is any color you wanted add to that? No. I think you got the math right. And the only thing that I would add is, we continue to focus with respect to our strategy on trying to create and add value to our advisors. And where we do that, you see these positive mix shifts. So you are seeing the value of, as an example, our corporate advisory platform and outsourcing the risk associated with that where you see, as you mentioned, the transition towards centrally managed or even advisory. And so I think that's what we continue to focus on is creating and adding value, recognizing that those trends will help drive that ROA which is controllable, if you will, up higher. Got it. And just one follow-up for me on organic growth. Now it's continued at a really healthy clip. Your IBD market share are taking assets north of 50%. I was hoping you could speak to the growth opportunity. How that's evolving within the IBD channel? And maybe your confidence levels in terms of the ability to sustain them mid single digit pace of organic growth as we look ahead to 2020? Yes. It's a great question. And I think you know, it's dead in the center of what our strategy is focused on. We have an aspiration and our strategy is focused on driving back to organic growth upward over time. And I think we think about that over three fronts or three areas of which to do that.
First, you have got new store sales. I mean here we have good momentum, right. We recruited $35 billion of AUM in the fourth quarter, sorry, $35 billion over the full year which was up over $27 billion in the prior year. So you see good growth year-on-year. And we believe there is opportunity by continuing to improve and enhance the efficacy of our business development team, developing new capabilities that further help us differentiate.
That just creates a more appealing model to continue to drive up recruiting in our traditional markets. And then you add to that the complementary broadening our participation in the marketplace by creating these new affiliation models where now you are able to participate in a more significant way across movement of advisors in other channels. We think that combination creates opportunity to continue to enhance our overall new store sales.
The second, I think, area of opportunity we see is in the area of retention. Our results continue to show improvement there. If you look over the last two years, retention has gone up from 95% to 96.5%. That's a good trend. There is good momentum there. And again, our second strategic play run right at us continuing to improve that service experience as reflected by the increase in our NPS score over the last couple of years. We believe if we continue to improve the service experience along with that is gong to come improved retention numbers. And so this year, we are focused on adding this transformation of our new service model. You add that to the baseline work we were already doing around enhancing our technology, improving policies and procedures, you end up, we think, with an interesting opportunity of which to improve and enhance retention over time.
And then the last category you get to is same-store sales. And look, that area has been that consistently steady over the last couple of years. We wanted to be better and we have challenged ourselves to innovate new ways of which to help our advisors increase the growth of their practices. So this is where we are focused on business solutions as a lever to do that, digitizing workflows. These new advisor capital solutions that we are working on, all of which we think are ways to go really deep to help advisors with tools that will help them transform how they operate their businesses and heighten the probability they are able to grow their same-store sales.
So, when you put all of those multiple orders together, we are encouraged by the opportunities to continue to enhance our organic growth and improve sort of that NNA capture over time. So I hope that helps. A comprehensive answer, Dan. So thanks for taking questions. Thank you. And our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Hi. Good evening guys. Another follow-up around expenses. So Matt, appreciate your comments around being nimble and I guess responses to the environment when it comes to expenses for 2020. But assuming you guys meet your organic growth objectives and the environment stays steady the way you described it on the macro side, is still reasonable to anticipate EBITDA margin expansion from you guys in 2020? Yes. I mean Alex, I think there is a lot of factors that impact that. I think when I take a step back on the EBITDA margin for us, we are focused on driving value over the long term. I think that when you look three, four years ago, our margins were in the low 30s. If you look at this year, they were in the, call it, 47%. So we had some nice expansion there. I think when we are focused on investing for organic growth, we are focused on the long term. So I think if there are short periods of time where you take a little bit of a step back on EBITDA margin like you saw this quarter where we are investing for long term growth, I think we are comfortable staying in a place where you have healthy margin. So I think our confidence is in the long term expansion there. Near term, lots of different factors that could impact that, so that would be hard to predict. Got it. Fair enough. And then on the business side of things, either Dan or Matt, I was hoping you guys could give us an update on where some of the business service initiatives stand. I think there's been a handful of them obviously rolled out last year. I think the revenues are all likely to start coming through this year. So maybe kind of help us frame how meaningful revenue contribution that could be for LPL this year? Yes. And I think you are referring to the business solutions. I just want to make sure. Yes. That's right, yes. Okay. Terrific. So yes, maybe I will start and certainly, Matt, you can add any color you like. So to put a fine point on it, look, we ended the year with 650 subscribers, which was up 500 over the year. I think we see that as a really positive trend. The key point there being that the value proposition is resonating with the advisors and the solutions are adding the value that were intended. And I think that's really an interesting opportunity we see to build from and that's what we were trying to sort of prove in our overall hypothesis and experimentation last year.
I think as we move in specifically the fourth quarter, if you drill down on that for a minute, we were still in that developmental phase where we were continuing to build the foundation and the infrastructure to scale in a really thoughtful and effective way. Think about things like automation to drive efficiency or dedicating a sales team to drive awareness and demand for the solutions. And so we think that's important to make sure that we do this well as we move to this more operational phase as we move into 2020.
So I think as you look at the value that comes from these solutions, we are encouraged by the contribution of helping existing advisors operate their practices free uptime to spend time with clients and grow their businesses. So we are seeing positive trends coming from those that are using these services today. We are also seeing it help attract new advisors that these are unique solutions and they add to the appeal of the overall model.
And then finally, we are starting to see, as you say, it start to contribute to gross profit. And so, as we look ahead, we remain focused on growing out these solutions and moving from what I will call more of a developmental phase to more of an operational phase where we are really focused on scaling. And I think we began to make that transition in this year.
So I hope that helps. Yes. That helps. Thanks. Thank you. And our next question comes from Jerry O'Hara with Jeffries. Your line is open. Thanks. Really just one for me. Just kind of looking at your supplemental slide and the recruited assets, the trend has been pretty strong sequentially over the past year. Just curious if you could maybe elaborate a little bit on what some of those drivers are or what's working or what's resonating just from a general, I guess just from a broad perspective. Thank you. Yes. So maybe let me take that from kind of a macro level and maybe the headline is the recruiting environment itself we find in sort of a solid state. And then we feel good about the progress that we are making and our pipeline. So let me give you a little color on maybe both of those.
From an environmental standpoint, we continue to see the trend towards independence and that remains strong and obviously creates opportunity. Over the last year, I think the rate of advisor movement has been relatively stable. And then finally, we continue to see in the independent space advisors in search of higher level of capabilities that will help them run their businesses. And so those trends obviously make up or what we would see is again a pretty solid environment.
When you click down and look at our approach to that opportunity set, in the independent space we continue to add more capabilities that help us differentiate and meet the needs of what those advisors are searching for. I think in addition, you have a very stable platform. And so the combination of capabilities and stability is very appealing.
With respect to also stepping into this opportunity of how could we continue to invest and automate and digitize our business development team and capabilities such that we enhance the efficacy of that group and that team and increase our win rates. And so that's part of our element strategy and we continue to make progress there and the team's done a great job over 2019 and continue to add new capabilities and new leverage tools to enrich how they do their work.
And then finally, I think we have the opportunity to think about these other channels, right. And where we haven't participated is greatly in the movement of advisors in those other channels, we see the opportunity to create new affiliation models that really cater to and appeal to advisors who were in search of an independent model coming out of these other channels. And so with respect to those affiliation models, ones in market, one we go to market in the second quarter and then one we will go to market later this year. We are receiving good feedback with respect to the value proposition associated with those programs and we are encouraged that they will continue to contribute to our ability to expand our recruiting efforts. So in a nutshell, we feel good about the results from last year and our pipeline as we move forward. That's helpful color. That's it for me. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Thank you. Good morning or good evening everyone. It's been a long day here. So first one, just on and maybe an update on the timing behind the migration of the portfolio from floating to fixed. Sure Craig. So I think if you look at, we talked about a quarter ago, we had $6 billion of potential opportunity to move from floating to fixed over the year. We ended up moving $3.3 billion of that a little bit earlier than we anticipated, meaning in the fourth quarter. So I think about the rest of the opportunity, I would say that another $3 billion is a good round number and way to think about it. And it's probably more towards the second half of the year just given most of what we moved this quarter was really acceleration of the near term floating rate contracts that were coming up. Got it. And then just a quick update on the recruiting front and specifically I am eyeing the transition assistance. I think the amortizations were up over 20% year-over-year. And how should we model the transition assistance amortization cost for the full year? Sure. Yes. I think from a transition assistance standpoint, Craig, where we are in market really hasn't changed. So the economics that we are paying are pretty similar. The amortizations are typically in the five year zone, although every deal is underwritten individually. So I think the primary driver of that is going to be just the level of recruiting itself, right. And I think we have talked a little about on this call already the strength and the increase in that recruiting that build throughout the year with the fourth quarter being $10.6 billion. So that's probably the primary driver of the rates of TA and the timing of the amortization have been pretty consistent. Thank you. Sure. Thank you. And our next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Thanks guys. So you talked about a few conferences that are affecting the promotional expense in the first quarter. Shouldn't there be some revenue that offsets that expense? And if there is, can you quantify that for us? That's part one of the question. Part two, will there be another large conference in the third quarter of this year? Or has that been pulled forward to Q1? Yes. So Chris, when you think about conference, our largest conference of the year is almost always in the third quarter. There is no change to that. Our number two and three typically happen, one happens in Q1 and the other happens in Q2. Those two just both happen to be in Q1. That conference in Q3 is the one that typically has the most revenue associated with it, meaning the transactions and fees. So there might be a little bit associated with the two that are happening in Q1, but not much. Okay. Thank you. Sure. Thank you. And our next question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Your line is open. Great. Hi guys. Hi Devin. Most have been asked. I just wanted to ask one on your client cash. You guys had a nice step up in the year-end. We have seen that from some others as well. But just curious, now that we are beyond year-end, does it feel like that was kind of typical behavior where money typically flows back just once the calendar year starts? Or I guess what are you seeing there and net buying still seems reasonable. So just trying to kind of unpack that a little bit given that it's obviously a positive trend. Yes. Sure Devin. So I think what we have seen so far in January is what you would expect in an up market. So I think with respect to cash, you are starting to see some of that cash go back into the market. I would say headline is cash so far is down slightly. There is still a couple or one or two days of data left to get but cash balances are just down slightly so far in January. Okay. Terrific. And then just maybe a quick follow-up in terms of the various affiliation options. When you are talking to advisors, are you presenting the firm now as kind of hoping to allowing to affiliate in any option they would like? Or typically, are advisors approaching LPL or you are approaching them for one specific affiliation option? I understand it will probably evolve as some of the newer affiliation options increase but I am just curious kind of how you are going to position that moving forward? Yes. We see that as actually an advantage to be able to have the flexibility to offer them different ways of which to think about their affiliation that would work best for them. And that can be when you recruit them new to the firm or that could be while they are here and something changes within their business, which allows them to continue to think about evolving their business in a way that's much easier and much more efficient by staying on this platform. So our whole mantra is, we have to meet them where they are in the evolution of their practices and the flexibility of our solutions and alternatives should be available to them and they can decide which ones best for them. That's how we see it. Okay. Great. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Hi. Good evening and thank you. We are hearing and seeing more consolidation in the wealth management space broadly. A couple of things. Maybe one, are you seeing valuation from wealth management companies firm further, say, over the last couple of quarters? I think maybe the more interestingly, is this flowing through at all to increase your recruiting cost at the broker or advisor level? Yes. Let me start and then Matt, you can add any color. So I think definitely we have seen an upweight in activity as you describe out in the marketplace. And with respect to valuations, I think that we have seen them, I might say, pretty steady over the last year as we think about it in the different places and opportunities where we explore. Our discipline, as you know, is always go in and look at the deal and make sure that it makes sense from a strategic, operational and a financial standpoint. And so we tend to take a good sustained rigor around how we think about those things.
And what does that mean relative to the M&A activity that occurs within the marketplace? I think there are places where we still find some really interesting value where an acquisition strategy makes a lot of sense across those three lines. There's other places where it may not. And I think we will stay disciplined where we find that opportunity.
We are and continue to look for opportunities relative to acquisition from what we would call a growth acquisition like an Allen and Co. solution that we did as well as things that accelerate and advance our capabilities like the AdvisoryWorld transaction. So we think you have got to be selective and you have got to look and you have got to be proactive in exploring those opportunities. But we think that they are out there.
Relative to the recruiting front, we don't really see any correlation or any tie relative to the cost of acquisition on the recruiting front with respect to the acquisition approach. I think there is a fair consideration down at the individual advisor level. If you are a practice, an advisor practice acquiring another practice, how you might think about that and value that. But we don't see it necessarily correlated up at the higher macro level. Great. Thanks very much. Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Cyprus with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Just curious to get your thoughts on how you are thinking about what might be an opportunity set for the pure RAA space, given some of the M&A that's happening in the industry that could put some RAAs and RAA assets in motion? And what, in your view, would be the key value proposition that LPL could potentially offer to attract some of those advisors versus some of the larger RAA custodians? Yes. So one, I do think that we acknowledge there is opportunity in that pure advisory space. One of the affiliation models that we are creating right now is a solution that is focused just 100% on an RAA-only firm. And we see opportunity to differentiate relative to providing what I might call the capabilities that we are building on our strategic play number three where you are building and supporting more capabilities down inside the practice, everything from digitized workflows, capital to support that practice all the way to our business solutions.
I think the second opportunity we have is that we can provide a solution that allows them to outsource that risk to us and be an RAA-only or be their own RAA. So the flexibility and optionality to choose how they think about investing in their own infrastructure to manage risk versus outsourcing that to us is another place that we believe we can differentiate. And then as we continue to innovate on our advisory platforms, creating certain solutions that are fully integrated inside our overall platform, leveraging the vertical integration that we would make available to those types of advisors, we think is an advantage. What I mean by vertical integration is being able to support both the RAA itself as well as being the custodian and having technology that crosses both of those, we think creates some differentiated options. So those would be the primary areas. Great. And just maybe on the ICA yield guidance. I think you said 200 basis points for the first quarter. Just curious how you are thinking about that trending through the rest of the year maybe assuming stable rates? And then just curious around what are the fixed and floating yields today broadly speaking and the reinvestment rate on the fixed or new extensions? Yes. I mean I think the guidance for Q1 at 210 basis points, that's just driven by where you get the full quarter effect of the October rate cut as well as where floating rates are currently. I mean you kind of Fed funds sitting in the 155 zone right now, just kind of on the low end of the range and you typically see, I would call it, around 20 basis point premium on that in the market.
On the fixed side, I think we have seen the curve flatten out and even inverted a few points. So I think on the fixed rate side, you are probably at that level or actually lower on any given day. We have typically put our deposits in the five-year plan of the curve and those would be a little bit lower. I think guidance for the rest of the year, I think we will take that one quarter at a time just given the number of things that can move that. But 210 is our view for the first quarter. Great. Thank you. Sure. Thank you. And we have a question from Chris Shutler with William Blair. Your line is open. Hi guys. Good afternoon. A follow-up on the RAA segment. I was curious, I know it's early, but how should we think about the economics to LPL in that affiliation model? Yes. Chris, definitely early. I mean I think when you get back to when you think about our ROA, that's obviously going to be primarily on the advisory side. It all depends on this affiliation there. So I think it's probably a little bit earlier, but the advisory returns are the key area to focus on. Okay. And then let's see, on the gross profit ROA, Matt, is there any way to give us a sense what the gross profit ROA looks like today for advisors brought on to the platform in recent quarters versus advisors brought on a couple of years ago before the big ramp in the recruited assets and advisor loans really began? Just trying to get a sense comparing those two tranches using a similar timeframe. Sure. I mean I think the big driver is going to be mix, right. So it depends on the asset mix they have and the platforms that they use. I think the best way to think about it is, brokerage dollars are in the low 20 basis point range, advisory dollars are in the low 30 basis point range. And advisory dollars, that's on essentially managed platform, is going to be in the low 40 basis point range, right. And then you start to, folks that are using our business solutions, say you using all four of them, you can even add up to five basis points from there. So it really depends on all the mix of the services that they use. If you go back a long time ago, I think where the asset mix was more brokerage versus advisory, I think that gives you a sense of how it's changed over time. Okay. Thank you. Sure. Thank you. And I am showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back to Dan for any closing remarks. Yes. Thanks Catherine. And thanks to everyone for taking the time to join us this afternoon and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Have a great day.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Arnold. Thank you, Josh and thanks to everyone for joining our call. Over the past quarter, the COVID-19 virus has altered both the economy and our daily lives. Given this, I first want to thank our employees for their remarkable hard work and commitment to supporting our advisors over the past few months. And I also want to thank our advisors for continuing to provide financial guidance to millions of Americans at a time when it is needed most.
More broadly, after executing on our strategy over the past several years, we have built an organization that not only performs well in good environments, but also excels in challenging times to provide strength for advisors and their clients. As we look ahead, we envision an even greater number of advisors and their clients seeking not only advice, but also the capabilities and stability LPL can provide. We are well positioned to meet this growing need and increase our market leadership. In that spirit, today I'm going to focus our discussion on three areas; first, our position and momentum entering this climate; second, how we are executing our COVID-19 contingency plans and finally, how we are driving the business forward from here.
Now, over the past several years with a focus on serving our advisors and their clients, we have built a robust and resilient operating platform, innovated on differentiated capabilities and enhanced our service experience. At the same time, we increased our balance sheet capacity and stability, which positions us to continue investing in a broad range of macro environments. This combination of business and financial strength has made our model more appealing in the marketplace and lead to positive momentum and higher levels of growth. We saw all of this reflected in our first quarter results.
Organic growth continued to increase in the first quarter as net new assets totaled 12.5 billion, which translates to a 6.5% annualized growth rate. This is the highest level we have recorded and up from 4.9% in the prior quarter, as new store sales, same store sales and retention all increased on a sequential basis. Looking more closely at new store sales, recruited assets were 8.4 billion in the first quarter and 36 billion over the past year. Turning to our financial results, first quarter EPS prior to intangibles was $2.06, which was up 7% from a year ago.
With respect to results around the advisory experience, I want to highlight two key indicators of our progress in this area. First, our advisor Net Promoter scores increased by another nine points in Q1 for a total increase of roughly 55 points in just over two years. Second, annualized production retention was a new high of 99% in the first quarter. As we look ahead, we will continue to work to drive favorable outcomes like these by investing in capabilities and technology, transforming our service model and attracting and developing extraordinary talent with our mission driven culture.
Now, let's move to how we are executing our contingency plans for COVID-19. We first identified the principles that mattered most to guide our efforts, taking care of our advisors so they can take care of their clients and protecting the health of our employees. We then used a data driven agile approach to work through this effort. Our Management Committee met daily to assess the changing dynamics, iterate on our plan, and take a series of actions guided by our principals. These actions included quickly stopping employee travel, and changing our approach to advisor conferences to avoid large group gatherings.
We also effectively moved over 90% of our staff to work from home while maintaining the high levels of service our advisors expect. To provide additional support for our employees through this period, we paid a cash bonus to those required to come to the office and for family members of employees who lost their jobs at other companies, we offered temporary roles and placement services. Remaining responsive to evolving conditions, we extended service hours to give our advisors more flexibility in their own work day.
Our research team also increased their level of support by providing around the clock updates, insights and forums to enrich our advisors guidance and communications as they work to keep their clients informed. And to help advisors lower trading cost, we added two more sponsors to our no transaction fee ETF platform. Through all of this, our systems were stable and resilient, handling up to seven times average daily trading volumes with no interruptions.
We're pleased with how our organization quickly and nimbly solved problems and worked through challenges so our advisors could continue to focus on serving their clients. Advisor feedback indicates they appreciate we have maintained continuity in our business and the assistance we provided to help them manage their own transition into working in these new ways. More broadly, we also see the emergence of new ways of thinking that will come out of this period such as a more distributed workforce model, and the increased utilization of automation and artificial intelligence.
These structural trends are creating opportunities to evolve certain aspects of how we work and serve our advisors, which we are incorporating into our plans. As we look ahead, regardless of the shape of the recovery, we see an even greater need for our solutions and are better positioned than ever to serve our existing advisors and compete for additional market share. Given this, we remain focused on our three strategic plays, and I thought it might be helpful to share some color on our progress. As a reminder, our first strategic play involves winning in our traditional independent and institutional markets, while also expanding our affiliation models to compete in new markets.
With respect to our traditional markets, we continue to bring advisors onto our platform and grow our pipeline. Our differentiated capabilities, resilient platform and stable balance sheet are an even greater competitive advantage in this environment, which in turn is leading to increased interest from prospective advisors. To capitalize on this interest, our business development team has created alternative digital approaches in order to continue recruiting and onboarding prospective advisors. These capabilities also provide an interesting leverage point to increase our business development reach and efficiency going forward.
Looking more closely at recent recruiting activity, January and February were some of our highest months of pipeline growth. Then in March, activity slowed as advisors focused on serving their clients through the market volatility and transitioning to work from home. As the climate stabilized in April, advisors had more time to work on the strategic elements of their business, and our pipeline growth returned to levels similar to January in February. As a result, April recruited assets were slightly above the monthly average in the first quarter, and our pipeline is now at the largest in its history.
Our work on expanding our affiliation models in the advisory oriented and employee markets is progressing and starting to deliver results. In April, we officially launched our premium offering as LPL Strategic Wealth Services. And our first team joined and is now operating and serving clients on our platform. Later this quarter, we have additional advisors scheduled to join and our pipeline continues to expand. As for our independent employee offering, we are still on track with our plans to go-to-market at the end of this quarter. Across both the employee and independent channels, we're hearing solid interest from prospective advisors.
We also continue to use M&A to complement organic growth. Earlier this week, we announced our acquisition of Lucia Securities, a San Diego based firm with 20 advisors and 1.5 billion in client assets. This transaction will give Lucia's advisors access to our differentiated capabilities, technology and service, and we look forward to them joining our platform later this year.
Our second strategic play involves creating an industry leading service experience that increases our ability to attract and retain advisors. The main components of this strategic play are investing to enhance and differentiate client works, transforming our service model into a client care model, and delivering instantaneous processing driven by robotics and artificial intelligence.
As part of our service model transformation, we are now providing omni-channel capabilities to over 3000 of our advisors. This approach combines interactive voice recognition with skills based routing to ensure our advisors can easily connect with a service professional who is trained and certified to answer their specific question. Given the positive feedback we have heard from advisors, we plan to roll out these capabilities to the rest of our advisors over the next quarter.
Our third strategic play is focused on helping advisors run the best businesses in the independent marketplace, using innovations such as outsourced business solutions, digitized workflows, advisor focused capital solutions and lead generation. The last few months have reinforced the importance of this strategic play and the value we can bring to advisors as their business partners. We remain focused on digitizing the six primary advisor workflows, and are about halfway through this effort.
In the first quarter, we completed the end-to-end integration of the first workflow, which is turning prospects into clients. As a result, when an advisor generates a proposal, and then a prospective client accepts it, a click of a button now populates all proposal information into our new account system. This integration makes it much more efficient for advisors to turn prospects into clients as they grow their business. As we move forward, we continue to focus on innovative solutions that make it easier for advisors to run successful businesses through any market conditions.
In summary, the focused execution of our strategy over the past few years has enabled us to be a source of strength and support for advisors and their clients during a time of unique need. As we all look ahead and try to envision what the future may look like, we believe our continued execution of our strategy, combined with the learnings and insights we've gained in this climate, position us to shape new opportunities for even more advisors and their clients and to continue creating long-term shareholder value.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt. Alright, thank you, Dan and I'm glad to speak with everyone on today's call. Before I review our first quarter results, I'd like to highlight some of our progress over the past few years to enhance both our business and financial strength. We invested in capabilities, technology and service with a focus on improving the support and experience of our advisors and their clients. These investments are some of the key factors that led to our record growth in more than doubling of our EBITDA to over 1 billion last year. Additionally, our growth combined with disciplined expense management increased our operating margins from the low 30% range to nearly 50%.
During the same period, we increase the stability and flexibility of our balance sheet through several debt refinancings, which resulted in lower interest expense, greater corporate liquidity, and longer term maturities, all while cutting our leverage ratio nearly in half. And perhaps most important of all, these steps positioned us to have an unwavering focus on supporting our advisors and their clients, which in turn, drove the highest level of organic growth in our history. And as we look ahead, while taking into account the impact of COVID-19 on the environment, we are even better positioned to drive long-term growth.
With that, let's now turn to our first quarter results. At a high level, our Q1 results are another example of the resiliency of our business and financial model during volatile times. The combination of strong organic growth, natural hedges from client cash balances and trading and discipline expense management lead to EPS prior to intangibles of $2.06. This was up 7% from a year ago, and is the highest result in our history.
Looking at our business results, we finished Q1 with total brokerage and advisory assets of 670 billion, down 12% from Q4, driven by the decline in equity markets, partially offset by organic growth. Total net new assets were 12.5 billion in Q1, or a 6.5% annualized growth rate. And within the quarter, as we look at the impact of COVID-19 on our growth, I would highlight that net new assets in March were 4.3 billion, our second best month ever. And as for the month of April, we have continued to see strengthen net new assets, which are trending to levels similar to the monthly average we saw in Q4.
Now looking at our business mix, we continue to see positive trends this quarter. Advisory assets increased over 48% of total assets, primarily driven by advisory inflows of 12.5 billion or a 14% annualized growth rate. Within our advisory platforms, centrally managed net new assets were 2.2 billion or a 17% annualized growth rate.
Before moving on, I'd like to share one final item on net new assets. As you know, organic net new assets is a key metric in our industry, both to evaluate individual company performance and to compare growth rates across our space. So it is important that our net new asset definition reflects both the full organic growth we are generating and be comparable across companies.
With that perspective, we evaluated our definition, as well as the prevalent practice of our peers. We found that while we do not include the combined contribution of dividends, interest and advisory fees, most firms do. In our business, these sources generate approximately 1.5% of asset growth per year.
So beginning in Q2, we will include these factors in our net new asset reporting. This update will more fully reflect our organic growth and make our results more comparable across the industry. We have provided historical data in our key metrics presentation. So you can see the net new assets generated from these sources.
Now let's turn to our q1 financial results. Our top line growth continued as gross profit was 576 million, up 37 million or 7% sequentially. Looking at the components, commission advisory fees net of payout were 162 million, up 28 million from Q4. The increase was mostly driven by seasonally lower production bonus expense, as well as higher advisory fees and sales commissions.
Looking ahead to Q2, I would highlight that advisory fees are primarily priced off of prior quarter balances. So the impact of the decline we saw in equity markets in the first quarter will be fully reflected in our Q2 results.
Moving on to asset based revenues, sponsor revenues were 134 million in Q1, up 1 million sequentially, driven by greater usage of our mutual fund and ETF no transaction fee platforms, partially offset by lower average assets.
Turning to client cash revenues, they were 151 million, down 4 million or 3% from Q4. The decrease was driven by lower short-term interest rates, mostly offset by higher client cash balances. Looking more closely at cash balances, they were 48 billion at the end of Q1, up 14 billion sequentially, with nearly all or 13.6 billion of that increase coming in the month of March.
When we look at April, cash balances have remained steady and have only declined slightly from the impact of advisory fee billings. As for client cash yields, our Q1 ICA yield was 195 basis points, down 27 basis points from Q4, mostly driven by the decline in short-term interest rates in March.
Looking ahead to Q2, we thought it'd be helpful to provide some additional disclosure in light of the dynamic environment. So we have shared new insight into our fixed, variable and overflow balances as part of our key metrics presentation. We hope you find this helpful when thinking through how our ICA yield will vary in different environments.
So given where balances and rates were at the end of Q1, we expect our Q2 ICA yield to be around 120 basis points. This assumes no further changes in interest rates, client rates or cash balances.
Moving on to Q1 transaction fee revenues, they were 137 million, up 19 million sequentially, primarily driven by the increase in trading activity in March. As we look ahead, while transaction volumes were somewhat elevated in early April, they have now returned to levels similar to Q4. Given this, April transaction revenue was about 5 million higher than our Q4 monthly average.
Now let's turn to expenses starting with core G&A. It was 223 million in Q1 or an annualized run rate of about 890 million.
As we look ahead to the full year, I wanted to share some context on our spending plans. We remain focused on balancing expense discipline, with growth investments, especially as environments like this can provide some of the best opportunities to drive organic growth. And as a reminder, we started the year with a core G&A outlook range of 915 to 940 million, or a 5.5% to 8% growth rate from our 2019 levels.
The increased investment is almost entirely dedicated to driving organic growth, both in our traditional markets like we saw in Q1, as well as in new markets. We have also sequenced our spending plans to build gradually through the year, which positions us to be flexible and dynamic, depending on how the year plays out and our Q1 expenses, with a run rate below the low end of our full year outlook range, further strengthens that position.
So as we think about the environment we're in right now, as well as the organic growth results our investments are generating, we believe the best way to drive long-term shareholder value is by continuing to invest, though at a more modest level, given that, we are now planning for our full year core G&A to be in the lower half of our outlook range. That said, we will remain flexible and are prepared to adjust our spending up or down depending on how our growth opportunities and the macro evolve from here.
Now turning back to Q1 promotional expenses, they were 57 million, up 6 million sequentially, primarily driven by higher advisor conference expense. Looking ahead, we have no large conferences in Q2, so we anticipate conference expenses will decrease by approximately 10 million sequentially.
Moving on to capital management, while the current macro environment has been volatile, we continue to generate strong cash flow. Even if we look at scenarios where the macro deteriorates meaningfully from here, our cash flow would still be well in excess of our needs, including serving our advisors, investing for growth, and paying regular dividends. This positions us well to continue to deploy capital while maintaining a strong balance sheet.
As for our approach to capital allocation, our framework is unchanged. We invest for organic growth, first and foremost, then pursue M&A opportunities where appropriate, and finally return excess capital to shareholders. And as we have discussed, we think this environment can provide us with even more opportunity to deploy capital for organic growth given the strength of our business and value proposition.
This climate may also create more M&A opportunities, and our approach here remains the same. We are interested in firms that are aligned strategically, financially and operationally and we're starting to see opportunities materialize like the acquisition of Lucia Securities we announced earlier this week. They are firm with 20 advisors and 1.5 billion in client assets. The transaction has an anticipated EBITDA purchase multiple of approximately six times and we expect it to close in the second half of this year. We are excited to welcome Lucia's advisors to the LPL family.
As for capital returns to shareholders, in Q1 we repurchased 150 million of our shares and paid 20 million of regular dividends. Given the uncertainty in the macro environment, and our increasing opportunities to deploy capital for growth, we paused our share repurchase program towards the end of Q1. We will revisit our plans as the macro stabilizes and we have more clarity on the path from here.
In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong results in Q1, including the best organic growth and earnings in our history. And as we look forward, we are excited about our opportunities to continue driving growth and creating long-term shareholder value.
With that operator, please open the call for questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. You may proceed with your question. Hey, good afternoon. So Matt, I wanted to start off with just a question on the ICA. Now really appreciate the enhanced disclosure on Slide 16 including the maturity schedule for the ICA contracts. Now this quarter to be unique although I would say that there was a broader industry trend and then you saw material uplift in cash and given cash has remained elevated in April, as you noted, and just some of the pressures of the long end. You still have your same 50% to 75% fixed target, but what's your appetite to deploy some of those floating balances today into fixed rate just given some of the pressures on the curve? Yeah, so I think there's a few factors at play there. I mean, I think first with our approach to long-term. I think our target of 50% to 75%, overtime, still holds and still makes sense. I think the key here is really about reducing our sensitivity to short-term movements and interest rates. And while we're subject of course to the interest rate environment, having that flow through our financials over a much longer period of time, I think helps us focus on our advisors what makes most sense for them from an investment standpoint. I think when you look at the market today, Steve and I'm with – to your point on the amount of cash that is on balance sheets right now. Things are much, much different than for an understatement of the call I suspect than just a few months ago with short-term rates zero and the 10 year to your point at about 50 basis points.
And I think that combined with the amount of cash that's out there I think that just the demand in market for fixed rate contracts now, I think is pretty light. There's some demand in the kind of the short end of the fixed rate part of the curve, meaning in the one to two years zone, so that I think there might be tactical opportunities there. But I think broadly we're – for right now we're focused on really putting those balances more in floating contracts, but contracts with a spread. And on the – and I'm sure you saw it on the disclosure that you referred to it towards the end of the quarter, we put in place another $5 billion variable contract at a spread in the 20 to 25 basis point range, versus the kind of those overflow contracts that are kind of flat. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color about the environment right now, but I think the long-term strategy is really unchanged. Now thanks for that color Matt and maybe just switching over to question for Dan. I was hoping then that you could provide us with some updated thoughts or color on the M&A backdrop. You recently executed a deal. At the same time, we're also hearing just across the industry that a lot of the private players that employ much more leverage are feeling just increasing levels of stress and I was hoping you can give some context as to what – how the M&A opportunity is evolving for maybe some more transformational deals, and also how the perception of weaker balance sheets of your competitors is maybe enhancing your ability to recruit given some of the strong numbers that you saw in April. Yeah, Steven, so there's a lot there. If I don't hit it all on the first try. You can just redirect me, but let's start with the M&A piece perhaps and I'll start from the strategic place, which is as you guys know, M&A continues to stay on our strategic radar. As a reminder first priority is the use of our capital to drive organic growth and then we use M&A as a complement. One of those opportunities we do see is with M&A across the small BDs and RIA segment of the marketplace. As you said, the Lucia transaction is a great example of that opportunity where we can create value for both the principals and advisors of those practice as we transition their business onto our platform. So we do continue to see an opportunity there. In environments like this we're coming out of them, we would anticipate based on what history would tell us is that there would be demand and opportunity for continued consolidation within that segment of the marketplace. And so, as we said in our remarks, we continue to look at that segment of the marketplace for opportunity.
I think with respect to the broader question you asked around transformational opportunities. I think that again, history would tell us that in times like this, where you've got a tougher macro conditions that potentially disrupt the overall economic drivers of firms. Yeah, add to that, perhaps leverage that they have, on their balance sheet creates tough conditions to have the capacity to continue to invest and thus drive those businesses in a meaningful way forward generating organic types of growth. And so I think we believe that with that as a backdrop, you will begin to see some potential conversations and dialogues about strategic pivots by those firms, absent some sort of V shaped recovery, and so again, I think we look at that in the same way we do with the other segment from an M&A standpoint is on our strategic radar. We look at it as a complement to organic growth. If it's aligned strategically, operationally and financially with our business, we would have an interest in having that type of dialogue. So hopefully that gives you some perspective, at least on the M&A landscape.
I think if you flip over to the question that you were asking about value propositions relative to the competition. I alluded to the fact that it can be tough, given the macro conditions with a highly leveraged balance sheet and some of the financial drivers of your top line growth challenged in this type of environment. I think for us, we look at our model and just continue to invest in it to enrich the competitive appeal of that model through its capabilities, its services, its technology, we feel good about that baseline value that we offer today. I think when you come through an environment like this with our resiliency, stability and those capabilities and you add to that the continued capacity to invest, we think that creates a pretty appealing scenario and an alternative for advisors to consider. And we'll continue then to take that position of strength and explore those possibilities across the independent space and the new markets that we've talked about in terms of attracting new advisors to our platform. So we think that creates a pretty compelling alternative option and if you don't have those opportunities associated with your model, then it makes us a pretty tough team to beat. Well, that's great Dan and thanks for indulging my three part follow up if you will. Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question. Hey guys, how are you. First question just around, I guess, organic growth. So in the past, we've seen a slowdown in net new asset growth during periods of market volatility. Obviously, your net new assets in March were really strong and comments about April also point to a much different – much more different picture than what we've seen in the past. I guess can you talk about sustainability of that growth, ability to convert the robust pipeline that you talked about into net new assets over the coming months and quarters. And I guess to what extent do you see your investments in tech and digital solutions as kind of a key differentiating factor at times of social distancing. Yeah, so it's a great question Alex. Let me take a stab at that. And again you're welcome to ask a follow on if I don't cover all of that. I think the – with respect to sustaining that type of NNA growth, I think that is certainly our aspiration and one of our primary areas of focus. And I think coming into the quarter, we had a good trajectory on that organic growth. And in Q1, we continued that trend. So that's certainly a nice jumping off point. I think as you look forward, we believe that capacity to invest, the investments we've made over the past three years, give us a real strong positioning from a competitive appeal, as we talked about. And again, our ability to continue to invest we think will continue to extend that differentiation and that competitive advantage. I think, you also then match that with the resiliency of our platform and the ability we've had to serve and support our advisors through what is a challenging and tough environment and you take that baseline, you add that to it, you add the ability to invest in it. And again, that combination creates an interesting opportunity for us as we think about sustaining that organic growth, both across new store sales, but also across same store sales and retention. And so I think we're pretty encouraged when we look at that package of options, alternatives and levers that we can continue to drive that that trajectory and trend with respect to our NNA over time. So short answer is, yeah, we feel pretty good about our continued focus on sustaining that and our competitive advantages, options, alternatives and tools in order to do that. Thanks for that. Yeah, you had a second part. I don't think I got you. No, I think you covered it pretty well. I think my second question was for Matt, also around ICA. I guess it was just hoping to get a little bit more color around, if there's any opportunity to expand the variable contract capacity to accommodate some of those overflow balances in order to pick up the 20 to 30 basis points spread. Sure, I mean, I think if you just look at the additional disclosure we put in for the quarter, I think we've got most of them in there with a contract that we put in place at the end of this quarter of around 5 billion. So you've now got just under 3 billion in the overflow balances and I think that of course, we'll always look for opportunities. But I think over the long-term here, those balances are probably not going to be in cash for an extended period of time. So I think we feel pretty good between the fixed portfolio and the increase of the variable capacity by 5 billion this quarter. Again, there'll be tactical things that we're working on I think might improve that a little bit from here, but I think the bulk of it, we were happy to get done at the end of March. Great, thanks very much. You bet. Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. You may proceed with your question. Thanks. Good evening everyone and hope you're all staying healthy. I had a gal to Alex's first question on the impressive April credit assets. How are you actively recruiting new advisors without the ability to hold in person meetings? And it sounds like your business can survive pretty much using Zoom and Skype, probably better than your competitors. Yeah, well, I'll speak for us. Look, we obviously make a big investment in recruiting and see it as a nice lever of organic growth. And if you look at over the last year, we've recruited 36 billion in assets and we feel good about the progress that we're making there in that ongoing trajectory. There's a couple of key drivers to that. It's certainly continuing to invest in the model and creating differentiated capabilities that create that competitive appeal that I talked about earlier. We feel good about that continued trend and the opportunity with some of the new capabilities we're delivering to continue to create a distinction there. And I think the second part is the efficacy of our business development team and their ability to continue to take what is a competitive differentiated solution and go effectively take that to the marketplace. And as you said, I think in the midst of March where – or I guess, the full force of the pandemic hit, it was quite disruptive to the typical and traditional recruiting processes that many of them were done in person.
And I think some of the work that we had done to automate and digitize a lot of the processes in the past were certainly the leverage points. But I think that that team's ability to really pull off and explore what were the options and alternatives and it'd be quite agile about different ways to solve where you couldn't travel or you couldn't have a home office visit or you couldn't go visit an office and bring them on board and help them transition into the platform. Then we created digitized tools to overcome those things so that we could continue our activities. And though, as we said March had an impact in terms of the overall recruiting. We did see some deals get pushed back into second quarter because of some of that complexity. We were able to mitigate some of those challenges with these digitized capabilities, and we'll continue to leverage them going forward. And they accentuate our opportunity set in April as we're seeing in some cases where we use a digitized means to onboard someone, creating a faster ramp up in assets than we've seen traditionally. So there's some cool possibilities there that we'll continue to work on, we'll refine, we still have things to learn. But it's all in the spirit of continuously getting better. If we split that strong March net new asset number into same store sales and new store sales contribution, do you know the rough mix and was there any change in composition in March versus what you saw in January and February? Yeah, maybe I'll take a stab at that first. And I'll let Matt give you some additional color. I think if you if you look, interestingly at the trends, you would have seen some stronger new store sales at the beginning of the quarter, that had some impact in March as the pandemic sort of took and created a bigger impact. I think, contrary to that same store sales actually strengthened through the quarter as the value proposition of these advisors providing insight and perspective both when the engagement was good beginning of the quarter, but the sentiment was positive, as well as in March where sentiment had completely changed, but again the engagement was still strong as there was a lot to help clients with in terms of how they think about their financial futures and their life goals and dreams. And so, we actually saw same store sales build throughout the quarter. Do you want to put a higher capstone on that? No, I was going to say same thing. So you summarized it well. Great, thank you, guys. Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Katz with Citigroup. You may proceed with your question. Okay, thank you very much and appreciate the extra disclosure, super helpful, but was doing okay. Maybe Dan, one for you perhaps just structurally and maybe it's too soon. You and your peers have seen just a tremendous spike in cash and like others you're sort of seeing a relatively steady state in April, despite the markets bouncing back. Do you think we've reached some kind of point where cash becomes a higher percentage of client assets all else being equal? What's your sense in your conversations in the field? Yeah, it's a really great question Bill. And it is early. We can look to history as a way to – as one source of data to think about that question. I think you can also look to human behavior and when you go through an impact like this, what sort of ongoing tail impact does it have on how people think about an allocation or even advisors allocations? My sense of it is this. I do believe you'll see cash in just more normalized market environments i.e. less volatility. You'll see more money get put back to work. Do we return to those 4% cash as a percentage of overall asset levels? I'm not sure, I think that's on the backs of a long sustained bull market and probably have more risk taking appetite than the one normally might. So as you think about the 4% range in assets that we jumped off of, to now it's roughly 7% of total assets. I think historically says you live in a five to six range and that may be a reasonable way to think about this over the long-term, acknowledging that there's lots of data to collect and more time to play out, but that might be a framework, at least of which to enrich your thinking. Okay, thank you for that. And my second question, I'm going to heat to a little bit of two parter, a little bit desperate, so I apologize. Can you give us an update on business solutions and how those conversations may have been evolving, particularly with just sort of the acceleration of volatility in the second quarter – in the first quarter? And then Matt maybe one for you, just going back to your decision to sort of slow – pause the buyback, how much of that is truly from the macro versus building M&A pipeline? Thank you. Yeah. So I'll take the business solutions first Bill and then I'll turn it over to Matt. So look, it's just for everyone, as a reminder, the business solutions is really about providing access to expertise and affordable way to help advisors operate their businesses. And in Q1 we had good momentum to start the quarter. The fundamental value proposition continues to resonate with our advisors. And we saw our subscriber base grow to around 700 in the first quarter, which is up roughly 50 over fourth quarter, so that's all a good solid baseline and we feel good about that. Certainly when COVID arrived, we saw two things that maybe are worth noting. The first is the advisors who were in the pipeline to potentially set up a subscription and begin to use one of those services, that progress slowed as they rightfully shifted their focus over to serving and supporting their clients and not it's prioritizing sort of starting something new. And I think that creates some short-term headwind in terms of working through that. We also cancelled some conferences that we would have typically used as sales forums for business solutions.
So we have to find other ways of which to consistently offer those types of solutions, which we do, but those are just sometimes centre pieces to how we offer those types of solutions in Q1. So that has a bit of a headwind as well. I think more on the favorable side of it, though the advisors that are using these services, given the complexity of the operating environment in the first quarter, the value of these solutions was magnified, whether it was the marketing solutions, not just helping them with lead generation, but helping them manage their client communications in a really intense time where the CFO solutions helping them with business stress testing or cash flow analysis and evaluations, the tech solutions where we actually came up with a really cool creative, turnkey remote office solution within literally two weeks, within the quarter to again, help advisors and working from home and making that simpler and easier. So it really does reinforce the value these solutions offered to the advisors. So, again, we were excited about the long-term opportunity set and the value they create. You just got some short-term headwinds that we've had to work through. Matt, you want to take the second part of it. Yeah, I think Bill on the repurchase program pause, I mean, the thing I would emphasize most is when we look at our organic growth and our value proposition, having a strong balance sheet is just critical and supportive of that. So being able to manage through a downturn like this, while continuing to generate cash, to have low leverage ratios compared to others in the space, to not being a bank with the risks that come along with being a bank and needing capital to support it and having losses associated with loans. I could go on and on, right. So I think those things are really, really important. So when you look at continuing to do share purchases in an environment like this, we really balance that against being able to have that strong balance sheet and being able to support everything that we need, so I think it's out of an abundance of caution. I think kind of getting more clarity on where the macro goes from here I think we'll help on that front. So I think that's the primary thing. I think when you look at M&A, I think those opportunities are there and interesting. I think Dan described that well. The only thing I would add is just the reminder M&A, you've got a lot of clarity on the EBITDA that comes with that. And given our price discipline there, it's not – unless you're talking large, large deals. That's not typically a big user of leverage given our price discipline combined with the EBITDA that'll come along. So hopefully that helps you get a little perspective or color on our perspective. Thank you, Bill. Thank you. Our next question comes from Gerry O'Hara with Jeffries. You may proceed with your question. Great, and thanks for taking my questions this afternoon or this evening potentially. The centrally managed portfolios, obviously a very strong NNA growth continues. Just trying to get a sense around sort of the adoption from advisors of this program and kind of where you might see it trending on a go forward basis. Is it sort of wholly adopted by the advisors at this point? Is it sort of still in an evolutionary stage or what is it that's continuing to drive this strong NNA growth going forward. Now, let me give you a little color on that. Again, Matt, if you want to add anything behind that. So look, if I took at a high level, I think you're in the earlier part of the nine innings game in terms of the adoption and utilization of centrally managed solutions. And I think the continued investment we make in the capabilities, the flexibility, the optionality we give the advisors, the improvement and user interfaces all will help support and drive the continued use of centrally managed platforms. I think we recognized there's more innovation out there for us to work on and add to those centrally managed solutions, such that you've got terrific investment options and strategies that help those advisors create and add value to their clients. You can do it in a highly simplified, digitized way that gives access to the advisor to kind of take their hands on and off the wheel is a really interesting appealing package of value to those advisors. As we continue to evolve our capabilities there, we think there's a correlation between the evolution of those capabilities and the utilization of the centrally managed platforms.
What's driving it? I think advisors more and more recognize and look for that it can be a great leverage point their overall practice and as they try to either lower their costs or create more flexibility to reallocate their time to more valuable activities, I think this becomes a more and more appealing type of concept that they can use as a leverage point to their practices. So we create a really appealing solution. Their need for will only evolve and grow as they look for more leverage points in their practice, that's we think, a nice combination to drive a long sustainable trend, which is why we say it's in the early parts of the game. I don't know if Matt, you want to add anything to that? No, I think that was well said. That's helpful and I guess one for Matt specifically and I apologies if I missed this or if there was a read through it is perhaps somewhat clear, but I guess intuitively promotional expenses would likely come in, in the current coming quarters, assuming all else equal with the current backdrop. But one, I guess, can you perhaps kind of confirm that statement? And then two, have you kind of thought about ways to perhaps – I don't know if this is impossible, but digitize if you will, that this sort of activity or if there's sort of virtual capabilities that will enable you to kind of continue down the road of certain promotional activities. Yeah, sure, Gerry, I mean, I think on both of those the promotional expenses in Q2, we have very few, if any conferences, so they'll come down specific to the conference piece of that by about 10 million. So there's definitely a decline there. On the second part of your question, I'll just give a little bit of the financial ends and then Dan, if you want to jump in. But our national conference, our largest conference of the year is in Q3 and we have already decided to move that to a virtual conference. So we are in the planning stages of that. So I think to answer the question it's definitely possible. We are in the middle of working on that. And obviously, Dan's in a better spot to give some color on that than me. Yeah, so obviously, pulling together 8,000 to 9,000 people in July doesn't sound like a great risk to take given the backdrop and so we announced that we would shift this to a virtual conference. A lot of folks are working on that same concept. There's again, some interesting technologies and cool ways of which to share that content in a more digital platform. And so we're working through exactly how we would do that, the cost associated with doing that, working with sponsors to be a part of that overall program, so more to come on that. But I think Matt's right, as we think about third quarter and that being our largest conference. As we get through the other side of that and would expect you to see some shift or change in the overall economics around focus on our big conference. Okay. Great, thanks for taking my questions this afternoon. Thank you. Our next question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. You may proceed with your question. Hey, great, good evening, guys. First question here just on upfront contracts in the industry, obviously had seen kind of those scaling up in recent years just as there's quite a bit of competition and also your firms have the benefit of higher interest rates that was maybe supporting some of that spending or investment if you will. With interest rates and equity markets abruptly moving lower, I guess what are you guys seeing with upfront recruiting packages? I appreciate it's probably early. And whether you guys expect to hold the line, which would maybe further accelerate organic growth or potentially would you move that lower, which would make the recruiting economics even more attractive, assuming the organic growth remains strong to kind of think about how that may affect things moving forward? Yeah, Devin, I mean, I think on the way we approach that is really a change. We changed, we adjusted our approach a couple of years ago, just underwrite to returns. We're continuing to underwrite those returns. We've never put into those models any sanguine view, if you will, on the macro, so we'll update based on the environment we're in that could buy things down a little bit, but I would – as a general rule, but each deal is individually underwritten dependent on the mix of that firm and what products and services they use, but we'll continue to underwrite returns, so no change there. Got it, very helpful and then just to follow up on customer cash, appreciate all the detail in the presentation and the commentary on the ICA portfolio. With respect to the DCA piece, you guys updated the fee schedule. And just trying to think about whether there's more room to do that and kind of the inputs to do that, just trying to think whether there might be some additional opportunity for that piece as well kind of down the road here. Yeah, I mean, I think when you think about that product, it's one word to fee per account. So the balances in there kind of – are the – drive the overall economics. So I think that the changes that we made that you referred to are based on where those balances are. And I think if that changes over the long-term that could impact things. But I think we feel like with the adjustments we've made that that product is in the right spot and a competitive spot for the clients that have investors in there. Okay, great. Leave it there. Thanks, guys. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JP Morgan. You may proceed with your question. Hi, good evening. I'm just curious to hear your thoughts if you think there might be a longer term impact of COVID-19 on the wealth management business, either the way that advisors will manage their relationships or work from home or something else that really changes the efficiency of the advisor in their business. Yeah. So Ken, I think there's no doubt this will create some structural change across the market and the industry and I think probably history again tells us the magnitude that change will likely be driven by the desire of individual firms and how much they want to embrace and pull that change through. And we entered this environment with – as I said earlier, where we established some principles that drove how we think about this opportunity. And that starts with taking care of our advisors so they can take care of their clients and also at the same time protecting the health and safety of our employees. So those principles drove our thinking, our decision making through this and actually, given this significant change across both of those spectrums, there's a tremendous amount of learning opportunity that sits inside that change, right, which took us to the next place we went to in managing through this was our culture and our values. And one of our values is a commitment to learning and applying that learning to drive innovation in an agile way.
And so in a climate like this, where we talked about this significant change, we believe it creates an incredible opportunity to learn and apply that learning going forward to drive real structural differences in the business. And I think you hit on in the spirit of brevity one of those examples, which would be how people think about a distributed workforce. And what does that mean as you apply that to 4,500 employees in our case or nearly 17,000 advisors and how we support engage with them or even as you said, how we – how they would engage in, in millions of their clients. And so we believe there's a real ripe opportunity that this creates an opening of which to think about things in a different way and opens up the playing field, if you will, do experimentation, to do things that you may never have done otherwise. There could be jobs that you didn't think were possible to do remotely from home that all of a sudden by doing it, you now have a different point of view on that and that shapes how you think about managing your workforce, flexible schedules, how you access talent and even how you manage your real estate portfolio.
And that's just one example, right, that sits inside that structural changes suggested. We believe the whole use of robotics, AI and digital tools will be different going forward, people's thinking around outsourcing and supply chains will be changed forever by this if they have a desire to pull that through. And I think we're looking at it those things and more, really challenging ourselves to make sure we lean into the learning opportunities, and how you may pull through those changes to reshape your cost structure, to reshape how you engage with your employees all the way to how you position your advisors to deliver a different client experience to their client. So that's the spectrum of opportunity we kind of see coming out of this. There will be more to emerge. It's early. We've got a lot to learn, but we're trying to be purposeful about getting our arms around as much as that isn't cancer and be thoughtful and having an informed view is the best way forward. Great, well, thank you very much. Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Shutler with William Blair. You may proceed with your question. Hey, guys, hope you're all doing well. To follow up on Devin's question from earlier. How does the change in the interest rate environment affect what you're willing to pay for advisory assets? Are you underwriting a much lower Fed funds rate today, given the environment or when you think about TA do you kind of structure it in the hopes that rates bounce back? Yeah. Great, Chris. So we – I think I use my SAP word. We're not sanguine on the macro in the earlier answer. So we don't assume any improvement in macro. We underwrite to returns in the current environment that means the current interest rate environment. And then based on again, each deal is individually underwritten. And we say disciplined on that, I mean, undirected returns. Okay, fair enough. And then just a second one, just a small question on the conferences, since you're going to be doing those virtually this year, I think you mentioned the $10 million reduction in conference expense from Q1 to Q2, anything you can say about the remainder of the year and how both revenue and expenses will be impacted? Yeah, I think the Q2 reduction is really just based on the timing of conferences, which this year are planned primarily for Q1 and Q3. I think in Q3 where we have our focus conference that Dan talked about a little bit earlier, going virtual, I think just to give you a sense that conference is typically around 15 million in costs and around 5 million or 6 million in sponsor revenues. So I think as we approach moving to a virtual conference, I think we'll think through how those expenses evolve. You'll have obvious things like travel expenses, there won't be any rights that'll bring cost down, but at the same time, we're focused on investing in the virtual areas of the digital capabilities of that conference to make it something that's compelling and helpful, for the very reasons that we do that conference, right. So we're in the planning stages now. We'll give you an update next quarter in Q2, so you have a sense as to our best estimate as to what's coming in Q3 then. Okay, thanks a lot. Thank you. And hey, thanks to everyone for taking the time to join us this afternoon and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter, stay healthy. Thank you.

[Operator Instructions]
Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.
[Operator Instructions]
I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today to Mr. Dan Arnold, President and CEO. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir. Thank you, Dilan, and thanks to everyone for joining our call today. Over the past quarter, in the face of a challenging operating environment, our advisers have responded with resilience, flexibility and ingenuity. I want to acknowledge the essential roles they are playing by providing much needed financial advice to millions of Americans, while at the same time, pivoting their own practices to work remotely. I also want to thank our employees for their ongoing commitment and dedication to our mission of taking care of our advisers so they can take care of their clients. Now while the environment we are operating in has changed, our principles remain the same. We believe a good strategy matched with extraordinary execution and alignment with a mission-driven culture will drive long-term growth and value. Following those principles, in the second quarter, we continued to focus on executing the components of our business priorities, while also moving forward on our strategic plan. Today, I will share color on both of those areas.
Starting with our business results. Organic growth remained solid as second quarter net new assets totaled $13 billion, which translated to a 7.8% annualized growth rate. This was our third quarter in a row at 7% or higher and was driven by continued strength across new store sales, same-store sales and retention. In the second quarter, recruited assets were at new high at $11.1 billion. These results against the backdrop in which industry adviser movement was down by over 30% from a year ago are a testament to the appeal of our model and the performance of our business development team. Looking at the past year, recruited assets were nearly $39 billion, which is also a new high for the team.
With respect to the adviser service experience, we were able to pull forward solid outcomes in a challenging operating environment as our Net Promoter Scores remain consistent with the increased levels we delivered in Q1. Additionally, our retention was at a new high of over 98% for the first half of the year as the flexibility of our affiliation models, evolving capabilities and enhanced service experience continue to resonate with advisers.
These key business results also led to solid financial outcomes with second quarter EPS prior to intangibles of $1.42. Now while we remain focused on operating the business in the second quarter, the influence of the remote work environment created new challenges and opportunities to solve for. As an example, to help advisers effectively operate remotely, we developed a bundle of new and enhanced capabilities, including an online calendaring solution for advisers and their clients to schedule time to meet virtually; intra-office instant messaging for advisers to stay connected with their staff remotely; and a more digitized, centrally managed platform experience with greater model flexibility. We also continue to evolve how we engage with our advisers in the new and more virtual landscape. Instead of canceling our national adviser conference this summer, we pivoted to a fully digital experience. Similar to the format of our traditional in-person meeting, the 3-day program will include livestream general sessions, a mix of breakout meetings, technology demos, a virtual sponsor exhibit hall and online networking. With the event now online, we can potentially reach all 17,000 of our advisers and their staff rather than the 5,000 who might normally attend in-person. As we look forward, we expect new virtual approaches like these will become another way that we can support our advisers and their clients over time.
Let's now turn to our progress executing on our strategy. As we look ahead, we continue to see growing demand for advice, and believe we are better positioned than ever to serve our advisers and compete for additional market share. In light of this, we remain focused on executing the strategy we've shared with you in the past. And while that strategy has not changed, we have evolved from 3 strategic plays to 4, which enhances our focus on how we innovate and execute on our strategic agenda. You can see our updated framework in our investor presentation.
Now with that as context, let's walk through our progress on our strategic priorities, starting with our first strategic play. This play involves meeting advisers where they are in the evolution of their practices by winning in our traditional markets, while also leveraging new affiliation models to expand our addressable markets from $4 trillion to $13 trillion. With respect to our traditional markets, the appeal of our model continues to attract more advisers on to our platform and strengthen our pipeline. In addition, the continued evolution of our digital capabilities within the sales process and for adviser onboarding has proven to be an increasing source of competitive advantage. As a result, interest from prospective advisers continue to grow, and our pipeline is the largest in our history. Another opportunity to grow in our traditional markets is by increasing our market leadership in the third-party bank channel. Yesterday, we announced that we reached an agreement with M&T Bank to transition its wealth management business on to our platform. M&T is a top 25 U.S. bank with approximately $20 billion in brokerage and advisory assets and 170 financial advisers. They will become our largest financial institution client when they onboard next year. We look forward to the opportunity to help them serve and support their clients, expand their value proposition and contribute to growth in their business.
With respect to our new affiliation models, in June, we launched our independent employee offering. We're seeing solid early interest from prospective advisers, and we expect the model to contribute to our opportunity set, pipeline and results going forward. We're also using M&A of adviser-owned practices as an additional source of growth. The 2 acquisitions we announced over the past quarter, Lucia Securities and E.K. Riley have approximately 55 advisers and $3.5 billion of assets combined. Approximately 95% of advisers across those 2 firms have committed to join, and both transactions are on track to close later this year.
Our second strategic play is focused on providing capabilities that help advisers differentiate and win in the marketplace. This in turn helps existing advisers grow their practices and attracts new advisers to our platform. Within this play, we are focused on equipping advisers with digital capabilities to help increase their accessibility, deepen their relationships, attract new clients and lower their costs. In that spirit, over the past quarter, we began the rollout of our new mobile app. This solution goes beyond typical transactional information to create a new way for advisers to help their clients digitally engage in their personal financial journeys. The tool enables advisers to personalize the interface for their practice and individual clients, while also providing clients with enhanced views of progress towards their financial goals. As we look ahead, we plan to continue to invest in this area to help advisers enhance the overall experience for their clients.
Let's next move to our third strategic play, which involves creating an industry-leading experience to delight advisers and their clients, which in turn, increases our ability to attract and retain advisers. The main components of this strategic play are transforming our service model into a client care model and using robotics and artificial intelligence to deliver instantaneous processes.
As part of our service model transformation, I want to highlight 2 technology-driven enhancements that we made over the past quarter. First, we scaled our omnichannel capabilities from 3,000 advisers to nearly 16,000. This means nearly all of our advisers benefit from the combination of interactive voice recognition with skills-based routing to a service professional, who is trained and certified to answer their specific question. Second, we introduced new speech analytics capabilities to enhance our quality management. We are now using artificial intelligence and machine learning to capture and score the sentiment of each service call. This positions us to quickly identify emerging service issues and more systemically and proactively address it. At the same time, we can also use this data to enrich how we develop and manage our service professionals. Our advisers continue to share positive feedback on our service model transformation, and tell us that it is a key contributor to our increased Net Promoter Scores and retention levels.
Our fourth strategic play is focused on helping advisers run the most successful businesses in the independent marketplace, using innovations such as outsourced business solutions and adviser-focused capital solutions. With respect to business solutions, in early June, we introduced our newest offering, the Assurance Plan. As context, across our industry, 70% of advisers don't have a succession solution in place. The Assurance Plan can help our advisers with this challenge by protecting the value of their businesses in the event of an unplanned exit. With this plan, we provide an annual valuation, and we facilitate a commission-free sale to another qualified LPL adviser at a guaranteed minimum purchase price. This gives advisers the peace of mind that their family and clients will be taken care of, and it strategically positions us to continue serving clients and assets through succession events. After launching in June, we signed over 150 subscribers in the first 2 weeks. We look forward to continuing to providing this solution along with our broader portfolio of offerings to help advisers run and grow their businesses.
Before closing, I also want to share that we have thought a lot about the growing need in our businesses and our country to address issues of inequality. To inform our learning, the management committee and I have been talking with business leaders, advisers and employees in the black community while simultaneously engaging with all members of the LPL family in the spirit of understanding and building empathy. Within LPL, there is a broad consensus around the desire to take action to make a difference. In order to do that, we are creating a strategy to promote racial equality and equity at LPL. There are definitely no easy or quick fixes to solve these challenges, but we are committed to making progress for our advisers and their clients, our employees and future generations.
In summary, in the second quarter, we continue supporting our advisers and their clients while driving growth and increasing our market leadership. As we look ahead, we see an opportunity to not just return to business as usual, but rather create a future that is better than ever for our advisers and their clients. We believe that continuing to execute on our strategy will achieve this goal and create long-term shareholder value.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt. Thank you, Dan, and I'm glad to speak with everyone on today's call. Before I get into my prepared remarks, I just wanted to encourage everyone to take a look at Page 3 of our press release. We described several non-GAAP measures that Dan and I used to discuss the business. And as name would state, they are non-GAAP measures, and we provide reconciliations to each of the relevant GAAP measure. In addition, on Page 4 of that release, we also describe some forward-looking statements that Dan and I will use to discuss our business results today, and actual results could vary materially from those estimates. So please keep that in mind as well.
Now as we turn to the quarter, the macro environment remains uncertain, but we have never been more certain about the importance of the role our advisers play in helping their clients achieve their financial goals and dreams. That is why we continue to invest to provide an industry-leading value proposition for our advisers to serve their clients and win in the marketplace. These investments, in turn, help us drive growth, and in Q2, we generated the highest organic growth rate in our history. So as we look ahead, we are excited about the opportunities we see to continue serving our advisers, growing our business and creating long-term shareholder value.
Now let's turn to our second quarter results, starting with total brokerage and advisory assets. They were $762 billion, up 14% from Q1, driven by continued organic growth and higher equity markets. Looking at organic growth, total net new assets were $13 billion or a 7.8% annualized growth rate. This was the highest quarterly level we have recorded and double our pace from a year ago. Moving to recruiting and retention, which are 2 key drivers of organic growth, both reached new highs in the second quarter. Recruited assets were $11.1 billion, and retention was 98.6% year-to-date. Looking at our business mix, we continue to see positive trends in Q2. Advisory assets increased to over 49% of total assets, primarily driven by advisory net new assets of $10.2 billion or a 13% annualized growth rate. Within our advisory platforms, centrally managed net new assets were $1.3 billion or an 11% annualized growth rate.
Now let's turn to our Q2 financial results. Strong organic growth combined with continued expense discipline led to EPS prior to intangibles of $1.42. Looking at commission and advisory fees net of payout, they were $131 million, down $31 million from Q1. The decrease was primarily driven by seasonally higher production bonus expense, lower advisory fees following the Q1 equity market decline and lower sales commissions. Moving on to asset-based revenues. Sponsor revenues were $131 million in Q2, down $3 million sequentially as average assets decreased in the quarter.
Turning to client cash revenues. They were $116 million, down $35 million from Q1, primarily driven by lower short-term interest rates. Looking more closely at client cash balances, they remained elevated throughout the quarter and finished Q2 at $45 billion. I also want to give you an update on our ICA portfolio. As a reminder, when ICA balances increased rapidly in March, we took action that same month to secure $5 billion of new variable rate capacity. This allowed us to minimize the amount of overflow balances, which currently have a yield close to 0. In Q2, we continued that work by adding another $5 billion of variable rate capacity, which allowed us to move the remaining overflow balances to higher-yielding contracts. We also continue to grow our fixed rate portfolio by adding another $1 billion of fixed rate balances, bringing the total to over $13 billion. I would note that given the flatness of the yield curve, we added these new balances at the 1-year point, which was about 60 basis points at the time. As for client cash yields, our Q2 ICA yield was 127 basis points, down 68 basis points from Q1. The decrease was primarily driven by the full quarter impact of lower short-term interest rates, partially offset by the benefit of the Q2 ICA portfolio enhancements that I highlighted. Looking ahead to Q3, our ICA yield will reflect the remaining impact of lower LIBOR rates as well as the maturity of $0.5 billion of fixed rate balances. Given these factors and where interest rates, client rates and cash balances were at the end of Q2, we expect our Q3 ICA yield to be around 115 basis points.
Moving on to Q2 transaction and fee revenues. They were $119 million, down $18 million sequentially. The decrease was primarily driven by lower transaction volumes following the record Q1 activity levels. Looking ahead to Q3, volumes have returned to more normalized levels, which on a run rate basis would result in a decline in transaction revenues of around $5 million from Q2.
Now let's turn to expenses, starting with core G&A. It was $222 million in Q2, roughly flat to Q1. This brings our core G&A expense for the first half of the year to an annualized run rate of about $890 million, which is below the low end of our outlook range. Looking ahead, as our investments are resonating with advisers and driving record levels of growth, we feel confident in our spending plans for the second half of the year. At the same time, the operating environment remains volatile. So we plan to stay flexible and dynamic on expense management. Given these factors, we continue to manage to the lower half of our core G&A range of $915 million to $940 million.
Moving on to promotional expenses. They were $45 million, down $13 million sequentially as we had no major conferences in Q2. Looking ahead to Q3, we will host our National Adviser Conference, and while we pivoted to a virtual format, we are still investing to create a meaningful and engaging conference experience for our advisers, including a new digital platform, content over several days and outside speakers. Given the conference as well as continued growth and transition assistance from our recruiting success, we expect our Q3 promotional expense to be around $60 million.
Moving on to capital allocation. Our framework continues to be investing in organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A opportunities where appropriate and returning excess capital to shareholders. Looking at the components of our framework, organic growth continues to provide the highest and most attractive returns on our capital. Our investments here are working well, so we plan to continue prioritizing organic growth as we deploy capital. M&A can also provide compelling returns, and while the timing is inherently difficult to predict, we want to remain positioned to take advantage of opportunities should they arise. As for capital returns to shareholders, given our focus on preserving capital for organic growth and M&A, combined with the continued uncertainty in the macro environment, we plan to remain paused on share repurchases for now, though we will stay flexible and dynamic as we move forward.
In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong results in Q2, including the highest organic growth rate in our history. As we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue investing to serve our advisers, grow our business and create long-term shareholder value.
With that, operator, please open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions]
I show our first question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Crédit Suisse. We can see from Slide 16 that LPL now represents 15% of the bank market after the M&T partnership closes mid next year. Can you help us think about the size and timing of future partnerships with the remaining 85% of the market that is not currently serviced by LPL? Yes. Thanks for the question. And look, I think as we look at the bank marketplace, as you say, it's roughly $1 trillion. And if you click that down further, about 2/3 of the market today does not outsource to a third-party provider like ourselves, about roughly 1/3 does. And what we've been doing is exploring our opportunity set in that overall $1 trillion market. One way to do that was to explore working on new expanded solutions that would make outsourcing more appealing to larger banks and create that openness and willingness to explore a strategic alternative.
And so with respect to M&T, that's what we were able to do. And they run their own BD today or broker-dealer today and RIA post that and transitioning to our platform. The value that we would offer is -- will reduce their risk across this business line significantly. We help enhance their client experience and the solutions that are made available to them across this business line. We'll increase the financial contribution of this program to the overall enterprise, and we can also work on custom integrations that help create unique offerings to their clients. And so we think that's an interesting and compelling solution for larger banks that has historically not outsourced this business line. And so we're using that solution to engage in some other financial organizations that tend to be in larger in size and exploring whether or not it would be an interesting option or alternative for them. So that's where we are in that process. So I hope that helps answer your question. Very helpful there. And then we've been very impressed with the progression of your organic growth over the last few years, now around 8%, very high level. In 2021, when you have both the employee and pure RIA channels open, I wanted your thoughts to see if we could get another step-up in the firm's organic growth rate? Yes. So our strategy with respect to our overall organic growth is absolutely to continue to work on increasing that growth rate. Q2, we were able to achieve 7.8% annualized growth rate. We had good momentum coming into the quarter, which was always helpful as we have had 7-plus percent growth rates in the prior 2 quarters. We continue to see and invest in the appeal of the model. So it continues to evolve and grow, and that certainly is helpful. We've also seen the continued improvement enhancement of the overall efficacy of our business development team and their ability to share our message and do it in really create an effective digital and data-driven ways. And we think that those 2 are big time structural drivers to the overall value of our model, and the ability to then continue to achieve these types of growth rates. At the same time, if we continue to improve the service experience that enhances our overall retention numbers, you get a really good, strong baseline performance. You add to that these new models like the independent employee model, as an example, and that begins to be an additional catalyst or leg up to give us more opportunities in the batter's box to drive greater growth. And so we continue to drive up growth rates in our traditional markets. We get more swings in the batter's box with these new markets. We think those 2 things together will help us continue to drive up growth. You complement that with continuing to increase your retention levels and maintain good same-store sales levels, you end up driving up growth. So that's what we're trying to do. We feel good about our ability to do that. Our next question comes from Bill Katz from Citigroup. I was just sort of wondering, given the -- the exit momentum you've had through the quarter -- thank you for the monthly details, if you could maybe just sort of color out or frame out the July trends. And I'm sort of curious around sort of net new asset and mix dynamics, what's happening with cash? And then underneath that, Matt, I think you said, if you $630 million sort of yield levels, but I think yields have come in a little bit more since then. So how to sort of think about that stress test on the ICA yield? Yes. Sure, Bill. I mean, I think when we look at July on cash balances, remember, I'm sure you do, but just for everybody, remember, the first month of a quarter is when the largest buck of advisory fees gets charged to clients. So that will naturally reduce cash. So if you put that aside and just look at the activities for cash balances in July, they've actually grown. So you've started to see, not substantially, but they've moved up a little bit. I think on the yields, it's -- I think the 115 basis point comment was where everything was at the end of the quarter. I haven't seen anything so far in July that would meaningfully move that.
On the net new asset trends, just keep in mind the shift in the tax deadline this year from April to July, I think in the month that personal income taxes are due, I think you see across our industry, we are no different. That's usually a net new asset month that's relatively subdued as people are using those investable assets to pay some taxes. And what you typically see is subdued NNA through most of the month. And then as you get towards the end of the month, when you're removed from that tax deadline, you start to see NNA come back to more normalized levels. And that's exactly what we've seen in July. As we kind of come in here towards the end of the month, we're starting to ramp back up at levels that are consistent with Q2.  So I think I got -- I think that covers all 3 questions, right? Yes. Well, that's my first question. Okay. Second one, just maybe a big picture question. Certainly appreciate sort of the added opportunity set with the Assurance Program. Is there any balance sheet recourse risk that we need to think through on this effort? Yes. I'll take that one, too, Bill. I mean, no. I mean, I think the key thing is to keep in mind what the plan is. And I think Dan described it well in his remarks, but it's really about helping advisers bridge the value of their business, if they do end up having an unfortunate event, an untimely passing or disability where they can't continue to serve their clients. And you can imagine, as a retail investor, if all of a sudden, your adviser is not there, a quick transition is really, really important to preserve the value of that practice. So I think that's the primary thing that we do. We provide that peace of mind and that guarantee. But also when you look across our practice with 17,000 advisers, I think we've got a long list of folks that are quickly and qualified to be buyers of these practices. So I'd really view it as us providing a service to really bridge in an instance like this and really protect the value of the practice for the family really and also to get those retail investors to a new home where they can be served well. So I think that's the #1 thing I keep in mind. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. So I wanted to start off -- on the last earnings call, Dan, you spoke of some of the challenges potentially marketing, Business Solutions during work from home, but we did see some nice acceleration in terms of subscriber additions in Q2. I was hoping you could speak to some of the factors that contributed to that positive surprise. And just with the addition of new solutions, including remote office and succession planning, is Business Solutions still expected to be accretive to firm-wide ROA? And are the -- said differently, are the fee dynamics still better than the blended ROA for the firm? Yes. Steven, thanks. So with respect to the sort of the first part of that question, I think if you look back at Business Solutions over the quarter, you saw a couple of things occurring. A, you saw advisers very much focused on serving and supporting their existing clients. And the -- sort of the extreme conditions they were in of having to focus and spend significant amount of time with their clients, that created new opportunities. As an example for our virtual CMO program, where the CMO shifted to helping their advisers manage those client relationships and those client communications. With respect to the CFO offering, the downside planning and helping them understand cash flows and to think about how to transition through any potential change within their practice was clearly an important value to provide in the short run, and then certainly having a virtual admin made it much, much easier to move to a remote environment. So probably the most significant thing that occurred in the quarter is that really reinforced the structural value associated with the Business Solutions. And I think you're now seeing, as we come out of that volatile period, that reinforcement of that value, we're very optimistic on the continued potential increase in subscriptions associated with those traditional solutions. Inside the quarter itself, it was hard for advisers that weren't using those practices to pull up and try to engage in them and start them a new inside the quarter, given the focus on their clients. So we didn't see as many new sales on those items within the quarter, but again, I think we're seeing that trend change as we're coming out of that period of volatility. What we've also seen, though, is the ability to continue to innovate and add new capabilities and new solutions, whether it be the Assurance Plan, whether it be a remote office solution, it helped advisers quickly pivot to operating remotely with this turnkey technology solution. So we continue to create new services within the overall offering. Those new services drove a higher proportion of the overall sales in Q2 than the traditional ones did. And if you look at the overall mix or the ROA, we still expect that to have a higher contribution than the overall baseline business. That said, some of these services are more labor intensive and scale differently. So they would probably have higher revenue and higher cost. Some of these new solutions, like the Assurance Plan, would have lower revenue but much lower cost. And so that would be a way to maybe think about the traditional solutions versus the -- some of the newer ones that we've just come up with in the quarter. I hope that helps. Yes, that's very helpful. And just a follow-up for Matt. I was hoping you could give some additional detail relating to the M&T transaction, and how should we be thinking about the potential earnings accretion from this deal? And maybe just any context you can give around the blended ROA that you typically earn on these bank mandates and any incremental costs associated with servicing those assets? Yes. Sure, Steve. I think when you look at an institution like an M&T, those firms are usually more brokerage than advisory. So if you look at -- if we just start with the baseline of the gross profit ROA on our brokerage business, which is in the 15 to 20 basis point range, and an institution of this size, I think, would be at the lower end of that, right, so 15 basis points. And then when you look at the cost to serve because of that same size and scale, the cost to serve would be -- also be a lot lower. And then you add on top of that, the transition assistance, which we -- our principle of underwriting for returns would be matched up here. So you put all that together from a -- if we look at it from an EBITDA margin lens, it would be accretive to our EBITDA margins, if you just look at what we delivered this quarter. So I think we're -- as Dan said in his remarks, we're excited about the opportunity to serve M&T and help them help their clients. Our next question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. So Matt, first question I wanted to dig a little bit more on the promotional expense guidance. So I appreciate the conference, but it's still a pretty meaningful step up sequentially, and it feels like the virtual conference, should be somewhat cheaper than the actual conference. So maybe help bridge the delta from this quarter to next quarter? What's TA versus what's the conference? And I guess, just a little bit bigger picture, given the success you guys are having recruiting in a virtual format, should we be thinking about the promotional expense relative to the growth of the company just being a little bit slower, I guess, a smaller percentage going forward once things are normalized? Yes. I think on the second question, Alex, the teams that are doing the recruiting, those costs show up in core G&A, not promotional. So I think that's just inherent in our core G&A guidance on the cost and the efficiencies that we would get in doing that. On your first question, I think that probably the thing that maybe makes the swing be a little bit higher is, we didn't have any conferences in Q2. I think we typically have one of our larger conferences in Q1, another large one in Q2 and then our largest in Q3. So with that, I think you've got a trend that looks a little bit higher, but I think it's -- both Dan and I talked about in the prepared remarks, I think well to state the obvious, we're saving on hotels and travel and things of that nature. The core point of the conference is really to get our advisers together and provide them content and opportunities to really focus on their businesses and how to grow. So I think we're really focused on doing that. We haven't done it yet. This will be our first one, and I think we'll learn and iterate based on how that goes. But I think we -- I would say, sitting here now and in our planning, we feel really confident that what we are investing in the conference is going to have a great return and help those advisers grow and in turn, help us grow over time. Got you. And then a quick follow-up on the ICA dynamic. So saw the disclosure around a little of an incremental extension this quarter, $1 billion. It looks like you guys did it at a 60 basis point rate, which I don't recall seeing one year 60 basis points since this whole thing unfolded. Maybe a little bit more color of kind of where you were able to lock in the rate like this? And opportunistically, are there more opportunities to do kind of above-market locks similar to this? Yes. There is one day, Alex, one day, it was at 60. So I think that our focus here on the fixed rate balances, right? I think we've talked about it a lot on the philosophy of really minimizing the interest rate movements, allowing us to have a more stable earnings stream and focus on investing in organic growth. And I think the core of your question is, there is not a lot of opportunities right now, and I think the -- hopefully, what you take away is that we're -- we monitor the markets every day. We're talking to lots of banks every day. And if there is a tactical opportunity to do something that can move us forward, we're prepared and ready to do that. And I think that's how I would read the $1 billion at 60 bps. And just to state the obvious, or 60 bps, to state the obvious, that's not where rates are today, right? The curve is pretty much flat. I think the 10-year closed today at an all-time low at 53 point something. So right now, not a lot of opportunities, but if they do present themselves even for a short period of time, we'll do our best to take advantage of them. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Harris from Wells Fargo. A few follow-up questions on cash economics. First, banks are retrenching, loan growth is way down, so has there been any change in the appetite among banks to acquire your deposits? It doesn't sound like there has been, but maybe you could frame up the risk for that and whether that potentially might reduce your spreads? And then is there any more downside to any of your money market yields where they sit today? Yes. Chris, I think on the cash appetite, I think what we've seen is primarily appetite for floating balances. And I think if you just look at Q1 where we added $5 billion of capacity on floating balances in the Fed funds plus 20 to 30 range, and we added another $5 billion this quarter. I mean those are at least for -- when you look at the relative size of that on our balance sheet, those are pretty substantial adds. And as I was just talking with Alex about, there is not a lot of demand and appetite on the fixed rate side for those.
On the money market side, I mean, a couple of things I keep in mind. The money market sweep is really running off. So it's a product that's getting smaller and smaller. Really where our money market product is, is on the purchase money market side. And from our economics, that's really a revenue share. It's not directly tied to interest rates like the ICA account would be. So it's more of a revenue share that you can see is in the 20 basis point range, higher end of that right now. So it wouldn't be directly tied to movements in interest rates. Okay. And related, real quick, if I can. The -- for the M&T transaction, what do you guys can earn on those cash balances? How does that work? Yes. So for M&T and for banks in general, I think, to state the obvious, they are their own bank. So a lot of times institutions will just keep the cash balances and will serve their wealth management business, and that's the case in M&T. So those cash balances will be staying in their bank. Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. I just wanted to circle back on the centrally managed platform, about $54 billion in assets now. I was hoping you could just share an update on some of your initiatives there, how you see that evolving in the next couple of quarters? And maybe you can also give us a little bit of sense of the profile of advisers that are taking you up on that centrally managed platform. What are the types that are more likely or more active users of that? And maybe what portion of those advisers have joined, say, in the past couple of years versus those that are -- have been on your platform for many years? Yes. So let me take that one. And first of all, your centrally managed platforms. If you think about the real structural value that you're providing is compelling investment content, right? And then secondly, the ability to save the adviser valuable admin time, where they don't have to do a lot of the administrative work and trading work associated with portfolio management, and so thinking about those as 2 core characteristics. Generally speaking, they're going to apply to any potential different personas of advisers that sit up there today with the exception of the adviser who creates most of their value through their very own portfolio construction. That being harder and harder to do and getting paid less and less for that, obviously, you're seeing a move away from that from most advisers who have a broader value proposition, and then would use the centrally managed platforms along with also, in some cases, using a rep directed platform. And that's the nice thing as we give them the flexibility to use whatever platform is best for whatever individual client. And so with that as a baseline and a foundation, that opens us up to a centrally managed solution being applicable to 70-plus percent of the advisers, and again, they can use them however they want to with inside their practice. So there is broad appeal there and broad applicability there. And I think what you're seeing is more and more advisers growing in this trend of recognizing the value of their time and the trade to save that time to use it on, what I might call, higher-margin activities. And so we do expect the demand and the utilization for the centrally managed platforms to continue to trend up. Now we've got to keep investing in it, and make sure that we give them that compelling investment content that we actually are able to give them continued expansion in the savings of time by adding new functionality and new capabilities to the platform. And a great example of that was the Advisor Sleeve solution that we rolled out. We just enhanced in Q1 and Q2. That basically gave the adviser more flexibility as to how they engage in a centrally managed platform, where they can load and trade their -- sorry, load up their own models on the centrally managed platform, but still get all the benefits of the time savings and the outsourcing of the trading and the operational work to us. And so that's an example of where we continue to invest. We continue to invest in the SMA platform, same concept and principle here, a centrally managed platform and continue to expand the functionality and flexibility will drive more growth to the platform. We also is where we're investing from a pricing standpoint. As we've shared with you, we've continued to use pricing as an option for an investment for the past 5 years, and centrally managed platforms are a place that we continue to see opportunity to do that. So I hope that answers your question, but that's some of the opportunity that we see associated with both the structural benefits and growing demand as well as some of the investments that we're making. Great. Much appreciated. And maybe just a quick follow-up on that as well. I guess what would you say would be the top 3 things or so you'd like to add or expand or improve on that platform as you look out over the next couple of years? Yes. I think the more we can give the flexibility for the adviser to move in and out of that platform, the better. What I mean by that is that there is certain times where the adviser wants to take the wheel and control it. And to the extent that you can give them the ability to do that on a centrally managed framework, we believe is a journey that we've been on, and we've got a few more steps to take on that. I think a second component is continuing to add certain securities to it. So you'll see us working on adding equities to the centrally managed platform. Historically, it's been limited to portfolios with mutual funds and ETFs. And so there is an example. And then you'll also see us pulling in SMAs to this -- to our MWP platform, our sort of core centrally managed platform and integrating our SMA solutions into that platform. So those are 3 big things that we're working on. Our next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan from JMP Securities. I just want to have another follow-up here on the Business Solutions. And I appreciate all the color, and obviously, good to see the continuing progress. Trying to think about just the growth trajectory, and I appreciate it does take time to scale and it's newer, but you're also learning a lot as you go here and experiments as well. So I'm curious for the advisers that aren't using any of the solutions yet. Is it an education thing or a marketing dynamic thing where essentially advisers aren't aware of all the capabilities you have? And so you just need to better educate them and make sure they're aware. Or is it playing around with the pricing structures? Do you guys provide trials, so maybe you have a little bit of a sense of the backlog of what could come? I'm just trying to get a sense of the growth trajectory and some of those dynamics. Yes. It's a fair question, and I think there is a multitude of the different places that we would look at in order to accelerate, if you will, the growth trajectory of the solution. I think one place that you look at is definitely on the value proposition side. Does the value proposition resonate or are there other things that we can expand or do that make it even more valuable and more appealing. So we've been able to learn a lot about that over the past 1.5 years. We continue to roll out new digital capabilities inside all of them based on the feedback and the learnings we have from the existing clients. And so we see those baseline business solutions becoming more and more appealing as we make those investments, which will create, we think, more and more demand. I think at the same time, we are looking at different pricing structures. Can you create different versions of these or simplified version that would have a lower price point? Can you create a different construct, as you say, to give someone a trial period to come in and really experience the value and thus better understand how they may value it relative to their own practice? And so we absolutely are exploring and experimenting with different price points and pricing structures in order to do that.
And then we -- the third area would be continuing to innovate on new capabilities and new solutions. The nice thing about innovation is that it gets innovation as you're working down, solving real problems or challenges for advisers inside their practice and helping them operate their business, identifies new places to create and add value. And that's what occurred as a great example with the Assurance Plan. The dialogue around that need led to 3 other questions to ask, which then created this idea or concept of how to solve for it. So we do believe there is more things that we can do down inside the practice where they either buy those services somewhere else or don't even use them today because they don't think they have access to them that we can continue to help them operate their practices. So that's the 3 ores in the water that would help drive topline growth. Really appreciate the color, Dan. Maybe just a quick one for Matt on the follow-up on just transaction and other. I heard the comments about kind of normalizing volumes. What are the other kind of puts and takes as we think about just the current quarter? Sometimes there is elevated kind of conference-related revenues. You're trying to think about other things that -- I don't know if there's seasonality as well to think about for that line, which is obviously bounced around a fair amount over the last few quarters? Yes. I think the only additional thing I'd highlight, Devin, is on the -- just a couple of things on fees. The seasonality of IRA fees, right, those are typically a first half seasonal meaning Q1 is typically the highest quarter, Q2 is still a little bit elevated, but then when you get into the second half of the year, and specifically Q3, you start to see those come down. And then the other side of this, which is a great long-term item, is our retention, right? Retention is at all-time highs and meaning attrition is at all-time lows. And when those accounts leave, there is a fee charge for them to leave. So meaning the fees associated with folks leaving, accounts leaving LPL are also down, right? So great from a value standpoint long term, but in an individual quarter that puts a little bit of pressure down on fees. Our next question comes from Chris Shutler from William Blair. A few weeks ago, another large broker-dealer announced they plan to become a bank. Just given the rate environment likelihood that we might be here for some time, what would cause you to take a more serious look at that option? Chris, this is Matt. I'll take that. I mean, I think for us, it gets back to our value proposition and how we can serve and support our clients. And I think when you think about that, you don't need to be a bank to do that, right? When you just think about the cash capabilities that we offer in sweep today, and there is lots of folks out there that you can offer additional capabilities that a bank offers without being a bank specifically. So I think we're focused on the value prop, focused on how do we provide the services and solutions for our clients and their clients, and I don't think becoming a bank is necessary to do that well. Okay. And then secondly, can you give us a sense, even a ballpark, what percentage of assets at LPL are invested in passive investment products and ETFs more specifically? And I know it's super, super early days here, but if actively managed ETFs were to take off in a more meaningful way, how could that impact your economics? Yes. So obviously, with passive investments, as we've discussed in the past, it is only on the advisory platform to the advisory business, where this shows up as relevant in the brokerage construct you're, obviously -- an adviser is not going to use them or they don't get paid, right? So on the advisory platforms today, roughly 1/3 of the overall assets are in passive type constructs, think about mutual funds and/or ETFs. And we've seen an ongoing trend over the past couple of years of about 1% a year. We've shared that with you before in terms of that mix shift over time. You'll see some volatility from quarter to quarter, but on average, it's been about 1%. We see advisers using it primarily inside of a rep-driven platform where they may use it for large-cap growth or value type components of an overall portfolio. We also have passive options and alternatives on our centrally managed platforms as well, if an adviser want to, needs to or desires to use it in that format. So we don't see a big shift relative to how passive is being used as we go forward. Now active ETFs would create a question around how they might be utilized instead of active mutual funds, and I think it is a strategy or a way to potentially lower the cost of active management. We're supportive of lowering the cost. As the innovation around these products have occurred, we've been in dialogue with a number of different product sponsors as to how they think about it, and how we make sure that the overall ecosystem can use those in an effective way to help lower the cost of active management and enhance the overall experience to the end investor. So it's early days now in terms of how those may be positioned and rolled out, but we're optimistic that with the emergence and evolution of active ETFs that our sponsored programs will and can be evolved and adjusted and pivoted such that it has more of a neutral impact on our overall sponsor relationships. I show no further questions in the queue. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back to Dan Arnold, President and CEO, for closing remarks. Thank you, operator, and thanks, everyone, for taking the time to join us this afternoon. And we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Please stay safe. See you now.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Arnold. Thank you, Chris, and thanks to everyone for joining our call today. Over the past quarter, our focus has remained on our mission of taking care of our advisors, so they can take care of their clients.
This is a credit to our employees who have responded with agility and ingenuity to new working conditions and new opportunities to support our advisors. Their dedication is inspired by the unfailing commitment of our advisors who continue to provide much needed financial advice to millions of Americans managing through a challenging environment.
We believe this environment is driving several year’s worth of change in just a matter of months. This pace of change is creating many new constraints and challenges to solve for throughout the industry. We see this change as an opportunity to create additional long-term value by enhancing how we serve our advisors, how our advisors take care of their clients and how we engage with and attract the best employee talent.
We entered this year with momentum and the work we have done to operate in this changed environment puts us in an even stronger position to serve our advisors and grow our business going forward.
Now looking ahead, we will continue to focus on investing in our platform, which helps our advisors win in the marketplace, attracts new advisors, and in turn, increases our scale and capacity to invest.
This will help us deliver a market-leading platform that is the easiest place for the advisors to construct the perfect practice and run a thriving business. Doing this well gives us a sustainable path to higher levels of organic growth, increased market leadership and long-term shareholder value creation.
With that context in mind, let’s now turn to the third quarter and discuss how we are executing the key components of our business priorities while also moving forward on our strategic plan. Now let’s start with how we are executing on our priorities is translating to business results.
In the third quarter, our assets reached a new high of over $800 billion, driven by continued organic growth and equity market appreciation. After consistently investing to deliver a leading advisory platform, our advisory assets continue to grow up 20% from a year ago and now are over 50% of our total assets.
Moving to organic growth, net new assets remained solid at $11 billion, which translated to nearly a 6% annualized growth rate. This brought net new assets to a new high of $51 billion over the last 12 months, which translates to a 7% annualized growth rate and was driven by continued strength across new store sales, same-store sales and retention.
Organic growth increased throughout the quarter as expected. After the impact of client tax payments and summer seasonality in July and August, respectively, organic growth was over 7% in September, consistent with our growth rates in the first half of the year.
In the third quarter, recruited assets were $10.7 billion and contributed to a new high of $41 billion over the past 12 months. These results were primarily driven by the appeal of our model and continued solid execution by our business development team.
With respect to our advisor experience in the third quarter, we continued to develop solid service outcomes, driven by the flexibility of our affiliation models, evolving capabilities in technology and enhanced service experience. As a result, retention remained over 98% through the first three quarters of the year, up nearly 2 percentage points from a year ago.
One of the traditional contributors to our advisor experience is our annual national conference. Now as we shared last quarter rather than cancel the event due to the environment, we pivoted our approach and in August delivered a digital experience.
By moving the conference online, we enabled twice the number of people to participate this year, advisors found the content engaging and informative and appreciated the savings of both time and expense from not having to travel.
That said, we continue to believe in the importance of in-person interaction as a personal connection is at the center of our industry. Given these learnings, we have the opportunity to structurally evolve how we deliver our conferences and leverage a mix of in-person and digital formats going forward. Our third quarter business results also led to solid financial outcomes with EPS prior to intangibles of $1.44.
Let’s now turn to the progress we have made executing on our strategy. As we look ahead, we continue to see growing demand for advice and believe we are well-positioned to serve our advisors and collectively compete for additional market share.
Now in light of this, we remain focused on executing our four strategic plays. Our first strategic play, as a reminder, involves meeting advisors where they are in the evolution of their practices by winning in our traditional markets, while also leveraging new affiliation models to expand our addressable markets from $4 trillion to $13 trillion.
Strategically, we believe this combination positions us to not only deliver sustainable and repeatable organic growth, but also to increase our growth rate over time. With respect to our traditional markets, we continue to drive solid recruiting results, which include achieving higher win rates and attracting larger practices. This dynamic is also benefiting our pipeline, which expanded to new highs throughout the quarter.
At the same time, we continue to increase our market leadership in the third-party bank channel. As a reminder, in July, we signed an agreement with M&T Bank to move its retail brokerage and advisory business to our platform.
Earlier this month, we signed an agreement with another leading institution, BMO Harris Bank. Their retail brokerage and advisory business, BMO Harris Financial Advisors plans to transition approximately $14 billion in assets and 115 financial advisors onto our platform in the first half of next year.
We look forward to helping them serve and support their clients, expand their value proposition and grow their business. Together, these two leading banks are representative of the work we are doing to serve more large institutions.
And with respect to the expansion of our addressable markets, our new affiliation models continue to gain traction. After launching our independent employee model this summer, we are seeing solid interest from prospective advisors and our pipeline is growing.
We also added two more Strategic Wealth Services practices in the third quarter, which bring recruited assets on this model to approximately $1 billion. We are encouraged to see our new affiliation models building momentum and believe that they can help increase our organic growth rate over time.
Our second strategic play is focused on providing capabilities that help our existing advisors differentiate the marketplace and attract new advisors to our platform. Within this strategic play, we are focused on internally developing new capabilities, as well as opportunistically using M&A to accelerate the delivery of certain solutions.
In that spirit, earlier this week, we acquired Blaze Portfolio, an advisory trading platform based in Chicago. As context, trading is a foundational piece of the advisor workflow and increasing its strategic value especially as more advisors shift to models-based practices.
With the capabilities from Blaze, we will provide a more flexible and dynamic trading and rebalancing solution that enables advisors to deliver more personalized and engaging experience to their clients.
Let’s move to our third strategic play, which involves creating an industry-leading experience to delight advisors and their clients. One of the key parts of this strategic play is transforming our service model into a client care model.
As a reminder, this model is designed to provide advisors with differentiated service at a time and in a manner that works best for them by bringing together an omnichannel platform, complex case management and self-help capabilities.
After we rolled out our omnichannel and case management solutions across our service organization, they delivered a solid contribution to our advisor experience and NPS scores. We are now using speech analytics to monitor and learn from each service call to fine-tune our model and continue to increase performance and value over time.
The next big category of work is self-help capabilities within client works, which will provide online, relevant and easy to navigate content that solves an advisor’s needs without ever having to make a call.
Our goal is to make self-help one of the easiest channels for advisors to access and navigate LPL, helping drive convenience and efficiency for their practices, while contributing to the ongoing enhancement of our advisor experience and NPS scores.
Our fourth strategic play is focused on helping advisors run the most successful businesses in the independent marketplace. One of the key components of this play is Business Solutions.
As we move through the changing environment this year, we have seen expanded utility of our original admin, marketing and CFO Solutions, as advisors leverage these offerings in different ways to solve for new challenges. The COVID-related climate also proved to be a catalyst for innovation and developing new services, like our Assurance Plan and Remote Office Solution.
By continuing to learn and adapt to our advisors’ changing needs, we now have a stronger and broader portfolio of solutions that are delivering more value, are applicable to more advisors and are proven across a challenging environment. As a result, our Business Solutions subscriptions have doubled over the past year to 1,200 at the end of the third quarter.
In summary, in the third quarter, we continued to invest in the value proposition for advisors and their clients, while driving growth and increasing our market leadership. As we look ahead, we remain focused on executing on our strategy to help our advisors further differentiate and win in the marketplace and to drive long-term shareholder value.
With that, I will turn the call over to Matt. Thank you, Dan. And I am glad to speak with everyone on today’s call. In the third quarter, we remain focused on serving our advisors, growing our business and delivering shareholder value. We continue to drive strong organic growth, recently signed another large bank and closed on three acquisitions and we did all of these while remaining disciplined on expenses. As we look ahead, we are excited about our increasing opportunities to drive organic growth and long-term shareholder value.
Now let’s turn to our third quarter results, total advisory and brokerage assets increased to a new high of $810 million, up 6% from Q2, driven by continued organic growth and higher equity markets.
Looking at organic growth, total net new assets were $11.1 billion or a 5.8% annualized growth rate. Our results increased throughout the quarter with September organic growth at 7.4%, which was up from July and August as those two months included the impact from client tax payments and summer seasonality.
Moving on to recruiting and retention, which are two key drivers of organic growth. We continued to produce strong results in the third quarter. Recruited assets were $10.7 billion in Q3, which brought our 12-month total to $40.8 billion. At the same time, retention remained over 98% year-to-date.
Looking at our business mix, we continue to see positive trends in Q3. Advisory net new assets were $10.4 billion or an 11% annualized growth rate, which brought advisory assets to over 50% of our total. Centrally Managed platforms also continued to grow as net new assets were $1.9 billion or a 14% annualized growth rate.
Now let’s turn to our Q3 financial results, strong organic growth combined with expense discipline led to EPS prior to intangibles of $1.44. Looking at commission and advisory fees net of payout, they were $142 million, up $11 million from Q2, primarily driven by higher advisory fees and commissions.
Moving on to asset-based revenues, sponsor revenues were $145 million in Q3, up $14 million sequentially as average assets increased, driven by higher equity markets and organic growth.
Turning to client cash revenues, they were $109 million, down $8 million from Q2, primarily driven by lower short-term interest rates. Looking more closely at client cash balances, they remained elevated at $47 billion, up $1 billion sequentially.
As for client cash yields, our Q3 ICA yield was 118 basis points, down 9 basis points from Q2. The decrease was primarily driven by lower LIBOR rates, as well as $0.5 billion of fixed rate contracts that matured during the quarter.
Looking ahead to Q4, we will have the full quarter impact of the decline in LIBOR that occurred in Q3, as well as another $0.5 billion of fixed rate contracts maturing. Given these factors and where interest rates, client rates and cash balances were at the end of Q3, we expect our Q4 ICA yield to decrease by about 10 basis points sequentially.
Moving on to Q3 transaction and fee revenues, they were $120 million flat sequentially, driven by higher fee revenue and lower trade. While July and August trading returned to more normalized levels, volumes increased in September along with market volatility. Looking ahead to Q4, I would highlight that our October volumes have returned to more normalized levels.
Turning to Business Solutions, they continue to scale with 1,200 subscriptions at the end of Q3. This is up 250 from last quarter and double our total from a year ago. These offerings generate roughly $15 million of annual recurring gross profit, and more importantly, they help advisors free up additional time to serve their clients and grow their business.
Now let’s turn to expenses starting with Core G&A. It was $227 million in Q3, up $5 million sequentially, as we continue to invest to drive organic growth across our new affiliation models, technology and service. Looking ahead to Q4, we remain on track to be in the lower half of our 2020 Core G&A outlook range of $915 million to $940 million.
Moving on to promotional expenses, they were $58 million in Q3, up $13 million sequentially, primarily driven by our national advisor conference. Looking ahead to Q4, we anticipate lower conference expense, partially offset by seasonal marketing and continued growth in recruiting transition assistance. As a result, we expect Q4 promotional expense to decrease by about $5 million from Q3.
Turning to our tax rate, it was 23% in Q3. This is below our expected range of 27% to 29%, as we benefited from a positive decision on a prior expense that was considered non-deductible.
Moving on to capital allocation, our balance sheet remained strong in Q3, with credit agreement net leverage at 2.15 times and cash available for corporate use of $252 million. The strength of our balance sheet remains a key enabler of organic growth and positions us to deploy capital when opportunities arise.
As for capital deployment, our framework remains focused on allocating capital aligned with the returns we generate, investing in organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A opportunities where appropriate and returning excess capital to shareholders.
As we look forward, we see increasing opportunities to allocate capital to organic growth and M&A, including transition assistance for M&T and BMO next year. Given these opportunities, we are currently prioritizing capital deployment to organic growth and M&A. That said, we will stay flexible and we will adjust our plans as the opportunity set evolves, including allocating capital to share repurchases.
In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong results in Q3, and as we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue investing to serve our advisors, grow our business and create long-term shareholder value.
With that, Operator, please open the call for questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Okay. Thank you very much for taking the question. Good evening, everybody. So, Dan, maybe I want start with your big picture, obviously, you detailed three or four things that are really resonating in the marketplace. Could you unpack maybe the organic growth that you are seeing, maybe take it down a little bit to the different channels between sort of the traditional channels versus new one and so maybe speak to what’s particularly resonating in the marketplace that’s driving the very strong both net new assets, as well as the recruited assets? Yeah. Thanks, Bill. Let me take a stab at that and I will try to give you a little color and then if you have got a follow-on, please fire away. So look, I think, if you think about our growth. We, first and foremost look across all of the different models or parts of the market that we serve and look at how we are doing from new store sales, same-store sales and retention, right?
And if you match that to the investments that we make strategically in our model, they are meant to serve or support any parts of that growth formula. So we obviously see record high results in the new store sales, which is referenced in the trailing 12-month recruiting that we have done, where we have brought in over $40 billion in assets, which was a record high for us, so that would reinforce that oar in the water is making good progress. I will come back to that.
I think same-store sales has been durable and kind of sustained itself in a similar place over the last couple of years. This year, more of that opportunity is coming from advisors broadening their value to existing clients and ultimately getting rewarded for that value by gathering more assets with those existing clients, which is a bit of a different shift from prior years where they may get a higher mix of that growth from new clients that they attract.
And then on the retention front, clearly, that’s us investing in our model, improving and enhancing the service experience, the technology capabilities, our ability to serve and support and evolve the model going forward and sort of play out into the future where our advisor’s needs are. And I think that is best reflected in the retention rate, which is up 200 basis points over the last couple of years.
So I think that gives you a feel, if you will, around the different horse that we have in the water and the contribution they are making to that. So I think we are getting a good contribution across the Board with the most significant coming in the growing of the -- of new store sales or recruiting.
And if I click down on the markets based on your question, most of that recruiting results over the last 12 months has come from our traditional markets, so think about our traditional independent and the institutions marketplace.
We have got the three new models or markets that we are ramping in, SWS is the first one that you are beginning to see some contribution now come from that and the pipeline there is sound. More importantly, we are moving people through that pipeline and I think you will begin to see a bigger contribution of that in 2021 from the SWS model, our Strategic Wealth Services model.
Then you also have our employee-based model or Linsco model, as we have branded it and that is just new to the marketplace. It’s getting a really positive reception. I think for some of the differentiated capabilities, we are building that pipeline.
We think that solution is appealing to an interesting segment of the marketplace, and so, again, I think, we are quite bullish on the contribution that can come from that in the future and none of the growth has come from that model up to this point.
And then finally, the RIA only, we are an RIA custodian or we support some RIAs. We are going in and investing in that model and evolving it, such that we think it’s going to create a really interesting, compelling solution that’s differentiated in the marketplace at a time where we expect to see some churn pick up in that part of the marketplace. So that’s a little bit of how we think about the contribution up to this point with those models, but then how you might think about them differently as we go forward. I hope that helps. That’s helpful. It is. Thank you. Maybe one for Matt. Just sort of thinking about your commentary where you ended in terms of capital priorities. Just stepping back as you think about core expense growth as you look out to next year? How much of an opportunity has that been down the underlying expense growth just given everything that’s been going on with COVID and work-from-home and remote office backdrop versus maybe not letting that bend down and reinvesting back in business to further turbo charge organic growth? Yeah. Hey, Bill. So I think as we think about expenses next year, we will share our plans on the next quarter’s call. But I think from a principal standpoint, I think you hit on it in your question. When I think about Core G&A and spending, it’s really back to the capital allocation priorities.
I think we see the highest and best use of capital to invest and drive organic growth. I think that will be the principle that we bring to that and that will be the principle we will bring to laying on our Core G&A plans for next year. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Hi. Good afternoon, Dan. Good afternoon, Matt. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just starting off with a strategic question for Dan. Some of the acquisitions, including AdvisoryWorld and more recently Blaze, there are products or services which are being marketed to advisors outside of the LPL channel. And as your strategy evolves and you continue to build out just some of the more proprietary Business Solutions, especially given some of the strong demand for those services you have seen from your own advisors. How are you thinking about the opportunity to maybe white-label and market some of those solutions outside of your current advisor network, especially given some of the wealth competitors within that solution space trade at much higher valuation multiples? Yeah. Steven, it’s Dan. Hey. Good question. Look, with respect to Blaze and AdvisoryWorld, those are both part of our strategy where we use M&A, in some cases to help accelerate the development of our capabilities and then fully integrating those capabilities into our overall ecosystem or workflows for our advisors.
And in this case, that’s very much what we are doing here is capitalizing on a really good solution in property out in the marketplace and bringing it into improve and enhance the overall workflow associated with portfolio construction and development, right, and trading is a big component of that.
That said, the second opportunity associated with this acquisition is certainly to continue to support the market share that they have outside of the LPL platform and that is our intent to do that here. It’s to continue to serve and support it, continue to invest and innovate in the capability and tool and certainly evolve that offering to those clients.
I think by doing that, it gives us the chance to continue to learn and understand how to serve a marketplace outside of the LPL platform, which then strategically positions us and reserves the right to if we ever want to shift or pivot and begin to serve that third-party marketplace in a more significant way.
I think it gives us the foundation to work from and do that well. So though not the priority right now, it certainly is a strategic element of value here that gives us the chance to learn and allows us to be positioned to do that. Thanks for those remarks, Dan. And maybe just a clarifying question, a follow-up to Bill’s earlier one on organic growth and investment. Matt, I know your investments in recent quarters have been largely focused on driving organic growth, we saw strong momentum in September. I was hoping you can just give us some more color on whether that organic growth momentum has continued into October? And what that can mean for just Core G&A expense in Q4 as we contemplate some of those additional investments? Yeah. Sure, Steven. We look at what we have seen so far in October, right, being here pretty much at the end of the month. That momentum has continued. So I’d describe it as consistent with September.
I would keep in mind the majority of advisory fees are charged and paid in the first month of the quarter. So when you look at the trends from September to October, that’s going to have a natural bias down just from the change in the amount of fees.
Putting that aside, October M&A is really trending at a similar level to September, so we have seen that return to organic growth continue. And then on the cash balance side or the cash sweep side, we have continued to see cash build in October at a modest pace. I think we are seeing some good results there.
On the Core G&A side to your point, we remain on track for that lower half of our outlook range. So that lower half being, call it, $915 million to around $927 million. I think to the point of your question, where we would land in that range especially with three quarters being completed and just one left. I think the main variable is the variable expense associated with organic growth and how we finish the year.
So given the first three quarters, as well as what we have seen so far in October, I’d say, we are probably going to be towards the upper end of that range, meaning the $915 million to $927 million range. But we do have two more months to go, so we will have to see how it plays out, but that would be the perspective where we are today. That’s great, Matt. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Great. Hi, everybody. So I was hoping we could talk a little bit more about the banking channel. You guys announced two sizable deals in the last couple of months. So maybe talk a little bit about what’s changed in that channel that makes you guys more of an attractive place for some of these advisors to join? And then from a financial perspective, maybe you could just kind of walk us through sort of a framework around gross profit ROA and EBITDA ROA for those type of transactions, including amortization of transition assistance that, Matt, I think, you alluded to that in your earlier comments that that’s probably going to pick up next year, some of those FAs on Board? Yes. So, Alex, it’s Dan. Let me take the first half of that and then I will let Matt finish up with sort of part B of that. So, look, with respect to the general financial institutions marketplace. We have seen some good solid momentum over the last couple of years, and as you all know, it’s roughly a $1 trillion asset marketplace, and roughly a third of that business is outsourced today.
So last year, we recruited $5 billion, which mainly would have been share that’s coming from what was already outsourced. This year we are on track to double those results, and again, it’s mainly where there are participants that are already outsourcing that solution or service.
I think strategically, we challenged ourselves around this concept of can we add value to a part of the marketplace that traditionally hasn’t outsourced, and if so, how might you do that, in this case, it’s these larger financial institutions.
And so I think what we have done is try to go in and innovate or ensure that we could deliver for them a differentiated client experience, which we know is important in their overall offering out in the marketplace and how they position themselves and if we can complement that and extend that overall value proposition in a differentiated way, that’s interesting. If we can find ways of which to optimize the financial contribution of this type of business line within the financial institutions would be a second place that we focused on.
And finally, ultimately, shifting the risk profile for them, I think, is typically an appealing characteristic of the model. And so those are the areas that we focused on to try to come up with innovative ways of which to shift that, evolve that, such that this market that had never been outsourced became an opportunity and that’s where we focused.
And try to show up with a differentiated solution and have had the opportunity to have that dialogue with some of these financial institutions. We think it’s pretty appealing. It’s a pretty unique model and I think we have got a couple of wins and we are out there actively sharing that concept in that model. Though not for everyone, we think it’s pretty appealing, so that’s the concept we have used to try to extend the market, if you will, in this channel. I hope that answers your question. Yeah. And, Alex, on the financial side. When you look at the traditional bank channel, usually the majority of the assets at those institutions are on the brokerage side. So you kind of start and look at our gross profit ROA and those assets are in the 15-basis-point to 20-basis-point range and then for the larger banks, given their size, the returns are usually at the lower end of that range. So that’s the way to think about gross profit.
On the cost side, I think one of the primary benefits of the transaction is we can really bring our scale to serve them in an efficient way. So there’s really a lower cost to serve. And then on the transition assistance side, we always underwrite to returns, so given those dynamics that the TA rates are typically lower for those banks -- for those larger banks.
So when you put all that together, the economics are accretive on the EBITDA margin for us, and then, I think on these two specific ones, as we get closer in future quarters, we will give you a little bit of color on to the extent on how their onboarding and things will impact the financials in those periods. Awesome. Thanks. And my follow-up, I guess it qualifies as a follow-up, is around M&A broadly. I am just curious to get your thoughts that in case we do have a change in tax law and there’s a change in capital gain taxes. To what extent do you think that could be a driver in increased consolidation in the industry with you as an acquirer potentially or some of your financial advisors acquiring other practices with kind of financial backing of LPL, because I know, obviously, that’s an interesting element to the story that you guys bring to the financial advisor, just kind of allowing them to use your sort of balance sheet for acquisitions? Yeah. I think the fundamental point, Alex, which is a good one that you are making is, where there’s change, there’s usually a broad set of different questions or new needs that come up or people contemplate new scenarios that they may not have faced before.
And we do think the environment, as we look out for any number of reasons, including potential tax law changes, certainly drives more consolidation and activity on the M&A front and whether that be at the advisor level, which is a logical place to ask that question or more at the corporate level. I think we see that landscape being -- and the trajectory of the activity, they are trending up on both fronts.
And obviously, as we have said, from a strategic standpoint, we would typically be a participant on both of those levels as we have in the past couple of years and we would take our disciplined approach where we make sure that these acquisitions make sense from a strategic standpoint, a financial one and operationally. But I think we are aligned in the premise of your question that you are going to see more activity. Great. Thanks very much. Thank you. Our next question comes on line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Thanks. Good evening, everyone, and hope you are all doing well. I wanted to follow-up on NNAs. So 3Q was impacted by taxes and seasonality, and then next year you have two NNA accretive transactions closing. So can you comment on your ability to accelerate off this 6% level into 2021? Yeah. Hey. Thanks for the question. And let me take a first run at that and you fill in anything, Matt, that you think would be helpful. So I think if you look at Q3 as a jumping off point where you had roughly a 6% annualized growth rate. That was driven by, certainly, July as you say, with the tax payment trends and that will pop up next year in April rather than in July, let’s hope.
But I think you will certainly see that headwind in that particular month that the tax payments occurs and then there’s always a little seasonality in the summer. But let’s just say that 6% to 7% is the right more blended jumping off rate.
I think as we look out and push ourselves or challenge ourselves to drive that number forward or higher outside of the $34 billion that comes from the two large financial institutions that we referred to. I think we see us continuing to invest in our model that makes it more appealing, improve the effectiveness of our own sales activities and business development activities. Our traditional markets continue to contribute to that -- to a higher growth rate in terms of new recruiting.
I think our new markets, as you supplement them then. They begin to contribute because, as I said up to this point, we have had very little contribution from them. So we see that as an opportunity as they ramp in more robustly next year. So those are both places where we would challenge ourselves to continue to extend the growth rate especially as the new store sales.
We continue to invest in the model from a service experience standpoint and we have got retention levels at the 98% level now. We think that’s a pretty sound and solid outcome. So I think as we go forward and continue to invest in that service experience, that’s probably a good way to think about retention.
And then I think same-store sales is a place that we continue to believe there’s more opportunity there and we continue to innovate, especially inside Business Solutions with a new offering called Growth Solutions that is in the experimental phase right now, where we are being more explicit and coming up with new ways of which to help advisors grow their existing businesses and so though I don’t think that’s a short run opportunity, we do see that as a long-term opportunity to tease out more contribution in same-store sales.
So I hope that helps you as we think about at least going into next year, where that ramp would come is probably new store sales and longer term you probably get it from new store and same-store. Thank you, Dan. Very comprehensive. I have one follow-up P&L question probably for, Matt, but I just wanted your perspective on the 25% increase year-over-year in transition assistance versus, I think, it was a 4% increase in net new advisors? Yeah. Sure, Craig. I mean I think that the approach on TA is really the same, right? It’s underwritten to returns and those returns based on the assets that come over and I think what you are starting to see not just this year, but over the past several years us starting to recruit larger and larger advisors, and the return hurdles haven’t changed. So I think any dynamic you are seeing there is just related to us being able to bring on more advisors from more assets. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Hey. Good evening. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to circle back on the Centrally Managed assets and platform there. It looks like that’s stabilized here at around 14.5% of client assets. So I just hope you could talk a little bit more about some of the initiatives that you are putting in place when thinking about to further accelerate the penetration. How is the product set evolving and if you could also touch upon maybe and describe the profile of the type of advisors that are participating on the Centrally Managed platform? Yeah. So let me take some of those and get, if I miss one or two of the different sub-questions in there, please just redirect me. But -- and so look, we believe that this models based approach or models management based approach that’s emerging inside advisor’s practices is a significant and sustainable trend. It’s a really good way for them to optimize portfolio construction in a really efficient way and construction/management.
And it applies both as rep as PM all the way over to your Centrally Managed platforms. And so we see the opportunity to make investments in this models based approach being relevant across that entire advisory platform.
That said, if you go move over to the Centrally Managed concepts, I think, where we are trying to make investments and where we actually believe we can continue to drive growth and participation on those platforms, continuing to add, what I might call, variations to them.
So you heard us talk a lot about rep sleeve, which is an ability to use Centrally Managed platform and just outsource less than the turnkey option or alternative and that extends the applicability now of that model to more advisors as an example.
We continue to make other investments in that platform and pull in other underlying securities. So you pull in individual equities, you pull in SMAs and now you are beginning to enrich that overall Centrally Managed platform and you are going to have a lot more advisors utilize it for a variety of different reasons for their clients.
So think about variations to the Centrally Managed solution and also think about extending the overlying strategies that you can apply to it and the different securities that you could use within it.
So there’s lots of ripe opportunity there to continue to invest in our platform to extend its applicability to a lot more advisors and help us drive more assets there or contribute more assets. I think, also, as you know, we make investments from a pricing standpoint typically each year.
And we have tended to focus on advisory and we will continue to do that as we move forward, our advisory platforms and this would be an area where, again, you lower minimums, you simplify pricing, you lower pricing on your Centrally Managed platforms, you are going to draw more utilization of them there too. So that’s sort of the spectrum of how we think about the opportunity to enrich its appeal to the advisors and ultimately how they use it to serve their clients. Great. Maybe just the last part of that question just around the profile of advisors that are more likely to participate or that are participating today, just any color there that you can share? Yeah. I think a couple of thoughts there. It’s actually a broad appeal across the Board. So there’s not one segment that we built it for. It’s meant to have broad application across the platform. I think as more advisors are using more advisory solutions in their overall mix, that just overarching demand will tease out the opportunity for more to test, experiment and use it.
We see them using it across a client size now. That typically ranges somewhere from $100,000 to $0.25 million in assets and that’s not to say it was built that way, but that tends to today fill a sweet spot in perhaps how it’s used. I think we continue to work on the pricing. You will enable it to be used up market.
And I also think you see advisors who have traditionally been rep as PM or had done the portfolio construction and management themselves. As their time is pressured in general or they want to allocate it to other higher value services, you are seeing more and more experiment with shifting some of that traditional rep as PM work over to Centrally Managed model.
So making it easy to convert from one model to the other, putting them all inside one platform under one contract takes out the friction associated with that transition or that movement and as we do that over the next year or so, we also think that will unlock some movement towards these Centrally Managed solutions. Great. Thank you very much. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Yeah. Great. A question on the ICA guide for Q4, has the yield on floating balances changed much at all and I asked the question because it seems like a decent step down for just $0.5 billion of fixed that are rolling off? Yeah. Chris, I think, the -- on the variable balances, it’s really just the contracts associated with LIBOR, resetting and coming down to where current LIBOR is. Fed funds obviously moved pretty immediately back in March and LIBOR has just moved slowly after that. I think where it sits today, if history is a guide, it’s now settled in where it would typically be when Fed funds is near zero, but it’s just those contracts resetting. Okay. And subsequent to quarter end, there was a move up in some medium-term, long-term interest rates. At what level of rate do you guys need to see where you might entertain the idea of moving potentially some more balances into fixed? Yeah. I mean our focus on fixed is unchanged, right, targeting that 50% to 75% zone of the overall balances and really to minimize the amount of impact on our economics as interest rates move.
I think what’s most relevant today is less about where the curve is and really just the amount of liquidity in the marketplace. I mean there’s just not a lot of demand for those fixed rate contracts. So I think minor movements in the curve probably don’t change that.
I think over the long term, if the curve steepens, I think, there’s a lot of opportunity economically for us to move more into fixed rate balances. You just look at where we are today at about 35% fixed.
If you just look at the bottom end of that target range moving up to 50%, it’s about $5 billion in balances that we can move. And I think if you look back over the last couple of years when we were moving into the fixed rate market, the sweet spot in that market was really the five-year point on the curve.
So if you are just trying to run some math, I think, thinking about the opportunity at the low end of the range of $5 billion on the five-year point of the curve is the opportunity. But I think in the moment right now, there’s just so much liquidity in the market, there’s just not a lot of opportunity today. Got it. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is now open. Thank you. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But maybe just a couple of follow-ups, one, just on Business Solutions, the subscriptions up 250 quarter-over-quarter, just wondering if you can give more color as to which solutions are seeing the most uptake? And then just maybe qualitatively, if you could talk a bit about how the solutions are resonating as part of the value proposition when you are actually pitching the advisors for some of your new channels? Yeah. It’s Dan. Let me try to swing at that. So maybe the second one first, I think, so first of all, this concept about helping an advisor run and optimize how they operate their business. There’s new capabilities there that the independent space hasn’t always been focused on solving for.
And I think our principle was make sure that we build something that is digital in nature so you can scale it and personalize it but also make sure it has the ability to help the business owner or advisor execute versus just sort of sharing more best practices with them. So the concept was to fix an execution challenge not a know-how or a knowledge challenge.
And so in that spirit, that continues to be our focus with respect to all of these solutions and that’s what resonates regardless of the model. The traditional independent model, typically the independent has experienced where some of those challenges or friction points are.
And when they get the leverage of an admin or a CFO that can provide, in the case of an admin, just leverage points of time where there’s task to do that are better outsourced to someone where they can focus and allocate that time to higher value tasks.
The CFO, though, provides them real knowledge and insight that they may not have had or had the luxury of leveraging to help them enrich their decision making. So it resonates for the independent who has actually already experienced the friction.
It resonates with the Strategic Wealth Services, because that’s an advisor that’s coming out of an employee model that is curious about and a little apprehensive about running a business and these services being available to them is a great leverage point and a boost to confidence in being able to do that.
So those are two examples of where a new model that resonates and on an independent model, same value but one’s got a different experience, but it resonates with them and I think you are seeing equal appeal, as we describe those services in any of those models.
I think what we have had to do, remember, we are still really in a phase of innovation and iteration and so we are constantly learning how to tweak, how to evolve, how to add capabilities, elements or prioritize those in these services.
And so this year has been a great learning opportunity for us to take the traditional admin, CFO and marketing solutions and evolve their utility or listen to what our client’s needs through a different environment, in a tough environment and really enrich the value associated with those solutions such that they broaden the appeal to more advisors.
The other thing we are thinking about doing is how do we continue to lower the cost, lower the price point and again extend the appeal to more advisors. So those are the things that we are doing inside Business Solutions to drive, we think increased adaptability and leverage of those solutions.
What’s growing the fastest? We have seen good consistent growth across the traditional three, admin, CFO, CMO. We were actually concerned inside the pandemic that people would be concerned about paying for them and maybe you would see attrition pickup and we saw the opposite, people really get great value out of these solutions during it. It actually reinforce their durability and their value, and again, as we said, we extended their versatility or their utility to these clients.
And so though I think it did hurt selling to new advisors in the short run because of the environment. We think the value proposition is reinforced and we have seen growth rates begin to pick up post that the sort of the height of the pandemic.
I think the two new solutions that we mentioned, especially the Assurance Plan, have been the biggest drivers of growth in the last quarter. The Assurance Plan really resonates when you think about helping someone protect their business in the event of an untimely or unplanned impact to their lives and it creates a really interesting way of which to preserve the asset that they have created in their business and create an orderly way of which to ensure that it protects that asset for their family and for those end clients of it and make sure for an orderly transition at a reasonable market based valuation.
So that has been very attractive, because that gap out in the marketplace did not exist, especially for advisors who are in their 40s and 50s and have a longer runway left to operate their businesses. It’s an extremely attractive value. Thanks, Dan. Maybe a follow-up for Matt on capital return. I think the last two quarters, you mentioned or you stated that the buyback was paused, I don’t think I caught that exact phrase in this quarter. But just wondering if we should take that to mean that you are more comfortable restarting some level of buyback, even though you are prioritizing that capital towards organic growth and M&A? Yeah. I mean, I think, maybe if I bridge us from the beginning of the year, where we were buying back shares in Q1 and pretty consistently in 2019 as well. I think that pause in March was really driven by the macro uncertainty from COVID.
And while we continue to monitor the macro, I think, as you heard well in the prepared remarks, the business has really strengthened. So I think all else equal, we likely would have restarted share repurchases by now. But those opportunities in organic growth and M&A have just increased and that’s really where we are deploying the capital, right?
Organic growth driving the highest levels in our history, we talked a fair bit about M&T and BMO onboarding next year, where just those two firms alone are $34 billion of AUM and we closed on three M&A deals in as many months in the last three months.
So I think you heard right, share repurchases are attractive, but the opportunities that we are focused on right now are on organic growth and M&A. And if that changes, we will adjust consistent with our priorities and that includes allocating capital to share repurchases. Got it. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gerry O'Hara with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Great. Thanks. Maybe just one for me on competitive dynamics, but broker recruitment obviously has been strong throughout the pandemic and if historical trends I guess are something to look too there, we might expect sort of a pickup in broker recruitment on the other side of this. So just sort of curious to see or hear, based on conversations, is there kind of a cohort of advisors that’s waiting to kind of get to the other side before engaging with folks, such as yourselves, or perhaps, has this been a different environment, whereby you have been able to kind of just consistently go out and attract advisors despite the uneven backdrop? Thank you. Yeah. Good question. Certainly, this environment, we have seen movement of advisors are churned as we call it down. As you look over the last nine months, 10 months, churn rates are down but our win rates are up. So the team has done a great job of persevering through some of the complexities created by the environment and I think you have continued to share the story and helped advisors find creative ways of which to still make that transition.
We expect that creativity in that approach and sort of that resilient heads down. Keep moving forward approach to be taken by our team as we move forward. We do believe that as you get to the other side of the pandemic that it’s reasonable to expect churn rates to trend up and with the additional models we have, applying them across multiple markets where the churn rate comes up, we think about that as an interesting opportunity. So I think your premise is correct. Great. Thanks for taking my question, Dan. Thank you. Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Ken Worthington with JP Morgan. Your line is now open. Hi. Good afternoon. This is Will Cuddy filling in for Ken. Hi, Will. So production revenue -- hi. Production revenue has been elevated this year and while still elevated in 3Q, it’s been trending a little lower from the first half of the year. If my math is right, slide four of the deck implies a 97% retention rate of production, down from 98.5% for the first half of the year and it doesn’t look like there’s seasonality in prior years. Why do you think production has trended down in 3Q, and looking ahead, do you expect this to continue down and stabilize around a more normal level of 96%, stabilize at current levels or increase back to levels seen in the first half of the year? Yeah. So let me take that one. I think to maybe come back to your final point and question. We think somewhere in that 2% to 3% range is what we are trying to play to and we think that’s a reasonable landing place for attrition, so conversely 97% to 98% of retention.
I think you had, in the first part of the year, some benefit or tailwind, if you will, around retention, just because of the pandemic and what we said earlier, lower churn in the overall marketplace kind of showed up there, maybe with a little bit of help.
But, I think, again, the growing appeal of the model, the capability set that we are trying to invest in, the service experience we can deliver is really the drivers of that retention rate and we think a reasonable place is that 97% to 98% range. Got it. Thanks, Dan. And then on transaction fee revenue, Matt, thanks for the commentary in the prepared remarks on trading volumes. To help us understand the dynamics a little bit better, could you roughly break out how much of that revenue line is transaction and how much of that is fee? And then as we think about the growth of your Business Solutions and subscriptions, like how can that growth drive that revenue line item further, how are we going to see that on the P&L? Yeah. I mean the majority of that line is fees. So call it two-thirds, the three-fourth zone is fees. So transactions is a much smaller piece of it, so to answer your first question. On the Business Solutions side, it’s -- right now the run rate gross profit is around $15 million for the solutions that we have so far, and I think, obviously, we expect to grow that from there.
And maybe just to emphasize Dan’s color a little bit earlier, we are still in the experimental phase on some of them and learning and growing from here. But I think we feel quite good about growth over the long-term.
And perhaps more importantly, they are about setting up advisors for them to be able to manage their businesses and grow their balance sheets, if you will or AUM, as well as operate a more efficient practice. I think if we do that, you are going to see that show up across the P&L. I think that’s really where the long-term success can come from as well. Got it. Thank you for taking my questions. Thank you. And this does conclude today’s question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Dan Arnold for any closing remarks. Yeah. Thanks. I just wanted to thank everyone for taking the time to join us this afternoon and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Have a great day and please stay safe. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Arnold. Thank you, Carmel, and thanks to everyone for joining our call today. Over the past quarter and throughout 2020, our focus remained on our mission of taking care of our advisors, so they can take care of their clients. This is a credit to our employees who responded with agility and ingenuity to new working conditions and new opportunities to support our advisors.
Their dedication is inspired by the unfailing commitment of our advisors who continue to provide much-needed financial advice to millions of Americans managing through a challenging environment.
As we enter the New Year, we remain focused on executing our strategy, while also evolving our long-term vision of how we deliver on our mission. We aspire to push past our old vision of extending our leadership in the independent space and redefine the independent model over time and by doing so, become the leader across the entire advisor-centered marketplace. Our approach is to build a platform that is simple and straightforward for advisors to use in constructing the perfect practice for themselves and their clients.
More specifically, this vision centers around making it easy for advisors to join our platform with no friction or complexity, and as simple as turning dials, they can determine the exact services they want to leverage, pick the business model that will work best for them, choose the technology and workflows that make them most efficient, and select the product mix that best meets the needs of their clients, all while leveraging expertise and solutions to enhance the performance of their businesses.
Ultimately, that creates total empowerment for LPL advisors to thrive and that is the heart of our mission. Doing this well gives us a sustainable path to higher levels of organic growth, increased market leadership and long-term shareholder value creation.
With that context in mind, let’s now turn to the fourth quarter and discuss our results and progress on our strategic plan. Let’s start with our fourth quarter business results. Total assets reached a new high of over $900 billion, up 18% from a year ago. This increase was primarily driven by continued organic growth and equity market appreciation.
With respect to organic growth, fourth quarter net new assets prior to acquisitions were a new high of $18 billion, which translated to an 8.8% annualized growth rate. For the full year, net new assets were $56 billion, which translates to a 7.4% annualized growth rate, up from 5.3% percent a year ago. This increase was driven by continued strength across new store sales, same-store sales and retention.
In the fourth quarter, Recruited Assets remained solid at $10.8 billion, which brought our full-year total to $41 billion. This was up $6 billion from a year ago and by more than 50% over the past three years, primarily driven by the appeal of our model, our ongoing innovation for the future and continued solid execution by our business development team.
In the fourth quarter, we also continued to enhance the advisor experience, as we delivered solid service outcomes driven by the flexibility of our affiliation models, evolving capabilities and technology and an enhanced service experience.
As a result, retention remained approximately 98% for the year, up from 96.5% percent a year ago and Net Promoter Scores increased by over 15 points year-over-year and more than 60 points in three years. Our fourth quarter business results also led to solid financial outcomes, with EPS prior to intangibles of $1.53, which brought our full-year total to $6.46.
Let’s now turn to the progress we have made executing on our strategic plan. As we look ahead, we continue to see growing demand for advice and believe we are well-positioned to serve our advisors and collectively compete for additional market share.
Now, in light of this we remain focused on executing our four strategic plays. As a reminder, our first strategic play involves meeting advisors where they are in the evolution of their practices by winning in our traditional markets, while also leveraging new affiliation models to expand our addressable markets.
Strategically, we believe this combination positions us, not only to deliver sustainable and repeatable organic growth but also to increase our growth rate over time. In our traditional markets while advisor movement remained at lower levels over the past year, we continued to drive solid recruiting results and gain market share.
To share a little more color specifically on our third-party financial institutions channel, we continue to see good momentum in the core segment of this market, and at the same time, we remain encouraged by our opportunity with regional banks. The planning and preparation for our new relationships with BMO and M&T are going well and we are in ongoing strategic dialogues with other prospects.
With respect to the expansion of our addressable markets, we anticipate our new affiliation models will also contribute additional organic growth in 2021. Following five Strategic Wealth Services practices that onboarded last year, we have a solid pipeline with a number of commitments that will join in the first half of this year. In January, we also onboarded our first Independent employee model practice and we are seeing other prospects progress through the pipeline.
Another key component of this strategic play is using M&A as a strategic lever to complement organic growth. Earlier in Q4, we onboarded a combined $4 billion of assets from our acquisitions of Lucia and EK Riley, then in December, we signed an agreement to acquire Waddell & Reed’s wealth management business, which has over 900 experienced and accomplished advisors, serving approximately $70 billion of client assets.
Post the signing, our teams have collaborated well with Waddell & Reed and Macquarie, which is contributing to solid progress on the transaction. Thus far in the process, Waddell & Reed advisors serving approximately 80% of client assets have already committed to join our platform following the close of the transaction. We will give you an update on the rest of the retention pipeline next quarter.
Our second strategic play is focused on providing capabilities that help our existing advisors, differentiate in the marketplace and drive efficiency in their practices. In 2021, we plan to continue our work from last year, with a focus on developing capabilities and solutions in two key areas. The first is to enrich the end client experience with expanded digital solutions, enhancements to our advisory platforms and a broader set of lending solutions.
The second key area is using technology, including ClientWorks and ClientWorks Connected, to help advisors enhance the performance of their practices, operate more efficiently within their key workflows and expand scalability to serve more clients. We believe these evolving capabilities will contribute to an increase in advisor growth and retention rates.
Let’s next move to our third strategic play, which involves creating an industry-leading experience to delight advisors and their clients and that in turn helps drive advisor retention. One of the key parts of this strategic play is providing advisors with differentiated service at a time and in a manner that works best for them.
We are doing this by transforming our service model into a client care model. We are about halfway through the implementation of this model and at this point, it has made a solid contribution to our Net Promoter Scores. We see additional opportunity to drive these outcomes higher as we deliver the second half of this initiative.
We also see evolving our custodial platform operations as an opportunity to further enhance service levels, platform scalability and efficiency. As part of this work, our areas of focus include automating routine work with robotics, removing paper forms and increasing eDelivery through digitization and process re-engineering to drive continuous improvement. We believe these initiatives combined with our transformation to a client care model position us to further strengthen the advisor experience and our platform as our business grows.
Our fourth strategic play is focused on helping advisors run the most successful businesses in the independent marketplace. One of the key components of this play is our portfolio of Business Solutions.
As a reminder, when we started Business Solutions over two years ago, we saw the opportunity to help advisors find better alternatives for some local services that cost in excess of $1 billion a year.
Our hypothesis was that we could provide higher quality services at a lower cost and free up additional time, for advisors to spend on more valuable activities, including serving their clients and growing their practices. In that spirit, we created our Business Solutions portfolio to solve for these discreet needs, with outsourced professional expertise.
Since then, we have been able to expand and evolve the value proposition of the portfolio and scale our subscription base. As a result, we finished the fourth quarter with about 1,400 monthly subscriptions, which is more than double the level a year ago.
At the same time, we have expanded the portfolio to include business optimizers and additional professional services. We are also innovating on how we package these solutions such that we can unlock additional value for advisors when using a combination of different offerings.
As we look ahead, we see several pathways for continued growth including partnering with more of our LPL advisors, introducing new solutions, and experimenting with serving advisors outside of LPL.
In Q1, we will launch the next innovation in our portfolio M&A Solutions, which will be our sixth offering. As context, this service grew out of CFO Solutions as we identified an opportunity to help advisors acquire other practices. That inspired us to develop M&A capabilities as a service for advisors.
This M&A offering will provide a turnkey solution and dedicated support for advisors from deal sourcing all the way through transaction advice, capital funding and process execution. With this offering, advisors can now more easily use M&A as a repeatable and sustainable growth engine for their practices.
In summary, in the fourth quarter and throughout the year, we continued to invest in the value proposition for advisors and their clients, while driving growth and increasing our market leadership. As we look ahead, we remain focused on executing our strategy to help our advisors further differentiate and win in the marketplace and drive long-term shareholder value.
With that, I will turn the call over to Matt. All right. Thank you, Dan. And I am glad to speak with everyone on today’s call. Before I review our fourth quarter results, I would like to highlight our progress during 2020. Looking at the year, we are proud of what we accomplished within our framework for driving long-term shareholder value.
We entered 2020 with momentum, and continued to invest through a volatile environment to provide an industry-leading value proposition for our advisors to serve their clients and win in the marketplace.
This commitment to enhancing the support we provide our advisors, resulted in the highest quarterly and full year levels of organic net new assets in our history. By leveraging the investments in our platform and the financial strength we built over the last several years, we enter 2021 in an even stronger position, as we work to onboard our two largest financial institutions, M&T and BMO, as well as Waddell & Reed.
So as we look ahead, we are excited to continue growing our business and leveraging our increased scale and capacity to further invest in our platform, which positions us to drive additional growth and long-term shareholder value.
Now let’s turn to our fourth quarter business results. Total advisory and brokerage assets increased to a new high of $903 billion, up 11% percent from Q3, driven by continued organic growth and higher equity markets. Looking at organic growth, total net new assets were $17.8 billion or an 8.8% annualized growth rate.
Moving on to recruiting and retention, which are two key drivers of organic growth, we continued to produce strong results in the fourth quarter. Recruited assets were $10.8 billion in Q4, which was our third consecutive quarter above $10 billion and brought our twelve-month total to a new high of $40.9 billion. At the same time, full year retention was 97.7%, an improvement of over a percentage point from last year.
Looking at our business mix we continued to see positive trends in Q4. Advisory net new assets were $15.9 billion or a 16% annualized growth rate. Our full year total was $50 billion, up almost 50% from last year and more than doubled our total in 2018.
Centrally managed platforms also continued to grow, as net new assets reached a new quarterly high of $2.5 billion or a 17% annualized growth rate.
Now let’s turn to our Q4 financial results. Strong organic growth, combined with expense discipline, led to EPS prior to intangibles of $1.53, up 6% sequentially. Looking at our topline growth, gross profit was $534 million, up $28 million or 6% sequentially. Looking at the components commission and advisory fees net of payout were $153 million, up $11 million from Q3, primarily driven by organic growth and higher equity markets.
Moving on to asset-based revenues, sponsor revenues were $153 million in Q4, up $9 million sequentially, as average assets increased driven by organic growth and higher equity markets.
Turning to client cash revenues, they were $105 million, down $4 million from Q3, driven by lower client cash yields. Looking at client cash balances, they remained elevated at $49 billion, up $2 billion sequentially.
As for client cash yields, our Q4 ICA yield was 108 basis points, down 10 basis points from Q3. The decrease was primarily driven by $0.5 billion of fixed rate contracts that matured during the quarter and higher cash balances.
Looking ahead to Q1, we will have the full quarter impact of the $0.5 billion of fixed rate contacts that matured in Q4, as well as another $0.5 billion of fixed rate contracts maturing in Q1.
Given these factors and where interest rates, client rates and cash balances were at the end of Q4, we expect our Q1 ICA yield to be around 100 basis points. Roughly half of the decline is driven by growth in balances, while the other half is driven by fixed rate contract maturities.
Moving on to Q4 transaction and fee revenues, they were $130 million, up $10 million sequentially, driven by higher trading volume and fee revenue. Looking ahead to Q1, while we acknowledge the widely discussed increase in activity in the self-directed space, our trading levels have remained more stable and consistent with what we would expect to see in the advisor-led wealth management space.
As a result, our trading activity through January is in line with Q4 levels. That said, I would note, there are three fewer trading days and seasonally lower fee revenue in Q1. So we expect these two items to reduce transaction and fee revenue by $5 million.
Turning to Business Solutions, they continue to scale with 1,400 subscriptions at the end of Q4. This is up 200 from last quarter, and double our total from a year ago. These offerings now generate roughly $17 million of annual recurring gross profit, up from $15 million last quarter. And more importantly, they help free up additional time for advisors to spend on more valuable activities, including serving their clients and growing their practices.
Now let’s turn to expenses, starting with Core G&A. It was $252 million in Q4, leading to full year Core G&A of $925 million, in the lower half of our original outlook range of $915 million to $940 million.
Turning to our outlook for 2021, our long-term cost strategy remains unchanged. We continue to prioritize investments that drive organic growth, while delivering operating leverage in our core business.
Looking back, over the last three years our Core G&A has grown in the mid single-digit range annually as we invested to drive growth. And over the same period, these investments have helped our organic growth more than double from 3% to 7%.
Given the success we are seeing with these investments, we are planning the same level of Core G&A growth we planned last year, which was 5.5% to 8%. So for 2021, this translates to a range of $975 million to $1 billion. I would note, this includes costs to support BMO and M&T, but is prior to expenses associated with Waddell & Reed.
Moving on to Q4 promotional expenses, they were $48 million, down $10 million sequentially, primarily driven by lower conference expenses following our national sales conference in Q3.
Turning to Q1, we anticipate promotional expense will increase by approximately $10 million, primarily driven by increased transition assistance from recruiting, and BMO and M&T on-boarding expenses. Looking ahead, we anticipate BMO will join by the end of Q1 and M&T will join during the middle of this year.
Now let’s talk about Waddell & Reed. We are excited about the transaction and encouraged by the progress we are making with advisors. As mentioned, Waddell & Reed advisors serving approximately 80% of client assets have committed to join our platform, following the close of the transaction. This puts us above our 70% modeling assumption, thus far in the process. I would also note, Waddell & Reed Wealth Management assets at the end of Q4 were $70 billion, which is up $7 billion from Q3.
With respect to the ongoing earnings benefit from Waddell & Reed, we will have updated estimates as we move towards the close and onboarding dates, which we expect to be in the middle of this year. That said, today I would like to provide some color on the acquisition and integration costs, which we continue to estimate will be approximately $85 million.
That said, to provide more transparency, we will add an acquisition cost line item to our management P&L beginning next quarter. We think reviewing our results prior to these acquisition costs will be helpful in understanding our financials.
So starting in Q1, we will report our results as EPS prior to intangibles and acquisition costs. As we look ahead, our integration work is progressing well and we anticipate up to $10 million of acquisition costs in Q1.
Looking at share-based compensation expense, it was $8 million in Q4, relatively flat to Q3. Looking ahead, Q1 tends to be our highest quarter of the year, given the timing of our annual stock awards, so we anticipate this expense will increase by a few million dollars sequentially.
Turning to depreciation and amortization, it was $29 million in Q4, up $1 million sequentially. Looking ahead, we continue to invest in technology and recently rolled out several improvements to our advisory platform and end client experience. As a result, we expect depreciation and amortization to increase by $4 million sequentially.
Moving on to capital allocation, our balance sheet remained strong in Q4 with credit agreement net leverage at 2.16 times and cash available for corporate use of $280 million.
As for capital deployment, our framework remains focused on allocating capital aligned with the returns we generate, investing in organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A opportunities where appropriate and returning excess capital to shareholders.
In the near-term, we expect the majority of our capital deployment to be focused on organic growth and M&A, as we onboard BMO, M&T and Waddell & Reed. Once we have completed these transitions, we plan to reassess our capital deployment opportunities.
And if at that time we have excess capital to deploy beyond organic growth and M&A opportunities, we would anticipate restarting share repurchases. That said, we will have to see what our opportunities look like at that time.
In closing, we delivered another quarter and year of strong business and financial results. And as we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue investing to serve our advisors, grow our business and create long-term shareholder value.
With that, Operator, please open the call for questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your question, please. Hey, Dan. Hey, Matt. Good afternoon. Hi. So I wanted to start with a question on organic growth. As you noted, you are coming off a record year organic growth north of 7% 4Q was your strongest quarter and 9%. So momentum was clearly building nicely towards year end. I was hoping you could speak to what you are seeing in terms of the backlog across both the traditional market, as well as some of the newer camps and how that compares with the year ago levels. Is this what’s informing your confidence around the sustainability of that 7% plus organic growth rate from here? Yes. Steven, so let me let me take a stab at that, and please, if I don’t get it all, you ask a follow on? So, look, the short answer is, as we said in the remarks, we think that pace around 7% is sustainable. And then we continue to challenge ourselves to expand on that growth rate.
So let me give you a little color as to how we think about that. I think one quick way to orient yourself to it is, how do we get to where we are over the last call it three years and that’s been driven by new store sales increasing by 50% over that period of time, which has come almost totally out of our traditional markets.
Retention rates have improved from 96% to 98% over that period of time. So that’s also a helpful contribution. And then same-store sales continue kind of a steady, durable, increase over that period of time. And so what you have done is you have gone over that period of time from roughly below 3% organic growth rate to 7%.
Now, as we look ahead, relative to the opportunity to both sustain, but more importantly, grow that rate, we look to new store sales first, and see the new markets that we have entered, the strategic wealth services model, the independent employee model and the RA markets, and obviously, see a much bigger opportunity set with momentum building inside those three new offerings, which largely haven’t contributed a whole lot to our growth up to this point. So that that’s one opportunity.
Certainly this emerging new bank opportunity with respect to larger banks exploring outsourcing is a second way to think about an opportunity going forward. And then we continue to improve our own efficacy of our business development team and its capabilities to grow and win at higher rates. That’s a third one as we continue to innovate there.
And then, finally, I think we continue to innovate around onboarding and the more seamless we can make that we believe creates two more movement in the marketplace in the future. So those are how we think about opportunities and new store sales.
I think it would be, if you click over the same-store sales for a minute, we see the opportunity to continue to drive automation into the advisors key workflows that then they get the benefits of efficiency, freeing up time to reallocate to more valuable activities.
We also see this technology creating more scalability in their practices. So they can obviously attracted support more clients. We continue to build out new solutions for their organic growth efforts. And finally, this new M&A Solutions becomes yet another way for them to create another lever to grow their practices.
So across new store and same-store says you have got multiple oars in the water that we are working on, in order to drive that rate higher. If we are successful on executing on these, well, then you can see where the logic around the opportunity set grows and we deliver higher growth rates. I hope that helps. No. That’s great, Dan, a very fulsome response. So thanks for all that color. And maybe just follow up for Matt, just on the ICA outlook. The lack of deposit appetite from third-party banks, it’s something we have been hearing from you and also for many of your competitors. Typically, we don’t see demand for cash increase until short rates start to rise. Clients are to engage in some form of cash sorting. And if we enter a prolonged period where short rates are at zero, but the yield curve steepens materially. How do you see demand from third-party banks evolving? Do you anticipate you are going to have opportunities to turn out the cash, take advantage of this deepening and if cash balance continue to build from here, should we assume that that’s going to fall into the overflow bucket? Are there opportunities to maybe optimize the pricing there as well? Yeah. Steven, I think, you summarized the market well. I think right now there is so much liquidity in the market from lots of sources that you all know that there’s just not a lot of demand for the banks on the sweet fund side. So I think you see that the balance is flowing into overflow contracts, a little over $2 billion this quarter. And I think in the near-term, that’s likely where cash would go.
But I think on your point and your scenario, as we move past, what I call, just kind of the technicals of the market right now. I think in an environment where near-term rates are low, but the curve starts to steepen. I think there’s opportunities to move into fixing that environment, right? So, of course, it’s always hard to predict. But I think this environment we are in right now is really just driven by that excess cash.
Now, when you look at our financials, right, and we target and being in the 50% to 75% zone for fixed, and we are hovering in the kind of a third of the 35% zone, there’s pretty meaningful upside when we are able to do that. So I think we are comfortable long-term that opportunity is there. But today that -- it’s -- there’s just not a lot of demand. That’s great, Matt. Thanks so much for taking my questions. You bet. Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Katz with Citigroup. Your question, please. Okay. Thank you very much. Good evening, everybody. Appreciate you taking the questions. Maybe, Dan, start with you. So I am intrigued by your commentary about maybe taking Business Solutions on the road. I was just wondering if you could maybe flesh out how you sort of thinking about that beta test, what kind of milestones you might be looking for and then how do you think about the TAM associated with that? Yeah. So, Bill, good question. I -- look, first of all, these Business Solutions are subscription based services, right? So that gives us flexibility as to how an advisor can plug in and leverage the LPL platform. So that’s the premise where you have a bit more flexibility in this concept about being able to serve advisors outside of the LPL family, if you will.
And today we are focused on continuing to innovate and deliver those services for LPL advisors. So that’s where the majority of our allocation of investment goes across this strategic play. And that’s allowing us to continue to learn and innovate on our offering.
That said, our hypothesis is, these services could potentially be offered to all 300,000 financial advisors in the marketplace. If you think about that premise of, if I am operating my own business and I have local level services that are necessary to support the operation of that business. Well, then we believe we can step in and create higher quality solutions at a lower cost using automation and digital capabilities to create real interesting scalability.
And you began to see where you could take for an example, take our M&A Solutions that we were just talking about and if we do that well for LPL advisors, then we could easily take that and point that to an advisor that doesn’t necessarily sit on our platform today and help create growth opportunities associated with a practice by providing or plugging in to that type of solution. So that’s the concept.
Your right, call it, an experimental phase now. I think it’s logical for us in our overall journey around this play to begin to experiment there and it’s early days of that experiment. We will likely take one of these solutions and begin to explore how that might work and present itself outside of the of the LPL family of advisors. And that will allow us some learning that didn’t apply and further innovate on how we might take this portfolio outside the LPL advisor base. I hope that helps. That’s very helpful. I appreciate the incremental change there. Follow up question is for you, Dan or for Matt, two-part. So I apologize for sneaking that extra question in. But so on the 20% of the Waddell Financial advisor that haven’t agreed to this point, I was wondering if you can provide some color on why not? And then could you just help me understand, I apologize if I show you know this, the interplay between the integration charges associated with Waddell and any flow through onto the Core G&A line? Thank you. Yeah. Thanks, Bill. I will take the first part of that and Matt, you take the second. How about that? Pretty good. So, Bill, as you recall, we announced the transaction in early December and at that point we began our retention efforts associated with the Waddell & Reed advisors. And so we have been at that largely six weeks. And so what you are seeing is that 80% retention rate has more to do with just the timing and where we are in the overall process than anything else.
As Matt said, we expect to close and convert in the second quarter. So there’s still time left to have that ongoing dialogue and make sure that all advisors can make an informed choice around where that best option is for them. So think about that just as more where we are in the timing process than anything else. Matt, do you want to take the second part of that? Yeah. Sure. Bill on the Waddell & Reed expenses, they are not included in Core G&A. So we are going to have a separate line item that includes the acquisition and integration expenses. So you can clearly see that and there weren’t any in Q4. Okay. Thank you. I will follow up offline. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Your question, please. Hey. Good afternoon, Dan, Matt, and congrats on the record organic growth. Hey. Thank you. So I am just wanted to start with the Waddell & Reed transaction first. So its advisors hold a very high percentage of Waddell and IV product. How do you think about the trajectory for them to reinvest this product into other funds and could this have any economic impact on LPL or the commission rates and shelf fees roughly in line with the product on LPL platform? Yeah. Do you want me. Yeah. Take that Matt and then I will add color around that. Yeah. Sure. Yeah. It sounds good. So, Craig, I would just highlight the partnership with Macquarie that really that we worked with on this transaction together. So I think when we look on the other side of closing and integration, I think we see ourselves continuing to be that strong partner with Macquarie, meaning the IV Funds moving over to their platform.
So I think that relationship and that synergy being able to continue the experience that what all advisors have with those funds today. On the other side of this transaction was a really, really important part of the, I think, what made this deal exciting for all three parties. So I just wanted to give you, just emphasize that from a strategic level and then Dan is anything you would add. Yeah. More from an operational standpoint, we don’t expect some big reallocation or shift in, how they are thinking about their portfolios or using what will then be Macquarie product on a go forward basis. So, I don’t think you are going to see some big step function change in terms of the allocation of those assets. So I am not sure you see any then knock on effect from that, which is the second part of your question. Great. Helpful. And I had one question on the production retention, it’s still at a really nice level, but we have watched it go down for three quarters now. Can you talk about any puts and takes or seasonality that could be acting -- that could be impacting 4Q or any other perspective on it would be helpful? Yeah. I think you are talking about our overall retention inside LPL. And look, I think, this is mainly just, you have seen it increase throughout the year, which is largely a matter of timing related to the impact the pandemic had in the early part of the year. So where might have been more complex or tougher inside that four-month to five-month period of real uncertainty. I think you just see now some of that pulling through.
As we think about it and look at it over the full year, you have got 98% retention, and as I shared last quarter, we think about a good sustainable range being somewhere around 2% to 3% of attrition or said differently 97% to 98% retention. So that’s what we are trying to manage to and work to and we feel good about the client experience and the advisor experience we are providing. And that is the primary driver of that attrition rate or retention rate and so that’s kind of how we are managing to it and thinking about it. I hope that helps. Thank you, Dan. Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Hey, guys. Good evening. I wanted to ask you around TA packages that are out there in the marketplace right now. Obviously, Raymond James talked about seeing a little bit more pressure in that market, sounds like that’s more in the employee channel, which is small for you guys for now, but curious if you seeing any meaningful change there? And maybe, Matt on -- Matt, the follow on is for you, I guess, with respect to promotional expense, to what extent that’s putting some incremental pressure on promotional expense for you guys into ‘21? I will take the first half of that and then Matt, I will turn it over to you. So, look, the short answer is, we are not seeing a lot of change in transition assistance rates this time. And you said it as a core principle for us, we determined transition assistance on a return basis approach and our TA rates have been stable over the last few quarters and as we enter this New Year, we don’t see that changing.
And when we look ahead, we think about TA and how it’s currently positioned or transition assistance, along with the rest of our value proposition from capabilities, technology and service and believe that that’s an overall really solid competitive offering and believe, as we go forward, that it will be a source of us continuing to gain market share. Do you want to talk about promotional expense? Yeah. I think I was just building what Dan said, I think, with the rates being stable, I think promo and the transition assistance amortization. If that’s going up in a meaningful way, it’s simply because recruiting and therefore organic growth has gone up. So I think it will move along with our recruiting success and the rates themselves really have been quite stable. Great. Perfect. And then just a follow up on Waddell & Reed, I know you guys give a little bit of color on the kind of the composition of the assets, et cetera, at the time that the deal was announced. But on the 80% that you already sort of retained, an you give us an update on sort of what’s the gross profit ROAs on that base and the mix of assets kind of equity fixed income? Thanks. Yeah. Not yet. I think it’s a little bit early. I think as we move towards close and onboard and we will start to get more updates on overall economics. I think, today we wanted to really highlight the early success on the retention front. So we will give you more on that at a future date. All right. We will stay tune. Thanks. Yeah. Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Your question, please. Yeah. Thanks. Can you guys talk a little bit about your risk management controls and what you are doing to keep risk reasonably well controlled with all the growth that you guys are seeing across the platform? Yeah. Let me take that one and then, certainly, you can add anything to that. Look, it’s a core component and value proposition of what we offer, both from a protection of -- to the firm, to the advisors, to the clients. But it’s also a really important value proposition for us of taking complexity out of this business and simplifying it to enable the advisors to operate their businesses successfully.
So it’s a place that we have constantly have to innovate on regardless of our growth rates, but in a world where you are growing that just creates more opportunity to allocate resources to think about how you improve the efficacy and the efficiency of compliance and our overall risk management programs.
And though we are not perfect and though we will try to play into that, I think, look, there’s key components of our overall risk profile that we look at. There’s some 16 different risk components that we actively monitor and review how we are doing in, in those areas. So think about that is managing your day-to-day risk or your operational risk.
And then as a complement to that, there’s that strategic opportunity that says, hey, how do we take and use robotics and artificial intelligence and automation of which to enrich the efficacy of our supervision, of our oversight? How do we imagine new ways of which to use technology to drive efficiency into what we do, which simply just then creates much more scalability to support that growth.
And so we look at it through an operational lens and track that on a monthly basis and hold ourselves accountable to constantly iterating and learning and applying what we are doing well and or not to improve it and then we allocate resources to drive innovation to do it better.
And look, our goal is to take risk management and turn it into an asset. If we continue to invest in it and we can do it better and cheaper than anyone else, it becomes a differentiator. And so that’s how we think about our risk management programs and that’s sort of what is our Northstar [ph], if you will, with respect to risk management. Helpful. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Campbell with Barclays. Your question, please. Hey. Thanks. Looks like a really nice December drove the big robust with acceleration and M&A growth, but also it’s like your recruited assets was pretty stable with prior couple of quarters. So just wondering if you could unpack some of the key drivers behind the December pickup? Yeah. Hey, Jeremy. It’s Matt. I think when you look at the interest and dividends component of that and as to your observation that happens typically in the third month of each quarter. And then in the third month of Q4, at year end in December, you have got a lot of funds that will distribute things annually. So that was a driver of it.
But even if he had kind of pulled that uptick out, when you look at our growth rate in Q4 at 8.8%, that was about a 0.5 percentage point, so still above an 8% organic growth rate. So really, really strong quarter in our view, but that interest dynamic that happens at the end of the year was the thing that bias December up over that. And if I added anything to that, I think, if click down on that, this is where you see that durable, but steady trend upward in same-store sales, where you are seeing advisors doing a really great job of serving and supporting their existing clients. So they are actually capturing assets from those existing clients at a higher rate than historically and certainly pre-pandemic.
At the same time, we have seen them now return to capturing or acquiring new clients at the rates, they were pre-pandemic and so some of that dynamic underneath fourth quarter is certainly supportive of increasing growth rates both across the quarter, I am sorry, across the whole quarter and ramping up within the quarter. Got it. Great. And then, Dan, you gave some really nice high level color around with the growth trajectory going forward to an earlier question, but I don’t know whether this is for you or for Matt, but can you just give us a quick update around how January activity is shaping up so far or will shape up? Matt, do you want to take that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I will take that one, Jeremy. Since we are sitting here in February, we certainly have some thoughts on January. So, overall, it pretty well. I mean, we are still finalizing the results. But I would describe it as growth consistent with what we saw in 2020, right. So nice organic growth.
There are a couple of things to highlight though for January by its nature, kind of the building on how are we just talking about December, by its nature, that drives NNA a little bit lower for that month.
The first one is December recruiting. I think you know this well, but FINRA shuts down for the last week or two of the year. So you just don’t have new advisors coming onto the platform. So it naturally slows NNA down in the beginning -- the early parts of January each year.
And then just building on what we are talking about December, while month three is the highest kind of interest and fees driven NNA of the month, month one is the lowest, right, because you have the advisor fees coming out primarily in the first month of the quarter.
So those two things together kind of put a naturally have you -- have a decline in January, when I put all that together, I think, we would expect January to be in the 4% to 5% growth -- organic growth. But again, we will finalize those results and release them in a couple weeks. Perfect. Thanks a lot. You bet. Thank you. Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your question, please. Hi. Good evening. Just a couple of follow ups on promotional expenses. I am wondering if you have any update on how much TA you are contemplating for the Waddell deal, whether TA rates associated with those Waddell assets you are expecting to onboard? And then separately, how should we think about the return of some higher non-TA related promotional expenses in a post pandemic world? Maybe frame how much expense benefit you realize there in 2020 due to lower conference spend or something else? Okay. Okay. I guess. Yeah. So, Kyle, I will start there. I think on the Waddell side, I think, we and Dan talked about our approach and thoughts on TA a little bit earlier. And I’d say, we have the same approach with Waddell.
So there’s really no different approach. They are making sure that we put those advisors in a position to successfully transition onto our platform. That’s what transition assistance is for. And we will underwrite it in the same way.
I think on the conference side of things and I will get a little color here, and Dan, if you want to jump in. But I think as we evolve over time, I think, like most folks we see on the other side of the pandemic doing a mix of continued virtual and digital things, but also, people value getting together in person. I think, especially in the independent advisory space, folks value getting together.
So I likely see us having a mix of what we had pre-pandemic, but it’s a little bit early to kind of call where and how those numbers start to change. So we will keep you updated a quarter ahead of time kind of how we gave -- how we did here today on promotional for next quarter. That’s on a cost side. I don’t know Dan if there is anything you want to add. No. well said. Yeah. All right. We are all good there, Kyle. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Gerry O’Hara with Jefferies. Your question, please. Great. Thanks and good evening, folks. Matt, perhaps, you could give a little bit more detail just around the Waddell timeline as it relates now to the close advisor onboarding and synergy runway. I know you had a nice graphic in the presentation last quarter and I may have missed it this time around, but if you could help us just kind of walk through that a little bit, that would be appreciated? Yeah. Sure. Gerry, we didn’t update it, but it’s unchanged. So I think when we think about the next key dates, which are closing into the subsequent asset transfer. Our estimate for that is the middle of this year and then the integration, the on-boarding process, et cetera occurs after that and I think that will lead to an EBITDA benefit ramp of about 12 months after closing.
So if you think we are closing and onboarding in the middle of this year, that will have us reach that run rate EBITDA estimate by the middle of next year or the middle of 2022. Yeah, so that’s what was in that presentation and those estimates are the same today. Okay. Thanks. And then just a follow-up, I think in the prepared remarks, Dan, you mentioned kind of the evolving opportunity around the custodial platform. Is there any potential kind of color you could add or context as to what that opportunity might be sizing or just, I guess, clients advisors anything you might be able to add would be helpful? Yeah. Hi. I will just give you a higher level macro overview at this point. I think we can give you more color as we move forward. But with respect to our RA offering, we currently provide this solution to a number of advisors.
That said, we are investing in our capabilities and resources that we believe match that growing opportunity set. As we do expect over the next few years more advisor movement or churn across that space. And so we believe we can put together an interesting differentiated solution that will contribute to our ongoing organic growth and be a nice contribution to increasing that organic growth rate.
So that’s how we see that and where we are is continuing to make sure we have got that differentiated solution and that we have got the resources in place to take that to the market. So more color on that as we go forward throughout the year, but hopefully that gives you a sort of our jumping off-point. That’s helpful. Thanks for taking my questions this evening. Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Shutler with William Blair. Your question, please. Hi, guys. Good afternoon. On the $10 million expected increase in promotional expense quarter-over-quarter, how much of that is BMO and M&T, and how much is something else? I am guessing marketing and conference expense are reasonably stable sequentially, so I am just trying to figure out if that Q1 level is kind of a new jumping off point or how to think about anything that might be that’s more seasonal or one-time? Yeah. Chris, M&T and BMO are about half of that. There are large financial institutions where there is a bit more technology, a bit more on-boarding support, so that’s why you see that increase. And well, I wouldn’t call that one-time. I call it connected to on-boarding a large financial institution.
So anytime we have those coming, you will see a little bit of a pickup in promotional for that, but it is, to your point, it’s not recurring, it’s just associated with those firms. And the rest of it’s really -- there is a handful of things in there, but it’s primarily tied to transition assistance amortization as we continue to recruit. Okay. So the half associated with the two big banks is not amortization of transition assistance, it’s other stuff? That’s right. That’s right. Okay. They haven’t joined yet. So that wouldn’t have begun. Yeah. Makes sense. Okay. And then the other one was just on the new M&A offering, maybe just give us a sense of how you plan to price that offering. I am guessing the workload there could vary a decent bit depending on the advisory firm that you are working with or the complexity of the target. So help us think through how to sort of think about that? Yeah. Let me give you a little color on that, and again, I think, there is more to play out here as we go forward. So I can -- if I can answer anything -- everything today, I think, we can give you that color over the next couple of months.
And so with respect to our M&A solutions, again what we are trying to solve for is actually helping advisors acquire other practices to integrate into their businesses, right? So that’s the context, and quite frankly, we realized and recognized and working with our advisors, that many of them saw this as an opportunity, but saw the complexity associated with M&A really hard and it kept them out of exploring those opportunities.
So our concept was, could we go create or build a solution that makes it much easier and simpler for them to go from point A to Z in that M&A process and thus in building a platform that helps them do that. If they do it once, then we are going to increase the odds, that they can do it again and again, you sort of create this repeatable, sustainable growth lever for them and a bit of a flywheel, if you think about it across a larger number of advisors.
So that’s the concept. And so what we have done over the last year is build that end-to-end platform for ourselves. So we will deliver that with LPL resources. So we have got a technology platform we have built that will host that and drive that and digitize that and make that easier.
We obviously have access to the marketplace and will help facilitate that marketplace of buyers and sellers. We can give good transaction advice around that. We know this well and we know the models well. So we can provide advisor and we are positioned to do that and we can also provide the capital funding or an option to the advisor for their capital funding.
So it’s really delivered by us. We are not working with other advisory firms. And again, us doing it as a service, our opportunity is to certainly charge for the value that we are providing associated with managing through that process. But the real win for us is at the end of it is helping these advisors capture assets and grow on the platform.
And so that’s how we think about that. That’s how you would see us pricing it associated with the more discounted fees for the value that we provide in the M&A process knowing that we can both help retain and grow organic assets on our platform. So I hope that helps you get the principles in the macro way we are thinking about it, more to come when we roll it out on pricing and things of that nature and that will happen in this quarter. All right. Thank you, Matt and Dan. Okay. Thank you. Our last question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your question, please. Hey. Good evening and thanks for squeezing me in here. I just want to come back to the client cash levels, looks like the allocations there came in a bit 5.4%, client cash allocations. I guess how do you see that evolving from here? Where do you see that leveling out say a year or two from now? And what environment, would you say that it would be higher or lower and has there anything changed structurally that could result in a different cash allocation than what we have seen historically on your platform? Yeah. I mean, I think, it’s -- I mean when you -- maybe the book in to look at, right? If you look at the periods that we have got in our key metrics supplement, right? We -- you kind of bottomed out in the low 4% range and think of that as probably the max deployed in the market that we have seen and then the other extreme is, when you go back years and years ago when you have seen the max pullback is in the 9% to 10%.
So it kind of feels like where we are right now at least with recent history, balances are a little bit high. I don’t think it would surprise us if you get on the other side of a pandemic with vaccines out and whatever environment you would describe as the new normal.
It wouldn’t surprise us if that -- if you saw that 5.4% start to go back down as you see money go into the market. But I’d emphasize of course that’s a really hard one to predict. But I think if -- when we look at the history that we have, that’s probably what we would expect to see. Got it. And just a quick follow-up on the money fund and DCA yields there, they continue to come in the fourth quarter. Just curious, any color you could share on the drivers there and what would need to happen to see further compression or -- and what scenario, could it even go negative or how do you think about any sort of floor on that and thoughts into ‘21? Yeah. Remember DCA was a little bit challenging, because it’s a fee-per-account, not a rate. So balances moving around can just change that reported rate, because it’s a fee-per-account type fee. So I wouldn’t read into that -- the move into that much.
On the money market side, I think, you are just seeing the dynamic of interest rates being near zero and those products where the product manufacturers can waive fees that puts a little bit of pressure on the yields.
But I don’t think it’s anything that you unexpected in an environment where Fed funds is in the 7, 8, 9 zone. I think that’s what you expect to see on money funds. And of course emphasize, when you look at the balances, those are -- of our nearly $50 billion in client cash balances those are pretty small piece of the overall pie. Great. Thank you. Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our Q&A session for today. I will turn the call back to Dan Arnold for his final remarks. Yeah. Thank you, Carmel. And thanks everyone for taking the time to join us this afternoon. We really appreciate it. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Have a great rest of your day.

This combination positions us to deliver another quarter of solid results while also continuing to make progress on our strategic plan.
I'd like to review both of these areas, starting with our first quarter business results. In the quarter, total assets reached a new high of over $950 billion, up more than 40% from a year ago. This increase was primarily driven by continued organic growth and equity market appreciation. With respect to organic growth, first quarter net new assets were $29 billion, which included $12 billion from BMO Harris Financial Advisors. This result translated to double-digit annualized growth of 13%, driven by continued strength across new store sales, same-store sales and retention. First quarter recruited assets were $24 billion, which includes $15 billion from BMO. This result brought our total recruited assets over the past year to a new high of $56 billion.
Our continued progress on recruiting is primarily driven by the appeal of our model, our ongoing innovation for the future and the expanded flexibility of our platform. At the same time, we further enhanced the adviser experience through continued delivery of new capabilities and technology as well as the ongoing modernization of our service and operations functions. As a result, asset retention remained solid at 98% in the first quarter and Net Promoter Scores increased year-over-year.
Our first quarter business results led to solid financial outcomes with $1.77 of EPS prior to intangibles and acquisition cost. Let's now turn to the progress we have made executing our strategic plan. As a reminder, we have evolved our long-term vision. We aspire to expand beyond our old vision of extending our leadership in the independent space and redefine the independent model over time, and by doing so, become the leader across the entire adviser centered marketplace. Now our approach is to build a platform that is simple and straightforward for advisers to use with the flexibility to construct the perfect practice for themselves and their clients. This approach breaks down the walls between traditional market segments and instead focuses on creating total empowerment for LPL advisers to thrive and that is the heart of our mission.
Doing this well gives us a sustainable path to higher levels of organic growth, increased market leadership and long-term shareholder value creation. Now to execute on our strategy, we have organized our work into 4 strategic plays, which I'd like to review with you in turn. Our first strategic play involves meeting advisers where they are in the evolution of their practice. By winning in our traditional markets, while also leveraging new affiliation models to expand our addressable markets. Strategically, we believe this combination positions us to not only deliver sustainable and repeatable organic growth, but to also increase our growth rate over time. In our traditional markets, while overall industry adviser movement remained at lower levels in the first quarter, we continue to gain share and grow our pipeline.
Looking more specifically at the regional bank segment of our financial institution channel, we onboarded BMO Harris Financial Advisors in late March. We continue to prepare for M&T to join in the next few months and we advanced conversations with additional prospects. With respect to the expansion of our addressable markets, we continue to see momentum building in our new affiliation models. Earlier this month, we onboarded 2 new practices to Strategic Wealth Services, bringing us to a total of 7 on the platform. And earlier this week, we added another adviser to our employee-based model. Looking ahead, we feel good about our pipeline for both of these models.
Another key component of this strategic play is using M&A as a complement to organic growth. With respect to our acquisition of Waddell & Reed's wealth management business, we now have commitments from Waddell & Reed advisers who serve approximately 95% of client assets. We are engaging closely with these advisers to help them prepare to transition to LPL and begin leveraging our platform to serve their clients and grow their businesses.
Our second strategic play is focused on providing capabilities that help our existing advisers differentiate in the marketplace and drive efficiency in their practices. One of the key components of this play is enriching the end client experience. Advisory platforms are increasingly at the center of the end-client experience as the secular trend towards advisory continues in our business and across the industry.
Given this, we remain focused on providing our advisers with an industry-leading advisory platform, including a number of recent enhancements. Within the quarter, we introduced simplified pricing and lowered account minimums on our centrally managed platforms. We also expanded our no-transaction-fee ETF product offering, which now serves about 40% of ETF assets in advisory accounts. At the same time, we are introducing new platform capabilities in the spirit of creating a differentiated UMA offering that combines multiple centrally managed portfolios within a single account. These enhancements increase the appeal, accessibility and flexibility of our advisory offering, which in turn supports our advisers' efforts to serve their clients and win in the marketplace.
Let's next move to our third strategic play, which involves creating an industry-leading service experience to delight advisers and their clients and that, in turn, helps drive adviser retention. A key component of this strategic play is transforming our service model into an omnichannel client care model that provides our advisers with differentiated service.
In Q1, we completed the rollout of live chat as a complement to our voice channel. Advisers now have a choice of either voice or chat to efficiently connect with a service professional who is trained and certified to answer their specific question. Our next step is completing the rollout of our digital self-service experience, which, together with voice and chat will position advisers to access industry-leading service at a time and in a manner that works best for them. We also continue to automate and streamline key elements of our service operations.
In Q1, our area of focus included enhancing the administrative support around tax season, digitizing forms and automating account transfers. Enhancements in these areas are helping strengthen the adviser experience and the scalability of our platform as our business grows.
By remaining focused on the transformation of our service model into a client care model and continuous improvement through the automation and streamlining of our service operations, we believe we are making positive contributions to the service experience, adviser retention and Net Promoter Scores.
Our fourth strategic play is focused on helping advisers run the most successful businesses in the independent marketplace. One of the key components of this play is our portfolio of business solutions, which help advisers operate their businesses so they can focus on serving their clients and growing their practices. As we discussed last quarter, we see several pathways for continued business solutions growth, including partnering with more of our advisers, introducing new solutions to the portfolio and experimenting with serving advisers outside LPL.
In the first quarter, our subscription base continued to scale to about 1,700 monthly subscriptions, that generated annualized revenue of approximately $19 million. This growth was primarily driven by our ongoing expansion and evolution of the value proposition of our existing portfolio.
Looking at our product road map, we continue to enhance our existing portfolio of solutions, while expanding into new offerings. In Q1, we launched M&A solutions, which is generating solid demand, including over 50 advisers who are leveraging this offering today. In Q2, we plan to introduce our seventh business solution, Client Engage. Now this is -- this evolved from our existing marketing offering and is focused on providing advisers with a digital approach to effectively and efficiently stay connected with their clients.
As we look outside LPL, we plan to begin marketing M&A solutions later this year. By experimenting with this scalable technology-driven solution, we can efficiently learn from serving outside advisers, while continuing to focus our resources and investments on delivering business solutions to LPL advisers.
Now before closing, I also want to highlight that we released our 2021 sustainability report last week. We believe operating a sustainable business is good for all of our stakeholders. We hope this report provides helpful insight into our practices and performance.
In summary, in the first quarter, we continued to invest in the value proposition for advisers and their clients, while driving growth and increasing our market leadership. As we look ahead, we remain focused on executing our strategy to help our advisers further differentiate and win in the marketplace, and as a result, drive long-term shareholder value.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt. All right. Thank you, Dan, and I'm glad to speak with everyone on today's call. As we move into 2021, we remain focused on serving our advisers, growing our business and delivering shareholder value. This focus led to the highest quarter of organic growth in our history. And in addition, we are in the midst of onboarding what will become 3 of our largest partners in BMO, M&T and Waddell & Reed. We expect these 3 partners to collectively add approximately $100 billion of AUM to our platform, bringing our total AUM to over $1 trillion.
Now let's turn to our first quarter business results. Total advisory and brokerage assets increased to a new high of $958 billion, up 6% from Q4, driven by continued organic growth and higher equity markets. Looking at organic growth, total net new assets were $29 billion, which translates to a 12.8% annualized growth rate. Prior to large bank onboarding, organic growth was 7.6%.
Moving on to recruiting and retention. We continue to produce strong results in the first quarter. Recruited assets in Q1 were the strongest in our history at $24 billion, which included $15 billion from large bank onboarding. These results brought our 12-month recruiting total to a new high of $56 billion.
Looking at retention, it remained strong at 98.1%. I would also note that we updated our retention metric to reflect asset retention rather than our previous method of production retention. We believe this change will be more helpful in evaluating our business results, and we have provided historical data in our Key Metrics presentation, so you can see both the old and new metric.
Moving on to our business mix. We continue to see positive trends in Q1. Advisory net new assets were $23 billion or a 20% annualized growth rate. With this growth, our advisory assets are now 52% of total assets as we continue to deliver differentiated advisory capabilities and benefit from the secular trend towards advisory.
Now let's turn to our Q1 financial results. Strong organic growth combined with expense discipline led to EPS prior to intangibles and acquisition costs of $1.77. Looking at our top line growth. Gross profit reached a new high of $579 million, up $46 million or 9% sequentially. Looking at the components, commission and advisory fees net of payout were $184 million, up $31 million from Q4, primarily driven by organic growth and seasonally lower production expense.
Moving on to asset-based revenues. Sponsor revenues were $168 million in Q1, up $14 million sequentially as average assets increased driven by organic growth and higher equity markets.
Turning to client cash revenues. They were $97 million, down $8 million from Q4, driven by lower client cash yields. Looking at client cash balances, they remained elevated at $48 million, roughly flat with last quarter. As for client cash yields, our Q1 ICA yield was 99 basis points, down 9 basis points from Q4. The decrease during the quarter was primarily driven by fixed rate and LIBOR-based contracts that matured and lower short-term interest rates.
Looking ahead to Q2, we will have the full quarter impact of the $0.5 billion of fixed rate contracts that matured in Q1 as well as another $1 billion of fixed rate contracts maturing in Q2. Given these factors and where interest rates, client rates and cash balances are today, we would expect our Q2 ICA yield to be in the mid-90 basis point range. I would also note, we have no additional fixed rate contracts maturing in the second half of this year.
Moving on to Q1 transaction and fee revenues. They were $141 million, up $11 million sequentially, driven by trading volume that increased throughout the quarter. Looking ahead to Q2, trading activity in April has declined from the elevated levels we saw in Q1. And if this trend continues through the quarter, we would expect transaction revenue to decline by about $10 million.
Turning to Business Solutions. They continue to scale with 1,700 subscriptions at the end of Q1. This is up 300 from last quarter and more than double a year ago. These offerings now generate roughly $19 million of annual revenue, up from $17 million last quarter. And more importantly, they help free up additional time for advisers to spend on more valuable activities, including serving their clients and growing their practices.
Now let's turn to expenses, starting with core G&A. It was $236 million in Q1. Looking ahead, we continue to anticipate full year 2021 core G&A to be in a range of $975 million to $1 billion. As a reminder, this includes cost to support BMO and M&T, but is prior to expenses associated with Waddell & Reed.
Moving on to Q1 promotional expenses. They were $54 million, up $6 million sequentially, primarily driven by increased transition assistance from higher recruiting and large bank onboarding expenses.
Turning to Q2, we anticipate promotional expense will increase by approximately $5 million prior to Waddell & Reed, primarily driven by increased transition assistance and large bank onboarding expenses.
Looking at share-based compensation expense, it was $11 million in Q1, up from $8 million in Q4. Looking ahead to Q2, we expect share-based compensation expense to be at a similar level to Q1.
Turning to depreciation and amortization. It was $35 million in Q1, up $7 million sequentially as several improvements to our advisory platform and end-client experience were rolled out sooner than anticipated. Looking ahead, we expect depreciation in Q2 to be in line with Q1 levels.
Now let's move to Waddell & Reed. The transaction is progressing better than we originally estimated across multiple fronts. As mentioned, Waddell & Reed advisor is serving approximately 95% of client assets have committed to join our platform. Factoring in this higher level of retention and current asset levels, we expect the run rate EBITDA benefit from Waddell & Reed to be at least $80 million, up from our original $50 million estimate. As a result of the higher retention, we now expect $110 million of acquisition costs, up from our original estimate of $85 million. These updates bring our estimated purchase multiple to 5x EBITDA, an improvement from our original estimate of 6.5x EBITDA.
Now I want to provide an update on our expected close timing. Over the past several months, we have had strong collaboration with Waddell & Reed and Macquarie, and we have received the required regulatory approvals. As a result, we are pleased to share that we anticipate closing the acquisition of Waddell & Reed's wealth management business as early as tomorrow. And we continue to expect to onboard the advisers a few months after closing.
Looking ahead, we are focused on providing transparency on the progress we are making on the transaction. With this in mind, we will share Waddell & Reed financial results in 2 primary categories. First, to provide more clarity around our results, we have added an acquisition cost line item to our management P&L. Looking at Q2, we expect roughly 1/3 of our total acquisition costs to be incurred during the quarter. Second, we will keep you updated each quarter on how we expect EBITDA to build as we progress towards hitting the full run rate benefit by the middle of 2022. In Q2, we expect annualized negative run rate EBITDA of approximately $10 million as we add resources to prepare to support Waddell & Reed.
Moving on to capital management, starting with our debt refinancing. Given the continued strength of our business, combined with the low interest rate environment, we were able to refinance our highest cost debt from 5.75% to 4%, reducing our annual interest expense by $13 million. We were also able to increase the size of our revolver from $750 million to $1 billion.
As for capital deployment, our framework remains focused on allocating capital aligned with the returns we generate, investing in organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A where appropriate and returning excess capital to shareholders. In the near term, we continue to expect the majority of our capital deployment to be focused on organic growth and M&A as we onboard BMO, M&T and Waddell & Reed.
Once we have completed these transitions, we plan to reassess our capital deployment opportunities. And if at that time, we have excess capital to deploy beyond organic growth and M&A, we would anticipate restarting share repurchases. That said, we will have to see what our options look like at that time.
In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results. And as we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue investing to serve our advisers, grow our business and create long-term shareholder value.
With that, operator, please open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Bill Katz from Citigroup. So maybe, Dan, to start off with you. It seems like I'm seeing from the headlines in your comments that the -- there's been acceleration in both Strategic Wealth Services and building so on sort of the independent play side. What's changing at the margin here? Is it just time or maybe a sense of maybe peel back a layer sort of what's been the incremental change in the marketplace that's resonating better? Yes, Bill, thanks for the question. And as a reminder, we just launched these last year, SWS in April and then the employee model in the second half of last year. And as you know, it takes a bit of positioning in the marketplace, seasoning, iterating on your value proposition as you learn and you get feedback, bringing on clients and then having a good experience and being able to use them as a reference to future prospects and considerations. We've also continued to invest and enhance in the talent on our business development team.
So a combination of those things are driving a bigger pipeline, better positioning out in the marketplace from a competitive standpoint, building on existing clients who are having a good experience and then finally using that quality talent to ultimately help go execute. So that's a similar concept for both. SWS, or Strategic Wealth Services, is a bit ahead of the independent employee model only because it started several months earlier, but you can see them on a similar trajectory. I hope that helps. Yes. And then maybe one just for Matt. I guess one of the themes that's been coming out is sort of this excess liquidity in the system overall. I think you mentioned in the last quarter as well. Can you sort of maybe update us your thinking on how to sort of track through fixed to float or float to fix, I should say, and so the ability to sort of drive the third-party sweep opportunity? Yes. Sure, Bill. I think that -- maybe just starting with our strategy and goals here, which are really unchanged, specifically on the fixed rate deposit side, which is really to get to a place where 50% to 75% of the portfolio is fixed. So I think from a long-term perspective, that's where we're headed. But I think to the point of your question and similar to last quarter is when you look at the amount of liquidity in the system right now, there's really just very little demand for deposits. That said, I think you're starting to see some early indicators of that changing and maybe really early indicators, but things like the yield curve starting to steepen, right? The 10-year moving up, where there's a -- for those banks that are on the demand side of these deposits, there's some economics in the spread for them to invest it. Consumer spending picking up, right? There's trillions of dollars in savings and checking accounts that's built up over the pandemic. And as that spending picks up, that going back into the market is one of the things that could lead to that demand.
So if those trends continue, I think those are some of the things that could start to change and improve that demand. But I'd emphasize we're not seeing that pick up today. But I'd just end with, I think, our long-term strategy of moving into that 50% to 75% fixed zone. When there is demand, we feel really good about being able to execute it then. Next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. So I wanted to start off with a question on M&A and the appetite for more transformational deals. In August '17, you announced the NPH transaction. You retained about 70% of the assets as part of the deal. Since then, you've made a lot of enhancements, whether it's investments in digital or just to the platform more broadly and fast forward to Waddell and now you've retained 95%. So just given that much stronger retention and the favorable experience with Waddell, given all the metrics you have in cited. I'm just curious whether that increases your appetite to do more transformational deals as a much higher retention significantly impact some of the future deal math? Yes. So Steven, it's Dan. So look, I think we continue to see M&A from a strategy standpoint as a complement to our organic growth and as you know, we look across the lens of growth opportunities or acceleration of capabilities. And so that hasn't changed in our overall strategy. We do believe that if we're good at executing on these transactions, then that becomes an interesting differentiator and an opportunity for us in terms of how we might structure a deal, value a deal, et cetera. And so we are staying disciplined on making sure with every acquisition that we learned from those and we apply those insights and learnings such that we can execute better the next time.
If you look at the drivers of the difference in these 2 transactions, I think most of it were activities that we control or drive, where we maybe didn't do them as well back in 2017, '18 and we did them much better today. Things like being able to automate and streamline the transition of asset and advisers moving from one place to the next. You take the friction out and help them continue to focus on their clients, that's a pretty appealing scenario. Our ability to take a strategy and go deliver it in a simple articulate manner to help advisers understand what that experience would be like, what their structure, what their economics will be like on the other side of that transaction and do it at pace and clear, you begin to create the right dialogues very quickly that lead to good outcomes. And so those are things that as examples that we continue to learn and evolve and get better in terms of our ability to execute.
So as we go forward, to your point, do we think there's continued consolidation, both in what I might call the smaller transactions across the entire spectrum, the larger transactions? Yes. Would we continue to have an opening and exploring and potentially participating in some of that consolidation? I think based on our strategy, the absolute answer would be yes. And to the extent that we get better and better at executing on these, we will use that insight perspective and advantage to think about how we consider approaching them. Thanks for that color, Dan. And just for my follow-up, I wanted to ask on the centrally managed platform. I mean the assets grew organically at a very impressive 47% rate. It looks like the bulk of the increase in the quarter was tied to the BMO onboarding. I was hoping you could speak to what drove such strong demand for the centrally managed product just from those advisers. And should we expect a higher ROA on those assets given the more attractive economics of centrally managed? Yes. Steven, it's great observation in that you did see solid growth in centrally managed platforms. And you're continuing to see that underlying strong baseline growth and utilization of that platform increase, right? So that didn't change in the first quarter across our entire platform. And as we invest and add capabilities, investment content, lower price, we think those centrally managed solutions only become that much more appealing.
And then you complement that or add that to, in this case, BMO's utilization of centrally managed solutions and that creates a really interesting opportunity not only for us to think about how we expand and grow our centrally managed platform, but even unique capabilities, we may put inside of it that are helpful and supportive of large institutions.
And then all the way finally to large institutions or users of models-based approach and our robust centrally managed solution with MWP enables them to leverage both the growing momentum their advisers have in this space, the great talent they have to serve and support their clients, matched with a platform that is really well aligned with their needs and the way they serve their clients. And that is a pretty interesting formula that certainly drives higher ROA with the more advisory they do and then the utilization of those centrally managed platforms.
Today, BMO's business is about 1/3 advisory, 2/3 brokerage. So as we go forward, we think our platform is a nice tool and a leverage point to help them as they evolve their business in order to serve their clients in the best way possible. Next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. I was hoping to zone in on the retention stats you guys provided, not just for Waddell, but obviously for the book as a whole. It looks like you guys are running at about 98% overall retention on the assets. It's quite a bit above from where we've been historically. And I think, Dan, you talked about the pandemic being sort of one of the reasons why retention might be strong, albeit maybe temporarily. It feels like it's sticking around. So I just wanted to get your updated thoughts on whether or not we sort of entering a bit of a new paradigm with the retention of the assets being as high as it's been recently. Yes, absolutely. As you say, if you look back historically, 3 years, you saw more of a retention rate in the 96% range. We saw -- if you look over the last 12 months, a retention range in the 97.5% level. So as you've said, we've seen some good stability in that 97% to 98% range for the better part of the last 3 quarters, which would indicate there's good staying power beyond the pandemic as you return to what I might call normal movement of advisers in the marketplace. And so we're encouraged by that.
We continue to invest in the model to improve that service experience, expand the capabilities and deliver those to our advisers such that it helps support them operate an efficient practice and effective practice, serve their clients and grow their business, and you would expect retention rates to be pretty sticky. For us, we're trying to manage in that 97% to 98% range and think that's a pretty good solid outcome and a good sustainable place to operate in if we're doing our job of investing in our model, ensuring it's delivering the right value for our clients. Got you. And Matt, a follow-up for you around expenses, I was just hoping to unpack that a little bit. So it sounds like the guidance obviously does not include any expenses related to Waddell & Reed, whether it's kind of their expenses coming on or I guess, expenses that you anticipate to kind of facilitate the transition, if I'm hearing that correctly? So kind of like the $10 million annualized EBITDA drag, for instance, that you're highlighting in the second quarter. That expense is not in your full year expense guide. I just want to, I guess, confirm that. And also, maybe you can help us think through expenses, core G&A inclusive of Waddell. And I guess, secondarily, as you guys pointed out in the slide, first quarter core G&A run rate is below the full year guide. So you anticipate a bit of a ramp. So maybe just kind of walk us through the sources of that ramp. Alex, I think that was a 3-part question. I'll answer. I think -- so you're correct. I think that the guidance of $975 million to $1 billion core G&A, that's excluding Waddell. And the reason for that is just as we ramp up both on the EBITDA side as well as the acquisition costs, I think our perspective was the way to give you the most clarity on that is to really keep them separate. Knowing that Waddell between both the revenues and gross profit and expenses, we're going to be ramping over roughly a year period to that $80 million run rate. So I think that's the way to think about it. I think obviously, when we get to the other side, everything will be put together from a dialogue and a guidance standpoint. I think -- we think that will be the most clear path and way to understand the core or existing business, if you will, as well as how and when, Waddell comes on board. So I think that covers questions 1 and 2.
Question 3, on how the existing business is ramping. And it's really pretty similar to what you've seen in prior years, which is you kind of steadily ramp throughout the year, meaning that Q1 run rate, I think probably the premise of your question or the genesis of your question is where our run rate right now is kind of below the low end of that range. And it's just that natural ramping during the year. And I think you saw that last year as well. So that would be our expectation this year. Next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler of Crédit Suisse. I had a follow-up on Steve's earlier question on the centrally managed platform. We know this business is highly gross profit ROA and ROCA accretive, but can you walk us through the math relative to your advisory assets that are not on the centrally managed platform? Yes, Craig, I think the dynamics haven't really changed. I think centrally managed usually adds about 10 basis points. I think we've got good disclosures in our investor deck on that. So I think the dynamics there are really pretty similar to what we have there. I think what I would add and note specific to BMO, just to build on Dan's comments earlier because that was a big driver in centrally managed for the quarter. When you look at those large financial institutions, right, those are contracts that are negotiated overall. And specific to large financial institutions, they typically start with a high percentage of brokerage, which brokerage assets overall are in that 15 to 20 basis point range. And just given the positive mixes at BMO that Dan highlighted, 1/3 of the assets in advisory and then a lot of that going into centrally managed. I think it's pretty reasonable to assume that BMO will be at the higher end of that range.
The only thing I would add is similar to M&A, those contracts, usually, there's some ramping, right? The first couple of years usually have some incentives, not dissimilar from what we're just talking about on the ramp for Waddell & Reed. So as that ramp occurs, just as an overall point on BMO really coming out of the high concentration in advisory and centrally managed, you've got a really accretive from a margin standpoint versus our current margin on that business. So hopefully that helps. And just circling back on cash sweep. How should we think about the near term opportunity to reinvest the $6 billion of overflow balances? Yes. I think when you look at the kind of the floating side of the sweep dynamic, it's really pretty similar to what's going on in the fixed contract side and that there's just not a lot of new demand. So if you think about those contracts in a normalized environment, you typically see them at a spread of 20 to 30 basis points versus Fed funds. And in this environment, you're really seeing them kind of Fed funds flat to Fed funds minus 5%. So I think that's kind of how I think of the marginal investment rates there. And this maybe give you just a little bit of color on those as those things mature, right? When you think about floating rate contracts, the nature of those are usually a 1- to 2-year contracts that typically roll into new periods pretty often.
So just to give you context for us for the rest of the year, if you look past the Q2 guidance I gave on ICA overall, so kind of looking in the second half of the year. And if the contracts that mature in that period, if they -- if we invest -- reinvest all of them, Craig, to your question in current rates, that would bring the overall ICA yield down by just a couple of basis points by the end of the year. So it's a relatively small reinvestment risk there. And then add to that with no additional fixed maturities in the second half of the year, it kind of gives you, I think, a good perspective on overall ICA rates. There's not a lot of downside risk, at least in the current environment in the second half of the year. You're talking mid-90s to low 90s is just the way to think about it. Next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley. I just wanted to circle back on the Business Solutions, I think you had quoted about $19 million of revenue annualized. I was just hoping you could maybe help us appreciate the profit margin on that, the gross profit contribution to that. And then just also maybe you can elaborate a little bit on some of the initiatives you have in place on expanding that out and growing the penetration within the existing adviser base? You want to take the economics on the first half, and I'll get the second. Yes, you got it. Mike, I think that when you look at Business Solutions, I think that there's 2 ways to think through it. First is on the economics. And I would think of it as a capability and a product that's generating fee revenue like we discussed. And then in addition to that, I think probably one of the more interesting parts of Business Solutions is really what that positions advisers that are utilizing them to do, right? It's about us helping them really run their small business in a really efficient and effective way that frees them up to be focused on the wealth management side, right, to deliver same-store sales and grow their practices or position them to do acquisitions with our new M&A solution. So I would really view that the financial benefits of Business Solutions really in a holistic way for the entire firm given the different types of dynamics that, that can drive. Yes. And maybe to build on your product road map question, as we look at our different options and alternatives to expand the portfolio and thus reach either more LPL advisers and/or sell existing advisers additional services, this, again, is based on the premise that they are engaging in many of these services at a local level. So our concept is we can offer them at a higher quality and perhaps at a cheaper cost, a pretty appealing combination.
And so if you think about our road map today, you've got the original 3 offerings, which were admin solution, a CFO solution and a marketing solution. So what we're doing with each one of those is we're exploring, can we create new variations of those offerings, of which might have a narrower value proposition, a lower price point and solve a specific problem or challenge that an adviser has to address on a weekly, monthly reoccurring basis. And so we are working inside our product portfolio across that entire spectrum of offerings to come up with new iterations on that. And you'll see a couple under the CFO solution, one that we're about to begin to go to pilot in Q2 that I mentioned earlier, and that was a derivative of our marketing solutions. And so that's kind of innovation area #1 of the road map.
The second one is we continue to experiment with new capabilities or new solutions. A great example of that would be experimenting with paraplanning, if you will. A whole new offering with respect to the professional services portfolio, but one that we're testing right now out in the marketplace, learning, iterating and potentially will become a whole new solution, if you will, to that portfolio. So that would be an example of a new solution. M&A solution would fit into that category of new offerings. And so those are the 2 primary places that we tend to explore, how do we expand the product road map and thus create more and more value that our advisers can leverage to replace that spend that we estimate is close to $1.5 billion a year that they spend on local level services. So that's what's driving that road map. I hope that helps. Got it. And maybe just a quick follow-up here just on the expense side. It looked like the share-based comp and D&A were both up meaningfully on a sequential and year-on-year basis. I know you gave some guidance into the second quarter. But just curious, I guess, any color on what's driving that and how you would expect this to sort of trend over the next couple of years? Should these lines grow in line with AUM growth or something else or some multiplier to that? Yes. On share-based comp, and you see the dynamic Q1 is typically the highest quarter, Q2 kind of close and then it drops down in the second half of the year. And it's really about the timing of those grants that kind of drives that dynamic. So that's on share-based comp.
On depreciation, I think a little bit of context there. The depreciation and amortization is largely driven by our technology spend. And obviously, that's the area where we're focused on developing capabilities that are key drivers of organic growth. And I think the key P&L dynamic to note that you probably know, but I'll highlight anyways, is that the expense really changes when you deploy the technology, not when you're spending the money. And when you look at Q1, we just had some larger projects that we deployed and rolled out. Dan covered a few of them in his prepared remarks. So that really started the depreciation and expense associated with that.
So if you look at the few quarters leading up to this quarter, you saw relatively low or small increases in depreciation, and we would expect a similar dynamic in the next few quarters. So it's really just that kind of concentrated deployment. The overall tech spend trends have been pretty consistent and unchanged from our overall expectations. So I hope that helps. Next question comes from the line of Chris Harris of Wells Fargo. So you guys are -- I mean LPL is just growing so incredibly fast right now. Can you maybe talk a bit about how you guys are feeling about the platform from a capacity perspective? In other words, you have the capacity in place, the services in place to be able to support all the incremental growth you're seeing and expected to see. Yes, it's a great question. And I think it goes back to the start of our mission, right? We got to take care of our advisers, so they can take care of their clients, which means we've got to make sure that we're there for them day in, day out from a service experience standpoint, that our platform has the stability necessary to leverage it and utilize it and then ultimately we're providing them the capabilities to create efficient workflows and capabilities to help them differentiate with their clients and continue to win. And we've got to make sure that we give them the tools necessary to pivot their businesses into a multichannel service business, where it's no longer just in person. They got to do it in a combined digital and in-person way.
So there's a tremendous opportunity for this platform to show up and support and help them and add value every single day, and that comes first and foremost for them. So our -- we've got to be diligent around making sure that we understand and plan for that growth, well, that we've got the technology and engineering capabilities of which to build the tools that are necessary and scale the platform.
We've got to make sure that we've got the fine-tuning, the testing, the utilization of AI to help us with respect to the risk management of our overall platform and stability, privacy, et cetera, associated with it. So that operating muscle to be really strong to execute on our plan comes first and foremost for us. I'd love to tell you we're perfect at it. We also have to have the humility to constantly listen to feedback. And if we're not getting something right to quickly focus on addressing it and iterating and then ultimately getting better because of it. And so I think that's a principle and the foundation of how we operate and execute.
Then we got to make sure that we're investing in the right people, attracting the right talent that we've got the right size talent that is well aligned and positioned to collaborate and execute together to deliver on our expectations. So that comes number two, what are our operating metrics, how do we observe, measure, how we operate not on a weekly or a monthly basis, but on a daily basis. So it's that we can take that data, learn from it, fine-tune, revise, iterate, et cetera, to make sure that we can be the best that we can be every day.
And then finally, we got to be investing in technology and automation that helps us scale. So you can scale into bursts of growth or you can constantly with consistent sustainable growth that you are constantly improving and enhancing your performance because you're able to digitize and automate it from end to end throughout the ecosystem, not to mention the benefits that you get from a scalability from an economic standpoint by doing that. So we continue to work on that. Introducing robotics, deploying AI and machine learning throughout our ecosystem in order to do that. And so we've got a lot of passion for doing it. We're not perfect. We hold ourselves uber accountable to our NPS scores. We've got room to improve, and it's priority one for the firm. I hope that helps. Next question comes from the line of Gerry O'Hara from Jefferies. Maybe circling back to Business Solutions. Just curious if you have tracked or have kept any data points around the overlap amongst advisers as it relates to the various different solutions. It almost strikes me as though if you could kind of get the adoption of one such as admin solution or CFO solution that could work as a gateway to additional, but not sure if you sort of track that or seen that metric develop? I think that's great strategic utility. And I think that is a good hypothesis and a premise that we are seeing trend once someone is engaged in a service, if they're having good success and it's a good leverage point, there's a higher propensity to use another one. I think as we iterate on the portfolio and expand the different offerings and you create, as an example, not just a holistic CFO offering, but you can take elements of what a CFO's role might be, bookkeeping as an example, or FP&A work, and you're able to create discrete products out of things like that. I think your premise of sort of a land-and-expand strategy makes even more sense. And so there's more to play out on that as we evolve our product road map. But we are trying to also be digital first and use data of which to learn and understand how our clients are engaging with us, both so that we can improve our offering, better -- deliver a better service experience to them across this portfolio. It's a good question. Okay. Fair enough. And then perhaps you can remind us what the mix on the $100 billion of assets that's going to be onboarded across the 2 banks and Waddell as it relates to fee-based advisory versus more traditional commission-based business. I think you just sort of highlighted earlier, the BMO mix. But if you could just kind of remind us what that aggregate split is that would be helpful. Yes. Gerry, I think, well, we can be directional here. I think to the point on BMO, they're a little bit higher on the advisory side than your typical large financial institution, right, meaning M&T would be more focused on the brokerage side. And then Waddell, I think as we're near closing and then onboarding, I think we'll give you more specifics on that in the near future. Next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken from UBS. Great. This one, you might -- it might be -- have been answered by the last question on Waddell and the fact that more details are coming. But I wanted to follow up on Alex's question earlier to see whether or not we could get some -- maybe some more granularity on the profile of what it will look like? Are FAs going to ramp over time over that year? Or is there -- how should we assume that will come on board, both the revenues and the expenses when we think about modeling it? Or was your last comment basically to say that you're not really in a position to say and we got to hold our horses for these questions? Yes, I think I liked it a little bit between those 2 points. So I think if you look at -- we did some updated disclosures in our key metric materials if you have those handy, I'll speak to them on Pages 7 and 8. But I think you've got the mix of Waddell at the time we announced the deal, which is a little bit over 50% brokerage, so 45% advisory, 55% brokerage. At least you can see what it looked like back then.
I think on the ramp, I'd highlight a few things. And this is where we added some detail on Slide 8, just to think about our path from closing, which could be as early as tomorrow to hitting that run rate EBITDA of $80 million. And there's really, I think, 3 broad steps that are happening that would drive it. And that's why I was giving a little bit of color on earlier. It's first and foremost is really adding the resources and technology and expenses, maybe to build a little bit on the question Dan was just answering just to make sure that we are in a position to receive Waddell the company at closing and to onboard the advisers a few months after that.
So the expenses start first. I think then onboarding, we think it will happen a few months after closing, so call it a few months from now. And that's really where the gross profit synergies start, right? Once the advisers and their assets are on our platform, and then following that, it's really your classic M&A integration work to get the expense synergies. And we think that will take about a full year from close. So you kind of put all that together. And that's, I think, a pretty good road map from here till hitting that run rate EBITDA and using that time line that I just walked through kind of by the end of Q2 of next year of 2022. Yes. In that maybe one helpful comment. Relative to your gross profit point because this is an acquisition, the ramp of the advisers is different than a normal recruiting scenario. So the assets and the advisers will all come over in mass. So let's say, we close tomorrow, let's just say, 3 months later, the assets come over a weekend and the advisers come over a weekend. And so they will be all on our platform. So your ability to begin ramping from that point is solid and a little different from recruiting where you ramp in over time. So hopefully, that gives you a little more color. It does. It almost sort of suggests it's more like a step function than a ramp to some degree. Also kind of curious about thinking about the impact of the reopening of the economy and the idea that people are going to start getting more comfortable with face-to-face meetings with vaccines rolling out as successfully as they have been. How should we think about -- there's a couple of different perspectives I'm curious about. Number one, from a recruiting perspective, is that going to put a bit more expense back into the recruiting effort versus before? Or are -- have you learned that you can be so much more efficient recruiting in a Zoom world that you'll keep a lot of the recruiting efforts to Zoom, that's one angle.
And then from another angle, thinking about the advisers and the net new assets over the past year, how much of those -- has the amount that normally comes from an adviser's existing book of business been impacted by the fact that they can't do prospecting, dinners or seminars or what have you. And do you expect that, that might start to kick back in now that people will be coming back to restaurants and whatnot? And maybe what kind of an impact do you think that could have? Sorry for the multi-parter. No, there's a lot there. So let me give you a directional answer of that, just I think to give you some guideposts and in some places, not to try to be overly precise on something we don't exactly know, right? So with respect to recruiting, your first part of your question, I think the short answer is it does not go back to what it was before, but it doesn't necessarily stay what it is today. And I do believe that we've continued to recruit throughout. We've had some people doing some travel throughout. We've been incurring some expense relative to our business development activities, right, the sort of the core G&A expenses associated with that.
But we have used technology and learn to use technology in a much, much more creative way, and we've broken through and set new paradigms, if you will, on how to do that in acceptable ways to do that and gotten better at it over the years. So I actually think you'll see a mix where we'll use technology where it's more efficient, it's less wear and tear. And quite frankly, it's more appealing for the advisers or the prospect as well as for our business development resources as an example.
And then where we do need to travel and where we do make a difference in face-to-face, we will absolutely do that. So if we do this well, we should find both improved efficiency and efficacy in our business development efforts. So that's how I would answer that one. Again, not trying to be really precise about exactly where the dial goes back to. But I think it's some middle ground. I hope that was helpful to you on the recruiting.
On -- with respect to our advisers, a couple of things. Their baselines changed significantly in the first 90 days when the country shut down. But the pace of reopening, as you know, has been very, very different at a local level across the country. And many of our advisers are doing a lot more face-to-face than what we might -- would expect living in bigger cities. And so consequently, I think you've already seen a pivot for a lot of advisers, probably more back to that baseline way they did business. But I think the cool part about our advisers being in businesses for themselves, they've got to be quite innovative and have that entrepreneurial spirit, right, of a small business owner. And most have added this digital capability to their repertoire.
So now they've got 2 ways of which to serve clients, which again, opens up the aperture of their opportunity to increase the size of their book, find more efficient ways to engage with clients, and then ultimately provide a mix of those that would rather meet in person versus those that are good doing it over the video. And you now redefine geography for them by doing that as well. And so we actually think this becomes a really interesting opportunity for our advisers as a catalyst to enhance the service experience, expand the flexibility around it and ultimately use that as a catalyst for growth. Do I think they're going to get back to doing dinners full time like they used to? No, but I do think that dial will go back to what is -- how that adviser uniquely wants to run their practice. So you'll see probably a spectrum of different outcomes depending on the adviser themselves and their clients. I'll stop there. And there are no further questions at this time. I will turn it back to Mr. Arnold. Yes. Thanks, everyone, for taking the time to join us this afternoon, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Stay safe.

And thanks to everyone for joining our call today. Over the past quarter, our advisors continued to provide their clients with personalized financial guidance on their client's journey to achieve life's goals and dreams. And at the same time, we remain focused on our mission of taking care of our advisors so they can take care of their clients.
This combination positioned us to deliver another quarter of solid results while also continuing to make progress on our strategic plan. I'd like to review both of these areas, starting with our second quarter business results. In the quarter, total assets reached a new high of $1.1 trillion up more than 45% from a year ago. This increase was primarily driven by continued organic growth or Waddell & Reed acquisition and equity market appreciation.
Now with respect to organic growth, second quarter net new assets were $37 billion. This result to a 16% annualized growth rate driven by continued strength across new store sales, same store sales and retention, and brought our organic growth rate to over 12% for the past year.
In the second quarter, recruited assets were 35 billion, which brought our total over the past year to $80 billion. Our continued growth in recur or in recruited assets, including new quarterly and full year highs reflects our ongoing progress on enhancing the appeal of our model and expanding our addressable markets during the quarter.
Our recruiting results increased each in each of our markets with over $10 billion in our traditional independent model, over $22 billion and our institution services model and approximately $2.5 billion in our new affiliation models. These broader and more diversified results help position us to drive higher levels of recruiting going forward.
Now, now looking at the same store sales with the backdrop of continued strong retail engagement, our advisors remain proactive and focused on serving their clients and enhancing their offering. As a result, advisors are both winning new clients and capturing more assets from existing clients, which drove same-store sales to new highs in the second quarter.
At the same time, we further enhanced the advisor experience through the continued delivery of new capabilities and technology, as well as the ongoing modernization of our service and operations functions.
As a result, asset retention was over 98% in the second quarter and 98% over the past year. Our second quarter of business results led to solid financial outcomes with $1.85 of EPS prior to intangibles and acquisition costs, which is an increase of 30% from a year ago.
Let's now turn to the progress we made on our strategic plan. As a reminder, our long-term vision is to redefine the independent model over time and by doing so, become the leader across the entire advisor center marketplace.
Our approach is to provide a platform that is simple and straightforward for advisors to design and run their perfect practice through a breadth of affiliation models and the ability to personally configure the components of our offering to align with each advisor's unique needs and goals. Doing this well gives us a sustainable path to continued solid organic growth, increased market leadership and long-term shareholder value creation.
Now to execute on our strategy, we have organized our work into four strategic plays, which I'd like to review with you in turn. Our first strategic play involves meeting advisors, where they are in the evolution of their practice by winning in our traditional markets, where our leading market share is now over 15% while also leveraging new affiliation models to expand our adjustable markets and our traditional markets, despite it visor movement in the overall industry remaining lower.
In the second quarter, we continued to increase our recruiting results and gain market share the combination of our recruiting momentum and the appeal of our model continues to expand the depth and breadth of our pipeline.
Looking at our financial institutions channel within the past two quarters, we on-boarded two new clients, BMO Harris and M&T. Then in June, we announced that CUNA brokerage services made the decision to partner with us and plans to join early next year.
These results reflect the market opportunity that exists to leverage our capabilities, to serve large institutions. And as we look ahead, we continue to progress prospects through the pipeline and see large financial institutions as a sustainable multi-year contributor to organic growth.
With respect to the expansion of our addressable markets, we continue to see momentum building across all three of our new affiliation models. Over the past quarter, we added five new practices across our strategic wealth services and employee models. And after re-launching the RIA only offering in April, we have been encouraged by the positive market reaction, including a new RIA that joined in May.
Looking ahead, we see a growing pipeline across all of our new affiliation models. Another key component of this strategic play is using M&A as a compliment to organic growth. After closing our Waddell & Reed Acquisition in April last week, we transitioned to our platform over 900 advisors, who serve approximately 98% of client assets.
Our second strategic play is focused on providing capabilities that help our existing advisors differentiate in the marketplace and drive efficiency in their practices. One of the key components of this play is helping our advisors enrich how they serve their clients through the use of advisory platforms.
In that spirit, we continue to innovate on our platform most recently with the introduction of a number of product pricing and capability enhancements. One new capability to highlight increases the personalization available within our centrally managed advisory solutions.
Now, two years ago, we introduced adviser sleep, which allows advisors to personalize centrally managed portfolios with their own asset allocation models while outsourcing the day-to-day work of portfolio allocation and trading to us. To build on this capability, last quarter, we launched from sleeve.
This innovation enables larger firms, RIAs, and institutions to develop models that all advisors across their firms can use and thus providing additional ways to leverage our centrally managed platforms, to help me client needs differentiate the marketplace and drive efficiency and advisor practices. At a over $9 billion of client assets is invested across advisor sleeve and firms sleeve and we will continue innovating to increase the value of these personalized investment offerings.
Let's next move to our third strategic play, which involves creating an industry leading service experience to delight advisors and their clients. And in turn help drive advisor recruiting and retention. A key component of this strategic play is transforming our service model into an omni-channel client care model.
And the second quarter we launched a digital help center, a machine learning based solution that gives advisors easy access to information that addresses their most common service related needs. This resource puts information that's personalized, timely and relevant at their fingertips, thus positioning advisors to serve their clients in a simpler and more efficient way.
Together with our voice and chat channels, the digital help center enables advisors to access industry leading service at a time and in a manner that works best for them. We also continue to automate and streamline key elements of our service operations through the enhancement of our digital operating model, including investing in new bots across our care organization.
Now, this helps us to increase both our service levels and our capacity to grow as we can continue to scale our business. And we believe these investments in our client care model and the automation and streamline streamlining of our service operations are making positive contributions to the service experience while also increasing the scalability of our platform.
Our fourth strategic play is focused on helping advisors run the most successful businesses in the independent marketplace. One of the key components of this play is our portfolio of business solutions, which helps advisors more effectively operate their businesses so they can focus on serving their clients and growing their practices.
As we discussed last quarter, we see multiple pathways for continued growth in business solutions, including delivering existing solutions to additional advisors and introducing new solutions to expand our product portfolio.
In the second quarter, our subscription-based continued to scale to approximately 2100 monthly subscribers, more than double a year ago. This includes about 80 subscriptions with advisors who joined from Waddell &Reed. Now the more work on business solutions, the more we work on business solutions, the more opportunities we find to help our advisors solve additional challenges through the expansion of our product portfolio.
We now have 7 solutions available in our product portfolio, three additional solutions in pilot and a handful of other offerings in the incubation phase. As we continue add new solutions, we expect to expand the adjustable market while at the same time, accelerating our pace of innovation, the foreclosing, I want to highlight our ongoing efforts to actively shape and refine our advisor centric culture, which is instrumental to executing our strategy.
In the second quarter, we rolled out our adviser promise, which is a modern evolution of the advisor commitment creed our founders wrote more than 30 years ago. We will use this promise to drive further accountability for providing industry leading advisor experience and to continue to increase the competitive advantage, our advisor centric culture provides in the marketplace.
In summary, in the second quarter, we continued to invest in the value proposition for advisors and their clients while driving growth and increasing our market leadership. As we look ahead, we remain focused on executing our strategy to help our advisors further differentiate and win in the marketplace. And as a result drive long-term shareholder value with that.
I'll turn the call over to Matt. All right. Thank you, Dan. And I'm glad to speak with everyone on today's call. In the second quarter, we remain focused on serving our advisors, growing our business and delivering shareholder value. This focus led to the highest quarter of organic growth in our history.
And in addition, we have now on-boarded three of our largest partners in BMO, M&T and Waddell & Reed, who collectively added over 100 billion of assets to our platform, helping drive our total assets to over $1.1 trillion.
Now let's turn to our second quarter business results. Starting with organic growth,total net new assets were $37 billion, which translates to a 16% annualized growth rate. This was driven by strength across all three channels of growth, recruiting same-store sales and retention.
Looking more closely at recruiting and Q2 recruited assets were the strongest in our history at $35 billion, which brought our 12 month total to a new high of $80 billion. Moving on to our business mix, we continue to see positive trends in Q2 advisory, net new assets for $21 billion. We're a 17% annualized growth rate with this growth. Our advisory assets are 52% of total assets. As we continue to deliver differentiated advisory capabilities and benefit from the secular trend towards advisory.
Now let's turn to our Q2 financial results, strong organic growth combined with expense discipline led to EPS prior to intangibles and acquisition costs of $1.85 up 30% from a year ago, looking at our top-line growth gross profit reached a new high of $602 million up $22 million or 4% sequentially looking at the components commission advisory fees, net of payout.
We're $197 million up $13 million from Q1, primarily driven by organic growth and assets from Waddell & Reed in Q2. Our parent ratio was 86.3% up about 70 basis points from Q1 due to typical seasonality. Looking ahead to Q3, we anticipate our payout ratio will be approximately up approximately 100 basis points driven by the expected seasonal build and production bonus, as well as the onboarding of Waddell & Reed assets, which aren't a slightly lower payout on their platform.
Moving on to asset based revenues sponsor revenues were $189 million in Q2 of $22 million sequentially.This was driven by an increase in average assets due to organic growth. Waddell & Reed and equity market appreciation. Turning to the client cash revenues,they were $90 million down, $7 million from Q1 driven by lower ICA balances during the quarter.
Looking at overall client cash balances, they were $48 billion roughly flat with last quarter, looking more closely at our IC a yield. It was 98 basis points in Q2, relatively flat with Q1. As we look ahead to Q3 given where interest rates, quiet rates and cash balances are today, we expect our Q3 ICU to be roughly flat to Q2.
Now looking at our fixed rate portfolio, as a reminder, we have a fixed rate maturity at the end of the third quarter, which will lower our Q4 see a yield by approximately 10 basis points that said I would highlight that as the yield curve steepened earlier in Q2, we saw demand starts to return to the fixed rate suite market.
As a result, we were able to enter into $600 million of new fixed rate contracts at the three-year point, which was about 40 basis points at the time, looking beyond Q3 and given the expectation that short-term interest rates will begin rising in late '20, '22 or early 2023.We thought it would be helpful to share the economic benefit of rising rates using the deposit betas we experienced in the most recent interest rates cycle.Using our current suite balances a 100 basis point increase in the fed funds rate would translate to approximately $340 million of annual gross profit.
Moving on to Q2 transaction and fee revenues,they were $137 million down $4 million sequentially driven by trading volume that decreased throughout the quarter. Looking ahead to Q3 prior to Waddell & Reed, we expect transaction and fee revenue to be relatively in-line with Q2. As we anticipate seasonally, lower transaction volumes and IRA fees will be offset by revenues from our national advisor conference.
Turning to business solutions, we ended the quarter with approximately 2100 subscriptions, which is up 400 from last quarter and more than double a year ago. These offerings now generate roughly $20 million of annual revenue. And more importantly, they help free up additional time for advisors to spend on more valuable activities, including serving their clients and growing their practices.
Now let's turn to expenses starting with core DNA. It was $252 million in Q2 and $240 million prior to what outreach looking ahead, we continue to anticipate full year 2021 cords unit to be in a range of $975 million to $1 billion.
As a reminder, this includes cost to support BMO and M&T but it's prior to expenses associated with what I would read moving on to two, two promotional expenses. They were $64 million up $10 million sequentially.Prior to Waddell & Reed costs,promotion was $57 million up $3 million sequentially, primarily driven by large financial institution onboarding and increased marketing expense.
Turning to Q3, prior to Waddell & Reed, we anticipate promotional expense will increase by around $10 million. As we have two of our largest advisor conferences in Q3. I would also note that we have shifted several conferences that are typically in the first half of the year to the fourth quarter, this will likely lead to a similar level of promotional spending Q4.
However, our plans could change depending on the environment. So we'll give you a more specific update next quarter. Now let's move to Waddell & Reed overall, the transaction is progressing even better than we expected across multiple fronts.
As mentioned Waddell & Reed advisor serving approximately 98% of client assets have joined our platform, which is up from our prior estimate of 95% factoring in this higher level of retention and current asset levels. We now expect the run rate EBITDA benefit to be at least $85 million up from $80 million. And we continue to expect to reach this run rate by the middle of next year.
Moving on to capital management, our balance sheet remains strong in Q2 with the leverage ratio at 2.3 times and corporate cash of $278 million as for capital deployment. Our framework remains focused on allocating capital aligned with the returns we generate investing in organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A where appropriate and returning excess capital to shareholders.
In the first half of this year, the majority of our capital deployment was focused on supporting organic growth and M&A. Looking ahead while we continue to see compelling opportunities to deploy capital, to drive growth, we also feel well positioned to restart our share repurchase program.
Initially focusing on repurchasing shares to offset dilution, which we estimate to be approximately $40 million per quarter, we will, of course remain flexible and dynamic should additional opportunities to deploy capital, to drive growth emerge.
In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results, including the best organic growth in our history. And just last week on board of the advisors, from Waddell & Reed, as we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue investing, to serve our advisors, grow our business, and create long-term shareholder value.
With that operator,please open the call for questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions].The first question comes from the line of Steven Chubakfrom Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Why did I start off with a question on just some of the ICA dynamics certainly encouraging to see the interest from bank partners for some longer dated money, but some of the ICA concerns to rest, but if rates remain at zero, the bank deposit mat demand remains tepid. You can just speak to the strategy for managing fixed term contracts over the next few years. And just generally, what are you hearing from your bank partners with regards to appetite to take on some additional fixed term contracts in the current environment? Yeah, Steven, I I'll, I'll take that obviously. I think when you look at our, our fixed rate approach and strategy, it's really unchanged, right? Even the environment that you described, which is our goal remains getting to 50% to 75% of the portfolio fixed of course, in an environment where there is demand that that can help us do so.
And I think when we're in an environment like we are now with rates low and the curve relatively flat, I think that's an environment where we would stay closer to that 50% point. And if you're in an environment where the absolute level of rates are higher and there's some steepness to that curve, I think we would naturally migrate to that 75% side of the, of that range.
So that's been our approach for awhile. I think the, the environment we're in really doesn't change that. I think to your point on what we're hearing from our bank partners, I think it's, it's probably more what we're seeing and their actions, which is when there's some steepness to the curve and just looking at Q2 when it was the 10 year was at that 150 to 160 zone, right. There's economics on their side.
And that's really when you saw them start to come back into the market and we were able to execute a relatively small amount, but I think from a really an indicator of their approach and intentions I think it spoke really, really loudly that once there some economics to be had that the fixed rate sweet market is something that I think would -- would return.
So we're obviously not in that environment at this very moment, but I think it's a good idea as to what things could look like,if rates move up again. Actually I [Indiscernible] and just my follow-up maybe for Dan, you touched on this quite a bit in your prepared remarks in terms of the better balance across all the different affiliation options and the accelerating organic growth that you're seeing? I mean, one of the questions that we probably field most often from investors is this trying to unpack given some of the momentum that you're seeing, the new organic growth algorithm, especially given the momentum you're seeing within the institutional channel in particular, which seems to be adding at least 200 basis points plus of organic road?
I didn't know, Dan, if you could just speak to given the progress you're seeing on the organic growth side, what do you think is like a new sustainable organic growth rate? if some of the success that you're seeing in non-traditional areas continues to build from here? Yeah. That makes sense. And so perhaps it's as a way to. Thanks. That makes sense. Helps if I have the microphone on, sorry about that? Yeah, for, for context, perhaps look, we're focused on organic growth and over the past three years, the team has done a great job of expanding that, think about that, that March from sort of 3% to over the last 12 months, 12%. Right.
So if you break that down to get at your question, a bit two thirds of that has come from those traditional three oars in the water, if you talk about new store sales, same store sales and attrition. And if you peel that back a little further, that contribution from those oars is really well balanced across all three which I think, I think speaks to the durability of that growth, right.
So that's two thirds of that, that journey from 3% to 12%. And then I think if you, if you look at the remaining third, that's come from our entry into supporting large financial institutions. And, and, and again, I think we're being very intentional about vesting in our capabilities that created an appealing solution for these large institutions as we've partnered with BMO and M&T we continue to invest in our capabilities for institutions, which we think just enrichens the, the appeal of the model.
So we're quite optimistic about our pipeline there and our ability to continue to pull through pull through new institutions.And so we see that as a contributor to, to growth over the next several years or an ongoing contributor to growth that might be a way at least to think about the dynamics of how we got from three to 12 and perhaps how we think about going forward the durability around, have them look at the end of the day.
Organic growth is a key point of our strategy, and we're focused on trying to drive that rate higher. And, and we've got three good avenues of which to continue to do that through our traditional markets, these expanded new markets and then this institution's marketplace. So I hope that gives you some color and helps. Your next question comes from the line of Bill Katz from Citigroup. Your line is open And a good evening, everyone. And thank you for taking the question just want to follow up on. So Steve's line of questioning there, just coming back at it a slightly different cut at the organic growth. Something that we're observing is combination of further penetration within each segment. As I sold, look at where you're picking up shift from, and also that mandate sizes seem to be rising.
So could you speak a little bit to maybe why the seeing the, the better efficacy is this just idiosyncratic or is there something else, a Fort here as you saw the cumulative maybe time recruitment, what have you, is helping to bolster sort of that penetration? Yeah, thanks for the question bill. And it's --it's a, it's a good one as you point out in terms of maybe the nuance that sits underneath it.So we look at it this way. We, we launched these three new models at different times, but we, we launched them from a, from a place of a hypothesis around a business model that we took to the marketplace.
You get feedback, you'll learn as a part of that. You continue to invest in enrich your capabilities within that model. You successfully deliver it to clients. You begin to build a reputation with those clients around the success of that model and between new capabilities in the building reputation that, that supports momentum. That supports confidence in prospects exploring further this opportunity. And I think naturally leads to in many cases larger opportunities because of that building credibility.
So I think that's how we think about the Swiss model and that's the most mature of the new models. We're seeing sort of a similar flight pattern. If you will, with a lens of growth, it's just 6, 7, 8 months behind the trajectory of Swiss and then RIA, we just, we just obviously relaunched in, in April.
So hopefully that helps, but we do think it's that growing credibility with delivering a good solution that is serving clients well in the continued evolution of capabilities we'll create that natural lift on, on larger clients, bigger demand, growing pipelines and what we're trying to do is drive a much bigger contribution from those models. Okay. That's helpful. Thank you for that. And maybe one from Matt, glad to see the buyback taking a little bit sooner, then maybe we modeling how'd you arrive at sort of the dilution offset. So I think about opportunity to grow organically opportunity for anything else on the M&A side of the equation. And then what, what, what are some of the other metrics we should be looking at to think about the potential me to upsize that buyback as we look ahead? Yeah, though, I think the key thing is just our capital allocation framework. I think we're, we're continuing to deploy capital as you can see in the quarter in organic growth and M&A but at the same time, I think when you, when you go back six months ago, I think we're through some of the, the chunkier capital deployments on those first two categories.
So I think we've got a little bit more excess capital to deploy. And when you run it through that framework, while we continue to have opportunities in those first two categories, I think we feel quite comfortable allocating capital to, to share our purchases, given both the capital level and the returns they generate.
And I think as we look forward to your question, I think we'll continue to look at it from that same lens, with the principles of making sure we maintain a strong balance sheet is that's quite supportive of our organic growth. And if the opportunities to allocate to organic growth and M&A increase we'd move capital to there. And it's returning capital to shareholders is the primary place where it makes sense. We'd move capital to there. It's all about applying the framework. So that's how we'll continue to approach it going forward. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Hey, thanks for taking the question. Just on the, with Dell transactions, help you can elaborate a little bit on the contribution in the quarter in terms of some of the puts and takes. I think there were also some one-time costs or some drag that was maybe partially offsetting some things there as well. So it'd be, you could elaborate a little bit on that and how we should be thinking about the timing of the ramp here particularly as we go into the second half of the year in terms of the contribution from Waddell? Yeah, sure, sure. Michael, I think when you, we've got hopefully some good disclosures on that, that as I, as I talk here, you can look at, or maybe even look at later in our team metrics deck on slide 8 that I think helps with that.
But I'll get a little bit, a little bit of color here. I think when you look in the second quarter, really the, the main action or activity was, was closing on the transaction and we're actually able to get some of that, that kind of first round of expense synergies a little bit earlier than we had expected a quarter ago.
That's why you see that run rate hitting, $50 million from an annual basis. For the two months that we had, what on board in the quarter, as we look ahead to Q3 it's really about onboarding is the key integration activity, which, happened just last weekend.
So that'll lead to some more gross profits synergies, also moving the advisers onto our payout grid, which is a little bit higher and then eliminating the cost of their custodian. Now, those things, coincidentally kind of net out, which is why you see Q3 still being at that same $50 million run rate, but, but a lot of activities happening.
And then from this point forward meeting in Q4 through the middle of next year is really about the rest of the expense synergies and integration. And those are the activities that will bring us to that $85 million plus run rate by about the middle of next year.
So, so that's the path on the, on the integration and run rate side your question on the kind of one timers, I think the acquisition costs which we now estimate, or a total will be a total of around a hundred million that shows up in that acquisition cost line item, which you saw that really increase in the second quarter from the closing.
And then I'd highlight the third quarter is probably going to be the, the quarter with the largest amount of that a hundred million. Our estimate right now is in the $40 to $50 million range and that's really tied to the onboarding activities, which are, which is the activity that naturally encouraged the most costs. So hope that helps Super, thank you. Just a quick follow-up on the ICA balances. We saw the overflow balances decline a bit in the quarter. Just curious what appetite or ability is there to sort of expand the the variable balances and really take those overflows down to zero. What's the potential to do that? Would you say? Well, I think that gets back to just when there's demand from the banks, right. I talked a little bit earlier about, when the, on the fixed rate side, when, when rates move up along the curve, meaning that, that three to five-year point, there's some demand there on the floating rate side, I think it's really going to come back to the, the amount of liquidity that's in the market in banks needing liquidity for their balance sheets.
And I think we're, where we sit today, there's still just a, a substantial amount of liquidity in the market, but I think we're now in the second quarter, in a row where you're starting to see some signs of activity that ultimately would lead to that demand returning right.
Consumer spending, picking up, right,that's coming out of checking's and savings accounts at the banks. Loan balance is beginning to grow, meaning they're loaning out that cash.So I think if you continue to see the trends there, I think those are the things that would ultimately lead to that demand picking up. Your next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt from KBW. Your line is open. Hi, good evening. So maybe a two part question, I think you've changed some of the rate sensitivities in your deck on the gross profit benefit from, from rate hikes. And you noted that the beta was two and a half percent through your first four hikes in the last cycle. So yes, the first question is, should we take the sensitivity to mean you expect similar beta dynamics during the next psyching cycle?
And the second part of that question is it's really like if you look back during the last rate hiking cycle, you took advantage of the gross profit benefit to really increase technology spending and reinvest in the platform? However, you're, you're in a different spot today in terms of ongoing reinvestment into the platform. So as we look ahead towards the next rate hiking cycle and as you kind of outlined very meaningful, gross profit -- profit benefits, how should we think about how much of that could fall to the bottom line versus wanting to take advantage of the environment to, to reinvest in the business and increased spending? Yeah,Yeah, I think on the, on the sensitivities, and I think that the, what we were trying to do there is really, give some empirical data on from the last interest rate cycle right now, market demand and market pricing ultimately drives where deposit betas go. But I think from our chair that the best information to look at to get an expectation of what, what happened is what happened most recently.
And I think that's what we updated our our metrics to show, which was an average beta 15%, that period of 2015 to 2019, but then the early part of the cycle, it was two and a half and then later part of the cycle '25. So I think the, the, the market dynamics will determine where that goes. But I think looking at the history from our chair, it's probably the best thing to look at.
Now to your point on what to do with that revenue, I think it will go back to our capital allocation framework, right. The same thing that we're applying today on where the, the highest and best returns are and when you look at investing in the platform, those are things that drive organic growth and if there's things that can drive a return there, we focus there.
And then to M&A then returning capital to shareholders, which from a gross profit standpoint, can, can show up in the form of, of just incremental margin and delivering, operating leverage. So it'll just be based on our opportunity set at that time. And I just emphasize, I think when we, when we take a step back and even just building on what Dan was talking about earlier in our opportunities and the different channels and models we have, I think we're excited about an environment where we can continue to grow further. This question comes from the line of Alex Blosteinfrom Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. You on-boarded in the second quarter. Can you talk a little bit about the financial advisors appetite to enhance capabilities that LPL can offer resonates most? And then maybe just put some, putting some numbers around that gross profit on that a hundred billion dollars of assets kind of where's that now. And what do you think that could ultimately go? Let me take the first half of that, Matt, and you take the second. So yeah, Alex with respect to the advisors look, the, the typical principles that, that one large institution might, might choose or use to, to make the selection to partner with us typically has to do with enhanced technology capabilities.
So can we provide them technology, automated workflows, et cetera, to drive efficiency into their practices, free up time for them in their teams to spend on clients and prospects and so that is a priority and we spend a good bit of time making sure that you do the appropriate level of training, coaching, and, and, and, and work to ensure that they can leverage that, that sort of comprehensive technology offering.
And that takes time. They don't get that on day one, but you continue to work on it and they become proficient at it quickly. And that becomes a big leverage point. So that is one area that they tend to look at.
A second one would be the advisory platform that we have and the breadth of options and alternatives. We give them from a capability set from an investment content from a pricing standpoint, from a vertical integration and ease of doing business that that certainly is a, is a way for them to, to provide expanded or enhanced value of advice to their, to their end clients ultimately help them differentiate and support their growth aspirations.
And so there you get a great client experience at the end of the day, matched with also some tailwinds for growth. And so that would be a second area that I would tend to highlight. And if you look at the institutions at a macro level, right our ability to partner in and provide a good deal of support and advice through -- through the compliance and risk management support that we can provide shifts the risk profile for them with this business initiative.
And I think creates at an institutional level unimportant element of value. A second one is just improved and enhanced economics typically shifting from a, a model where you've got the entire cost structure and then have to make the investment labor and technology, et cetera, to do it. And you can go to a more outsourced arrangement.
We typically see an improvement and enhancement and overall economic, so I'll stop there, but those were maybe some high level things that are in it for the, for the advisors and their clients, as well as the institution as a whole. And then, and then now it's just on the, on the gross profit or the return side, when you look at the financial institutions channel, right, they're typically much larger to the point of the first part of your question, a little bit heavily focused on the brokerage side.
So you get RIAthat are that as a starting point or closer where brokerage RIAare. So think 15 basis points a little bit of additional color on CUNA there a network of credit unions. So we, we share some of that gross profit with them. So for that particular opportunity to be more than the 10 to 15 basis points zone.
And then on the cost side, I think that the, the cost to serve is lower just given, given that size. And then the, the TA and the underwriting factors in all those economics, you bring it down to the bottom line. And you look at our, if you look at our EBITDA operating margins, they're quite creative to that with, with one caveat that, that deals of this size in the, in the nature of this channel, usually come with some, incentives in the early terms of the deal, first year and second year. So those economics grow over time as you, as you get deeper into the contract. So hope that helps. That helps. Thanks. and just maybe a quick clarification around the ICA dynamics. So clearly LPL continues to have significant amount of upside higher interest rates and appreciate you guys highlighted below the positive bit as well, but that's obviously very helpful from the last cycle. How do you think about the trade-off I guess here between fixing out kind of at 40 bips for three years if the demand picks up again, sort of versus waiting for a particular, potentially a much more material upside, 12 to 18 months out? Yeah, I think it goes back to that 50% to 75% approach. Alex. I think we're really focused on on having a stable earning stream in this area and not trying to be folks that pick the points where interest rates make sense and don't make sense. I think we've got a principle is we'll hedge a little bit lower on the percent.
If the, if the economics look like they're at the lower point and a little bit higher on the, on the percentage, if we look like they're at a higher point, but once you get below that, we're not trying to tactically pick those points, I think, specific to this quarter. I think when you're in the market that I think we're all collectively in when a bank comes up and has demand for sweep deposits I think most people would -- would say yes and, and deploy that. And that's what we did on that particular opportunity. Your next question comes from the line of Gerry O'Hara from Jefferies. Your line is open. Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. I was I was hoping maybe we could get a little extra color on the on the business solutions. It sounds like Dan may, may have mentioned three in pilot, a handful of others that are perhaps on the com.
I don't know if it's too early, but would, would certainly love to hear a little bit about, about those. And then also, what has been really resonating? I think it sounded like 80 or so if my notes are right that have already been kind of picked up from some of the widow advisors. So any, anything additional, there would be a, I think of of use. Thank you. Yeah. Maybe I'll give you just a quick snapshot of the product portfolio. And then and then I can answer your question about maybe some of the early interests from the Waddell & Reed folks, and, and then happy to share the three that we've got in pilot phase. And so if you look at the, the, the solutions today, as I mentioned, there's seven there's the original three, which were admin solution, CFO and marketing.
With respect to Waddell & Reed, the most popular one for them thus far has been admin solutions, which makes sense if you're thinking about coming in and learning a new environment and making the transition. So and you've got people in the LPL ecosystem that are experienced in supporting and helping do that. I think that's a, that's a, that's a logical place to look for a leverage point.
And if you didn't have access to that admin at the, the market rates of hiring someone directly, this is, this is actually a new service and a good alternative, lower cost way to do that. With respect to the solutions then that we've added to that original portfolio, you've got the assurance plan which is we just rolled out the resilience plan and those two are ways of which to support and help advisors plan for unexpected and or expected transitions from the business.
So assurance plan was the old plan that if unfortunately it kind of gave someone downside protection if something happened to them unexpectedly and the, in the business had to be transitioned. This gives them an orderly way to, to make that transition to do that resilience plan was added as a, as an ideation from that in a learning and a feedback that advisors really liked the assurance plan, but they also said, well, what if we have a short term disruption in our ability to operate or run the business, could you help us with that as well?
And so that's where we came up with this idea with the resilience plan that gives them some support and a backstop, if they had an unexpected problem, think about disability or something like that, or if they even have a planned need to have an extended leave from the business such as a fraternity or maternity type of leaves.
And so pretty cool innovation that came from the feedback and the appeal of the insurance plan. There's also M&A solutions that we've launched earlier in the year and remote office solutions that emerged during the pandemic, the three they're in pilot real quickly, you've got a bookkeeping solution that we're experimenting with that was born out of the, the CFO solution.
And I continued innovation from the feedback that our clients give us on their needs. There's a paraplanning solution in pilot. And then finally something we call it client engage, which is meant to be a way to support and help the advisors managing successfully the servicing communications with their clients. I'll pause there, but that's, that's that gives you a quick snapshot of the portfolio. Helpful. Appreciate and appreciate that. And then maybe just one for Matt, if you might have a comment or two just on the environment around, around transition assistance, what, you're, what you're saying, what you're hearing? I think we'd all appreciate that as well. Thank you. Yeah, sure. I think that the headline is we're, we're seeing a pretty consistent environment, which is the, the overall value prop at the firm is what matters the most. And I think when you get then click down into transition assistance, to help facilitate the move from one firm to another I think we're seeing pretty similar levels that we've seen in the last few quarters. So, so no change on that, on our end. Your next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan from JMP Securities. Your line is open. Great. Good evening guys.S tart here with just a bigger picture question. As we watch the business scale and increase, affiliation options with a lot of success, bringing in larger advisors that have, more complex businesses does the thinking evolve at all around potentially re-exploring the merits of becoming a bank and I appreciate it's complicated.
And, and obviously you guys decided to not two years ago, but just given those dynamics of how the business is evolving, maybe coupled with some of the near term dynamics around rates. I'm just curious if it kind of comes back on or the pendulum swings in one direction there? Yeah. Maybe we both can give some color on that. I'll start Matt, you feel free to provide any insights. So obviously from a strategic standpoint, we, we have a significant set of considerations that you always think about and you're diligent around always evolving your assessment, given changes in the marketplace, changes in the business changes in the competitive landscape.
And so potentially being a bank is one of those things that we would always keep active sort of that assessment in that consideration. And I think we would look at it from a strategic standpoint, are there capabilities that, that -- that could potentially support advisors and their value to clients. And is it a better way to manage ultimately, our, our cash balances and, or ultimately deploy and execute against some of that expanded capability that I was mentioned earlier.
And so I think we always look at it from the standpoint of what's the best way to do that, right The old do, do we do it ourselves or do we outsource it The marketplace has given us lots of options of which to find different ways to provide capabilities and, and to effectively manage our cash balances using someone else's balance sheet to do that.
And we think that strategically makes sense in the short run, as long as we find the options and alternatives to do that, and we can deliver the capabilities that our clients need. And that's kind of how we see it in the short run, but I think we continually look at the different market dynamics and keep that assessment alive, just so it's fresh, we're clear and have the most informed view that we can about our set of options.I'll pause there. You want to add anything to that? That is all said. I just emphasize a couple of things that the key Devin is, is making sure that we're in a position to deliver the products and capabilities that matter to our advisors and their clients. And do you need a bank charter to do that? And I think to Dan's point, the marketplace has given us plenty of options where you don't.
And I think the second part of the question is, well, what, what's the best return on capital, right? Deposits on our balance sheet versus someone else's. And I think you run that math, especially in an environment like this and the return on capital of having a bank is not a pretty picture. So I think it makes sense where we are now, but to Dan's point, I think we always look to make sure if the world changes that, we'd be aware of that. I appreciate the update there. And then the follow-up, I guess shorter term or a smaller topic you guys talked about streamlining, automating, the service offering, which is interesting. And as we think about just the, the bigger opportunity to automate the platform and, and, utilize technology to, to, to kind of scale the business from here, how should we think about like the expense buckets and maybe where there's incremental operating leverage in the model like, so service feels like that that's one example where, there's a number of people doing jobs where in some cases new technology may be able to step in and disintermediate some of that and save some money for LPL. I guess if there's any way to frame that and are there any other areas like that that could be kind of margin enhancing? Yeah, that's a good, it's a great question. And it's one from an, an operational execution standpoint, I think we're, we're keen on exploring what are those sort of world of possibilities and how we might best do that. So if I just gave you a little color on areas that we think about, there's certainly leveraging robotics, as you say, for more repetitive type of work where as you expand and you grow and you can transform that work into, to a more automated type of solution makes tons of sense in the short run from potential expense synergies.
But adds a lot from a scalability standpoint,so across our operations and our compliance organizations you see opportunities for robotics. You also have opportunities to use AI for quicker assessments and more robust, broader spectrum assessments. So think about the efficacy of oversight of our own compliance controls or risk management controls.
And that's a place where you could use AI to step in as a, as a real leverage point for for the work that, that our folks do. And in that case, that may not eliminate jobs, but that may create lots of scalability as you go forward because of the more efficient, effective use of automation to assess greater and greater volumes of, of, of business.
So that would be another example, I think, where you could use newer technology with you, if you will, our automation and deploy it within the organization. Maybe I'll pause there. And I don't know if you want to take on the implications or contribution that may occur from that. Yeah. I just emphasize with Dan said, I think the biggest opportunities are really investing in and deploying technology that allows us to scale, right?So for, every, every dollar of assets we're adding, we're adding less expense than we had to add for the prior asset, right. That somatically that's the primary approach. I think when you look at what that could deliver, I think it gets back to our principles of the amount that we would invest.
We're going to be focused on both investing to support that growth, but at the same time, delivering, operating leverage. Right. And I think that you see us doing that, I think right now. And I think that same approach as allude have going forward. Yeah. I'd leave you with this. Think about it as dry using automation and technology and modern technology to drive the future advisor and end client experience the efficacy of your risk management oversight, and finally third scalability in the overall operations. And there are no other questions over the phone line at this time. I would like to turn the call over back to Mr. Dan Arnold for closing remarks, sir. Thanks much RJ. And thanks everyone for taking the time to join us this afternoon. We really appreciate it. And we look forward to speaking with you again.

Over the past quarter, our advisors continue to provide their clients with personalized financial guidance on the journey to help them achieve their life goals and dreams. And at the same time, we remain focused on our mission of taking care of our advisors, so they can take care of their clients.
This combination positioned us to deliver another quarter of solid results while also continuing to make progress on our strategic plan. I'd like to review both of these areas, starting with our third quarter business results.
In the third quarter, total assets reached a new high of $1.13 trillion, up 40% from a year ago. This increase was primarily driven by continued organic growth and equity market appreciation. With respect to organic growth, third quarter net new assets were $27 billion, which translated to 10% annualized growth, driven by continued strength across new store, sales, same-store sales, and retention. Over the past year, net new assets totaled $110 billion or 14% organic growth.
In the third quarter recruited assets were $13 billion, which increased our total over the past year to $83 billion. Our continued growth in recruited assets reflects our ongoing progress with enhancing the appeal of our model and expanding our addressable markets.
During the quarter, we continued to drive solid recruiting results across each of our markets, including $10 billion in our traditional independent model and $2.5 billion in our new affiliation models. Multiple channels contributing to our growth better positions us to drive higher levels of recruiting over time.
Looking at same-store sales with the backdrop of continued strong retail engagement, our advisors remained focused on serving their clients and enhancing their offering. As a result, advisors are both winning new clients and expanding share of wallet with existing clients. A combination that drove same-store sales to new highs in the third quarter.
At the same time, we further enhance the advisor experience through the continued delivery of new capabilities and technology as well as the ongoing modernization of our service and operations functions. As a result, asset retention was approximately 98% in the third quarter and over the past year.
In July, we on-boarded the advisors from Waddell & Reed and the final asset retention rate for the deal was approximately 99%. Currently, we are focused on the integration work to help these advisors optimally leverage our platform and support the growth of their businesses. Our third quarter business results led to solid financial outcomes with $1.77 of EPS prior to intangibles and acquisition cost, which is an increase of 23% from a year ago.
Let's now turn to the progress we made on our strategic plan. As a reminder, our long-term vision is to redefine the independent model over time and by doing so become the leader across the entire advisor center marketplace.
Our approach is to provide a platform that has the flexibility and personalization that make it simple and straightforward for advisors to design and run their perfect practice. We do this by providing advisors a breadth of the affiliation models, advisory platforms, investment content, technology, custody, and practice support that provides more flexibility in one place than anywhere else. Doing this well gives us a sustainable path to an industry-leading advisor experience, continued solid organic growth, and increased market share.
Now to execute on our strategy, we have organized our work into four strategic plays, which I'd like to review in term. Our first strategic play involves meeting advisors where they are in the evolution of their practice by winning in our traditional markets where our leading market share is now over 15% while also leveraging new affiliation models to expand our addressable markets. In our traditional markets, in the third quarter, we continue to increase our recruiting results, gain market share, and expand the depth and breadth of our pipeline despite advisor movement remaining at lower levels.
Looking at the large financial institutions marketplace, we on-boarded BMO Harris and M&T earlier this year and are applying the insights from those experiences to make our institutional offering even more robust and differentiated. This innovation and marketplace momentum are helping drive a solid pipeline with a growing number of prospects. As we look ahead, we are preparing to on-board CUNA Brokerage Services in the middle of next year and continue to see financial institutions as a sustainable multi-year contributor to organic growth.
With respect to the expansion of our addressable markets, the combination of a compelling value proposition and positive referrals from advisors using the new models are attracting more prospects and contributing to our growth. As a reminder, a year and a half ago, we launched Strategic Wealth Services and we have now added 17 practices, including eight in the past quarter.
We subsequently brought our employee model to market later in the year and five practices have joined, including two over the past three months. Then earlier this year, we relaunched our RIA custody offering and have been encouraged by the number of RIAs, who quickly partnered with us. As we look ahead, we see these new affiliation models continuing to build momentum and becoming a larger contributor to our organic growth.
Our second strategic play is focused on providing capabilities that help our advisors differentiate in the marketplace and drive efficiency in their practices. One of the key components of this play is the breadth and flexibility of our advisory platforms, from our turnkey centrally managed solutions to advisors managing portfolios themselves.
This optionality is contributed to advisory now making up a majority of our total assets specifically within our centrally managed solutions with our ongoing investments in capabilities and pricing, our assets have increased to nearly $90 billion at an average annual organic growth rate of over 20% for the past five years.
A key contributor to the growth of our centrally managed offerings is the increased personalization that enables advisors to use these solutions in the way that works best for them. For example, earlier this year, we introduced our Firm Sleeve solution, which together with Advisor Sleeve enables advisors and institutions to personalized centrally managed portfolios with their own asset allocation models.
We are now taking the next steps in this personalization journey by adding separately managed accounts while also integrating all centrally managed investment content into a single account for each client. These enhancements make it easier and more efficient for an advisor to expand the scope of their solutions while also providing a simpler and more unified experience which in turn contributes to the appeal and future growth of our centrally managed advisory solutions.
Let's next move to our third strategic play, which involves creating an industry-leading service experience to delight advisors and their clients and in turn, help drive advisor recruiting and retention. A key component of this strategic play is transforming our service model into an omnichannel Client Care Model.
As a reminder, over the past year, we rolled out voice chat and digital help to our advisors giving them access to differentiated service at a time and in a manner that works best for them. We are now focused on helping our advisors fully leveraged these channels to better serve their clients and more efficiently run their businesses.
To further enhance our service model, we are also experimenting with specialized service pods designed specifically for different types of advisor practices. These pods include integrated teams comprised of service, case management, compliance, and relationship management. These experiments are helping us to tailor services based on advisors affiliation models and practice attributes and are making positive contributions to the advisor experience.
Our fourth strategic play is focused on helping advisors run the most successful businesses in the independent marketplace. One of the key components of this play is our portfolio of business solutions, which helps advisors more effectively operate their businesses so they can focus on serving their clients and growing their practices.
Now, as we discussed last quarter, we see multiple pathways for continued growth in business solutions, including delivering existing solutions to additional advisors and introducing new solutions to expand our services portfolio. In the third quarter, our subscription base continued to grow more than doubling year over year to approximately 2600 subscriptions demonstrating increasing demand and appeal.
We continue to innovate on our business solutions portfolio to expand the variety of needs we can solve for and provide a wider range of price points to enable a broader set of advisors to engage. One of our sources of innovation comes from advisor feedback on our existing solutions, which we use as a catalyst to iterate on our core offerings like CFO solutions.
As an example, over the last year, this approach helped us identify several additional finance related needs for our advisors, which led to the development and launch of M&A solutions, Assurance Plan, and our book keeping pilot.
Going forward, we will continue to leverage advisor feedback as fuel to expand our solutions portfolio. Now with the expansion and seasoning of our portfolio, the strategic value of business solutions also continues to expand and has become an important component of the value proposition and a contributor to growth and our new model such as Strategic Wealth Services. As we look ahead, we are focused on continuing to innovate and expand the portfolio to increase the contribution to gross profit and organic growth.
In summary, in the third quarter, we continued to invest in the value proposition for advisors and their clients or driving growth and increasing our market leadership. As we look ahead, we remained focused on executing our strategy that help our advisors further differentiate and win in the marketplace and as a result, drive long-term shareholder value.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt. All right, thank you, Dan. And I'm glad to speak with everyone on today's call.
In the third quarter, we remained focused on serving our advisors, growing our business, and delivering shareholder value. This focus led to another quarter of double-digit organic growth. In addition after on-boarding Waddell & Reed, BMO, and M&T, we continue to work with these advisors to acclimate and leverage our platform and capabilities, while also preparing to on-board CUNA in the middle of next year. As we look ahead, we are excited by the opportunities to help our advisors differentiate and win in the marketplace and grow our business.
Now let's turn to our third quarter business results. Total advisory and brokerage assets increased to a new high of $1.13 trillion up 2% from Q2. A key driver of this increase was organic growth, which totaled $27 billion or a 10% annualized growth rate. This was driven by strength across all three channels of growth, recruiting, same-store sales, and retention.
Looking more closely at recruiting, in Q3 recruited --in Q3, recruited assets were $13 billion, which brought our 12-month total to a new high of $83 billion.
Moving onto our business mix. We continue to see positive trends in Q3. Advisory net new assets were $21 billion or a 16% annualized growth rate. With this growth, our advisory assets are 52% of total assets, as we continue to deliver differentiated advisory capabilities and benefit from the secular trend towards advisory.
Now, let's turn to our Q3 financial results. Strong organic growth combined with expense discipline led to EPS prior to intangibles and acquisition costs of $1.77, up 23% from a year ago. Looking at our top line growth, gross profit reached a new high of $631 million, up $29 million or 5% sequentially. Looking at the components, commission and advisory fees, net of payout were $202 million, up $5 million from Q2, primarily driven by organic growth and a full quarter contribution from Waddell & Reed.
In Q3, our payout ratio is 87.1%, up 80 basis points from Q2 due to typical seasonality as well as the onboarding of Waddell & Reed, which earned a slightly lower payout on their platform. Looking ahead to Q4, a reminder that the production bonus increases throughout the year and is typically highest in Q4. So, we anticipate our payout ratio will be up roughly 30 basis points sequentially to approximately 87.4%.
Moving on to asset-based revenues. Sponsor revenues were $210 million in Q3, up $21 million sequentially. This was driven by an increase in average assets due to organic growth and a full quarter contribution from Waddell & Reed.
Turning to client cash revenues, they were $91 million, up $1 million from Q2. Looking at overall client cash balances, they were $51 billion, up $2 billion from last quarter. Looking more closely at our ICA yield, it was 101 basis points in Q3, up 3 basis points from Q2.
Now moving onto our fixed rate portfolio. In Q3, we added a new $1 billion fixed contract at the three-year point of the curve, which was about 45 basis points at the time and as a reminder, at the end of the third quarter, we also had a fixed rate maturity of $2.3 billion yielding approximately 160 basis points. As we look ahead to Q4, given these factors and where interest rates, client rates, and cash balances are today, we expect our Q4 ICA yield to decline by approximately 5 basis points.
Moving on to Q3 transaction and fee revenues. There were $140 million, up $3 million sequentially. The increase was primarily driven by revenues from our national adviser conference and a full quarter contribution from Waddell & Reed. Looking ahead to Q4, based on the lower trading levels we've seen so far in October and the typical seasonal increase in IRA fees, we expect transaction and fee revenue to be relatively in line with Q3.
Turning to business solutions. We ended the quarter with approximately 2600 subscriptions, which is up 500 from last quarter and more than double a year ago. These offerings now generate roughly $25 million of annual revenue and more importantly, they contribute to organic growth by helping drive recruiting, same-store sales, and retention.
Now let's turn to expenses starting with core G&A. It was $271 million in Q3, up $19 million sequentially driven by a full quarter of Waddell & Reed and continued investment to drive and support organic growth. Looking ahead, given our strong levels of organic growth and the variable costs associated with supporting that growth, we are tightening our 2021 core G&A outlook to a range of $990 million to $1 billion and given our current rate of organic growth, we expect to be in the upper half of that range.
Additionally, now that we have on board Waddell & Reed and have a better sense of the timing of those expenses, we will include those costs in our overall outlook going forward. As a result, we expect Waddell & Reed to add $55 million to $60 million to our outlook, which brings our total 2021 core G&A outlook to $1 billion 45 million to $1 billion 60 million.
Moving on to Q3 promotional expenses. They were $84 million, up $20 million sequentially primarily driven by meeting expense as two of our largest advisor conferences took place in Q3. Turning to Q4, we anticipate promotional expense will increase by a couple of million dollars sequentially. Driven by transition assistance, large financial institution on boarding expenses, and advisor conferences that we were scheduled to Q4 from earlier in the year.
Now let's move to Waddell & Reed. In July, we completed the onboarding, which resulted in 99% of client assets joining our platform, up from 98% estimated last quarter. With respect to run rate EBITDA, it was roughly $50 million in Q3 and we anticipate it ramping to approximately $60 million in Q4 as we build toward $85 million run rate by the middle of next year.
Moving on to capital management. Our balance sheet remained strong in Q3 with the leverage ratio at 2.2 times and corporate cash of $266 million. As for capital deployment, our framework remains focused on allocated capital aligned with the returns we generate investing in organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A where appropriate, and returning excess capital to shareholders.
In Q3, we allocated capital to both organic growth and M&A as well as restarted our share repurchase program buying back $40 million of our shares to roughly offset dilution. We anticipate a similar level of share repurchases in Q4 while remaining flexible and dynamic should additional opportunities to deploy capital to drive growth emerge.
In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results. As we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue invest in to serve our advisors, grow our business, and create long-term shareholder value.
With that, operator, please open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bill Katz of Citigroup. Your line is open. Okay, thank you very much. So just wanted to circle back to maybe some of the recruiting trends you spoke to, it sounds like you have a few more things in the hopper in the bank channel side. I was wondering if you, maybe you could flush that out a little bit. And then on the business solutions sort of wondering on your huge step up sequentially. Where do you think you are in terms of your penetration rate of your base FAs and maybe some update as it relates to the beta test outside of your core footprint? Thank you Bill. So, let me take those on the, I think on the institutional front, which may have been your first question in terms of and how we think about that opportunity and see that and how we see the opportunity going forward.
So look at the short answer is, we're excited about the opportunities across both the traditional bank outsourcing markets - that's your bank and credit even in the outsourcing market and then the new large institution market and just pursue those opportunities we continue to invest in our capabilities to make the model more appealing as a driver of growth across what is a collective $1 trillion market opportunity as you know.
So again, I think we're well positioned to win the day and as we enhance our capabilities, we think that distinguishes our value proposition going forward. And we continue to be active and exploring those possibilities across that entire landscape. We see our pipeline continuing to grow and without giving you specific some, we have good confidence that we can continue to see this - this financial institution space as an ongoing sustainable and multi-year contributor to our organic growth.
So that's, I think question number one. With your second question on with respect to our business solutions. So look, we have lots of opportunity here, right. This is a, this is a new offering where we continue to both take our core offering and expand it. So you think about starting with three to four professional services and how do you then broaden if you will, the reach across multiple different solutions inside the LPL advisor base.
And so for there, I think that's predominantly where that 1200 subscriptions sit today. We do believe there is significant upside to continue to drive that penetration as we refine the value propositions of those offerings and we expand the number of solutions that we offer at different price points, you really significantly increase the available market within side that 20,000 advisors, and so we do believe that we're just in the logical normal early innings part of a 9-inning ballgame around the existing advisors on the LPL platform.
So, I think that I hope that helps in terms of giving you that directional opportunity, I think when you explore outside the LPL platform, our priority is focused on the LPL platform today, so the only place we've experimented outside is with M&A solutions where I think it's very logical that you would, we would be interested in getting both potential buyers and sellers outside of the LPL platform to enrich our M&A solutions, our offering in the breadth of that marketplace.
And so we continue to experiment there. We haven't done any deals outside of the LPL advisor family today, but we continue to explore that possibility. So, again we're just very early into exploring offering that type of solution outside the LPL advisor. I hope that helps. Okay, thanks. And maybe a follow-up for Matt would be, and thanks for taking the questions. Just in terms of your new guidance, how much of that is sort of inflation pressures we're sort of hearing that across companies that are reporting versus just maybe a step-up of recruitment. And then how do you think about the interplay for next year. I know it's obviously early days, but as we should think about maybe the relationship between growth and spent? Thank you. Sure. Bill, I think when you look at the updated guidance for this quarter, it's really our where we land on our expenses within that range is really driven by organic growth in the cost and specifically the variable costs associated with supporting it. And so I think when you look at our growth this year, in the last 12 months, call it in the 14% range, well into double-digits that's what's driving us up to the higher end of that range, but I just emphasize is still within the, within the range that we started for this year.
As we look ahead to next year, I mean I think we're in the midst of planning for that right now. As you can imagine. And I think we'll talk a little bit about that and give you some guidance as we typically do on next quarter's call. The thing I'd emphasize now is we're approaching it the same way we typically do and focusing in on the same core principles, which are investing to drive and support organic growth and at the same time, really focusing on delivering operating leverage. Right. So those principles will, will remain and our quarter our planning and we'll give you an update next quarter. Our next question comes from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Your question please Hi, good afternoon, Matt, Dan. Maybe just starting off with a question on the ICA strategy. I was hoping you could provide Matt some perspective as to how demand is evolving with really high expectations getting pulled forward, whether there is any market differences in demand for floating versus fixed rate contracts, and given the increase in three to five-year swap rates, I think they're now at about 90 to 120 bps. How is it, what's your appetite at least today to do additional extensions? Yes, Steve. And I think when you look at the market today, right. It's both from a demand standpoint as well as pricing I the headline to give is it's looking better. Right. Both on the floating side, on the fixed side, I think to click down on that, on the floating rate side and while emphasizing, we haven't seen a broad-based return of demand.
We are starting to have more conversations and those conversations are about folks coming to market, Fed funds plus 5 basis point zone versus if you go back the last few quarters, it's really been Fed funds flat or basically sure, I'll take your money, but it's one basis point, that's it.
So, the dialog there is certainly improving. And on the fixed rate side, just the say, we're starting to have dialog there and I think you hit it well in your question as the, as the yield curve starts to steepen, there's just economics in there that banks cannot on their side. So, the dialog there is picking up and you can see we've, this is the second quarter in a row, we've been able to, to put a new fixed rate contracts.
So the headline I give you is things are looking better just based on the dialogs that we're having. I think to the last part of your question on our appetite on how and when to fix out, our focus in philosophy there is really unchanged, and that's ultimately wanting to be at a place where the fixed component of the portfolio is in the 50% to 75% range and in periods of low late rates, I think we'd say closer to the low end of that range and in periods of higher rates, especially with some steepness to the curve we'd say closer to 75%. Right. So, we're sitting at 25% today.
So I think as opportunity start to emerge and we're able to take advantage of that and deploy that in a fixed rate I think would be interested in doing so once that demand comes back. So, I think if, if what we're hearing, this quarter continues. I think you'd start to see some, some more demand in future quarters. Thanks for that color. And maybe for my follow-up. It's actually one of the same lines of what Bill just asked on the expense side, maybe taking a slightly different tack. Matt, I know when you had initially laid out the core G&A growth guidance last year the 5.5% to 8% growth, you talked about half of that growth being allocated towards efforts to accelerate organic growth in your traditional markets. The other half allocated towards some newer initiatives expanding the addressable TAM or market. As organic growth has accelerated, I understand that there is some upward pressure, but I just want to get a sense as to whether that philosophy still holds in terms of what's going to drive core G&A growth from here? And also wanted to you to provide some context around the promotional side, given that's the biggest area of upward expense pressure that we saw in the quarter, certainly higher than what we had been contemplating and how we should think about the growth in promotional from here given some of those upward pressures and the competitive environment? Yes. Is that I think Steve as like a four-part question on how we've been going - I think on the core G&A going forward. I think that if you build on the focus on investing and spending to drive organic growth, It's tied really to that. So, if you look at our plans for next year that will, we'll share next quarter that working through, whether it'd be growth in traditional markets. I think you heard a lot from Dan in the prepared remarks on how the new models are growing, and we've talked a bit about on this call and how business solutions is growing.
So, I think it's going to all be tied to growth. I think the split that we talked about this year, we'll see if that same split plays out next year, but at its core, it's really investing to drive organic growth, while at the same time balancing, delivering, operating leverage to the bottom line.
On the promotional side, I think the headline I would give you there. As we look ahead to 2022, is there's really two drivers of promotional one growth in the business overall. And then two our conferences and I think when you look at growth of the business overall, a little bit similar to what I was just talking about on core G&A. The drivers are really going to be the transition assistance associated with advisors joining our platform and the onboarding expenses for some of the larger ones associated with that.
So as you, as you start to look at what we've delivered over the recent periods, right hitting new highs for organic growth in our traditional markets, right having a full year of the larger wins like BMO an M&T on the platform, onboarding CUNA in the middle of next year and then of course beyond organic growth and Waddell having a full-year effect of that, so that's going to be the big driver on the TA side.
On the conferences side, I think like most folks and we really pulled back on conferences last year in 2020 given the, I think the obvious COVID environment. This year we've face those back in. But I'd say we're not at pre-COVID levels. So, I think we're still working and planning on this for 2022. But, I think we'll be looking to balance what I think we are quite confident is a positive return on conferences in person just a few we've done recently, I can tell you that the returns have been quite good, just given the excitement in the interaction folks have both us as employees in the home office as well as advisors getting to see each other.
While at the same time, I think taking advantage of the digital capabilities that we've deployed, this year as well as managing costs and the safety of those attending. So that's something that will come together next quarter, but the headline for you on promotional is it's about growth overall and then really how the conference plans land. Knocked all four out. Thanks so much for taking my questions, Matt. Our next question comes from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Thanks. Hey, good afternoon guys. All right. So, we'll continue with the multipart questions I guess to keep everybody awake, so essentially managed really nice growth, obviously good organic growth, good asset growth. How do you see sort of the internal addressable market in this part of the model? Is that something that you see advisor sort of switching from somebody else like external TAMs or these new folks that are, have not really use these services before? And maybe just remind us on the economics again, kind of, how does LPA, LPL ultimately makes money on this? Does that show up in advisory or does it show up in other? So, just a little bit more granularity, that would be great. Thanks. I'll take the first part of that. Matt, you take the second. So, Alex with respect to where the opportunity sets coming from I think your question set it up well, for the most part, it's new advisors coming onto our platform that will move from some other solution that they had been using wherever they came from.
So that's obviously one driver of growth. A second driver of growth as we're seeing more and more advisors utilize essentially managed solutions versus Rep as PM or constructing their own portfolios for the efficiency gains for the opportunities of which to create some professional leverage points that allow them free, free up time to do other things, I think is a positive trade. So, the more we add capability to this and lower the cost, the more and more of, that's a logical trade for them. So that is the second component.
And then I think the third is that you just continue to have this ongoing transition from brokerage to advisory, which is obviously a tailwind across the entire advisory platform including centrally managed. So, you might, you might think about it through those three drivers. And then. Alex, just on the economics. I think when you look at the long-term trends where interest rates are, is going to impact the numbers overall, but just to give you a sense of the different platforms. I think we, when you look at brokerage assets from an ROA standpoint, our gross profit ROA standpoint. They have been in the 15 plus, 15 to 20 zone depending on where interest rates are. When you move into the advisory platforms, it's about 10 basis points above that. And then within the advisory platforms when you move into essentially managed, it's another 10 basis points on average above that. So hope that helps on the economic side. Yes, that's great. And then a follow-up on Waddell, so $85 million plus an EBITDA contribution middle of next year. Can you help us frame the opportunity around the plus, how much of that would be sort of cross selling, how much of that would be maybe accelerated growth for Waddell advisors, are there additional kind of cost-cutting measures that are maybe embedded in the plus piece? Just trying to frame what the opportunity could be? Thanks. Yes. Yes, definitely, I think, future growth would be, it would be above and beyond that, I think when you look at our moving Waddell onto our platform and then what we've done so far through the quarter is really getting the synergies on the revenue of the gross profit side as we move them onto our platform move them off of their custodian and I think from this point forward, it's really about the work on expense synergies. Right. The natural things that you would do in a corporate integration that we plan to get done by the middle of next year. So the plus on $85 plus is really just that work. And if that goes better than estimated at this point that's where the plus could come from. Yes, I think. Alex, just to add to that. Beyond that you would begin to factoring can we support and help their same-store sales growth, expand their utilization of advisory platforms et cetera. So those are, those are things that aren't necessarily contemplated that in the short run. Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I just hoping you could update us on the digital offering what that looks like today and how do you expect that offering to evolve over the next 12-24 months, maybe you can give us a sense of what's next on the to-do list there? Michael, just for purposes of a little bit of distinction are you talking about for the end client or for the advisor, or both? Both, please. Yes, so for the advisor, we continue to see an income, an important part of the overall value proposition being the operating platform of which we provide them with that digital platform. So, anything that we can do that helps them operationally simplify what they do straight through processing, easy user interfaces that make for simple clicks to ultimately kick off a series of integrated workflows, those are great outcomes.
And so that's where we think about this digital platform of which helping our advisors in terms of simplifying the overall day to day processing and drive efficiencies into their work. I think the second place that we think about is how do we add and enhance robotics AI into these overall systems to improve and enhance the efficacy of those systems. So, think about improving and enhancing our overall collaborative risk management with them would be another place.
So you streamline, how you think about risk management, you have systems that are more efficient and effective at overall assessing some said risk and collaborating and working together with them is another opportunity and maybe a third one is, how do we help them with respect to prospective insights or trends that are occurring within their client base and how to position to better serve or support them or take a certain action. So, that might be three places in a wide spectrum of areas that we see is big opportunities on the, what I would call the advisor platform. And that's what we sometimes refer to as client works, as an operating platform or client works connected where we're actually streamlining workflows.
With respect to the, to the end investor that's been a place of investment for us. That is not historically been a place that we - necessarily played into create great value and in the last four years, we've pivoted pretty significantly and are trying to create what I would call a digital platform that we wrap around the advisors, not meant to replace the advisors, actually meant to enhance the advisors value proposition to the client and enrich how they show up for that advisor. So, think about the combination of the advisors professional IP together with a really modernized digital experience around that and so we're investing in our digital capabilities in order to achieve that.
So, anything from your standard ability to initiate and kick off workflows by the end investor to having robust content that provides them insights on industry opportunities within their portfolios to just the standard data they may need to better manage their account, when they want to, however they want to, sort of meeting them where they are.
So, we see that is a really robust and ongoing place to invest as we think about transforming that over time into smarter, more intuitive AI driven opportunities to make sure we're there when client, we're there with the advisor when the client needs us most. Great, thanks for that. Just as a follow-up. I was hoping you could maybe elaborate a bit on the traction you were seeing in the RIA custody offering and the momentum there, maybe you could comment on how many advisors have partnered with you since the re-launch of that, but the feedback has been and what sort of actions that you're taking here to enhance the growth and enhance the offering? Yes. In that case we were, as I had mentioned to you before, we were already a custodian if you will for RIAs. We just had done it in a more defensive posture and so we've been investing to streamline and improve the efficiency and experience that we can deliver as a custodian for someone, who is just focused on RIA business or advisory business. So, one that's been up. I would call it a year journey to improve that. We're still working on that, but we feel good about that journey in that trajectory.
And then the second thing that we've done is we've added resources to focus on growing this business and hence the combination of those intersection point launching this last spring and we've had some what is what we expected was a trajectory very similar to our Swiss model or LPL employee model where you sort of build and ramped in and, and I would say that we were pleased that the quick response we and the interest that we've had in that custodial side that exceeded a bit of the ramp that we saw in those other models and so we still have some iteration and work to do as we learn to get feedback from those advisors that have joined us, but it's been a small handful today and the pipeline is interesting. And again we've got business development resources that are focused on going out and winning this business.
So, I think you should think about it as we've seen the trajectory of those other two models. We do think it will follow a similar pattern. I'll buy it. We've got a faster start out of the gates. But, we think it will, it will follow a similar trajectory if you will, of growing into that. So it's very, very early on and we are establishing ourselves as a market player, a competitor, who has a viable competitive offering capability set that's competitively priced and now we've got to go out and sell it and pull those deals through.
So, I think there's more to come on that. It's just really early and pleased that the quick response that we've had, we've onboarded several advisors and we've got a good solid pipeline building. Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken of UBS. Please go ahead. Thanks for taking my questions. Matt, I just was curious about squaring a couple of the comments on the ICA dynamics and how they've been changing, it looks like the money fund balances went up in the quarter a decent amount. But yet, I think you indicated that the floaters, the ICA floaters, we're now Fed funds plus 5, so maybe could you help me square why the money fund balances were gone up if the floaters are looking more attractive or was it that that's now post 09/30 and that's the current environment and so we should expect those money fund balances to move out and move into the floaters? Yes, sure, Brian. So two different things going on, on floating rate dialog in the Fed funds plus 5 zone. I was just giving some color on what the dialog is in the current market. Right, We've got no new contracts there. Just to try and give a sense now that there is some steepness to the curve, that folks are starting to engage at a place that I think is constructive versus in the past it's been one basis point and a lot of cases. So, I think I just look to future quarters will update on how that's going, I'll just give you a sense as to the dialog in the marketplace right now.
On the money fund side, that's a little bit different. I think what you see happening there is really the overflow capacity that we have where there's really two types of overflow. It can be, in ICA contracts or bank contracts or money markets and the capacity in that part of the market is really primarily coming from money markets. Could you can imagine on that type of short-term money the banks don't have a lot of economics and therefore don't have a lot of demand for it versus the money funds don't have the similar balance sheet constraints.
So, that's where you just see a lot more demand there. Now those are overflow so kind of to square that back with the first part of your question, when demand does return those balances will naturally go back into whether it be floating rate contracts or fixed rate contracts whenever the capacity returns. It's a little bit of two different things going on there. Got it. Okay, thanks. And then on promotion. I know the there, you had referenced that there's a lot of flux going on in the conference world, which is totally understandable. Normally, if we go back to pre-2020, 3Q to 4Q you guys typically have a pretty decent drop, about a $10 million or $12 million drop in conference expense quarter over quarter. With that, I'm trying to think about the promotional indication of up a few million quarter-over-quarter would that typical seasonal pattern of the conference expense decline in the fourth quarter and therefore the TA amortization would continue to ramp or is this year going to look a little different on the conference end of things, I know it's a ticky tacky question, just want to get it straight? Yes. No worries. Yes, I think the last part, you said there this year is a little bit different and I think the key is when you look at, when you look at last year for conferences, mean in Q4 of 2020 we really didn't have any conference spend just given COVID in the environment when typically you would have it spread throughout the year. And then when you look at our plans for this year, even though we have a return to pre-COVID levels we've really scheduled. The conference is almost entirely in the second half of the year.
So, when you get into the Q4 21 versus Q4 2020 comparison, it's just a little bit of an abnormal year where you've got basically half of our conference spend this year in Q4 when to your point, historically would typically see a decline. So it's just a little bit of a different year. Got it. So more like a flat quarter-over-quarter conference dynamic than the typical drop? Yes. And I think my comments in the prepared remarks just promotional up a couple million next quarter which to your point is likely driven by growth in TA. Thank you. Our next question comes from Gerry O'Hara of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Gerry, please make sure your line is unmuted and if in a speaker phone lift your handset. Great, thanks. Sorry about that long day. Anyway, Dan, I think in your prepared remarks, you mentioned something about the traditional markets continuing obviously to be strong for you all despite lower assets in motion. If, I kind of got that correctly. So hoping you might be able to kind of flush out that dynamic a little bit whether that's just sort of a slowing in the breakaway broker trend, whether it's a little bit more near-term, or if it's just kind of more secular in nature, that would be helpful? Thank you. Yes, I think, where I mean in the traditional markets or maybe the advisor movement. I don't actually mean to reflect those that are moving out of the warehouses, I actually a more reflecting the movement within the independent space and I do think that's more timing than anything. I think you had lots of folks that are already in the independent space with some of the success that they're having in the marketplace today and growing their practices and supporting their clients, as well as you just add to the complexity of coming out of a significant amount of change in the prior year due to the COVID environment.
I think it's much more circumstantial than it is some structural shift in terms of the advisor movement in the independent space, but I do think that's probably reflective of the balance of this year and as we get to a place where we think, hopefully the COVID environment more normalizing, I think you'll see people ramped back up continuing to explore the strategic options versus just tactically managing their business. I hope that helps. Next question comes from Devin Ryan of JMP Securities. Your line is open. Okay, great. Good afternoon. I think you want to come back to the conversation we're just having now about kind of independent broker movement and yes I guess it's a longer-term point of view, again you're just talking about, you think about the market. I mean there still huge fragmentation smaller group of scale players. If you just think about the past year and a half or so, I mean it just feels like the leaders are separating themselves and it's more obvious just around technology some of things you guys are talking about on service and just the evolution of the model. And so what does this kind of to talk a bit about how this plays out longer term and just the consolidation of the market to the larger firms, is this clearly being going on for years. You guys have been a winner of that, but what point if at all, it does, it really kind of accelerate. It feels like there's maybe some inertia right now and to your point, yes, there is some friction in trying to move after kind of a lot of change over the past year.
But, why aren't advisor is kind of long-term kind of going towards where there's just, it feels like tremendous value relative to some of the smaller platform just aren't could be able to keep up technology wise or service wise or with some of the innovation that a large firms are bringing. So it's kind of tailoring on the prior question, but would love a little more detail there? Yes, sure. And so, as you say, outside of the current environment. Right. We do see that structural trend from moving from a - from let's call it a smaller provider to one that has more capabilities or higher quality capabilities that are going to help them better serve their clients, so that trend did exist today, even in this environment, and we do expect it to continue.
Now as we are able to invest more robustly in new capabilities, new opportunities, new economics. I think that will only accelerate that trend, Devin. And then at some point when it hits one of those firms hard enough, then you will see as you say the capitulation point of trading the franchise and so we do expect that trend to continue.
I think we, why we lead with organic growth and why we're so committed to investing in our capabilities to further enhance the appeal of the model, because we do see the independent space as a robust opportunity to continue to fuel our organic growth. Now the nice thing is, is you have the flexibility of the models that we offer now, right.
We can take those investments and across these different models create a much bigger opportunity set from that growing appeal in this broadened available market and so much like we see that continued trend from the all captive to the independent model. We continue to expect that to accelerate and evolve and obviously we're playing or trying to in a significant way to be a participant in that.
So, I think you've got it right. I think those structural trends continue and at some point on an individual sort of basis these companies will hit an inflection point where they feel like strategically, it makes more sense to explore some sort of transaction and certainly we're positioned to participate in that market at right valuations. So I hope that helps. Yes. I appreciate it. Thanks, Dan and quick follow up here. You may have hit this, but on commissions, just a little step back on particularly sales commissions of what I'm looking at here, more step back in the quarter. Is it seasonality or is this kind of kind of the right level maybe last quarter was a little more active above average, just any color on how to think about the trajectory and whether it was just a lighter quarter because either again some seasonality or people was engaged. Any color on how to think about the quarter for commissions, but maybe modeling going forward as well? Yes. that makes sense. And not to be overly precise, I would, as you say, look at it over a broader set of data than just one quarter. Naturally speaking, you've some, some elements of seasonality inside the third quarter because of the July, August timeframe or summer time frames, which sometimes reduces activity. And so, that said again without trying to make that the specific correlation here I kind of look at it more broadly over the last 12 months and you have seen some sustained elevated levels from where, from our jumping-off point in the prior 12 months. Right.
And I think you've got a couple of things going on to think about summer are in market driven. You've got good solid equity performance in the market. You've got good liquidity in the market, which certainly drive some activity, coupled with I think ongoing rising interest rate environments will create more opportunities for certain brokerage solutions to be offered, think about things like annuities.
So, those are some things to think about in the macro, I think when you think about our structural opportunities certainly the growing number of advisors we have will lead to more commission-based and sales-based business. And then on the sort of that same sort of structural concept that you've got the headwind of this ongoing transition from brokerage to advisory and those are the sort of the drivers of the inputs that I would think about as you think about the opportunity set going forward.
But look, I think the last couple of quarters, if you look at those across that entire sort of spectrum, you've got a logical sort of level of activity that I think reflects the current market environment. Hope that helps. And at this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Dan Arnold for closing remarks. Sir. Yes. Hey, thanks everyone for taking the time to join us this afternoon and we know it's a busy day for you. So, we really appreciate the time and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Arnold. Thank you, Jonathan, and thanks to everyone for joining our call today. Over the past quarter and throughout 2021, our advisers continue to provide their clients with personalized financial guidance on the journey to help them achieve their life goals and dream. And at the same time, we remain focused on our mission of taking care of our advisers so they can take care of their clients. This combination positioned us to deliver another quarter and year of solid results while continuing to make progress on our strategic plan. I'd like to review both of these areas, starting with our fourth quarter business results.
In the quarter, total assets reached a new high of $1.2 trillion, which was up approximately $300 billion or 34% from a year ago. This increase was primarily driven by continued organic growth, our acquisition of Waddell & Reed's Wealth Management business and complemented by equity market percentage.
With respect to organic growth, fourth quarter net new assets were $26 billion, which translated to 9% annualized growth driven by continued strength across new store sales, same-store sales and retention. Over the past year, organic net new assets totaled $119 billion or 13% organic growth, up from 7% a year ago.
In the fourth quarter, recruited assets were $17 billion, bringing our full year total to $89 million, which is more than double a year ago. Our continued growth in recruited assets reflects our ongoing progress with enhancing the appeal of our model and expanding our addressable market.
Looking at same-store sales, with the backdrop of a continued strong investor engagement, our advisers remain focused on serving their clients and differentiating their solutions in the marketplace. As a result, advisers are both winning new clients and expanding wallet share with existing plans, a combination that continued to drive solid same-store sales.
At the same time, we further enhanced the adviser experience through the continued delivery of new capabilities and technology as well as the ongoing modernization of our service and operations model. As a result, asset retention was approximately 98% in the fourth quarter and over the past year.
Our fourth quarter business results led to solid financial outlook with $1.63 of EPS prior to intangibles and acquisition costs, which brought our full year total to $7.02, an increase of 9% from a year ago.
Let's now turn to the progress we made on our strategic plans. As a reminder, our long-term vision is to become the leader across the entire adviser centered marketplace, which for us means being the best of empowering advisers to deliver great advice to their client and to be great operators of their business. To bring this vision to life, we are providing the capabilities and solutions that help our advisers deliver personalized advice and planning experiences to clients. And at the same time, through human-driven, technology-enabled solutions and expertise, we're supporting advisers in their efforts to be extraordinary entrepreneurial. Doing this well gives us a sustainable path to industry leadership across the adviser experience, organic growth and market share.
Now to execute on our strategy, we have organized our work with 4 strategic plays, which I'd like to review in turn. Our first strategic play involves meeting advisers and institutions where they are in the evolution of their business by winning in our traditional markets while also leveraging new affiliation models to expand our addressable market.
In our traditional markets, fourth quarter recruiting continued to be a significant source of growth with a new high of approximately $15 billion in assets. Ongoing enhancements to our platform and the efficacy of our business development team continued to increase our win rates and expand the depth and breadth of our pipeline despite adviser movement in the industry remaining at lower levels.
With respect to our new affiliation models, strategic wealth, employee and our enhanced RIA custody offering, we recruited approximately $2 billion in assets in fourth quarter. In each of these 3 models, we continue to see growing demand and expanding pipelines, which position them going forward for increased contributions to organic growth.
Large financial institutions were a new source of recruiting in 2021 with the addition of BMO Harris and M&T and will continue to contribute this year with the planned onboarding of CUNA. Our insights and progress over the last 18 months have led to the continued enhancement of our value proposition. And consequently, our demand and pipeline in this market continue to build. Given our experience and more seasoned view from this work, we see large financial institutions as a more accessible market opportunity for us and another new and distinct affiliation model that can drive sustainable organic growth over time.
Our second strategic play is focused on providing capabilities that help our advisers differentiate in the marketplace and drive efficiency in their practices. In 2022, we will maintain our focus on developing capabilities and solutions in 3 key areas. The first is to enrich the end-client experience with expanded digital solutions that increase personalization and self-service and enable advisers to create customized experiences for their business.
Second, we will continue to enhance our wealth management platform to help advisers provide their clients with differentiated advice, products and pricing. Third, we will continue to advance client work to our core operating platform, with additional digitized workflows to help advisers operate more efficiently and increase their scalability to serve more clients, all of which contributes to enhanced performance of their practice. We believe these evolving capabilities will help drive increased adviser growth, productivity and retention.
Let's next move to our third strategic thing, which is focused on creating an industry-leading service experience that delights advisers and their clients and, in turn, helps drive adviser recruiting and retention. As a reminder, over the past 2 years, we have transformed our service model into an omnichannel client pure model, including voice, chat and digital support giving advisers flexibility for when and how they access service. In 2022, we will continue to fine-tune this model to drive additional efficiency and an enhanced experience for our advisers.
Now this year, we will also advance to the next phase of our transformation, which is the streamlining and automation of our back-office operations. We will leverage Six Sigma process optimization and robotics and machine learning to reengineer our core clearing functions, including new account opening, transfers and money movement. These efforts will increase speed and accuracy for our advisers and their clients.
In the future, we plan to extend this transformation from the service and operations organization to trading and compliance. Doing so better positions us to create frictionless, efficient processes throughout our operations that enhance service levels, delight advisers and increase the scalability and efficiency of our platform.
Our fourth strategic play is focused on helping advisers run the most successful businesses in the independent market. One of the key components of this play is our portfolio of business solutions, which helps advisers more effectively operate their businesses so they can focus on serving their clients and growing their practices. In the fourth quarter, our subscription base continued to grow, more than doubling year-over-year to approximately 3,000 subscribers, demonstrating increasing demand and appeal.
And while working with advisers on evolving our suite of business solutions, we identified a new category of opportunity that will help advisers more efficiently and effectively deliver comprehensive financial advice and planning solution. And to help solve for this need, we are innovating on services that provide expertise and leverage to do this planning in a scalable way across their entire client base.
Our first offering in this area is paraplanning, which is a service that builds financial plans for advisers and then in turn utilize them to establish an investment strategy, help clients achieve their goals and objectives. This service launched last month and is receiving positive early feedback and engagement in the marketplace. We're also incubating other solutions, including tax planning and high network service.
As we look ahead, we remain focused on innovating and expanding our services portfolio to help advisers run extraordinary businesses and provide differentiated planning and advice for their clients and, in turn, to drive gross profit and organic growth over time.
In summary, in the fourth quarter and throughout the year, we continued to invest in the value proposition for advisers and their clients while driving growth and increasing our market. And as we look ahead, we remain focused on executing our strategy to help our advisers further differentiate and win in the marketplace and, as a result, have long-term shareholder value.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt. All right. Thank you, Dan, and I'm glad to speak with everyone on today's call. Before I review our fourth quarter results, I'd like to highlight our progress during 2021.
Looking at the year, we are proud of what we accomplished within our framework for driving long-term shareholder value. We entered 2021 with momentum as we grew assets organically in both our traditional and new markets and successfully onboarded Waddell & Reed, BMO and M&T, all while continuing to invest to provide an industry-leading value proposition for our advisers to serve their clients and win in the marketplace.
This commitment to enhancing the support we provide our advisers resulted in the highest level of organic net new assets in our addition. By leveraging the investments in our platform and the financial strength we've built over the last several years, we again entered the new year with positive momentum.
Now let's turn to our fourth quarter business results. Total advisory and brokerage assets increased to a new high of $1.2 trillion, up 7% from Q3. The key driver of this increase was organic growth, which totaled $26 billion or a 9% annualized growth rate. For the full year, organic net new assets were $119 billion, which translates to a 13% annualized growth rate, up from 7% a year ago. This was driven by strength across all 3 channels of growth: recruiting, same-store sales and retention. Looking more closely at recruiting, in Q4, recruited assets were $17 billion, which brought our 12-month total to a new high of $89 billion.
Moving on to our business mix. We continue to see positive trends in Q4. Advisory net new assets were $24 billion or at 16% annualized growth rate. With this growth, our advisory assets are now 53% of total assets as we continue to deliver differentiated capabilities and benefit from the secular trend towards adviser.
Now let's turn to our Q4 financial results. Strong organic growth, combined with expense discipline, led to EPS prior to intangibles and acquisition costs of $1.63, which brought our full year total to $7.02, up 9% from a year ago. Looking at our top line growth, gross profit reached a new high of $643 million, up $12 million or 2% sequentially.
Looking at the components, commission and advisory fees net of payout were $200 million, down $2 million from Q3, primarily driven by the seasonal increase in production volumes. In Q4, our payout ratio was 87.6%, up about 45 basis points from Q3, primarily due to the seasonal build in the production bonus. Looking ahead to Q1, a reminder that the production bonus reset at the beginning of each year, so we anticipate our payout ratio will decline to approximately 86.5%.
Moving on to asset-based revenue. Sponsor revenue was $220 million in Q4, up $9 million sequentially. This was driven by an increase in average assets due to organic growth and market appreciation as well as synergies related to Waddell & Reed assets being on our platform.
Turning to client cash revenue. It was $82 million, down $9 million from Q3. As anticipated, this was primarily driven by a fixed rate contract maturity at the end of the third quarter. Looking at overall client cash balances, they were $57 billion, up $7 billion from last quarter.
Looking more closely at our ICA yield, it was 101 basis points in Q4, unchanged from Q3. Within our fixed rate portfolio, in Q4, we added a new $500 million 3-year fixed contract. Looking ahead to Q1, we have a fixed rate maturity of $1 billion. I would like to highlight that we were able to renew that contract at maturity, into a new 4-year fixed rate contract. So given these factors and where interest rates, client rates and cash balances are today, we expect our Q1 ICA yield to decline by a few basis points.
Next, I want to highlight an update we made to our income statement this quarter to provide additional insight into our financials. We separated transaction of fees into 2 lines: service and fee and transactions. We hope this additional transparency allows you to more clearly see the revenue generated from predominantly recurring adviser- and investor-based services, apart from our transaction revenues. We have provided a summary of these changes on Page 12 of our Key Metric presentation.
So looking at service and fee revenue. In Q4, it was $110 million, up $5 million sequentially. This was primarily driven by continued growth in Business Solutions revenue and the seasonal increase in IRA fees. Looking more closely at Business Solutions, we ended the quarter with over 3,000 subscriptions; which is up approximately 400 from last quarter and more than double a year ago. These services now generate roughly $28 million of annual revenue while also contributing to organic growth by helping drive recruiting, same-store sales and retention. Looking ahead to Q1, based on typical seasonality and the growth of Business Solutions, we expect service and fee revenue to increase by a few million sequentially.
Moving on to Q4 transaction revenue. It was $39 million, up $4 million sequentially due to higher trading. As we look ahead to Q1, we have seen an increase in trading activity in January. That said, I would note there are 2 fewer trading days in the quarter, so that would likely offset that increase. So based on what we have seen to date, we would expect transaction revenue to be relatively flat with Q4.
Now let's turn to expenses, starting with core G&A. It was $299 million in Q4, bringing our full year core G&A to $1.58 billion. As expected, this was near the upper end of our outlook range driven by the variable expenses associated with our strong organic growth. Looking at the full year for 2021 and prior to the impact of Waddell & Reed, we grew core G&A by approximately 8%.
Turning to our outlook for 2022. Our long-term strategy is unchanged. We plan to continue to invest to drive organic growth and create incremental operating leverage. Over the last few years, we have increased our investments to drive organic growth. Those investments are yielding positive results, including the highest levels of organic growth in our history. And so as we look ahead to 2022, we plan to continue with the same approach. More specifically, we plan to increase our core G&A in the range of 7% to 9.5%, which is a similar growth rate to 2021.
I would note that these investments will be focused in 2 primary areas: first, to support our core business growth, including investments in technology and capabilities as well as a full year of Waddell & Reed expenses; and second, to support growth in our expanded addressable markets and to scale our new services.
Also, to give you a sense of the near-term timing of the spend, as we look ahead to Q1, we would expect core G&A to be in the range of $280 million to $285 million. We will, of course, remain dynamic to adjust for the pace of our growth and changes in the macro environment. But based on what we see today, we are excited about our opportunities to invest.
Moving on to Q4 promotional expense. It was $86 million, up $2 million sequentially, primarily driven by costs to support our organic growth, specifically, transition assistance and large financial institutions.
Turning to Q1, we anticipate promotional expense will increase to the low $90 million range, primarily driven by transition assistance, large financial institution onboarding and conference spend as we have 2 of our largest conferences of the year in Q1.
Now let's move to Waddell & Reed. The integration work is going well and remains on track to be completed by the middle of this year. With respect to run rate EBITDA, it was roughly $70 million in Q4. Based on current asset levels and our continued progress on the integration, we now expect the run rate EBITDA benefit to be at least $90 million by the middle of 2022, up from our prior estimate of $85 million.
Looking at share-based compensation expense. It was $10 million in Q4, relatively flat to Q3. As we look ahead, Q1 tends to be our highest quarter of the year, given the timing of our annual stockholders. So we anticipate this expense will increase by a few million dollars sequentially.
Turning to depreciation and amortization. It was $41 million in Q4, up $2 million sequentially. Looking ahead to Q1, we expect depreciation and amortization to increase by roughly $5 million sequentially. This is primarily driven by the deployment of technology to support the integration of Waddell & Reed as well as core technology spend to enhance our industry-leading platform. Given the nonrecurring nature of the integration spend, beyond Q1, we expect a more gradual rise in depreciation and amortization for the remainder of 2022.
Moving on to capital management. Our balance sheet remained strong in Q4, the leverage ratio at 2.26x and corporate cash of $237 million. As for capital deployment, our framework remains focused on allocating capital aligned with the returns we generate, investing in organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A where appropriate and returning excess capital to shareholders.
In Q4, we allocated capital to both organic growth and share repurchases, buying back $50 million of our shares to roughly offset dilution. We anticipate a similar level of share repurchases in Q1 while remaining flexible and dynamic as our capacity and opportunities to deploy capital evolve.
In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results. As we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue investing to serve our advisers, grow our business and create long-term shareholder value.
With that, operator, please open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. So maybe we'll start with organic growth. Not surprisingly, super strong end to the year. Obviously, wrapping up a good year for you guys from a net new asset and recruiting perspective. Given the sort of changing macro backdrop with both more equity market volatility and obviously down equity markets year-to-date but rising rate dynamics, curious how you think that will impact recruiting and sort of the broader competitive landscape. So are we likely to see FAs being sort of more reluctant to move given the kind of sharp move down in the asset values? Are there likely to be more competition because, again, people are more profitable so that maybe you can afford to pay a little more? So hoping you can sort of flesh out how that plays into your organic growth outlook into next year. Alex, it's Dan. Thanks for the question. So look, I think we always look at sort of the structural opportunities, first and foremost, relative to organic growth. And as we stated in our remarks, right, you've got new store sales, you've got same-store sales, and then certainly retention. And as it relates to new store sales, again, I think the flexibility and optionality around our model, continued investment in differentiation and the capability side of our platform and then using our rate-driven sort of underwriting process, we think that is really a feel in combination that continues to create that sort of structural differentiation out in the marketplace as we move forward. And I think that drives the primary sort of activity and results at the end of the day.
Now to your point, certainly, you have to overlay some market conditions that may influence that overall trajectory in the short run. There are cases to where you could have a significant market displacement that could occur that could temporarily disrupt the overall trend of opportunity out in the marketplace, i.e., advisers aren't moving as much because they're focused on those market conditions in serving and supporting their clients, and we've certainly seen that historically in the past. Up to this point, the volatility that we're seeing in the early part of the year, I think, is more aligned with sort of what we've played in the last couple of years. And so we're not seeing, thus far, some outsized impact for disruption in the overall movement out in the marketplace. I do think there's an overall, as we noted in our remarks, a bit slower movement in certain parts of the industry. But again, don't see necessarily thus far the macro influencing that. That's always subject to change if something more dramatic should shift as we move forward.
And I think with respect to interest rates, you're suggesting is if there's greater economics built into recruiting, how does that influence transition assistance and/or financial incentives. And again, we've seen no reflection of changing in the underwriting across the marketplace. And we continue to use a return-based approach to that concept. And we factor in, certainly, I think, the characteristics of our overall economics factored in with the macro. And so again, we haven't seen any shift at this point in the overall pricing out in the marketplace for cost of acquisition. I don't know if you want to add anything to that. No. Fair enough. All set. Great. A follow-up for Matt, maybe why don't we start with Waddell. Great to see the guide increase to $90 million plus from previous. Can you maybe expand a little bit what the plus depends on, again, is that market related to asset levels and rates? Or are you seeing potential for sort of incremental synergies, whether it's on the revenue side or the expense side? So just maybe a little more color on what could drive the upside there. Yes, definitely. I think as we move towards completing the integration by the middle of this year, the work that's really left is really on the expense synergy side. So as we complete that work, I think the plus is if we end up getting more synergies than expected. So it's kind of a small part of the work is left, and I think that's where the upside would be. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Katz from Citigroup. All the added color and disclosure is super helpful. So Dan, maybe a question for you. It sort of seems like from your commentary that the momentum is accelerating across the pipeline. So one clarification. Was that also in that the largest size of the financial institution group that the sort of the group you've historically not been able to go after, that $300 billion? But more broadly, can you just talk about what's resonating in the marketplace as, obviously, your organic growth is accelerating? Thanks, Bill. So yes. Look, organic growth is a key part of our strategy, as we've talked about, and we've stayed very intentional and focused on how do we deliver those results. And I think if you think about our growth going forward, perhaps if you look at the last couple of years as a framework for that, you've got 7% growth in 2020 and 13% growth in 2021, and those are probably pretty nice bookends as a way to think about a range of potential growth over the long run or as we go forward. Obviously, as we talked about in the last question, macro conditions at any point in time, that influence that overall opportunity set.
And I think, Bill, what we do to drive that, to get specifically to the second part of your question is we continue to look at investing in our traditional markets, growing the appeal of those markets, so it drives continued new store sales growth and continues to keep retention in that 2% range that we've talked about before. And we believe that investing in continued capabilities that help those advisers differentiate and win out in the marketplace is key to that. So think about that as focus #1.
I think second is expanding and accelerating the growth in our new markets. And you said it, we see continued momentum building there. Some of that was a go-to-market. We're new to the marketplace. We continue to iterate and refine those models to make sure they're well positioned and appealing as they can be and create the value that they should for those different segments of the marketplace, and we're seeing that versatility and that flexibility ultimately open up new opportunities. And frankly, it's even helping advisers in our existing platform who have one model, and potentially were thinking about transition to another, staying on our platform because we have that flexibility now. And so we do see continued momentum there, and we've gotten off to a good start here in Q1 relative to the strategic wealth solution as an example. So continued growing contribution from those new markets.
And financial institutions, what I was referring to as large financial institutions, this being somewhat of a new market for us. It wasn't a place that we always looked at for opportunity. I don't think we had demonstrated being able to bring a new solution to the marketplace that resonated, and it was actually a different contexted sort of solution for that segment of the marketplace. And I think through a couple of the wins that we've had, it's helped us learn, understand, refine and ultimately see that segment of the marketplace as a more sustainable avenue for growth and for contribution to come. So that's the way to think about the large financial institution markets, if that's helpful.
And then finally, the last one is helping our existing advisers grow. And they've certainly done a great job of that over the last couple of years in tough markets, and we continue to see opportunity to invest to help them differentiate their advice, expand their advice, solve new problems for clients and generate net new assets from that. So those are the primary sort of drivers underneath that growth. And I think if you try to apply all of that to 2022, as we think about this year, knowing that a large financial institution is onboarding in CUNA in the first half of the year, we believe we're in the upper half range of that 7% to 13%. So hopefully, that gives you some helpful color. That does. And just a follow-up for Matt or maybe, Dan. So just devil's advocate for a moment. If your rate guidance is correct, and if we get rates, hopefully, we will and get a 4, 5 rate hikes this year, all being equal, your guidance would suggest about $2.50 a share of incremental earnings power just based on Page 16 of the supplement. So if you assume that your recruitment remains solid, that your organic growth is bookend here, how do you think about deploying that incremental cash? And maybe you could speak to the M&A pipeline versus buyback at the margins for your choices. Yes. Sure, Bill. I'll take that one. I think when you look at our plans for the year, and I think you see those well in the core G&A specifically in the 7% to 9.5% range, I think the primary driver where that's going to land, I think, really is the level of organic growth. I think Dan just gave you some nice range of outcomes and opportunity set that we see there.
But really, interest rates, we don't see that driving that this year. I think when you look early in a rate cycle, that those increases and those benefits would typically fall to the bottom line and improve margin. So as we look beyond that and apply those excess funds to your question to our capital allocation framework, I think that the approach that we've taken in the past is really the same framework that we have today. And I think that will guide us. And it's back, first and foremost, to looking at opportunities to drive more organic growth, right? It could be things like new capabilities for advisers, things like further enhancing the service experience, expanding services to help advisers run their business as a few examples.
I think to your question on the M&A front, I think there's 2, call it, categories of opportunities there. That's a place where you can accelerate the delivery of capabilities through M&A. We've done a few small acquisitions there. And then the more, call it, standard or classic growth acquisitions as long as the returns are compelling, which obviously is key. And then lastly, returning capital to shareholders, which we also see as a compelling way to deploy capital.
So I think we're going to remain flexible and adjust if needed. And to your point, as we go through this year and with expected rate increases occurring, I think we'll apply those funds at that time to our framework and see what makes more sense at that time. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. So wanted to start with a question on rate optionality. Matt, since your rate sensitivity disclosure, the $310 million increase in gross profit from 4 hikes, it is based on a static balance sheet. And I was hoping to unpack some of the sources of rate upside that maybe aren't captured in that figure. And in particular, with money market balances running at very elevated levels, I was wondering how we should be thinking about both the capacity and timing to move money fund balances back into ICA as the Fed begins hiking. And with signs of bank demands also coming back for both floating and fixed rate agreements, a bit sooner than we were expecting, how should we be thinking about the glide path to getting back to that fixed target range of 50% to 75%? Yes. So great question, Steven. I think when you look at the money market, the balances in the money market overflow, and I think we put it in font size that folks at my age are just even hard to see, but I think you see a footnote there. If those balances go back into ICA, that would be an additional $30 million upside for rate hike for those overall balances. So it just gives you a sense as if demand does come back to the market and those [overall] allowances move gives you a sense of the benefit.
I think where that market stands, and I think you started to hint at it well in your question, I think where we sit today, the market and the -- therefore, the ability to do that hasn't really changed much. I'd say, if anything, it's improved a little. I think when you look at the things that would drive that, we're starting to see some positive signs, right? Consumer spending continuing to increase. Loan balances starting to grow off their lows at the big lenders. And then the biggest factor of all, the Fed, right, not only talking about raising interest rates and tapering, but actually talking about shrinking the balance sheet, their balance sheet. And those are the things that if all that occurs, I think, really removes a lot of liquidity from the system, and then we're naturally in a place to be a provider of them.
So it feels like the winds are blowing in the right direction, but things haven't really moved much yet. I would highlight some things we were able to do in the quarter. Like on the floating rate side, we are seeing pricing in the Fed funds plus 5 zone, where I think you were flat to negative when you think about more last year. And then on the fixed rate side, we're able to add a new contract this quarter, the $0.5 billion that I talked about in the prepared remarks. And the maturity that's upcoming in Q1, we're able to renew that into a new 4-year contract at 140 basis points, right? We haven't had that rate, I think, since pre-COVID or pre-pandemic.
So the market, I think, remains challenging. But I think there's a lot of good signs that if those things play out, it would improve. And I think pulling that through to the last part of your question is how does that fit into us getting to the 50% to 75% target range of the fixed rate portfolio, I think I'd just emphasize that remains our target. We're sitting at 25% now. I think in periods of low interest rates like we're in now, if demand is there, we'd probably want to stay shorter and closer to that 50%. And if rates are much higher with a steep curve, we want to be closer to 75%. And I think right now, the limiting factor there is more just the demand itself, which -- as I just commented on, which is why we're on 5. So hopefully, that helps, and I think I got -- I think it was a 3-parter, Steven. I think I got them all. It was actually a 2-parter, Matt. But I'm still going to push with a related follow-up, but it will be related, rest assured, just on cash balance growth expectations. You're entering the coming cycle with cash as a percentage of assets, relatively close to the 4% floor that you had spoken to previously, and that's before the Fed has even started tightening or where we would typically expect to see some signs of cash sorting as you noted in response to my earlier question or multipart questions. So given the strong organic growth that you're generating and just the need for advisers to maintain some minimum level of liquidity, should we still view that 4% as a reasonable floor on cash, which, all else being equal, would imply sustained growth in cash balances, at least in the mid- to high single-digit range even as the Fed begins to tighten this year? Yes, I think the short answer is yes. I mean, I think when we look at the dynamics of this cash, right, which is operational cash, right, for rebalancing or a weighting investment, I don't think we've seen anything change in how advisers give advice, the dynamics of that rebalancing and trading that would cause us to have a different view. So I think 4% is a good way to think about a floor. Now that doesn't mean 3.9 is a problem and a possibility. But I think when you think about it as a range, I think 4% is still the good percent to think of. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Just wanted to follow up a little bit there just on those overflow balances. I guess the point on the last question, just in a rising rate environment, I guess, what are the prospects, do you think, for those overflow ICA and overflow money fund balances to come back into an ICA floating? What really needs to happen? And how do rising rates impact the likelihood, the possibility and the timing for that to play out? Yes, sure. So Michael, it was what we were just talking about. I think that the mechanics are demand really returning to the market. And I think -- so then you click down and say what are the things that would cause that demand to return, and it's things that remove the excess cash off the banks that we will be placing that suite to, right? So that's consumer spending going up. That's loan balances on those balance sheets going up. And then the big factor, when you look at the Fed and the cash that's injected into the system, ultimately, it makes its way onto the balance sheet to those large financial institutions that we place our suite with. So it's really all connected. It's as simple as that. As demand returns, the mechanics of an overflow or when there's capacity in ICA, it goes back. Great. And then just a follow-up question on the expense front. You guys had flagged a more elevated promotional expense in the first quarter here just given some of the seasonality, but I was hoping you might be able to unpack what pieces of that come out as we go into the latter half of this year. How you see that trending, whether it's T&E, additional conferences? How do you see that trending? Yes, sure. And maybe just to hit again the Q1 numbers. When you look at the Q1 promotional expense, the key thing that I would highlight is it's really a function of our conference schedule. And when you look at 2021, if you recall, we had our conferences entirely in the second half of the year given the COVID environment. And this year, it's going to be a more typical schedule with conference expense showing up primarily in Q1 and Q3. So that's probably the main, maybe, thing you can intuitively see, right? The remaining drivers are all just connected to growth, the typical TA and the related amortization that comes from that as well as the cost to support the large financial institutions that we've talked a bit about here, M&T and BMO and then as we begin to support CUNA.
So as we get deeper into the year, and maybe just to think about the full year, right, just giving you the context on Q1, when we think about the full year, it's really similar drivers, right? The biggest driver is typically organic growth, the pace of that and the TA and associated amortization that shows up when that recruiting happens. As Dan highlighted earlier, the rates haven't really changed for that. Those have been quite stable. So I think the key driver there is going to be really the level of recruiting that we have.
On the conference front for the year, we're really planning to return to in-person events, right, so that would likely bring our conference spend for the year back to pre-COVID levels. I'd estimate that around a $20 million increase for the full year '22 versus full year '21. And then lastly, the onboarding expenses associated with CUNA, right? Similar to M&T and BMO in '21, we'll have those expenses in '22 for CUNA. So those are really the 3 biggest drivers I'd highlight. Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt from KBW. Maybe first, just a follow-up question on the cash balances, just with the meaningful cash build in December that you saw. Just wondering if you could share any information on whether those cash balances have been sticky thus far in January or you're seeing those kind of flow back into the market. Yes. We would typically see that happen, right? You get a normal build in the fourth quarter of each year, and you start to see those balances go back into the market in the first few months of the year. But with all the volatility we've seen this year and in this January, we've actually seen the cash balances continue to build. So they're up about another $1 billion for the month of January. I would emphasize, though, I think when volatility falls and things get back to normal, whatever your definition of normal is, I think we would expect to see that cash start to go back into the market. It's a lot of tax positioning, tax planning that you'd see in December, a lot of dividends and interest that come in. So it is very natural for that to get deployed back into the market in the coming months. Okay. That's helpful. And then my second question is just on the D&A guidance. I think you gave some commentary on the first quarter being up $5 million and a gradual increase from there. I think that implies something likely over a 20% increase versus 2021. I'm just trying to get a sense of if you look out over the medium term, and maybe it's a question more for the CapEx side of the business, are you comfortable, I guess, with the level of spend on the CapEx side? And if you could just go into a little bit more detail on the drivers of the increases here, that would be helpful. Yes. Yes, definitely. I think when you look at our core technology portfolio investments there, which is driving that increase, we've been increasing that around 8% per year for a while, and we plan to do the same in 2022. I think what you're seeing, the big pickup is really the technology associated with integrating and onboarding Waddell & Reed, and we had a big deployment in that area in the fourth quarter that then is going to lead to that depreciation increasing in Q1. So I think the increase that may not make intuitive sense is really connected with the acquisition. We factor those costs into the overall multiple, which you can see in the materials we estimated 4.5x. So it's really the core portfolio growing at 8%, I think as -- think about that as the ongoing runway. Our next question comes from the line of Gerry O'Hara from Jefferies. Just one for me this evening. Clearly, some strong momentum as it relates to the Business Solutions side. And apologies if I missed it, but what -- can you give us a little context about what's really resonating as it relates to the 400 incremental new subscriptions or perhaps what you see kind of onto come into 2022? And then also, can you help us maybe tie together just what the investment and spend looks like as it relates to the growth of these business solutions if that's part of that kind of core G&A number or if it shows up elsewhere? Any sort of kind of color or context, I think, would be helpful. How about I take part A. Matt, take part B. So thanks for the question. And look, with respect to Business Solutions, just as a bit of a context, if you’ll remember, that was an opportunity originally around this hypothesis of how do we help advisers, not only be great advisers, but to help them run private businesses. And we knew there was a significant amount of local level of spend that advisers are trying to help anything, accounting or bookkeeping to some sort of cash flow analysis to marketing support, tech support, all the things that you would think about in running a more entrepreneurial, smaller, midsized business. And so that was our original hypothesis.
And so as we've gotten in and continue to learn and serve and support them through our CFO solution, our marketing solution and our admin solution, I think those fundamentally and structurally resonate them and the needs that they have associated with those types of roles resonated. And what we've learned along the way, though, was there's also discrete problems that we can solve that don't require a full CFO. And we've been able to come up with sort of second-generation products, if you will, across the CFO and marketing landscape that expand our product offering, give different price points that make those services more and more accessible to more and more advisers. And so we will continue to innovate around what I would call the Business Services and think there's a significant room for opportunity when you look out overall -- advisers. And so those, again, I think, are really interesting, not only in the fundamental for initial offering, but multiple generations from their products in place.
And I think at the same time, as we've been innovating and working on those types of solutions, we learn more and more about new ways of new things that advisers are trying to solve for, and that's where we came up with help with succession planning around assurance plan. So our M&A solutions where that was borne out of how we think about succession planning and selling my business or an adviser is going to grow through buying a business. And we realized that those were obstacles and [obstacles] typically don't do, and we could come in with some expertise and leverage and help them execute around that to make those possible. So solving specifically again in and around how do I grow in to think about succession planning have been valuable areas of innovation to help drive that subscription base.
I think as we go forward, what we've also unlocked is a new category of opportunity where we will focus on helping them be great business owners. Now we've unlocked this opportunity where they may share, “hey, look, I want to provide a broader base of financial planning across my entire client base. I need some leverage to do that as that's time-consuming and hard to do.” So hence, this concept of consulting them [indiscernible] do the plans for them to position them than to go build the financial strategy and investment strategy associated with that. And so this has unlocked this full new category of helping them expand and broaden for the comprehensive advice, which just makes them more appealing and differentiated from other options out in the marketplace and hence help us to further this. So that's opportunity set as we move forward with respect to business and solutions. And to some degree, some of the initial products that have helped us get where we are, I hope that helps. Gerry, on the second part of your question on the cost front, I mean, the headline is that the costs that are included in our core G&A, included in core G&A guidance for 2022. So 7% to 9.5% range would include the cost of scale, our new services and specifically Business Solutions, as Dan just described. Okay. And actually, I just had one sort of, I guess, small follow-up, perhaps somewhat of a small point. But the interest rate sensitivity page, if I kind of compare this quarter-over-quarter, it looks like cash balances went up, but the incremental benefit from the next 4 rate hikes went down, granted it's a modest amount. And perhaps, you've already touched on it with some of the prior questions, so I apologize. But can you just maybe flesh that out a little? I would have maybe expected it to go in the other way. Yes, yes. I mean, I think it changed a little bit. I think the key is you saw the growth in those overflow balances in money markets and actually a slight decline in ICA. So while the sensitivities that are front and center in those bar charts went down a little bit, if you look at that footnote or the benefit associated with if and when those money market overflows go back into ICA, that actually went up, right? So it kind of shows up in a couple of different places, but it's just a mix, and we calculate those based on where we are at the end of the quarter. Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken from UBS. SWS wins have really been impressive. You got over 20 on the Board at this point. So far, what's been the feedback as you've built this offering out from advisers that you've onboarded? And are there any ways in which, based on that feedback, you're tweaking the offering or making adjustments in order to make it even more compelling? Thanks for the question. And yes, we are encouraged by the offering in the marketplace. And I think we probably -- when we first went to market with this solution, I think we've done some good research and insights, and all solid offering. But as people get in and begin to use that solution, you obviously begin to learn opportunities of probably creating some additional digital workflows that help them with efficiency inside the practices, which have being good feedback and learnings for us.
Continuing to more fully integrate some of our banking solutions was a another feedback that we've gotten that we've been working on to do that we think makes the solution more appealing. I think some of our high net worth solutions that we're working on have also been -- they've been a good source of feedback there to help us refine the development in those. So those are maybe some categories to think about where we've both made some improvements and continue to work to enhance the model.
But I think foundation, if you think about 85%, 90% of the core solution and the feedback we're getting in the NPS scores that we're getting from this group, it would reflect a good, solid offering, delivering on what they had hoped, which is to help to transition to an independent practice and the ongoing support, operate a successful and independent business. So we feel good about where we are and continue to take that feedback and apply it to enhanced offering. All right. That makes sense. And then just one follow-up, Matt, on the promotional expense. And you spoke to the -- to this -- to some degree, so it might be embedded within the prior answer. But when we look at the pickup in promotional from 4Q into the low 90s that you expect next quarter, it's my understanding that we had a conference -- you guys had a conference in the fourth quarter, so I would think that would be a like-for-like. So is the delta quarter-over-quarter really just purely the other factors, the TA and maybe a bit of a step-up in the CUNA onboarding? Or is it part of that embedded $20 million increase in the in-person conferences becoming larger and maybe the fourth quarter was a little smaller? Just understanding some of the complexion there would be helpful. Yes, definitely. And it's where you just ended the question. So it's a combination of -- we've got 2 large -- 2 of our largest conferences in Q1. You're correct, there is large conferences in Q4 as well, but you now have more of an in-person expectations. You have overall a little bit of increase in conferences and then all the growth items that you described. So it's a little bit of both. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Young from Truist Securities. I wanted to follow up on the Business Solutions portion of the business again. And good to see you get up to 3,000 subscriptions, another year of kind of doubling that. Is there any reason why we shouldn't expect that to continue to double or even more than double? I mean are we accelerating there? Or just any thoughts along the kind of pace of growth, especially with the new product additions would be helpful. Yes. I think you should think about that as the ongoing similar momentum that you've seen over the last year. With a bigger base requires obviously more incremental growth to create a doubling effect, if you will. But I do think that we've become better at offering these products. We've refined the existing version of products. And the new products coming out, that certainly will contribute to subscription growth. And again, we continue to try to refine our approach. And if we see opportunity or we've got gaps to fill in, then we certainly pivot and make those investments along the way. But I think the consistent sort of trajectory that we're on now feels like the best way to describe how we think about it over the next year. Okay. And as a follow-up, sorry, I apologize for switching gears here. But just on the financial institution side of the business, BMO, M&T last year, you got CUNA this year. Just from a capacity standpoint, I mean, would you all be able to announce additional partnerships this year? And how soon would you be prepared to actually execute following CUNA? And given kind of the splashes that you've made in that market recently with the size of the deals, are you having more conversations today than maybe a year ago regarding partnerships there? So if we go in reverse order, we are having more dialogue around the possibilities of serving or supporting larger financial institutions, also a larger set of institutions in different sort of categories. So that creates more dialogue and more opportunities.
With respect to the planning around these, I think we've got to be thoughtful and diligent around not just thinking about winning those deals, but making sure that we execute well behind them. And you've got to be thoughtful about your funnel and the pacing of that. These are also longer sales cycles because they're more complex than our typical other business development efforts and activity. And so without giving you a perfect time line, I think we have to be thoughtful and factor in our ability to execute match with that demand and opportunity and then plan those out so that we execute them well.
It's also worked on the other side with these institutions to work through and think through doing that. And so they also have their own execution limitations, if you will, that we've got to collaborate and partner up with them. And so without giving you some specific time frame around when some next deal may come, I think we have active dialogue going on with a broader set of prospects and then we'll factor in their ability to execute, our ability to execute and time those in a way that makes sense for doing that well. Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Dan Arnold for any further remarks. Yes. I just want to thank everyone for taking the time to join us this afternoon, and we look forward to speaking with you again next time. Have a good evening. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Arnold. Thank you, Howard, and thanks to everyone for joining our call today. We entered 2022 with a continued focus on our mission, taking care of our advisers so they can take care of their clients. As we progressed through the first quarter, market volatility and geopolitical uncertainty increased. Conditions like these, the value our advisers provide to their clients is reinforced by helping them to navigate in times of uncertainty. They work to provide personalized financial guidance to millions of American when they need it most, highlights the importance of LPL's mission. It also shines the light on the pivotal work of our employees. We take care of these advisers every day.
Guided by this Northstar, we worked together to deliver another quarter of solid business and financial results, while continuing to make progress on our strategic plan. I'd like to review both of these areas, starting with our first quarter businesses. In the quarter, total assets decreased to $1.16 trillion as continued solid organic growth was more than offset by lower equity market. With respect to organic growth, the business continued to perform well despite market volatility. First quarter net new assets were $18 billion, which translated to 6% annualized growth, driven by solid new store sales, same-store sales and adviser retention. These results contributed to an 11% organic growth rate in the past 12 months.
Looking at recruited assets, they were $10.4 billion in Q1, which prior to onboarding large financial institutions, was a new high for the first quarter of the year. These results were driven by the continued enhancement of the feel of our model and the efficacy of our business development. Looking at same-store sales, they remained solid in the first quarter as our advisers continue to focus on serving their clients and differentiating their solutions in the marketplace.
With respect to retention, we further enhanced the adviser experience through the continued delivery of new capabilities and technology as well as the ongoing modernization of our service and operations functions. As a result, asset retention was approximately 98% in the first quarter and over the past 12 months. Our first quarter business results led to solid financial outcomes with $1.95 of EPS prior to intangibles and acquisition costs, an increase of 10% from a year ago.
Let's now turn to the progress we made on our strategic plan. As a reminder, our long-term vision has become the leader across the entire adviser-centered marketplace, which for us means being the best at empowering advisers and institutions to deliver great advice to their clients and to be great operators of their businesses. And to bring this vision to life, we are providing the capabilities and solutions that help our advisers deliver personalized advice and planning experiences to their clients. At the same time, through human-driven technology-enabled solutions and expertise, we're supporting advisers in their efforts to be extraordinary business owners. Doing this well gives us a sustainable path to industry leadership across the adviser experience, organic growth and market share.
Now to execute on our strategy, we have organized our work into four strategic plays, which I'd like to review in turn. Our first strategic play involves meeting advisers and institutions where they are in the evolution of their businesses by winning in our traditional markets, while also leveraging new affiliation models to expand our addressable market. Our recruiting and traditional markets continue to be a significant source of growth in Q1, with approximately $7 billion in assets. In the quarter, we continued to increase our win rates and expand the depth and breadth of our pipeline despite adviser movement in the industry remaining at lower levels.
With respect to our new affiliation models, strategic wealth, employee and our enhanced RIA offering we recruited nearly $3 billion in assets in Q1. And this quarterly total was a new high for these models and reflects the increased diversification of our recruiting. In each of these three models, we continue to see growing demand and expanding pipeline, which position them for increased contributions to organic growth going forward. The large financial institutions market was a new source of recruiting in 2021 with the addition of BMO Harris and M&P. For 2022, CUNA is on track to join later this quarter. And we are prepared and ready to onboard their approximately 550 advisers located across almost 300 credit unions, who serve $36 billion of brokerage and advisory assets.
Also within this year, we will onboard People's United Bank, which was acquired by M&T and includes approximately 30 advisers serving $6 billion of brokerage and advisory assets. For these institutions, we will use new innovations that will make it easier to transition to LPL and, in turn, help make our offering even more appealing and ultimately contribute to future growth. As we look ahead at the market opportunity for large institutions, we continue to see our pipeline build as demand for our model grows.
Our second strategic play is focused on providing capabilities that help our advisors differentiate in the marketplace and drive efficiency in their practices. As part of that focus, in 2022 we are continuing to enrich our wealth management platforms including the enhancement of our advisory solutions, in allignment with the secular trend towards advisory, which continues in our business and across the industry. For example, in the first quarter, we expanded the investment options available in our centrally managed platforms by integrating separately managed accounts.
Doing so makes it easier and more efficient for advisors to leverage separately managed accounts which can drive higher utilization and further growth of centrally managed platforms. As a result, this enhancement increases our advisory platforms’ value to both existing and prospective advisors.
Let’s next move to our third strategic play which is focused on creating an industry-leading service experience that delights advisors and their clients and, in turn, helps drive advisor recruiting and retention. As a reminder, over the past two years we have transformed our service model into an omni-channel, Client Care Model which includes voice, chat, and digital support thus giving advisors flexibility for when and how they access service. We continue to fine tune this model to drive additional efficiency and an enhanced experience for our advisors.
Now, for the next phase of our transformation we are focused on expanding and enriching specifically our digital support in order to provide greater flexibility, speed, and accuracy for our advisors. As an example, we are developing end-to-end digital experiences in core clearing functions including money movement, account opening, and account transfers which collectively drive the majority of our service center activity. Now by streamlining our core clearing functions, we believe that we can enhance service levels, delight advisors, and increase the scalability and efficiency of our platform going forward.
Our fourth strategic play is focused on developing a services portfolio to help advisors run the most successful businesses in the independent marketplace and provide comprehensive advice to their clients. One of the key components of this play is our Business Services portfolio which helps advisors more effectively operate their businesses so they can focus on serving their clients and growing their practices. Our subscription base continued to grow ending the quarter at nearly 3,500 which more than doubled year-over-year, demonstrating increasing demand and appeal.
Now as we work with advisors on existing solutions, we are leveraging our learnings and insights as a catalyst for new solutions as well. Examples of this include our new Bookkeeping solution, which is currently in pilot as well as our enhanced Admin Solutions offering, which provides a next-generation tech-enabled task-management system.
We also continue to progress on the opportunity that we introduced last quarter to help advisors provide comprehensive financial advice and planning solutions. Our first offering, Paraplanning, has generated solid initial momentum in the marketplace. Our approach is to give advisors a scalable platform to efficiently and effectively deliver more financial plans and access greater expertise that helps them deepen their client relationships. We launched this offering in January, and by the end of Q1, we had approximately 60 subscribers. Now, at the same time we continue to work to expand the portfolio including tax planning and high net worth solutions. As we look ahead, we remain focused on innovating and expanding our services portfolio, which in turn positions us to drive additional gross profit and organic growth over time.
In summary, in the first quarter, we continued to invest in the value proposition for advisors and their clients while driving growth and increasing our market leadership. As we look ahead, we remain focused on executing our strategy to help our advisors further differentiate and win in the marketplace and as a result drive long-term shareholder value.
With that, I’ll turn the call over to Matt. All right, thank you, Dan. And I'm glad to speak with everyone on today's call.
As we move into 2022, we remain focused on serving our advisors, growing our business and delivering shareholder value. While the market backdrop was volatile, we delivered another quarter of solid net new assets and earnings growth. In addition, we are preparing to onboard two large financial institutions this year with CUNA and People’s United Bank. So as we look ahead, we continue to be excited by the opportunities we have to help our advisors differentiate and win in the marketplace, and grow our business.
Now let’s turn to our first quarter business results. Total advisory and brokerage assets were $1.2 trillion, down 4% from Q4, as continued organic growth was more than offset by lower equity markets. Total net new assets were $18 billion or a 6% annualized growth rate.
Looking more closely at recruiting, in Q1 recruited assets were $10 billion, which prior to large financial institutions, was a new high for the first quarter of the year and brought our 12-month total to $76 billion.
Moving on to our business mix, we continued to see positive trends in Q1. Advisory net new assets were $17 billion, or an 11% annualized growth rate. With this growth, our advisory assets reached a new high of 54% of total assets, as we continue to deliver differentiated capabilities and benefit from the secular trend towards advisory.
Now let's turn to our Q1 financial results. Organic growth, combined with expense discipline, led to EPS prior to intangibles and acquisition costs of $1.95, up 10% from a year ago.
Looking at our top line growth, gross profit reached a new high of $669 million, up $26 million or 4% sequentially. Looking at the components, commission and advisory fees net payout were $227 million, up $27 million from Q4, primarily driven by higher advisory fees and seasonally lower production bonus expenses.
In Q1 our payout rate was 86.1%, down about 150 basis points from Q4, largely driven to the seasonal reset of the production bonus at the beginning of the year. Looking ahead to Q2, we anticipate our payout rate will increase to the low 87% range, primarily driven by the typical seasonal build in the production points. I would also note we expect the payout rate to increase following the onboarding of [indiscernible], but given the timing of when they join, we expect to see that increase mainly in Q3.
Moving on to asset based revenue, sponsor revenue was $212 million in Q1, down $8 million sequentially as average assets decreased during the quarter driven by lower equity points. Turning to client cash revenue, it was $85 million up $3 million from Q4. This was primarily driven by the March rate hike, which more than offset expected, fixed rate contract pricing, looking at overall client cash balances. There were $62 billion up $5 billion from last quarter. Within our ICA portfolio as expected in Q1, we renewed a $1 billion fixed rate maturity into a new four year contract.
In addition in March, we were able to add floating rate capacity, which drove a roughly 3 billion increase in ICA balances. Looking more closely at our ICA yield, it was 102 basis points in Q1, up 1 basis point from Q4. As a reminder, our ICA balances are primarily indexed to Fed funds. So the ICA yield benefited from the March rate hike for the last two weeks of the quarter.
As we think about our Q2 ICA yield and prior to any changes in interest rates, we would expect an increase in yields on our floating rate balances. As we see the whole benefit of the March hike, while yields on our fixed rate portfolio will adjust for the renewal in Q1. The net effect is we expect our Q2 ICA yield to increase by a couple of basis points.
Now let's turn to service and fee revenue, which in Q1 was $113 million, up $2 million sequentially. This was primarily driven by continued growth in our services group revenue and the seasonal increase in IRA fees. Looking more closely at our services group, which includes business services and planning and advice services, we ended the quarter with more than 3,500 subscriptions, which is up about 500 from last quarter and roughly double a year ago. Our services group now generates roughly 30 million of annual revenue while also contributing to organic growth by helping drive recruiting same-store sales and retention.
Looking ahead to Q2, we expect service and fee revenue to decrease by a couple million sequentially, driven by seasonal declines in IRA and conferencing. Moving on to Q1 transaction revenue, it was $47 million, up $7 million sequentially due to increased trading volume from equity market volatility. As we look ahead to Q2, volumes in April have pulled back from elevated Q1 loans, which on a run rate basis would result in a decline in transaction revenue of around $5 million Q1.
Now let’s turn to expenses starting with core SG&A, it was $281 million in Q1. Looking ahead, we plan to stay disciplined on expenses while continuing to invest to drive growth. I would also note that with peoples now planning to join in the second half of this year, we anticipate up to $5 million of additional core G&A in 2022 to support this new large financial institution.
Moving on to Q1 promotional expense was $87 million, up $1 million sequentially, primarily driven by transition assistance, large financial institution onboarding and conference spend, as we had two of our largest conferences of the year in Q1. Looking ahead to Q2, we expect promotional expense will increase by a couple million sequentially. As we anticipate increased costs from transition assistance and large financial institution onboarding will largely offset by lower conference expense.
Now let's move to Waddell & Reed, the integration is on track to be substantially complete by the end of the second quarter. With respect to run rate EBITDA, it is roughly $70 million in Q1. And we now expect the run rate EBITDA benefit to be at least $95 million by the end of Q2.
Turning to depreciation and amortization. It was $45 million in Q1 up $5 million sequentially. Looking ahead to Q2, we expect depreciation and amortization to increase by a few million sequentially. Moving on to capital management, our balance sheet remains strong in Q1 with the leverage ratio at 2.16 times and corporate cash of $270 million. As for capital deployment, our framework remains focused on allocating capital aligned with returns we generated. Investing in organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A were appropriate and returning excess capital to shareholders.
In Q1, we allocated capital to both organic growth and share repurchases buying back 50 million of our shares. As we look ahead to Q2, we will remain focused on our capital allocation priorities. I would note we expect an increase in capital deployed for organic growth with the onboarding of [indiscernible] in the related transition assistance that will be paid during quarter.
We also anticipate continuing share purchases likely at a similar level as we did in Q1. As we look ahead to the second half of week, and if interest rates continue to increase as market expectations would apply. We would have additional capital to deploy. Our framework for deploying capital is unchanged. It would focus on organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A were appropriate and returning excess capital with shareholders. We will, of course remain flexible and dynamic as our capacity and opportunities to deploy capital of all. As a final point, I want to share that we've scheduled our next investor and analyst day for Wednesday, November 16 in New York City.
We look forward to providing more details. As we get closer to the event. In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results. As we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue investing to serve our advisors, grow our business and create long-term shareholder value.
With that operator, please open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question or comment comes from the line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Hey, good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for the question. Maybe we'll start with the ICA dynamics, great to see incremental bank pick up demand a bit here, obviously on the variable side of things. As we think through the cycle, you guys have significant amount of cash still sitting in money market funds is really form of sort of the overflow, I guess because bank demand wasn’t there for the last couple of quarters. How are you thinking about the ability to transfer them back into ICA, especially when money market fund yields feel like we’ll start to rise and already higher than what clients would be able to get and their kind of ICA cash balances. Yes. Alex, and I think I’ll hit just kind of cash sweep dynamics overall that I think will hit on the exact point you asked there, and I think you highlighted the money market balance is really a function of overflow as opposed to rate seeking behavior. But I think first on your point on demand with third-party banks, I would just emphasize that we’re really starting to see demand pickup, right?
You’ve seen the fixed rates where we were able to put together or put in place the last few quarters, I just emphasize this quarter where you’re able to add $3 billion imbalances from new variable contracts. At competitive rates, right, Fed funds flat on the variable side. And those fixed rates were really at the relevant point on the curve when we put those in place. And maybe even just as important to note, like we’re really early in the Fed tightening cycle, right?
Only one increase so far haven’t started to shrink the balance sheet yet. I’m sure you saw the consumer spending numbers come out. Those are picking up, lendings picking up. And I think those are all things that over time would likely lead to further pickup in demand. So I think sitting here today, I think we’ve – we’re more optimistic about demand continuing to pick up than we have been in a while for the reasons that that I just said.
I think to your point on the balances themselves in a rising rate environment, sitting in the money market that are really overflows, I think the key is just the nature of the cash balances that we have. I don’t know if you saw it, but we added a page in our key metrics that Page 18, that gives a I think a nice illustration of that, which is the cash in our cash sweep is largely operation, right?
It means it’s cash available for rebalancing, for paying fees, customer withdrawals and I think that’s why you see it as one of the lowest cash as a percent of AUM really in our industry in that 5% zone. And the key thing to your question that really tends to move that percent up or down is really market sentiment not rate seeking behavior.
And I think you can see that in the chart when there’s elevated volatility folks called in risk off mode, right? You see those balances get up in the 7% zone as an example at the start of the pandemic. And then on the other end of the spectrum, when they’re fully deployed or in risk on mode, if you will, you see that cash get down to call it the 4% zone you saw that if you look in the 2019 time period again market sentiment driven, not really rate driven.
The other thing I note is back then back in 2019, more than half of our assets were in brokerage accounts, and those tend to have less cash, right? So if you look at where we are today, the majority of our assets are in advisory accounts that tend to have more cash. So if you adjust for that kind of think of that low point that was at 4%, it’s probably closer to 4.5%. And we’re sitting at 5.3%. So with volatility actually rising.
So I think those are the big drivers. And then I know you didn’t ask about it, but on deposit beta, I think like you’ve heard from most folks, we don’t see anything pointing to a change in the price sensitivity of these deposits. So what we saw a lot last cycle, I think it was a good way to think about betas, which low in the early part of the cycle, think 2.5% higher as you get deeper in the cycle, I think 25% with an overall average around 15%. So those are probably the big three dynamics, Alex. And I think as we think about going into this cycle, I think we feel pretty, pretty well set up on the cash sweep cycle. Great. Thanks for saving time on a number of different follow-ups and I’m sure people are going to happy. I guess just to kind of wrap this up though and I don’t want to put words in your mouth, but is your expectation to move ultimately all the money market accounts back into ICA, assuming that the bank demand is there. Yes. I think the way I think about it for operational cash, right, the product is a bank product, and you have a pandemic dynamic where the demand wasn’t there. For folks where they have call it rate seeking cash or investing cash, we have separate products for those and people – and those are available and they can put that money there. That’s just not really the primary nature of this cash it’s really operations. Awesome. Great. Thanks so much. Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Bill Katz from Citigroup. Your line is open. Okay. Thank you very much for taking the question. Maybe let’s start with business solutions. Great to see combination of just strong absolute growth quarter-to-quarter, and then also I did pick up on PAS pick up 63 subscriptions in the quarter. Can you unpack that a little bit more just sort of where you’re seeing the success cross sell of across financial advisors and within PAS, is that being sort of cross sell to those that already have business solutions, subscriptions, or new just trying to get a sense of sort of penetration and growth in front of us? Yes. Bill, it’s Dan. It’s a great question. And I think as we step back and look at the opportunity set, it’s too old to extend the offering across a broader set of our advisors. If you think about 3,500 subscriptions that may cover roughly the 2,000 advisors. And so you’ve got lots of opportunity if you will to expand the offering across our client base, one. And then two, as they have success with one of these services then it’s very logical that that they would explore the extension of that relationship to engage in another service. And so we do believe that that certain different profiles of advisors could have as many as two, three as many as four of these relationships, if they truly are leverage points that drive performance in their businesses.
And so I think that’s the right sort of dynamic that you identified in terms of the opportunity set. As we look at it today, most of them are advisors that have one relationship. We’ve seen great success as an example with the original CFO solution, which ended up creating more value than just that financial acumen that sometimes advisors need and want to leverage. It actually provides additional strategic leverage that really helps them think about a broad best – a broad base set of challenges and considerations and decisions they have to make across the businesses.
You got a partner that brings that outside in thinking and compliments their perspective. Then I think they get great value out of enriching the decision making – they make about their businesses. So that’s one that we find continuing sort of growing, understanding around the value of it, and then happy clients share that with other clients and talk about their pragmatic experiences around it.
It gives an example of a solution like that great momentum. And so that’s maybe just a quick down to highlight one of the solutions. I think on the other side, this new category, we just opened up around the planning concept. That’s all about providing holistic advice and how do we help advisors do that in order to help them differentiate and grow. And we went right at a big challenge out in the marketplace, which is, hey, if I got a client book of 300 clients, and I only have been able to do 30 plans for those clients because of the complexity and the time spent, et cetera, not only to set them up, but to support them going forward. If I’ve got a leverage point of resource that can help me do that and I can take that from 30 to 200 relationships within my book.
Well, then now I’ve opened up a much, much broader orientation to my client relationship that creates a whole lot more solutions for me to solve for, which creates real value in helping me grow a relationship. It also gives me a long-term orientation to that client relationship where I can make sure we’re executing on that plan. Every year we hit new life events. I stepped in to add more value.
So it’s a – it’s really meant as a big time transformer, if you will into the orientation of client relationships, it create much more opportunity over the long haul. So that’s why we think that one’s so important and you can see then the residual kind of services that we could build around Paraplanning. That’s why we talk about tax planning, state planning, high net worth solutions. You can just really add to that baseline Paraplanning a lot of complimentary services. So let me give you a little bit of a framework at least for the growth potential, as well as I think the two categories of solutions we have and a little bit of a pragmatic example on each side. Great. Thanks so much. And then Matt, just my follow-up coming back to maybe rate sensitivity a little bit, can you talk a little bit about where your heads at in terms of migrating from float to fixed just given the shift of rates, I’d appreciate the belly of the curve is sort of flat is at some point. And also you had mentioned that you picked up a contract that Fed funds flat, and I think that compares to sort of Fed funds plus 20, 30 basis points in the past. Would you envision as demand for deposits rises that that spread might re-widen along the way? Thank you. Sure, Bill. I mean I think on the fixed rate appetite, I think our view there is really unchanged, right. I think if there’s demand and it’s up to us on how much to fix out that 50% to 75% zone is the zone that we want to be in. And I think when we’re early in a cycle and there’s some in this – in the yield curve starting to move up, I think we want to be on the shorter duration side and closer to that 50%.
Now the opportunities aren’t there, right? Because the demand is still limited from the bank side. But if we’re able to execute, I think it would be the same strategy that we had articulated before. So we’ll look to see as demand comes back or how quickly that comes back. On the variable right side, I think, yes, I think in this environment where there’s still this amount of liquidity, I think Fed funds around Fed funds flat, I think is what you should expect to see for a while.
Once you’re in a place where there is demands – full demand for the deposits, I think if that is the point where you would start to see spreads widen. So the question is just how quickly does that happen? That’s hard to know, but I think the spreads probably don’t start to widen until your demands fully being there. Thank you very much. Good. Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Brennan Hawken from UBS. Your line is open. Hey, how are you? Hey. Yes. Glad he said my last name. That’s… There you go. So just a quick question here on the expectation around 2Q ICA yield improvement only going up a few bps. Is that only based Matt, on what we’ve seen so far from the Fed, because the forward curve is telling us that May and June are not only live they’re likely to both be 50. Yes, no, absolutely. That’s prior to any additional rating. And then I think you can see the sensitivities that we put out on. If those increases do occur, you can see the math that flows out of that, but that was just to give you a kind of a baseline on where we are before anymore. Perfect. Okay. Thank you for clarifying that. And then the – I appreciate you referencing Slide 18, because that was going to be something I was going to explore. Have you looked at what that rate looks like? The percentage of cash, percentage of client assets in cash when you add also some of the purchase money market funds and other products that you all have available on the platform and how that might change over time and under different interest rate environments. Yes, Brennan, I think that if you go back a couple pages on Slide 16, you can see that we’ve got the purchase money market funds on that chart. So you can see that data, but the thing I would emphasize is back to their the rate sensitivity of these balances and it’s just not rate sensitive cash. It is that operational cash that is used for rebalancing for paying fees, the balances themselves, right? If you just look at where we ended Q1 on average, it’s 8,000 per account.
So it’s just not the type of cash that’s looking for investment, it really is there to facilitate those things. So I think when you look at Slide 18 we think the primary driver is really where the equity markets are, whether that cash is fully deployed or not. And not primarily driven by rates. Yes. Okay. That’s all really fair. It’s of course, I understanding all of that. It’s just that we’ve seen given the rapidity of hikes, the fact that, that it could move so quickly, certainly you guys are using the money market fund sweep to a greater degree. And so if it shifts over, it could be a bigger change. And there’s been a another competitor that, that went through a transition from money market to bank account, it led to some disruption in the last cycle. So that’s probably why there’s a bit more attention there. Thanks for taking my questions. Sure. Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Hey, good afternoon, Dan. Good afternoon, Matt. Good afternoon. So wanted to ask a follow-up. Sorry to beat the dead horse of Slide 18. But we’ve gotten some questions and there’s some confusion I wanted to clear up, specifically around how to think about cash growth this cycle versus last cycle. So a lot of folks are looking at the slide, seeing that cash balances themselves in the last tightening cycle didn’t grow very much were essentially stable. But of course this time around your organic growth profile is much stronger. And I was hoping you can speak to what would support better organic cash growth this cycle relative to last? And how you’re just thinking about the cash algorithm generally would be really helpful. Sure. I mean, I think there’s a couple things to highlight. I think on the organic growth, right? I talked about a little bit earlier if you heard. But our growth continues to be more and more in advisory, which has higher cash balance, right? So when you think about organic growth continuing to pick up, maybe if you’re looking at this slide on the right hand side of it, that’s where advisory growth has picked up more versus the left hand side. So I think that’s one thing to factor in.
And then second, I think when you look at the last cycle, I think and it’s not on the chart, but again, the key driver is equity market movements or overall market sentiment. And maybe if you hone in on in the end of 2018, early 2019, you can see that spike up to 5.6%, right, still at the peak of the rate environment. This is because you had equity market drops.
And then of course, moving over the right further when you pick up a Q1 2020 to 7.1% beginning of the pandemic. So I think what this chart shows is the thing that meaningfully moves that cash is really market sentiment and less so interest rate sensitivity. And to the point in your question continuing to grow more and more on the advisory side, overall is going to bias that percentage to be up slightly as well. That’s great. And my follow-up maybe for Dan. I was hoping you could just speak to how the M&A landscape is evolving and whether you have increased acquisition appetite as the current macro backdrop taking a step back higher rates, lower markets really should in theory bolster your relative financial position versus many of your private IVD peers that are in self clearing. And just wanted to get a sense as to whether this is an opportune time, given the strength of your earnings profile, your improving relative position to maybe get a little bit more aggressive on the M&A front. Yes, Steven. Look, I think our framework hasn’t changed, we first focus on organic growth and looking at opportunities to deploy that capital, even when at a place of strength in order to enhance our ability to differentiate and grow organically. And so in a down market, we see those opportunities around recruiting as an example where other firms may be struggling to invest in capabilities or they have less stable platforms. And they have the opportunity around a flight to quality as an example. And we’ve seen those opportunities occur at the beginning of the pandemic was a good example of that. And so obviously, we stand ready and positioned for those opportunities.
I do think and then you look at M&A as a compliment to that organic growth, we’re constantly looking across the landscape. It’s smaller broker dealers and RAAs that may be an opportunity and interesting perspective to support our overall growth agenda. And so those are interesting opportunities that we continue to look at. You do tend to see some of those emerge more readily in a more challenging market.
And then I think finally, as we look across the broader landscape of the marketplace, challenging markets bring about probably accelerated consolidation. And we certainly – if we feel well positioned and then we can follow our sort of formula, if you will, for how we think about the relevance of M&A, it’s got to make strategic sense, it’s got to be financially prudent and we got to make sure that we can operate and execute on it. Then we’ll be rather opportunistic there too.
So I think that’s sort of the order of which we would explore deploying capital to drive growth organic in smaller acquisitions, capability acquisitions, and then finally a larger more transformation. I hope that helps. Very helpful. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Good afternoon. Thanks for the question. Wanted to ask about recruiting? Just curious how this more volatile equity market backdrop with rising rates and less certain macro picture, I guess, more broadly impacting recruiting trends. Maybe you could share a little bit of color around the pipeline and it looks like you’ve been adding about 300 advisors or so per quarter outside of M&A and the mandate wins. So just curious your perspective on sort of the forward look around sustainability of that sort of case adding about 300 or so per quarter. Yes. So I might start with just a quick sort of step talk on where we are, and then we’ll talk about a little bit about as we think about it going forward. So as a reminder, over the past year, we’ve recruited $76 billion in assets. And if you click down on Q1 that included $10 billion in Q1, which say our largest first quarter we’ve ever had X large financial institutions being a part of that. And so that certainly I think reinforces the continued success and opportunity, even in a marketplace it’s under a changing conditions, if you will.
And then I think if you look at, we closed the quarter strong with almost 50% of that recruiting happening in March, so you got solid momentum as you kind of move away from some of the original episodic sort of geopolitical event that caused the volatility to start. And then I think as we – it gives us a good baseline if you will to look forward. And then you’ve got recruiting opportunities in the financial institution space that we talked about earlier, People’s United to add to that, as well as this growing diversity of our recruiting across our new affiliation models. Our strategic wealth Linsco and RIA new models all contributed collectively $3 billion in the first quarter, which is a high for those new models.
And so we believe that those sort of dynamics and optionality and flexibility within the model and our ability to continue to invest and enhance the appeal of it sets up for a good solid opportunity, if you will, as we move forward through 2022. The pipelines continue to grow in each one of those affiliation models. So, we’re encouraged by the opportunity as we go forward.
And look, even in a down market, if we get some extended down equity market, that typically works as a tailwind to recruiting as once you get sort of past that sort of initial stage of that more challenging market, and advisors have kind of acclimated to that, they’ll begin to pick up and use that time as an opportunity to look around and see how they strengthen their business strategically. So, if we do end up in some extended down market, those can be a tailwind. That’s how we see – that’s how we’re looking at it across the balance of the year. I hope that helps. Great. Thanks. And maybe just as a follow-up question. You were mentioning some of the new affiliation models. Maybe you could just talk a little bit about the new employee model? Just update us on how that’s progressing in terms of bringing on new advisors and assets? And to what extent could an acquisition make sense in that part of your business to be helpful in terms of accelerating your scale and presence in the marketplace there? Yes. It’s a good question. And look, that model is really builds a really interesting and differentiated space in the spectrum of different models that exist in the marketplace. And just the foundation of its value sort of leads to a hypothesis that, that has good, strong opportunity in front of it. We certainly have had to establish ourselves with a credible solution in the marketplace. And winning begets more winning. And I think we see momentum building as we’re doing that now in a variety of different geographical areas across the country and are really encouraged by how we think that model is positioned in the marketplace, its appeal. And now as we build our market share, it gives us even further kind of right to win credibility there.
So very encouraging trend. And you’re right, I think this is one of those places that you might use an acquisition strategically if you just wanted to accelerate or add momentum to this particular model. If you remember, it’s kind of how we started it with an acquisition of Allen & Co, which really gave us the initial foundation of learning and insight to try to build this model as appealing as we could make it and as differentiated. So, I think your hypothesis around could be complemented with M&A is certainly a logical place we would explore. Great. Thank you so much. Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Gerry O’Hara from Jefferies. Your line is open. Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just I guess staying on theme a little bit, but the financial institutions, it seems as though there’s been a cadence of perhaps one or two per year. Is there any sort of capacity constraint with respect to how many types of deals you can realistically expect to achieve in kind of a 12- to 18-month period, either from a staffing or just operational aspect of it all? Yes. I think when we originally started with these larger financial institution deals, admittedly, we had some things to learn and to in terms of both how you transition them into LPL and then how you support and help them acclimate, I’ll call it, in the first four to six months, which is a change management effort. And I think we had lots of room for improvement as we learned around our first rounds, and we use that data and those insights then to turn and create new solutions, new digital capabilities, new technology solutions to streamline things, better understanding about how to deploy human capital in order to support them.
And I think, presumably, not only will that help you get better at doing them in the second round, it also begins to help you drive efficiency and scalability into the overall effort. And so part of that is on-boarding them and how do we think about continuing to automate that to drive scalability into that. So, I would tell you, we’re learning into that, and we’ll get better and better at it, and we’ll automate it more and more. But I think it is reasonable to say there would always be some cap. I think we’ve got to continue to innovate first into that, and we’ve got room for improvement there.
I think the second thing is also just learning to operate at higher growth rates. And I don’t mean just in the initial transition. I mean how you support a higher growth rate on an ongoing basis. And I think this is where we see investments in our core operating platform, think service, compliance and operations and how we’re really exploring how do you digitize all of them to the extent that you can, and the scalability of the model really becomes interested not only in being able to facilitate those much higher growth rates on a sustainable basis, but also in the efficiency gains that you pull through it.
So, I think when we talk about these digital end-to-end investments in our core clearing function, those are great examples of where we see helping ourselves sustain higher growth rates are the longer period. I hope that helps, but that's a couple of areas where I think we think about how we improve and invest, position ourselves for the long-term for both higher growth rates and being able to bring in more [indiscernible]. Great. Yes, that is helpful. And that's it for me this afternoon. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Kyle Voigt from KBW. Your line is open. Hi, good evening. Give you a question on promotional expenses. If we exclude transition assistance I guess the 2Q guide would really not – would really imply not much change in that line versus the first and fourth quarter. Just wondering if you can quantify how much of the 2Q guide is attributable to those one-time on-boarding type costs that you cited? And really what I'm getting at is, is whether this kind of $45 million range for that promo expense excluding TA is a good new kind of run rate to think about moving forward. Because when I think, when we look back historically that that promo ex-TA was running around 25 to 30 pre-pandemic. So just getting a little bit more color there would be helpful? Yes, definitely. I mean, when you look at Q2 there's a couple things to highlight from a trend standpoint. And I think the first is really conference spend. So is a reminder, this year we're turning back to a more call it typical conference schedule for us, which means the majority of those expense will show up in Q1 and Q3. So we do expect lower conference expense in Q2, but I think the offset which I think you probed on in your question is really QA joining in the call, right? And the on-boarding expenses associated with a large financial institution in addition to the TA, but those actual on-boarding expenses show up and promotional, and they really peak in the quarter in which that institution joins. And then reminder [indiscernible] is the largest financial institution that world have had.
So you do have the typical TA growing not in rate, but I think in overall dollar amounts is our organic growth continues to grow or continues to increase. But I think probably the, the main thing it highlighted is the on-boarding expenses, which are non-recurring for that particular institution, right. If we continue to have more and more institutions we'll have more on-boarding expenses. But they are by their nature sort of non-recurring. And if you, we didn't included this quarter if you go – if you look at we put together last quarter, just looking at 2021 with M&T and BMO, those were about $15 million of those expenses for the year. And now when you look at this year, we have QA, which is kind of the size of those two institutions together, plus peoples, which is another call it five – 5 billion, 6 billion. So we've got even more coming this year and I think that might be the key to – from a model standpoint on your side. It's very helpful. Thank you. And then another question on expenses, you're kind of guiding towards core G&A growth in that high-single digit range this year. I guess in an even more favorable interest rate and revenue backdrop, would there be any reason why that growth rate would vary significantly from the current kind of guidance range of high-single digits? And also maybe if you could just discuss how you balance the tailwinds of an even more favorable macro environment between letting that kind of fall to the bottom line versus the opportunity to invest back more into the business? Yes definitely, and I think when you definitely going to address that, I think that, when you think about rates going up, I think about early in the cycle and I would expect us to let that benefit fall to the bottom line and fully improve our mark. And when I say early in the cycle, think the first 100 basis points or so, right. And once we get beyond that, I think we would consider making additional investments really with a focus on driving growth, but also while still resulting in an overall improvement in margin, right? So I think that's the balance we would have when we get deeper into cycle.
And I think the key for us is real, our capital allocation framework to drive the decisions and organic growth is first and foremost on that list. And the things that we would consider are new capabilities for advisors as an example. Further enhancements to the service experience. Investments in expanding the services portfolio that Dan talked about earlier that that all these things is due to dample that can really drive growth.
And then of course, beyond investing in the business, we would of course look at other uses for that capital outside the expense side, meaning M&A and returning capital to shareholders. So that's the framework we would use, and I think we're overall, I think we're positioned to really remain flexible and make those decisions at relevant time, meaning when those increases occur. Great. Thank you very much. Thank you. Next question or comment comes from the line of Michael Wong from Truist Securities. Your line is open. Hey, thanks for taking the question. Wanted to as maybe more of a high level question just on profitability kind of pre-cash so looking at Slide 14 in the gross profit ROA prior to client cash is sort of been coming down just a little bit here over the past couple years. And just wanted to get kind of a higher level thought on what could kind of turn that back the other way. Is it really just kind lapping some of these on-boarding and higher growth related expenses or there other structural things that that you expect that could be a benefit going forward? Yeah. And I think that the key on those trends is maybe just to highlight the changing – the nature of the revenues that are in there. And I think when you just think about gross profit growth overall, right before we get to ROAs, right? The things that are driving that up are going quite well, right? NNA overall has been increasing year-after-year, recruiting larger advisers. The financial institutions channel is expanding and growing. We've got positive mix shifts, whether it be brokerage to advisory and then within advisory into our centrally managed platforms and then some nice growth, I'm sure you saw, on the service and fee revenue.
So those are all things that are driving nice gross profit growth. When you look at it from an ROA standpoint, the challenge is they're not all asset-driven revenues, right? So it can get a little noisier. The adviser-driven fees, the services fees, transaction revenues, as an example, those don't move along with assets. So you get a little bit of noise there.
Another one that I think is really important is the large financial institutions. M&T, BMO, CUNA and People's, that gross profit ROA is dilutive to our overall averages because those institutions are much larger. Their gross profit ROAs for us are much lower. But the transition assistance and the expenses to support them are also lower. So they're margin accretive clients for us when you look at it from the lens of purely gross profit ROA, like I think – like you walked through very well just now. It's going to look like there's a decline when really the economics and the op margins are actually improving.
So I think that's the most relevant thing from my standpoint, when you see those trends, we're continuing to drive growth. We're just getting more and more diversified, both in the types of revenues that we have and the size of clients that we have that it looks like there's some compression there when it's really quite a positive story. That's really helpful color. I appreciate that and maybe as a follow-up, just as you've kind of move down the path and done more of these sort of different recruiting models. Are there any lessons learned sort of in terms of the structuring of the deals or the economics of the deals or are you getting better kind of incremental economics now than maybe earlier on with some of the initiatives? It would be helpful to hear anything about that. Yes, I think – sorry. So I think when you think about the overall economics of the different models and maybe building a little bit on what I was just talking about in the financial institutions, right there's different levels of services provided. So there's different – not only different levels of revenues, but also different levels of expenses to support it, and then the transition assistance to bring them on board. So I think about the overall returns for us is relatively similar as a baseline, then the more service and support we provide, the more those returns can go up. But I think the key is about the service and capabilities that we provide in those different points. Okay, thanks. I appreciate the color. Thank you. We have time for one final call. That call is from Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Hi, thanks for accommodating the follow up. Really appreciate it. Really a repeat customer. This is crazy. Go ahead. Well, now I get to ask the question I really wanted to ask, not on behalf of investors, but myself, which is on the buyback. And Matt heard you loud and clear about the second half and potentially some room for increasing or accelerating the buyback. I know you guys have a very transparent capital return algorithm. But just given the fact that you're running with excess liquidity today, you're already at that lower leverage bound, I was hoping you could speak to what level of buyback we could be contemplating in a higher rate environment relative to the $125 million a quarter you had done previously.
And given your stronger earnings power, is it reasonable to expect that it could even be above and beyond that run rate while still support – while still having ample free cash flow generation to support organic growth in the dividend? Yes. So I think – so it, of course, all depends on the opportunities we have to allocate capital, Steve, and how much eventually goes to buybacks. But I think maybe a couple of things, right? Just keep in mind, at least for the near term in Q2, with CUNA joining and the transition assistance getting paid in that quarter, that's going to be a meaningful use of cash in the near term to combine with the buybacks that we expect to be at a similar range for Q2.
But to your point on the second half of the year, I think to state the obvious, right? If rates go up in line with what the market expects, we're going to have additional capital to deploy. And I think to your point on the leverage range and being at the low end of the range, right, our objective would be to deploy that capital and to manage within that range. And I think where that capital goes is back to our framework, right? Organic growth first and foremost M&A second, and returning capital to shareholders third.
So it really just depends on the opportunities that are in front of us at that time. But I think if, in the scenario where the opportunities are primarily in share repurchases and the cash that we generate is going up, I would expect those share repurchases to go up, just all a matter of what the opportunities are, and we'll make our decisions at that time. That's great to hear. Thanks so much for accommodating the follow up. You bet. I’m showing no additional questions in the queue at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks. Thanks, everyone for taking the time to join us this afternoon. We really appreciate it. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Take care. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Arnold. Thank you, Justin and thanks to everyone for joining our call today. Over the past quarter, we remain focused on our mission of taking care of our advisers so they can take care of their performance. Amid persistent market volatility and geopolitical uncertainty, our advisers reinforce the value they provide to the clients by helping them navigate in times of uncertainty. In that spirit, I want to recognize our advisers for their continued care and dedication to their clients, especially when they need it most.
With respect to our performance, our second quarter business results led to solid financial outlook. At the same time, we continue to make progress on our strategic plan. I'll review both of these areas, starting with our second quarter business results.
In the quarter, total assets decreased to $1.1 trillion as continued solid organic growth was more than offset by lower equity markets. With respect to organic growth, the business continued to perform well despite market volatility. Second quarter net new assets were $37 billion which included $25 billion from CUNA and represented 13% annualized growth. These quarterly results contributed to a 10% organic growth rate for the past 12 months.
Looking at recruited assets, they were $44 billion in Q2, included $32 billion from CUNA. This brought our total recruited assets over the past 12 months to $84 billion which was up $4 billion from the same period a year ago. These results were driven by the ongoing enhancements to our model and our expanded addressable markets.
Looking at same-store sales, our advisers continue to focus on serving their clients and differentiating their solutions in the marketplace. And while market volatility led some clients to moderate activity in the quarter, periods of heightened uncertainty are often in the environments that reinforce the value of professional advice and with time and serve as a catalyst for advisers to grow their products.
With respect to retention, we continue to enhance the adviser experience through continued delivery of new capabilities and technology as well as the ongoing modernization of our service and operations. As a result, asset retention was approximately 98% in the second quarter and 98% over the past 12 months. Our second quarter business results led to solid financial outcomes of $2.24 of EPS prior to intangibles and acquisition, an increase of 21% from a year ago.
Let's now turn to the progress we made on our strategic plan. As a reminder, our long-term vision is to become the leader across the entire advisor-centered market which for us means being the best at empowering advisers and institutions to deliver great advice to their clients and to be great operators of their businesses. To bring this vision to life, we are providing the capabilities and solutions that help our advisers deliver personalized advice and planning experiences to their clients. At the same time, through human-driven technology-enabled solutions and expertise, we're supporting advisers in their efforts to be extraordinary business owners. Doing this well gives us a sustainable path to industry leadership across the adviser experience, organic growth and market share.
Now to execute on our strategy, we have organized our work into four strategic plays which I'll review in turn. Our first strategic play involves meeting advisers and institutions where they are in the evolution of the business by winning in our traditional markets while also leveraging new affiliation models to expand our addressable markets.
Our recruiting and traditional markets continued to be a source of growth in Q2 with approximately $9 billion in assets. We continued to increase our win rates and expand the depth and breadth of our pipeline, notwithstanding a broader slowdown in adviser movement over the past couple of quarters. Historically, during the initial stages of elevated market volatility, advisers often focus on supporting existing clients and may pause in making strategic decisions like switching firms. However, after advisers have acclimated to the conditions, they will often use times like this to consider new options for their practice, likely creating an opportunity for us from a recruiting standpoint.
With respect to our new affiliation models, strategic wealth, employee and our enhanced RIA offering, we recruited over $2 billion in assets in Q2 and believe we are well positioned to drive continued growth across all three models.
Second quarter saw a new high for recruited assets in our employee model as the value proposition for advisers has proven to be compelling. As a complement to our organic growth, we recently announced the acquisition of the Private Client Group business at Boenning and Scattergood which we will onboard to our employee model early next year. With respect to large financial institutions, we onboarded CUNA in May and we are on track to onboard People's United later this year. We continue to learn from each experience to use these findings to drive innovation that improves the transition to LPL and in turn helps make our offering even more appealing. As we look ahead, we expect to continue winning in this market as demand for our model grows.
Our second strategic play is focused on providing capabilities that help our advisers differentiate in the marketplace and drive efficiency in their practices. As a part of that focus, we continue to enhance ClientWorks, our core operating platform with the expansion of digitized workflows. For example, in the second quarter, we introduced enhancements to our Move Money solution which makes it easier and more automated for advisers to support deposits and withdrawals within client accounts. Separately, we also enhanced the client management workflow for advisory by integrating gold planning data into our Meeting Manager solution which facilitates more efficient preparation for and more value-added dialogue within client reviews. These enhancements help advisers operate more effectively and increase their scalability to serve more clients.
Let's next move to our third strategic play which is focused on creating an industry-leading service experience that delights advisers and their clients and in turn, helps drive adviser recruiting and retention. As a reminder, over the past two years, we have transformed our service model into an omnichannel client pyramid which includes voice, chat and digital support, thus giving advisers flexibility for when and how they access service. We continue to fine-tune this model to drive additional efficiency and an enhanced experience for advisers.
As part of the next phase of our transformation, we continue to expand and enrich our digital processing capabilities in order to provide greater flexibility, speed and accuracy for our advisers. Our transformation efforts are currently focused on four clearing functions, including money movement, account opening and account transfer which collectively drive the majority of our operational process. And while we remain early in these efforts, we are seeing solid progress as we are now processing millions of transactions for our advisers through the applications of robotics and AI. By expanding the automation of these critical processes, we continue to increase the scalability and efficiency of our platform while also enhancing the client experience.
Our fourth strategic play is focused on developing a services portfolio that helps advisers and institutions from thriving businesses and deliver comprehensive advice to their clients. In the second quarter, our subscription base ended the period at nearly 3,900 with sequential growth moderating slightly in the wake of macro volatility. As we work with advisers on existing services, we continue to identify new needs we can solve for on their behalf which is a catalyst for further innovation that expands the value proposition of our existing services and services opportunities for new services. One example relates to how former Waddell & Reed advisers utilized our Admin Solutions on an interim basis to help them during the onboarding process. And based on that insight, we created a set of solutions for shorter-term engagement with our services to solve for a specific need in time for advisers. And we are testing some of these with CUNA advisers as they transition to our platform.
Looking at our pipeline for the second half of the year, we have several services in pilot and other offerings in the incubation phase. And as we move forward, we remain focused on enhancing and expanding our services portfolio better support our advisers and drive growth.
In summary, in the second quarter, we continued to invest in the value proposition for advisers and their clients while driving growth and increasing our market leadership. As we look ahead, we remain focused on executing our strategy to help our advisers further differentiate and win in the marketplace and as a result, drive long-term shareholder value.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt. All right. Thank you, Dan and I'm glad to speak with everyone on today's call. In the second quarter, we remain focused on serving our advisers, growing our business and delivering shareholder value. Against the volatile market background, we delivered another quarter of solid net new assets and earnings growth.
In addition, we progressed the work to enhance our suite program utilizing free credits to create the client cash account. Substantially completed the integration of Waddell & Reed, signed an agreement to acquire Boenning and Scattergood, onboarded CUNA and are preparing to onboard People's United. So as we look ahead, we continue to be excited by the opportunities to help our advisers differentiate and win in the marketplace.
Now, let's turn to our second quarter business results. Total advisory and brokerage assets were $1.1 trillion, down 8% from Q1 as continued organic growth was more than offset by lower equity markets. Total net new assets were $37 billion or a 13% annualized growth rate.
Looking more closely at recruiting, Q2 recruited assets were the strongest in our history at $44 billion which included $32 million from CUNA. These results brought our 12-month total to $84 billion.
Now, let's turn to our Q2 financials. The combination of organic growth, rising interest rates, higher client cash balances and expense discipline led to EPS prior to intangibles and acquisition costs of $2.24. This was up 21% from a year ago and is the highest in our history.
Looking at our top line growth, gross profit reached a new high of $711 million, up $42 million or 6% sequentially. Looking at the components, commission and advisory fees net of payout were $205 million, down $22 million from Q1. The decrease was primarily driven by the seasonal increase in production bonuses and lower advisory fees following the Q1 equity market decline. In Q2, our payout rate was 87%, up about 90 basis points from Q1 due to typical seasonality. Looking ahead to Q3, we anticipate our payout rate will increase to roughly 88%, driven by the typical seasonal build in the production bonus as well as the onboarding of CUNA.
Moving on to asset-based revenues. Sponsor revenue was $208 million in Q2, down $4 million sequentially as average assets decreased during the quarter, driven by lower equity. This was partially offset by an $8 million payment from a sponsor related to higher period activity.
Turning to client cash revenue, it was $156 million, up $71 million from Q1. This was driven by higher client cash balance as well as higher average short-term interest rates. Looking at overall client cash balances, they were up in the period, ending the quarter at $70 billion. Within our ICA portfolio, we added capacity in Q2 as we saw further improvements in bank deposit demand, leading to an increase in balances of $8 billion, of which $3 billion are fixed rate and $5 billion are floating rate.
Looking more closely at our ICA yield, it was 134 basis points in Q2, up 32 basis points from Q1, primarily driven by the increase in the fed funds rate during the quarter. As we look ahead to Q3, we expect our ICA yield to continue to increase. Based on where interest rates are today and our historical data, we expect our Q3 ICA yield to increase to approximately 195 basis points.
Before moving on, I want to highlight that we updated our reporting of client cash balances. As we prepare for the introduction of the client cash account as our primary suite overflow vehicle, we have updated our cash reporting to include these balances. In addition, purchased money market fund balances have been relocated to the endnotes of our release. The historical data reflecting these changes is available in our historical information file.
Now, let's turn to service and fee revenue which in Q2 was $113 million, unchanged from Q1. Within our services group, we ended the quarter with nearly 3,900 subscriptions which is up about 300 from last quarter. Our services group now generates roughly $32 million of annual revenue, while also contributing to organic growth by helping drive recruiting, same-store sales and retention. Looking ahead to Q3, we expect service and fee revenue to increase by roughly $10 million sequentially, driven by revenues from our National Adviser Conference and IRA.
Moving on to Q2 transaction, it was $44 million, down $2 million sequentially due to decreased trading volume. As we look ahead to Q3, volumes in July have seasonally declined which on a run rate basis would result in a decline in transaction revenue of around $10 million from Q2.
Now let's turn to expenses, starting with core G&A. It was $286 million in Q2. Looking ahead, we plan to stay disciplined on expenses while continuing to invest to drive growth. Given the increase in interest rates to date, including the rate hike last week, we are poised to generate significant additional capital. Our framework for allocating this capital remains aligned with the returns we generate which first and foremost, is investments to drive and support organic growth. Now that we are deeper into the rate cycle, we plan to accelerate some of these investments and anticipate up to $20 million of additional core G&A in 2022. This increases our 2022 core G&A outlook to a range of $1.170 billion to $1.195 billion.
Moving on to Q2 promotional expense, it was $84 million, down $4 million sequentially, primarily driven by lower conference expenses. Looking ahead to Q3, we expect promotional expense will increase to approximately $105 million, primarily driven by conference spend as we hosted our largest adviser conference of the year last week which returned to an in-person format for the first time in three years.
Now, let's move to Waddell and Reed. In total, we onboarded over $70 billion as 99% of client assets joined our platform. We generated EBITDA of roughly $21 million in Q2 or $85 million on an annualized basis. At the end of the quarter, the run rate EBITDA benefit was approximately $100 million, bringing our estimated purchase multiple to 4.5x. As we have now substantially completed the integration, going forward, we will no longer break out their stand-alone results.
Turning to depreciation and amortization, it was $48 million in Q2, up $3 million sequentially. Looking ahead to Q3, we expect depreciation and amortization to increase by up to $5 million sequentially. As for interest expense, it was $29 million in Q2, up $2 million sequentially, as higher LIBOR rates increased the cost of our floating debt. Looking ahead to Q3, we expect interest expense to increase to approximately $33 million, primarily driven by the increase in LIBOR.
Moving on to capital management. Our balance sheet remained strong in Q2, with a leverage ratio at 2.1x and corporate cash of $241 million. As for capital deployment, our framework remains focused on allocating capital aligned with the returns we get, investing in organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A where appropriate and returning excess capital to shareholders. In Q2, we allocated capital to both organic growth and share repurchases, buying back $50 million of shares. As we look ahead to Q3, given our improved level of cash generation, we plan to increase share repurchases to approximately $75 million.
In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results. As we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue investing to serve our advisers, grow our business and create long-term shareholder value.
With that, operator, please open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. So Matt, maybe we’ll just start off with some of the cash sweep dynamics. In one of the slides you guys referenced that the deposit betas on subsequent hikes beyond 100 basis points or running a little bit lower than what you experienced, I guess, in the last cycle. I guess just curious to get your thoughts on why that is. Is it just the pace of rate hikes has been too fast and we’re going to likely play a little bit of a catch-up? Or do you think there’s a reason to believe that, that’s more sustainable? And maybe just as a follow-up to that, would love a comment on appetite for additional fixed duration as we saw you guys have done in the quarter? Sure, Alex. I think the -- maybe the operative point on that slide, the primary point on that slide is the betas in the prior cycle. I think we are just given how much cash is in the system, it's not a surprise to me that the betas so far have been a little bit better but I would just emphasize a little bit. So I think the center of gravity and where pricing in the product is probably in the zone of last time which just highlights it's not really a rate-sensitive product.
On your second question on fixed, right? I think our objective and goals here remain the same that I think you've heard for quite some time which is to get into a range of 50% to 75% of the portfolio on the fixed rate side. And I think the primary driver on our ability to do that is really demand coming back. So if you look at where we ended the quarter even though we added some fixed rates because of the growth that we had, we're at about 25% of the portfolio. And I think what -- when you think about the demand that came back in the market, it's really starting to build up quite well with us being able to add $8 billion of balances in the quarter, there was more demand on the variable rate side, right?
So about $5 billion of that came on the variable rate side. But the $3 billion on the fixed rate side, that was the most that we put in place in quite some time, probably since the pandemic began. So I think it's encouraging to see. And as we look ahead, it's going to be really about is the additional demand on the fixed rate side there. And the environment, I think, is conducive in general to that, whether it's the fed continuing to raise rates or probably more importantly, shrinking their balance sheet and taking cash out of the system to the consumer side where consumer spending remains healthy, loan balances are growing. Those are all things that ultimately would lead to sweep demand overall and then ultimately, I think, some fixed rate management. Great. And just maybe for my second question around organic growth. Obviously and again, perhaps not surprisingly, with more volatility, we’ve seen moderation in organic growth across the industry in terms of just net new assets. As you were to unpack that a bit and think about sort of the slightly lower run rate ex the larger transactions that we’ve seen from you guys, how much of that is coming from just slower same-store sales versus lower recruiting versus some retention dynamics? Just would love to get a little more color on that as we think on the forward organic growth rate opportunity for the firm as a whole. I'll take that one, Alex. And look, I think if you look at the quarter more closely, right, we saw solid new store activities. And if you look across our traditional markets, the new models ex the large institution, you saw a good robust activity with some slowing relative to prior quarters in new store sales as we believe more to do with just that macro backdrop as we talked about. And I think, as advisers pivot through that and get a bit more estimated to that environment and then begin to look forward, again, these types of conditions are usually an opportunity for us as we believe there will be more demand, if you will, to explore looking at more options and alternatives. And so, I think you’ve seen just a little sluggish in news for sales which is more backed up with the environment. The retention levels have remained as we pointed out, that 2% range in the past year to two years, we feel good about where that is and that’s at the lower end of kind of our target range. And so I haven’t seen much variability there through the period.
And then, same-store sales is where you see most of the headwind. Of course, this quarter, you have the April dynamic of tax payments that are a headwind on April. And then you saw the equity market volatile and moved down much of the quarter. We saw a real sluggishness in April. And we saw some same-store sales be back up in May slightly with the market and then June, it returned to a headwind. At our conference last week, I think in the dialogue with advisers, you’re beginning to hear those advisers get to a place, I think, in this period where they’re beginning to see more growth opportunities as they work through this period of volatility.
And I think that’s logical and normal as they see more opportunity to serve new clients who may not being served as well by other advisers. And that ends up being quite frankly, a stimulus and a structural opportunity to demonstrate value to differentiate when required. So a headwind in the second quarter, I do think that structurally speaking, we still see good opportunity as we go forward on same-store sales. But that’s the biggest headwind in the short. Let me pause there. I hope that helps. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. First off, I just wanted to unpack a recent announcement that you guys made in hiring Bill Sappington. And I was hoping you could just speak to the decision around the new hire. It certainly sends a strong signal that you guys are focused on growing some of your banking and lending solutions. It is a sizable revenue opportunity. It’s one that many of your peers have pursued. But just wanted to get a sense if you could help us frame the long-term revenue opportunity here, especially since your advisers haven’t historically been strong users of that lending product. Yes. This is Dan. Look, from a strategic standpoint, we're trying to, I think, solve for two opportunities. One, we hear our advisers with the appetite to broaden their value to their clients and provide more of what I might call a holistic approach to that overall advice spectrum. And so it's logical that we would think about bringing lending capabilities, cash management solutions and integrate those in as part of the client experience and to create those products and solutions to add value to the clients. And then, if you -- by solving that, you create economics around that and that certainly is appealing from a strategic standpoint. So that's really what we're solving for. I think what we did was go out to the marketplace and say, ""Hey, if we're going to do this right, let's go get the experience and the insight and the leadership to do that. We have been experimenting for a short period of time and just learning enough about it to probably ask smart questions and better identify where our opportunities were and then bring that leadership in to help us go operationalize and execute on that concept; so that's what we're doing.
We think there's interesting possibilities to do that through good third-party partnerships that have tight integrations into the overall client experience and thus deliver compelling solutions to the end client via those advisers. So I hope that helps. That's our strategy. Great. And just for my follow-up, maybe just unpacking some of the rate commentary that you made earlier, Matt. Two things I wanted to clarify. First, have you seen any change in client behavior in July in terms of cash allocations? How much of that cash, if any, has gone back into the market? And secondarily, you gave a lot of helpful color around fixed rate contracts. I noted that you had termed out some in the quarter. I’m just trying to gauge your sense of urgency there because the forward curve is pricing in cuts for next year. And there is some concern that if you still are running with a significant amount of floating rate ICA that the downside risk on cash sweep fees could be more acute if we do enter another easing patch. Yes. I'll take the second one first, Steve. I think that what I'd emphasize on the fixed rate side is we're below our target range, right? So I think from our perspective, if there's availability in the marketplace for fixed rate, we're interested in doing that. And I think what's encouraging, as I said, Alex, right, having the ability to add $3 billion just this quarter is really the most amount we've been able to do in a quarter since the pandemic. So I think it's encouraging. But our perspective, I think, is in line with the premise of your question that we'd like to increase fixed rates from here. It's just all about whether it's available in the market.
Now with respect to your first question, so balances in July. I think when you look at what you would typically see in the first month of the quarter, I'd just remind you that advisory fees are primarily charged or the -- or month one is the biggest month of the quarter. So that typically would reduce cash. But I think that was offset by the continued organic growth that we have as well as the volatility, at least in the first half of July. So those two things kind of netted off. And I'd say July cash balances were relatively flat. But I'd add that the mix improved, meaning we saw further demand or capacity on the ICA side. So ICA balances actually went up while the money market overflow went down.
And maybe just to complete the July update, even though you didn't ask it, just give a little bit of color on the M&A front which has those same dynamics of advisory fees in the first month of the quarter as well as that choppy macro. And I think when you factor those things in July, it's looking like something that you would expect in that environment which is organic growth, call it, in the 4% zone. And that is prior to any additional CUNA onboarding which we have about $5 billion to go on the direct side of CUNA. So I hope that helps to give you a little [indiscernible]. And our next question comes from Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Great. Just had a question on expenses. As we think about the moving pieces for this year but also into ‘23, I know probably to get any sort of guidance there. But I saw you increase the core G&A growth expense guidance here for ‘22, I think that implies around 10.5% growth to 13% growth for this year. So I guess, would you be surprised that, that level of growth persisted 13% growth for this year. So I guess, would you be surprised at that level of growth persisted into ‘23? And just any sort of help on the moving pieces as we kind of build our models out to ‘23 here just in terms of some of the moving pieces around expenses that are coming in to the run rate this year from some of the acquisitions as well as the large mandate wins and initiatives that you have going on, just in terms of helping us with the run rate impact as we think about a full year impact in ‘23? But at the same time, I imagine there are some synergies and some expenses that will be falling out. So just any help there would be appreciated. Yes, sure, of course. I mean I think the key thing, I'll just start with the driver of the increase and specifically, where we are in the interest rate cycle. And I think you probably recall in the past few quarters, we talked about the economics of interest rates going up and our perspective on that which is really for that first 100 basis points or so increase that the benefits of that really having that fall to the bottom line and improve upon. And once we got beyond that, really looking to our capital allocation framework to drive those decisions. And sitting here now well above 100 basis points, I think we feel well positioned to really allocate capital across all three of our primary areas, including what you're asking about on the expense front.
And I think when we look at how and where to allocate that, we do focus, first and foremost, on investments to really drive and support organic growth. And the investments that we've identified to accelerate into this year, that $20 million are really focused on that in areas that -- where we typically spend, like technology, capabilities, serving and supporting our advisers. We see opportunities in M&A. The Boenning and Scattergood is a good example of that, that we recently signed. And then, of course, returning capital to shareholders. And as I highlighted in the prepared remarks, we plan to increase our buyback to $75 million, up from $50 million in this quarter.
Now to your question about next year, right? I think what we'll do is really share our thinking on next year when we typically do which is when we get closer to the end of this year. But I'd just emphasize, we'll continue to apply our capital allocation framework to really drive how and where we allocate that capital. Really focused on making sure we remain flexible and can make decisions really at that time. So we'll give you an update then.
And I would just highlight from a share repurchase standpoint with the $75 million planned for next quarter, we are getting close to completing our current authorization. So that's something that will naturally work to refresh with a new one and we'll also give you an update after we do that as well. Okay. And maybe just on the capital management front, the $75 million of buybacks you mentioned for the next quarter, should we expect that pace to be sort of sustained into the fourth quarter and beyond? How are you thinking about that? And then just more broadly on M&A, clearly, you saw the transaction announced in the quarter. I think it was an employee model. So I guess where else might M&A be additive to the platform at this point? And what sort of properties are you seeing out there? And how much time are you guys spending on that? Yes. I mean I think on the M&A front, all about anything that can accelerate our strategy, whether it's -- when you look at the different types of M&A that we've done from our traditional markets to helping advance our entry into the new market on the technology side in advancing capabilities that we otherwise would have had to build. So, I think it goes -- all goes back to our strategy and whether it can advance that or not. And of course, if it’s price that makes financial sense. And if it’s a growth acquisition of operation, we’re in a position to be able to bring it on to it. So I think that perspective is really that we’ve had for a while is really the same.
On share repurchases, I’d just go back to what I said at answering the prior question, it’s really about our framework and what the opportunities are to allocate capital. I think with where interest rates are, we do expect to have more capital to allocate and we’ll be focused then on the opportunities we see on organic growth and M&A and returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases. So just depending on what the opportunities look like but if share repurchases make sense, we would allocate capital there. We’ll just have to see what it looks like at the time. And our next question comes from Brennan Hawken from UBS. I’d like to start with a follow-up to Steven and Alex’s questions. So the floating rate ICA contracts, they’re still being done at flat to fed funds. Matt, you indicated that demand was improving and we certainly saw that on the volume side this quarter. But when do you think that, that demand is going to translate into price as well, thinking back to the historical premium to fed fund rate that you typically get on the floating rate? Sure, Brennan. I mean, I think -- remember, I think we'll back when it peaked, right? We -- I think the Fed funds -- the variable contracts were in the Fed funds of maybe plus 20 plus 25. And I think that was at the peak, right? So where we are now with just the amount of demand and volume, I would just emphasize was a big, big positive in the quarter. And moving from contracts that were Fed funds through Fed funds minus a couple of basis points to now starting to get some that are Fed funds plus even in the 5% range or so. It's been a pretty quick improvement. So it's hard to know if that trend continues. I just will say when you look at the marketplace and the factors that would drive demand just continue to be. So it would not surprise me from a balance standpoint if demand continued to increase.
And whether the spreads go from the 5-ish [ph] zone that we just saw up to that 20%, 25% that we saw at the peak, that's harder to know but keep in mind with Fed funds at 225 to 250 [ph], the spread that we're talking about is a relatively small piece of the overall amount. Sure, sure. And I didn’t realize that you are seeing some small improvements in price. So that’s certainly encouraging and it makes sense. On the other asset-based fees, Matt, I believe you flagged an $8 million payment related to prior period activity. Should we consider that to be onetime in nature? Or is there a reason why that might be recurring? Yes. Its prior period related, so not recurring. And our next question comes from Devin Ryan from JMP Securities. First question, I just want to dig in a little bit more around if we can get some more flavor on just the pool of advisers in motion today. And what you're seeing both there and you touched a little bit, Matt, on kind of M&A properties. But just how that's been evolving in the current backdrop, if there's any affiliation model that people are gravitating to in this environment? And then whether in terms of just the strategy, whether people are seeking LPL out or if you're kind of aggressively proactively going after either M&A targets or recruiting. So we're hearing kind of two sides in the market. I know some people are having a lot of success as you are some aren't seeing much at all. So just love to get a little flavor for that. Yes, Devin, let me take a stab at that and a couple of questions in there. If I don't get it all, please just circle back. So I think with respect to the opportunity set, I think you've heard us talked about for the good past year, there's been slower movement or less movement, if you will, than historical norms in the overall marketplace. And we've continued to expand our participation rate and grow our share during that period of time. And I think that's probably reflective of the second quarter as well that we just saw and we are very proactive in the marketplace across all different models, affiliation models in terms of making sure that we create awareness for the solutions that we have, the sort of horizontal expansion we've gone on with this multiple affiliation models. We want to make sure that people are aware of the different solutions and problems that we can help them solve for.
And certainly, our ongoing investment in the vertical integration of our capabilities is making the model more and more appealing to advisers again in all different segments. And so we want to make sure that people are aware of that capability set within the base of innovation and the change that's going on. And the team has done a really good job, I think, of creating structure and using data and insights to go to the market in a smart way and a crisp way to tell that story in a consistent way. And so, we're very intentional about trying to be good at attracting new advisers and very intentional about constantly working on how can we improve and get better at that. So I think this combination of the capabilities that we've built matched with the growing efficacy of our ability to recruit is leading to that sort of consistent up and to the right kind of results related to our sales.
And again, we see a really strong pipeline, notwithstanding what's going on in the marketplace, all of our models that is very encouraging. I think that the employee base solution that we have still retains the independent principles. We're seeing continuing to really resonate out in the marketplace as more and more people become aware of it, we understand the combination of value they get of preserving sort of that principles and most appealing attributes of the independent model. We think that's very interesting growth cost. I hope that helps. That's helpful. Maybe just a quick follow-up here on the services business. And you mentioned there's some new services in pilot and incubation at the moment. I'm not sure if you can give any more detail on what those might look like or what buckets they fit into? And then, if you think about kind of the bigger picture as you continue to scale, is there room for pricing uplift, as it sounds like a lot of the advisers are getting a lot of value out of it and maybe arguably in underpricing some of the services. Or really, is it just more about the differentiation of that platform? And so it just helps growth and stickiness. Just love to get more color as kind of the longer-term vision. Yes, it's a good question. And look, strategically, the hypothesis was, hey, there's real problems and challenges to help these advisers better operate their businesses that we could solve for in a more effective way and in a cheaper rate for them thus creating real alternatives and real appeal. And then, if you can then integrate them from an automation and a technology statement when I take the service human center investment technology around it, well, that would be a great way to not only create scalability and efficiency in the overall delivery of those services, i.e., do them for a lower cost but then again, improve and enhance the value of it. So, I think that's the journey we're on. That's the journey we're on with the first generation of solutions that we offer to the marketplace. I think Audette [ph], CFO, marketing as the professional services that started with.
I think we continue to refine them and improve and enhance them that will give us potential pricing power in certain of those solutions and services or they continues to innovate on how you offer them to the marketplace and it could be that you turn those that holistic sort of CFO solution into different discrete solutions, think about bookkeeping there's a derivative effect that might have a lower price point but solved for unique need within the old CFO scope. And so there's another number of iterations that we can take to create product expansion that have different price points that actually make it more accessible and easier for us to serve a broader set of advisers. So you’ve got both dynamics. It’s product innovation needs, different positioning in the marketplace that will drive price points. And to your point, if you create more value, then you can also charge more historically consistent but valuable existing service. So I think all of those spectrum possibilities are there for us. We are heavily into the innovation and trying to learn and understand what problems or challenges we’re hearing from advisers and then how we can turn that into a service.
You mentioned some things that are in the incubation phase in or what I might call, pilot based -- bookkeeping is one of those that we think will be an interesting opportunity that we’ll go to market later this year on and then we’ve got another probably five or six that are in that incubation phase that would then logically would move to a pilot. I hope that helps. And our next question comes from Gerald O'Hara from Jefferies. Maybe just sticking with the business solutions for a moment. Can you maybe give us a little bit of color or context around kind of the stickiness of the subscriptions and what those kind of renewal terms look like or how long the contracts are? Or anything to just give us some insight as to the longer-term kind of opportunity there? Yes. So there's a variety of different solutions and services that are offered, right? So you have the professional services that I mentioned before, adding the CFO marketing business strategy, then you have some business solutions that we've created that are more like M&A solutions, our assurance plan, remote office, resilience plan and even now paraplanning as a solution. And so they're slightly different in the values that they create and they're slightly different than how an adviser may use them. And so they're distinctively different than they have when you think about contracts and things of that nature. But if you take the professional services, generally speaking, that's a one year contract to start that typically speaking, we have done that as a way to present it to the marketplace to make sure that it's not a longer-term commitment as people got acclimated service, understood whether the added value to them or not but then gave us enough time, i.e., a year to make sure that they hadn't informed you and had used it enough to really understand whether it created value for them or not.
And I think you have high retention rates on those different types of services. We're also though learning into the marketplace, as I said in my remarks. We saw some advisers that moved over from Waddell & Reed on our admin services that used those for a shorter time frame, I think their intent was to say, ""Hey, I just want these to help me transition over to LPL. So their vision was just one term on that contract and then ultimately would find a different long-term solution. So that's a good learning for us and an opportunity to innovate around that and create a different type of solution or shorter-term specific need in time. There might have a higher price associated with it but still create that value that they need for that short period of time. So that was a good example in learning where you might have had higher attrition rates on the surface of the admin services for that period of time but it was more related to how they were using the service, then it's satisfactory.
So again, I think as we innovate on these portfolio and we offer them to the marketplace, we're seeing how people use them in different ways, it's a good learning experience and evolution for us in terms of making sure we fine-tune the value and that we -- they're well positioned in the marketplace to meet those specific needs of the advisers that are looking for help. So net out is, I think, high retention rates. And again, our opportunity is to continue to create awareness and to make sure that we expand that portfolio, so that we reach more advisers with a variety of different solutions that they need. And we think that there's a significant amount of value to be added. It also creates great stickiness and around that overall relationship with us and also has a residual knock-on effect of improving and enhancing the overall performance of the practice only high tailwind to same-store sales and higher retention rates that come along with those additional services as part of the relationship and even help us with new store sales as a differentiated more appealing model. Okay, that's helpful. And then as a follow-up, I think around -- about this time last year, you kind of gave some color with respect to the RIA relaunch and sort of how that strategy was coming along, I guess, the sort of early days, maybe encouraging pipeline comments along those lines. But I think you also ended by saying you kind of need to go out and sell it. So hoping you might be able to give us a little bit of an update as to how that's coming along. Yes, good question. And I think we -- that was like a year ago, we kind of relaunched, if you will, or went to the marketplace in a more offensive posture relative to our RIA offering. And we continue to go to the marketplace, looking for those opportunities for folks to leverage us as a vertically integrated strategic partner that are RIAs only. We continue to add capabilities and pricing that we believe is competitive and compelling and you’re seeing that show up in the recruiting that we’ve had over the past 12 months. That said, I think there’s more that we can do and more opportunity and more -- we can be more intentional about how we go to the market and really establish ourselves as a differentiated strategic partner and a value-added partner and not just a custodian to RIAs. And so we have more to play there that you’ll hear more about in the coming quarters. And our next question comes from Kyle Voigt from KBW. Maybe a follow-up question on capital management. Your current leverage ratio is roughly 2.1x which is towards the bottom end of your range, your targeted range. I guess when you consider that ratio is calculated using LTM at the rate sensitivity you’ve disclosed, it’s relatively easy to see how that leverage ratio can very quickly move below 1.5x without down any debt and still investing significantly in the business. I guess, how do you view your optimal leverage ratio in a period with rapidly growing EBITDA? And I guess, would you be willing to kind of let this trend significantly below your target as we look out this year? Yes, Kyle. I think we're just starting with the range. I think the 2% to 2.75%, we think, is the right range to operate in. And it does a handful of things. But I think the balance sheet strength is key in supportive of recruiting and supporting our advisers that are with us. It's really, really important. And I think in addition to that, positioning us to have flexibility to deploy capital based on the opportunities that we see including M&A, investments in organic growth are important as well. And I think to the point of your question, I think as we get deeper into the interest rate cycle or even where we are right now, I think we feel comfortable and like being positioned on the lower end of that range as the interest rates get higher and higher and the amount of EBITDA that's driven by that -- by those economics is a larger percentage of it.
I think if we end up dropping below the low end of that range and maybe I wouldn't say significantly to your question but maybe by a small amount for a short period of time, I think that's okay. I think our center of gravity and focus is being really deliberate and thoughtful about not only where we allocate that capital but when we allocate that capital. So I think that's our perspective. Overall, we want to allocate that capital to drive value and I think we feel good we're positioned today. Understood. And as a follow-up on client cash, I appreciate the commentary on July but just a question on the idea of potential sorting and adviser behavior around client cash. Are you seeing any incremental signs of more yield-seeking behavior whether that’s demand for money -- treasury or short duration fixed income instruments? And given that we’ve just gotten the most recent [indiscernible] week and obviously acknowledging that’s a very small size. Just wondering if there’s been any change in behavior you’ve seen that’s been notable? Yes. I think I got your question, Kyle, it's breaking up there. But I think when you look at the right sensitivity of our cash and has anything changed? I think the answer is no. And I think just maybe a couple of reminders of the cash that we have in sweep on our business is largely operational. And that's why we tend to have some of the lowest cash as a percent of AUM in the industry where it's usually in the 5% zone. And the primary factor that tends to move that up and down is really market sentiment as opposed to rate-seeking behavior. And I think when you look at just the last couple of quarters and especially this quarter, I think you're seeing that play out. Just looking at Q2 as interest rates have gone up meaningfully during the quarter, our cash balances actually grew both in dollars and as a percent of AUM, up to 6.5% just given the volatility that you saw in the quarter.
So, I think the cash tends to be operational and even looking back at Q1, the last couple of quarters, I think you’re seeing empirical data that really validates that the cash -- the rate-seeking behavior is really not on the cash that we have. And our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler from Bank of America. I wanted to come back to the pure RIA channel which you just relaunched a little more than a year ago. Can you provide us an update on how this channel is doing? And I was also interested in how the competitive landscape is evolving with both the merger of two of the biggest RIA custodians and also some changes to the macro backdrop year-to-date? Yes. So I think with respect to the RIA business, look, the last two quarters, you've seen our affiliation models collectively, we've recruited in each of those quarters, a little over $2 billion in assets. And certainly, the RIA solution is a significant contributor to that. So again, we're seeing good traction with our offering in the marketplace today. As I shared with you, though, we see the opportunity to be a more significant vertically integrated strategic partner than just a custodian. And so that's one of the things that we're trying to be intentional about both in terms of how we think about our offering, our pricing and even potentially our branding of that offering. And so there's more to play out there that you'll hear more about as we go forward. But we do see the opportunity, given the size of that market to continue to win share there.
I do think with the consolidation of two large custodians, that creates disruption or some potential change in the marketplace. And usually, where there's change, if they're well prepared, chance favors to prepare and you can capitalize on that opportunity. And so I think we certainly see that as one of the possibilities and opportunities amongst a number to win share as we go forward. So, I hope that helps give you a little bit more color and context on the opportunity we see and how we're trying to be intentional about capitalizing. And I wanted to do my follow-up on the bank channel. So two big wins last year to this year with both CUNA and People’s United coming shortly. What’s the potential for additional bank channel wins? Can you keep the streak of two wins per year alive next year? And also, is the macro backdrop making it a little tougher to find the next win in just with banks focusing more internally right now? Yes, good question. And so look, as we go forward, our pipeline continues to build across a larger spectrum of financial institutional clients. So I think it's that typical momentum where you have some success, you continue to iterate and all of your value proposition and that tends to create more dialogue and more opportunity. So we certainly see that demand picking up. And one of the biggest hurdles is just the whole onboarding change in a transition process. We continue to learn and apply those insights and new innovations, I'd like to say now make our onboarding and transition process, a differentiated capability. And that's one of the things that we saw as a big opportunity to reduce one of the barriers, if you will, of making that transition and the change. And so, we think that the track record of steady wins, the ongoing evolution and a feel of our model, smooth transitions is increasingly making us confident in the durability of this -- of the growth in this channel. So that maybe answers your first question.
Your second question around the banks and their interest and their willingness to have this dialogue. Now I think the significant opportunity we have to add value across sort of a spectrum of economics needs risk management, needs operational efficiency, needs potential growth in their programs, notwithstanding the market volatility. There’s a lot of reasons to have a dialogue and a discussion. And again, we see those opportunities to explore those possibilities continuing to evolve in a constructive well. So macro hasn’t really altered the trajectory of this. And I am showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dan Arnold for closing remarks. I’d just like to thank everyone for taking the time to join us this afternoon and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Have a great day. Thank you.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Arnold. Thank you, Amy. And thanks to everyone for joining our call. Over the past quarter, amid persistent market volatility, our advisors continued to be a source of support and guidance for their clients by helping them navigate uncertainty. This commitment to their clients underscores the importance of our work on our mission, taking care of our advisors so they can take care of their clients.
With respect to our performance, third quarter was marked resilient business results which drove solid financial out, as well as continued progress on our strategic plan. I'll review both of these areas, starting with our third quarter business.
In the third quarter, total assets decreased to $1.1 trillion as continued solid organic growth was more than offset by lower equity. With respect to organic growth, the business continued to perform well despite market volatility. Third quarter net new assets were $20 billion, representing 7% annualized just contributed to net new assets over the past 12 months of $101 billion, representing 9% organic revenue.
Looking at recruited assets, they were $13 billion in Q3, bringing our total recruited assets over the past 12 months to $84 billion. These results were driven by the on-going enhancements to our model and our expanded addressable markets. Looking at same-store sales, against the backdrop of continued market volatility, our advisors remained focused on serving their clients and delivering a differentiated experience. As a result, our advisors are both winning new clients and expanding wallet share with this combination with existing market, combination which drove improvement in same-store sales in the third quarter.
With respect to retention, we continue to enhance the advisor experience through the continued delivery of new capabilities and technology, as well as the on-going modernization of our service and operations. As a result, asset retention was approximately 98% in the third quarter, and 98% over the past 12-months.
Our third quarter business results lead to solid financial outcomes of $3.13 of EPS prior to intangibles and acquisition costs, an increase of 77% from a year ago.
Let's now turn to the progress we made on our strategic plan. As a reminder, our long-term vision has become the leader across the entire advisor center market, which for us, means being the best at empowering advisors and institutions to deliver great advice to their clients and to be great operators of their businesses.
For bringing this vision to life, we're providing the capabilities and solutions that help our advisors deliver personalized advice and planning experiences to their clients, at the same time through human driven technology enabled solutions and expertise, we are supporting advisors in their efforts, the extraordinary business owners. Doing this well gives us a sustainable path to industry leadership across the advisory experience organic growth, and market share.
Now to execute on our strategy, we've organized our work into four strategic planning plays, which I'll review in turn. Our first strategic play involves meeting advisors and institutions where they are in the evolution of their businesses, by winning in our traditional markets, while also leveraging new affiliation models, which expand our adjustable model.
A recruiting in traditional markets continued to be a source of growth in Q3, with approximately $6 billion in assets. We continue to increase our win rates and expand the depth and breadth of our pipeline, despite advisor movement in the industry remaining at lower levels.
Following several quarters of elevated market volatility, advisors are acclimating to the conditions and increasingly exploring new strategic alternatives for their practice. This creates a more favorable scenario for us as market driven headwinds give way to the structural strength per model. This should result in a solid finish to the year from a recruiting team.
With respect to our new affiliation models, strategic wealth, employees and our enhanced RIA offering, we recruited over $2 billion in assets in the quarter and believe we are well positioned to drive continued growth across all three models.
With respect to large financial institutions, over the past two quarters, we onboarded two new clients, CUNA and People's United. We continue to learn from each experience and use these findings to drive innovation that improves the transition to LTL, and in turn, helps make our offering even more appealing. As we look ahead, we continue to see our pipeline build as demand for our model grows.
Our second strategic play is focused on providing capabilities that help our advisors differentiate in the marketplace and drive efficiency in the practices. A particular area of focus is helping our advisors create a digital experience for their clients. It's personalized for their practice. As an example, this quarter we extended the flexibility our advisors have and how they utilize their brand, and the optionality of the content and features they present to their clients.
In addition, we're always looking for opportunities to arm our advisors and in clients with expanded tools, products and services to navigate markets. To that end, we continue to build out our research capabilities in terms of content and subject matter expertise. We've also increased our focus on certain products like annuities and alternative investments, which are in higher demand in this market. To that end, we're working on making it easier and more efficient for advisors to provide these products, also expanding the breadth of solutions available to meet the client's needs. These enhancements help advisors broaden their value proposition and enrich the offering they provide to their clients, which further contributes to the appeal of our platform, both existing and prospective deposits.
Well, let's next move to our third strategic play, which is focused on creating an industry leading service experience that delights advisors and their clients and in turn, helps drive advisor recruiting and retention. As a reminder, over the past couple of years, we've been on a journey to transform our service model into an end-to-end client care model. And we think about this journey through two primary lenses, transforming our service interface, and reimagining the operational processing that takes place behind that.
Aspiration is provide advisors a multichannel experience, across voice, chat, digital first support, thus offering them greater flexibility for when and how they access service. While we continue to fine tune each of these three channels, we're currently focused on our digital first report, we see it as an opportunity to create an easier and more efficient experience for our advisors to access the information they need. And as we expand these capabilities, advisors can increasingly engage more and more digitally to resolve their requests. And many have already shared they prefer the simpler option over making a phone call.
While we're still in the early innings, we believe these enhancements will have a meaningful impact scalability of our platform, while also enhancing the client experience. Our four strategic players focused on developing a services portfolio that helps advisors and institutions run thriving businesses and deliver comprehensive advice to their clients. We're encouraged by the seasoning of this business and our value proposition continues to resonate with advisors. Four years ago, we started our service group with a strategic goal of solving the practice level challenges advisors face, so they can spend more time with the client.
Through ongoing innovation and expansion, these efforts have translated into the comprehensive portfolio of services we offer today. And as a result of growing demand, our services group subscription base continued to increase, ending the period at roughly 4200 and generating run rate revenue of $34 million. As we work with advisors on existing services, we continue to identify and solve for new needs on their behalf. One example is the launch of our latest solution bookkeeping services. And based on insights from CFO solutions, we created a new service to help advisors further streamline the business decisions with accurate and timely financial reports.
As a result, advisors can spend more time growing and managing their business or also tracking profits in closing. Looking at our innovation pipeline for the remainder of the year, we have several services in pilot and others in the incubation phase. And as we move forward, we remain focused on enhancing and expanding our portfolio, better support our advisors and to drive growth.
In summary, in the third quarter, we continue to invest in the value proposition for advisors and their clients while driving growth and increasing our market leadership. As we look ahead, we remain focused on executing our strategy to help our advisors further differentiate and win in the marketplace. And as a result, I have long-term shareholder that.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt. All right. Thank you, Dan and I'm glad to speak with everyone on today's call. In the third quarter, we remain focused on serving our advisors, growing our business and delivering shareholder value. This focus led to another quarter of solid net new assets and earnings growth. In addition, we enhanced our sweep deposit program with the launch of the client cash account and onboarding people as you noted today. So as we look ahead, we continue to be excited by the opportunities to help our advisors differentiate and win in the market.
Now let's turn to our third quarter business results. Total advisory and brokerage assets were $1 trillion down 2% from Q2, as continued organic growth was more than offset by lower equity. Total net new assets were $20 billion or 7% annualized growth rate. Our Q3 recruited assets were $13 billion, bringing our 12-month total to $84 billion.
As for our Q3 financial results, the combination of organic growth, rising interest rates, higher ICA balances and expenses led to EPS prior to intangibles and acquisition costs of $3.13. This was up 77% from a year ago, and is the highest in our history.
Looking at our top line growth, gross profit reached a new high of $838 million, up $127 million or 18% sequentially. As for the components, commission advisory fees net of payout were $182 million, down $23 million from chip. The decrease was primarily driven by the seasonal uptick and production bonus expense, and lower advisory fees following the Q2 equity market supply.
Our payout rate for the quarter was 87.9%, up about 90 basis points from Q2 due to typical seasonality in the onboarding unit. Regarding asset base revenue, sponsor revenue was $194 million in Q3, down $14 million sequentially. The decrease in Q3 was driven by lower average assets during the quarter, as well as a non-recurring $8 million sponsor payment in Q2.
With respect to client cash revenue, it was $304 million, up $147 million from Q2 driven by higher average short term interest rates as well as higher ICA balance. Looking at overall client cash balances, the end of the quarter at $67 billion, down $3 billion sequentially driven by client net buying activity of $20 million, which is the highest quarterly level we have ever seen.
Within our ICA portfolio, we added capacity in Q3 as we saw further improvements in banks deposit demand, leading to an increase in balances of $7 billion. And I would highlight that $5 billion of that increase was a new fixed rate contracts.
Looking more closely at our ICA yields, it was 212 basis points in Q3 up 78 basis points from Q2, primarily driven by the increase in short term rates during the quarter. As we look ahead to Q4 we expect your ICA yield to continue to increase. Based on where interest rates are today, we expect our Q4 ICA yield to increase to approximately 265 basis.
As for service and fee revenue, it was $122 million in Q3, up $9 million from Q2, driven by revenues from our National Adviser Conference and IRAP [ph]. Within our services group, we ended the quarter with roughly 4200 subscriptions, which is up about 300 from last quarter. Our services group now generates roughly $34 million of annual revenue, while also contributing to organic growth by helping drive recruiting, same-store sales and retention.
Looking ahead to Q4 results, we do not have any large advisor conferences in the quarter. We expect service and fee revenue to decline by roughly $5 million sequentially. Regarding Q3 transaction revenue, it was $43 million down $1 million sequentially as trading volumes declined.
As we look ahead to Q4, we have seen an increase in training activity in October. That said, I would note there is one less trading day. So that would likely offset that. And so based on what we have seen to date, we would expect transaction revenue to be relatively flat we feel great.
Turning now to expenses, Core G&A was $298 million in Q3 up $12 million sequentially. Looking ahead, we continue to see opportunities to invest to drive growth. So while we expect to be within our full year 2022 Core G&A outlook range, we expect to be towards the higher end.
As a result, we are tightening the outlook to a range of $1,185 million to $1,195 million. On Q3 promotional expense, it was $99 million up $15 million sequentially, primarily driven by higher conference expense because we hosted our largest advisor conference of the year, which returned to an in person format for the first time in three years.
Looking ahead to Q4, we expect lower conference spend partially offset by continued growth and recruiting transition system. As a result, we expect promotional expense will decrease by approximately $15 million sequentially. With respect to depreciation and amortization, it was $52 million in Q3 up $3 million sequentially.
Looking ahead to Q4, we expect depreciation and amortization to increase by a few million sequentially. As for interest expense, it was $33 million in Q3, up $4 million sequentially as higher LIBOR rates increase the cost of our floating rate debt.
Looking ahead to Q4 given where LIBOR rates are today, we expect interest expense to increase to approximately $36 million. Regarding capital management, our balance sheet remains strong in Q3 with corporate cash at $424 million, up $183 million from Q2. Our leverage ratio was 1.7 times down from 2.1 times in Q2. This decline was driven by a combination of our continued growth and a higher interest rate environment, both of which have meaningfully improved our earnings power.
As we look at our leverage ratio going forward, our balance sheet strategy is unchanged. Our focus is to maintain a strong balance sheet that can absorb a market downturn, while at the same time having the capacity to invest for growth. With our improved earnings power, we are updating our leverage target to a range of one and a half to two and a half times, which we believe positions us well to operate over a range of economic cycles, and strikes the right balance between preserving balance sheet strength and investing for growth.
As for capital deployment, our framework remains focused on allocating capital aligned with the returns we generate. Investing in organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A where appropriate and returning excess capital to shareholders. In Q3, we allocated capital to both organic growth and share repurchases, buying back $75 million of our shares.
As we look ahead to Q4, we plan to increase share repurchases to approximately $150 million. This will complete our existing authorization of $1 billion that we established at the end of 2018. Looking to 2023, we work to put in place a new share repurchase authorization, our focus was on an amount that we'd be in a position to execute against over roughly two years.
With that framing in mind, we established a new authorization of $2 billion, which we expect to begin executing in the first quarter of 2023. As always, we will retain the flexibility to adjust the pace to repurchases as the environment warrants or as other capital allocation opportunities across organic growth and M&A merge.
In closing we delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results. As we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue investing to serve our advisors, grow our business and create long-term shareholder value.
With that, I will ask our operator Amy to open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Hey, good afternoon. So I wanted to start off with a question, Matt, just on the buyback and the adjusted leverage target range. So certainly pleased to see or hear both. I was hoping you could frame the timing or cadence for executing that $2 billion buyback authorization. And just given the meaningful step up, you should see in EBITDA and leverage likely to fall below the low end of that target range in the coming quarters. Just in the absence of any opportunities around M&A, how should we think about your willingness or appetite to optimize buybacks and stay within that leverage target range over the long term? Sure. I mean I think the core of it, as I talked a little bit about in the prepared remarks, is making sure that we're balancing having a strong balance sheet with deploying capital to drive growth. And I think when we think through the prioritization of that, it is focused on organic growth versus M&A second and then returning capital to shareholders third. And I think what you hear us saying on the $2 billion over two years that we think around $250 million. And I would emphasize roughly, right, roughly $250 million a quarter is that right allocation.
Now if we get through a period of time over that two years, where interest rates are elevated for an extended period of time or there's just fewer opportunities to deploy capital towards organic growth or M&A., I would expect that pace to increase and for us to execute against faster. And I'd highlight, if the opposite occurs, we see more opportunities for organic growth and more opportunities for M&A that would expect it to slow down. So it's really just about the opportunities that we see, and we'll make those judgments along the way. That's great. And maybe for my follow-up, a question for Dan on the M&A landscape, certainly, higher rates bolsters your relative competitive position versus peers, particularly those that are in self-clearing. I was hoping you could speak to the environment for deal activity. How active you expect to be on the M&A front? And just the willingness of any targets to engage just given the pressures that they've been feeling in terms of equity market declines without the similar benefit or the offsetting benefit from higher rates? Yes. So Steven thanks for the question. And as Matt said, when you think about that allocation of capital, we obviously prioritize that to organic ours. And then we look to M&A as a complement to that organic growth. And I think as we've said before, there's two key areas. We continue to explore and look to the M&A marketplace for and that's to enhance or speed up capabilities that we deliver and make available to our advisers and/or 1 that contributes to our overall growth.
And I think with respect to that second category, we continue to look through the entire ecosystem from smaller growth-oriented deals like the binding scattered good ample that you saw us do in the second quarter all the way up to if there were a more opportunistic opportunity to create value, deploy our capital in a way that makes sense relative to other options and alternatives that operationally, we can consume that acquisition and execute on it well fits inside our strategy, then we would be interested in certainly exploring those opportunities in.
So I don't think our posture has changed at all relative to our strategy and how we think about using and leveraging M&A. Certainly, we get your point around how the market may -- and conditions in the market may change that may make those acquisition opportunities more right for available. And again, we stay consistent in our exploration of the market, looking at where we can complement our [indiscernible]. So I hope that helps. That’s very helpful color. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Thank you, Please standby for our next question. And our next question comes from Alexander Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Hey, guys, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question as well. So maybe I could start with also a bit of a strategic question, along similar lines to Steven’s question around M&A. But your cash flow characteristics, obviously improving meaning from the level, but also the visibility as you're starting to extend more. So from an organic perspective, if you were to think about areas where you'd want to invest more in to accelerate organic growth from here, what are the products? And what are the channels where you think that could be the best opportunity to accelerate investment in order to capture a higher share of the organic growth opportunity? Yes, let me start, then Matt you can you can add to that a compliment that. It's a sort of question. It's a great question. So I think, look, we would look across two different, obvious landscapes. One would be, how do we continue to create capabilities that help our advisors differentiate and win in the marketplace. Think about anything across the spectrum of our wealth management platforms and offerings, the more that we can automate from that the advisory platforms expand the content.
In terms of investment options, alternatives, we continue to invest significantly in our centrally managed platform, turning that into a really interesting and competitive UMA platform. Those are examples of where we would think about added capabilities that I think continue to help our advisors differentiate when other great examples of that are in our financial planning capabilities. That's where planning comes in and tax planning overlays, etcetera or again, other places, we, we believe the advisors can show up in the marketplace with a broadening and compelling value proposition. So that's just one example of where we would focus.
Again, the second one would be in this area of how do we help them run better businesses. And anything that we can do that, that makes them more effective at making better decisions, and really understanding what's happening in their businesses. So using data turned into analytics to create better decision making, creating leverage points and expertise, whether that be like, our CMO marketing solution, as an example, our CFO solution, those are examples of where we would continue to invest in capability and services.
So you take that combination of technology and services combined, all for the purpose of helping them deliver better advice and differentiate by so that they win more, and then ultimately, to help them operate and run better businesses. That's where you should think about us celebrating and enhancing our overall spin model. Think at the same time. Look, we continue to explore how do we expand and evolve our affiliation models such that, you extend your addressable market, you actually create more and more flexibility and optionality for how that advisor may plug into our platform, or may evolve, how they use our platform over time, we think are really compelling and interesting places to continue to invest.
So those are just a couple of examples of how we might think about deploying into our overall capability set that would drive new store sales, same store sales and -- all of which would obviously contribute towards the end of [Indiscernible]. Matt, I don't know if you want to add? No, you covered it up. Great, thanks. Thanks for that. And my quick follow up is just from that, clearly the dynamics and the broker sweep channel have changed quite rapidly here in the last three months, even in with banks starting to see more deposit outflows. How are you thinking about the spread on the ICA portfolio, obviously, on the variable piece, the fixed, I don't think has a spread on it. But -- are you starting to see competition getting to a point where spreads could actually start to increase over the last couple of quarters? And kind of how would you think about the bookends or where they could ultimately go? Yes, we're definitely seeing demand leading, leading to those spreads. So maybe just to walk back kind of pre-COVID. I think we landed in a zone where we would typically be able to get Fed funds plus 20, maybe 25. And then during COVID, if you were if you're lucky enough to get it as usually said, funds minus, and then and I think we lived in a place of round Fed Funds flat as we know, probably the last year or so.
And then I think what we're seeing right now and even the new variable contracts that we're putting in place right now we're at a spread of, plus 5 to 10. Right, so you're starting to see things come back and I think I don't I don't see anything just think that the book ended where we were with free code that plus 20 to 25. I think that's a good place to point to on where we think it would go. But I think the trend is a positive one. And we're seeing it each quarter including this quarter with that plus 5 to 10. Great, thanks very much. Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. And our next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Great, thank you. Just a question on the bank mandates. We saw the People's United come through in the quarter, can you just remind us how much if any, is there still outstanding to come through from a funding standpoint on that, or CUNA or others, as we kind of look through the rest of the year and into next year in terms of remaining balances to come through? And then if you could just maybe more broadly, update us on the pipeline and the conversations that you're having with banks, regarding outsourcing arrangements? And would you be surprised if there were no additional announcements on that front over the next 12 months? Yes. Let me take that. Or, Matt, you want to start with this, what's outstanding in terms of the balances to transition the unit? And then I'll pick up? Yes. Yes, it sounds good. I think it's mostly onboarded between the two of those. I'd call it in the $1.5 billion on that left to come on board. And that's on the direct side. So that takes a little bit longer for that process for those over, but $1.5 billion would be the right time. And then maybe for the second part of your question. So look, we continue to see these financial institutions as an affiliation model that we believe has ongoing growth opportunity. And I think we selectively added roughly $65 billion, $70 billion in large financial institution assets over the last couple of years and continue to see strong momentum in the demand for the solution of the offering, which really just sort of introduced a new concept into an outsourcing model sort of scale into the marketplace, right? So all the value proposition that we've talked about originally, everything from the risk management profile shift all the way to better client experiences attracting better advise or better financial results all still hold.
And I think what we've done over the last couple of years is as we've added these larger institutions, we continue to innovate both in terms of how we support them day in and day out. And also this is partly how you transition them over. That's a pretty big change management effort as you could imagine. And I think given that over the last couple of years, we continue to make our model more and more appealing.
So as we talk to future prospects. I think we're able to continue to expand the value, which we provide and deliver for them, the quality at which we do it and simplify the change management effort in the overall transition. So with that, momentum that we have matched with the improvement in enhancing value proposition, we believe and are still very optimistic in the sort of growing durability around the growth opportunity and have a good solid pipeline. And though these deals are a little bit harder to predict in terms of the timing because they're longer sales cycle, feel good that we have opportunity to continue the momentum. Okay. And just a follow-up question on the technology portfolio spend. I think you guys are expecting a little over $200 million or so this year. Can you just remind us what portion of that goes through the P&L versus what's capitalized? How you see that evolving? And then on the P&L, we see D&A continues to drift higher, what sort of growth rate can we expect there on depreciation and amortization relative to the 24% growth that we saw in the quarter on a year-on-year basis? Yes. On that growth rate, I mean, I think when you look at the last few quarters there's been a few million a quarter on that depreciation and amortization growth, and that's primarily the tech portfolio, the capitalized piece that goes there. So I think that's a good framing to think about that. On the tech portfolio, the capitalization versus expense rate, it moves around depending on the type of work that we're doing in that particular quarter. But I think a good rule of thumb is 70% capitalized 30% expense. Great. Thank you. Thank you. One moment please for our next question. Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open. Good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I'd like to start, we've heard from some other wealth management firms that have seen a shift and more growth on the brokerage side driven by investor demand to go and find yield and buy more interest in bonds and whatnot. Are you seeing that as well? And should we maybe tweak our expectations for your mix of growth in the near term? Yes. So short answer is we are seeing some mix. I think you're right in assessing that it's very much sort of environmentally driven by the macro market conditions. Fixed income is a good example of that. I think you're also seeing it in the alt space and in annuities. And those drive a higher mix of perhaps deploying capital to new solutions in a kind of a time-bound way relative to the market conditions. I think you've also seen it show up in a bit of a slowdown in some of the transition from brokerage to advisory. In the short run as well, we think that structural trend still makes sense and still expect that to continue. I just think you have a little bit of that sort of environmental noise overlay.
So I think those are the right way to think about slight mix. If you look at our overall macro trend that we still expect to see much more assets deployed to advisories which is for all the structural reasons that we've talked about before. And I think you'll see that we still sit in sort of that 52% to 53% range of assets now in advisory, and that probably hasn't continued to trend up as much as we would have expected, a little bit because of the macro, probably more because of some of the larger bank or enterprise solutions that we brought on, just have a higher mix of brokerage assets than typically independent advisers that we recruit new. But we do expect once they get on to our platform and have new capabilities and access to perhaps better advisory tools, they typically begin to also see a trend or a transition of their books over time from brokerage to advisory. So I hope that color helps. You've got kind of the structural trend towards advisory that still exists to a little bit of an environmental influence over the [indiscernible]. Sure, little mix of cyclical and with the secular. That makes a lot of sense. Yes. Yes. Okay, great. And then for my second question, I know it's early, but do -- and it will be impacted by a lot of factors that will come out and play out in the next several months. But any sense about how we should be thinking about expense growth for 2023. We've seen as the benefits of interest rates provide some tailwind that you have been driving a little bit of incremental investment in the platform. Should we assume that, that would continue along with a rate forecast that we might be using? Or -- and is there any reason to think that some of the expense growth or trajectory would slow for any reason at some point? Sure, Ben. I'll give -- it's a little early. I'll give you some color. I mean, I think when we think about -- to your point on interest rates and how that impacts our financials, when we do those economies, just building from the start of the cycle, right, early in the cycle, we were focused on that, the benefit from those increases falling to the bottom line and really improving margin, right? And then as we got deeper into the cycle, really pivoting to our capital allocation framework and allocating that capital across the 3 primary areas that we look at.
And I think investments to drive and support organic growth is the primary category, the first category that we look at. And as you highlighted a bit when we look at this year, right, we've been accelerating investments to drive growth and support our advisers. And just looking at Core G&A, we've typically been in the mid-to-single -- mid-single-digit growth rates in the past. And this year, we'll be in the 12% to 13% range, right? And part of that increase is coming from those incremental earnings from rates that we're really deploying to improve our value competition.
Now when we look across the other options, right, we see opportunities potentially in M&A, right? We see opportunities in returning capital to shareholders that we've talked about today, increasing the buyback in Q4 at $150 million and then pivoting to a $250 million -- roughly $250 million per quarter next year.
Now on the level of investments next year, I think if the interest rate environment does play out like it's predicted, I think we're going to be in a position to have opportunities to invest and drive growth, and we'll apply the same framework on the capital allocation front that we always use to guide us. And I'll share a bit more color at Investor Day in a few weeks, and then we'll finalize those plans as we normally do and share them on our year-end earnings call. Great. Thanks for that color. Appreciate it Matt. And our next question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Your line is open. Thanks, good evening. I want to start with a question just on adviser recruiting. In volatile markets, typically, we see adviser appetite to move slow or go away. So good to hear the comment on the strong recruiting pipeline. So I'd like to just maybe dig in a little bit around kind of where you're seeing momentum across what channels, expectations will actually executing on that pipeline. And then I'm just curious, like maybe there's a little bit of a coiled spring building. So I'm assuming that natural conversions has slowed a bit, but maybe the actual conversations and what's in the pipeline is expanding. So I'd just love to get more color there. Thanks. Yes. Devin, you said it, and we've talked about it, the macro conditions certainly can create some headwinds across new store sales or recruiting as we've talked about, right, the complexity in the marketplace drives focus on serving and supporting their clients in the short term, rightfully so and sometimes then delayed more strategic considerations.
So I think we saw certainly a pickup in the third quarter as we talked about some of those market-driven headwinds beginning to give way to the structural desire of an adviser to improve their practice or their programs. And so we feel great about our pipeline across all of the different affiliation models that we have, certainly are traditional one as well as in the new models that we've created -- and so as we go forward, we feel like, certainly, as these advisers pivot back to focusing on structurally enhancing the program that aligns well with the feel and capabilities if our model sets up well for a good strong finish to the year from a recruiting standpoint.
And again, I think you've seen it over the RIA channel the employee channel and the strategic wealth channel, right, those new models, we've consistently recruited a little over 2 billion each of the last three quarters. And so we feel good about going afield positioning in the marketplace for those as a great complement to our traditional markets. And then when you overlay the financial institution market over the top, it sets up for continued interesting evolution of our new store sales. And we continue to focus on trying to drive that higher as we go forward.
I think if you look at the trailing 12, we've got about 84 billion in recruited results and outcomes, and we continue to work both on our efficacy to execute better, met with more appealing model met with the breadth of affiliation models to continue to drive that buying [ph]. Hope that answers… Yes. Great color. Thank you. And as a follow-up, on customer cash, you appreciate it's primarily operational of LPL, and that's different than some others in the wealth space. But I just want to think about kind of the ranges of kind of where cash has trended its 6.4% of assets today, you're kind of at the higher end. I think the average from 2016 is like 5.3% in the low in 2019 was about 4%. So I just love any help thinking about kind of where we are in that range. I know we're in the higher end, but is 5.3% average, maybe where we get back to if sentiment in the market improves and gets back to something more normal, the denominator also matters quite a bit here. So just love to think about that range a little more to you and how you guys are thinking about maybe where cash could trend given that it is operational. Yes. Yes. It's definitely operational. I think that the best things to look at are the history, the empirical data that you were referring to. I think an average of 5% is where we've been. So you think of that as maybe a market neutral position and the lows have gone down closer to 4%. But keep in mind, our mix of assets were different back then. They were more in brokerage than they are today. And advisory in general, will have a higher amount of cash to facilitate rebalance. So maybe that low end -- would that mix change, that low end feels more like 4.5% given that mix change. And I think you're right, where we're sitting today in that 6.5% zone is certainly towards the upper end. So that's the range that I would have. Okay. Those are couple of contacts, so appreciate it. Thank you. Please standby for our next question. And our next question comes from Bill Katz with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Thank you very much. Good evening everyone. Thank you for taking the question. So just maybe picking up on that last line of questioning. Just given where you are, I wonder if you could update us on your thinking of sort of fixed to float relative to the 50% to 75% range. I see you sort of add 15 percentage points in the quarter. Is there any reason to think that you could take that number higher, all else being equal? And then how should we think about maybe the pacing to get back into the target range? Yes, Bill, and good to hear. Good to hear from you again. Welcome back. I think our target range remains at 50% to 75% in a rolling portfolio. So we're minimizing that interest rate volatility. And I think we're in periods of low rates, we'd want to stay closer to that 50% in periods of higher rates like we're getting into now, where there's also some steepness to the curve, I think we'd want to be closer to 75% -- and our ability to do that really is subject to the demand in the market, right? So maybe just a little bit of color on what we're seeing there is demand does continue to return, right?
On ICA overall, right. We added $7 billion of balances in Q3, the majority of that $5 billion in fixed, and that brings the amount we've been able to add this year of new fixed to $9 billion, right? And that's the most we've been able to add in a single year ever, meaning even pre-COVID. So the environment is certainly improving. And then when you look at from this point forward, it does feel like that it's set up more demand to continue to be strong. Right, from the Fed side of raising rates and really shrinking their balance sheet to the banks themselves, where consumer spending continues to remain healthy. Loan balances are growing. And those are all the things that would lead to additional demand.
Now whether that's fixed or not becomes more about those banks and what their asset liability management is and their interest in FX. So it becomes a little bit more challenging to take all that information and say that there'll be more fixed in -- but I feel confident overall that the environment is conducive to banks needing more ICA. And what we've seen so far has been approved. So we'll keep monitoring. But I think if the demand is there, we'll want to manage that 50% to 75% range we've talked through, which even though we've improved, we're still below the low end of that today. Okay, thanks. And just a follow-up. Just coming back to your commentary and perhaps I heard this incorrectly, I apologize if that's the case. I heard you say that sort of the new target leverage ratio would be 1.5 to 2.5 and I'm looking at something correctly. It was previously 2 to 2 or 3 quarters turn. Why now to reduce it? It feels like the franchise has probably never been in better shape. The earnings power certainly cyclically has a significant step function in front of the next couple of years. What is it about the messaging of bringing that down? Is this a point of conservatism? Is there maybe less leverage opportunities going forward? I'm just trying to understand why you bring it down. Yes. Yes, of course. So I think when we look at our strategy, right, which is unchanged, right? It's really focused on a combination of maintaining a strong balance sheet and having capacity to invest for growth. And the driver of the decline in the leverage ratio has really been our earnings power improving, right? Our growth, combined with the interest rate environment has driven the leverage ratio down.
So given that and given -- and thinking about what our target leverage ratio should be, we wanted to solve for two things, making sure we're positioning ourselves to be able to consistently support our advisers even when the macro declined, so the economic cycle link.
And then second, just making sure we're striking the right balance between preserving that balance sheet strength and investing for growth. Right? In our perspective in solving for those things, we think 1.5 to 2.5 times leverage is really something that positions us all to achieve those objectives. So that was the driver. Perfect. Thank you very much. Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Vogt with KBW. Your line is open. Hi, good evening. Most of mine have been answered already, but I just had a couple of follow-ups. Maybe one on the betas in terms of incremental betas, I know those increased to 20% over the last 75 basis points. But just wondering if you could provide some updated thoughts there on the trend for incremental betas as the Fed is now set to more -- to move more meaningfully above the peak of last cycle? Yes, Kyle. I mean I think the betas so far have been coming in favorable, right, as you highlighted. And the most recent hikes, we're at 20%. When you look at the last cycle, that would have peaked around 25% for us. They are coming in a little bit better. Our approach, though, here is -- and we'll continue to monitor it is to remain competitive, right? We've got a product that we want to be competitive in the marketplace. And I think that's what drives those betas. So I think we'll continue to price that way. I would say, just looking at the marketplace, we don't see anything pointing to a meaningful change in the price sensitivity of this particular product. So I think we'd be surprised if betas ended up being materially different than last time. Okay. And then just a follow-up on the leverage conversation just really more so on corporate cash. You built up your corporate cash balances to just over $400 million in the third quarter. And even when accounting for higher repurchases in 4Q, you're still very likely to build cash into the end of the year. I'm just wondering if there's a near-term preference to maintain higher cash balances than you have historically say, over the last 4 or 5 years in order to maintain kind of maximum flexibility on opportunistic M&A, is that a part of the decision-making there for running with higher cash balances. Well, I think it's back to our capital allocation framework. It's all about being prepared to take advantage of opportunities to invest in organic growth first, M&A second and returning capital to shareholders third. And I think the time, which each of those things emerges can be different, right? So I think what you see there is there's no -- nothing to infer about that cash balance build other than our economics improve pretty materially in the quarter, and we're going to allocate it the same way we have before. And our target for corporate cash hasn't changed at $200 million. So we're above that right now, but our target and objective will be to deploy it across our capital allocation framework. Great. Thank you. Thank you.[Operator Instructions] I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Mr. Arnold for closing remarks.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Arnold. Thank you, John, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. Over the past quarter and throughout 2022, our advisers remain the source of support and guidance for their clients against the backdrop of increased market volatility. In doing so, they reinforce the value of their advice and the important role they play for their clients. We thank them for their continued commitment and dedication as we focus on our mission, taking care of our advisers so they can take care of their client.
With respect to our performance, our fourth quarter business results drove a solid financial outlook, while at the same time, we continue to make progress on the execution of our strategic plan. I'll review both of these areas, starting with our fourth quarter business results.
In the quarter, total assets increased to $1.1 trillion as continued solid organic growth was complemented by higher equity markets. With respect to organic growth, fourth quarter net new assets were $21 billion, representing 8% annualized growth. This contributed to net new assets for the year of $96 billion, also representing an 8% organic growth.
Recruited assets were $15 billion Q4, bringing our total for the full year to $82 billion. These results were driven by the ongoing enhancements to our model and our expanded addressable markets.
Looking at same-store sales, our advisers remain focused on serving the clients and delivering a differentiated experience. As a result, our advisers are both winning new clients and expanding wallet share with existing clients, a combination which drove solid same-store sales in the fourth quarter.
With respect to retention, we continue to enhance the adviser experience through the delivery of new capabilities and technology as well as the ongoing modernization of our service and operations. As a result, asset retention for the fourth quarter and full year was approximately 98%.
Our fourth quarter business results led to solid financial outcomes of $4.21 of EPS prior to intangibles and acquisition costs, which brought our full year total to $11.52, an increase of 64% from a year ago.
Now let's turn to the progress we made on our strategic plan. As a reminder, our long-term vision has become the leader across the adviser center market, which for us means being the best at empowering advisers and enterprises to deliver great advice to their clients and to be great operators of the business.
Now to bring this vision to life, we are providing the capabilities and solutions to help our advisers deliver personalized advice and planning experience to their clients. And at the same time, through human-driven technology-enabled solutions and expertise, we're supporting advisers in their efforts the extraordinary business.
Doing this well gives us a sustainable path to industry leadership across the adviser experience, organic growth and market share. Now to execute on our strategy, we have organized our work into four strategic plays, which I'll review in turn.
Our first strategic play involves meeting advisers and institutions where they are in the evolution of the business, by winning in our traditional markets, also leveraging new affiliation models, which expand our addressable market. In our traditional markets, ongoing enhancements to our platform and the efficacy of our business development team led to continued improvement to our win rates and an expansion of the depth and breadth of our despite adviser movement in the industry remaining at lower levels.
As a result, Q4 was our strongest quarter of recruiting in 2022 in our traditional markets with approximately $11 billion in assets. looking ahead, we expect to carry this recruiting momentum into Q1. With respect to our new affiliation models, strategic wealth, employee and our enhanced RIA offering, we recruited over $1 billion in assets in Q4. In each of these models, we continue to see growing demand and expanding pipeline, which position them for increased contributions for our organic growth.
With respect to large enterprises, they remained a meaningful source of recruiting in 2022, including the additions of CUNA and People's United. Looking ahead, we expect to onboard Commerce Bank around the middle of this year and continue to see our pipeline build as demand for our model grows. And at the same time, we continue to have success recruiting in our traditional enterprise channel, including the addition of bank for [indiscernible] South in Q4.
Within this strategic play, we are also seeing positive early momentum with our most recent innovation of liquidity and succession capability where we are providing a differentiated offer to meet succession needs of the advisers. Over the next decade, it is estimated that up to 1/3 of advisers will be retired and will likely address succession needs of their practices.
To solve for this need, our first innovation was providing M&A support service to help facilitate the transition of practices from adviser to advisory. Our key learnings from that experience, there are many instances due to factors like large practice size or lack of an identified successor that will require a different solution.
And without of this need, we created our differentiated liquidity and succession offering, which LPL will step in to purchase an adviser's business and serve as a bridge to the next entrepreneurial successor, all while preserving the principles of independent.
The offering has been well received and we are encouraged our early momentum, having already executed on a handful of transactions with providers on our product. This year, we will also plan to take the capability to the external marketplace and look forward to sharing our progress.
Our second strategic play is to provide capability to help our advisers differentiate the marketplace and drive efficiency in the back. In 2023, we will focus our development of new capabilities and solutions within this play across four key areas. First, we will continue to enhance our wealth management platform to help advisers provide their clients to differentiated advice, products and pricing.
Second, we will continue to advance ClientWorks, our core operating platform, with additional digitized workflows to help advisers operate more efficiently and increase their scalability to serve more fun. Third, we will expand our banking and lending services to help advisers address a broader spectrum of the clients' financial needs and thus deepen their role as an essential partner.
And the final area is to enrich the end client experience with additional digital solutions that increase personalization and self-service and enable advisers to create customized experiences for their business. We believe these evolving capabilities will help drive increased adviser growth, productivity and retention.
Now let's move to our third strategic play, which is focused on creating an industry-leading service experience that delights advisers and their clients and, in turn, helps drive adviser recruiting and retention.
As a reminder, over the past couple of years, we've been on a journey to transform our service model into an omnichannel client care model, including voice, chat and digital support.
And as part of this journey, we have evolved the technology and instrumentation of our traditional voice channel while also making meaningful enhancements to our always- on digital support capabilities. As a result, approximately 75% of engagements with our digital channel fully resolve the service request and don't necessitate a phone call to complete the task. As we continue to expand and refine our digital support channel, we believe that an increasing share of advisers will leverage digital-first support for more flexible and efficient service experience.
As we continue to evolve our service interface, we're also transforming the operational processing that takes place behind that interface. For example, last year, we began automating much of the processing for our core clearing, including money movement, account opening and account transfer, which collectively drive the majority of our operational process.
And with these learnings from our transformation and service and operations, we are reengineering other areas of the business, including our compliance and risk management. Out of that end, we've applied robotics and AI capabilities through a number of our compliance review workloads, which has improved both the efficiency of the reviews as well as the efficacy of the overall risk management.
Efforts on this front include automating the reviews of client communications, marketing materials and transactions. Now by automating more workflows, we continue to increase the scalability of our platform while also enhancing plan is good.
Our fourth strategic play is focused on developing a services portfolio that helps advisers and institutions from driving businesses and deliver comprehensive advice to their client. As we discussed last quarter, we are encouraged by the seasoning of this business and the evolving appeal of our value proposition.
As a result of solid demand, in Q4, the number of advisers utilizing our services group continued to increase. We ended the year at over 3,000 active users, up more than 30% year-over-year and generating run rate revenue of $36 million.
Now when we started our services group, we focused on addressing some of the most complex challenges facing our advisers. We were often more acute for advisers with larger practices. With the insights and learnings from this initial client segment, we're now expanding our service portfolio to address the needs of a broader adviser base.
As we continue to evolve the offering in 2023, we are focused on several key opportunities for our services group: first, addressing additional channels, specifically building solutions solve for needs of enterprises; second, leveraging our structured approach to innovation in order to continue to develop new services and evolve our existing portfolio; and third, contributing to the growth of our new affiliation models, Strategic Wealth and Linsco, as well as expanding our ability to serve high net worth.
So, in summary, in the fourth quarter and throughout the year, we continued to invest in value proposition for advisers and their clients while driving growth and increasing our market leadership. As we look ahead, we remain focused on executing our strategy to help our advisers further differentiate and win in the marketplace. And as a result, we have long-term shareholder value.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt. All right. Thank you, Dan, and I'm glad to speak with everyone on today's call. Before I review our fourth quarter results, I'd like to highlight our progress during 2022. Against an evolving market backdrop, we maintained our focus on supporting our advisers and their clients while executing on our strategic priorities.
We continue to grow assets organically in both our traditional and new markets, successfully onboarded new enterprise clients, developed and piloted our new liquidity and succession capability and announced two strategic acquisitions. We accomplished this all while continuing to invest in our industry-leading value proposition and delivering record earnings per share.
Now let's turn to our fourth quarter business results. Total advisory and brokerage assets were $1.1 trillion, up 7% from Q3 as continued organic growth was complemented by higher equity markets. Total net new assets were $21 billion or an 8% annualized growth rate. Our Q4 recruited assets were $15 billion. I would note, this included $11 billion from our traditional independent model, which was the highest quarter of the year.
Looking ahead to Q1, our overall pipelines continue to remain strong. In particular, I would highlight that within our traditional models, the momentum we saw in Q4 has continued into Q1, and we are on pace to deliver one of our strongest first quarters in what is typically our slowest quarter of the year.
As for our Q4 financial results, the combination of organic growth, rising interest rates and expense discipline led to EPS prior to intangibles and acquisition costs of $4.21, the highest in our history.
Looking at our top line growth, gross profit reached a new high of $972 million, up $135 million or 16% sequentially. As for the components, commission advisory fees net of payout were $172 million, down $10 million from Q3, primarily driven by the seasonal increase in production mode.
In Q4, our payout rate was 88.4%, up about 50 basis points from Q3 due to the seasonal build in the production model. Looking ahead to Q1, we anticipate our payout rate will decline to approximately 87% as the production bonus reset at the beginning of each year.
With respect to client cash revenue, it was $439 million, up $136 million from Q3 as the impact of higher short- term interest rates more than offset a sequential decline in balances. Looking at overall client cash balances, they ended the quarter at $64 billion, down $3 billion driven by record net buying of $25 billion. Within our ICA
[Technical Difficulty]
As for Q1, we expect our ICA yield to increase to approximately 315 basis points, which include yesterday's 25 basis point hike at an assumed deposit beta of 25%.
As for service and fee revenue, it was $120 million in Q4, down $2 million from Q3. This decline was primarily driven by lower conference revenue, following our largest adviser conference of the year in Q3. Looking ahead to Q1, we expect typical seasonal increases in IRA to be offset by lower comp charge, so we anticipate service and fee revenue to be roughly flat to Q4.
Regarding Q4 transaction revenue, it was $47 million, up $4 million sequentially as trading volume increased. Based on what we have seen in Q1 to date, we would expect transaction revenue to be roughly flat with Q4. Turning to expenses. Our core G&A was $327 million in Q4, bringing our full year core G&A to $1.192 billion. This was in the middle of our outlook range and, for the full year, represents approximately 13% growth.
As for our outlook for 2023, our long-term cost strategy remains unchanged. We plan to continue to prioritize investments that drive organic growth and create incremental operating leverage in our core business. As we shared at our Investor and Analyst Day, the current environment is creating opportunities to accelerate our investment plans. As such, we expect to grow our investments at a similar pace this year. More specifically, we plan to grow our 2023 core G&A in the range of 12% to 15%.
To share a little more color on where our investments are focused, this expense growth spans the following three broad categories, with each driving approximately 4% to 5% growth in core G&A. First, to support our core business growth, including investments in technology and capabilities. second, to support growth in our expanded addressable market and to scale our new services. and third, to accelerate the timing of investments that advance our strategy.
To give you a sense of the near-term timing of this spend, as we look ahead to Q1, we would expect core G&A to be in the range of $320 million to $325 million. As always, we will remain flexible and can adjust to shifts in the operating.
Turning to promotional expense. In Q4, it was $84 million, down $15 million sequentially, primarily driven by lower conference spend. In Q1, we expect promotional expense will increase by approximately $25 million as we have two of our largest conferences of the year during the quarter.
Looking at share-based compensation expense, it was $12 million in Q4, up $1 million from Q3. As we look ahead, we anticipate this expense will increase by approximately $5 million sequentially in Q1 as it tends to be our highest quarter of the year given the timing of our annual stock awards. As for interest expense, it was $37 million in Q4 and up $4 million sequentially as higher LIBOR rates increased the cost of our floating rate debt.
Regarding capital management. Our balance sheet remained strong in Q4 with corporate cash of $459 million, up $35 million from Q3. Our leverage ratio was 1.4 time, down from 1.7 time in Q3. This decline was driven by a combination of our continued growth in a higher interest rate environment, both of which have meaningfully improved our earnings power.
As for capital deployment, our framework remains focused on allocating capital aligned with the returns we generate, investing in organic growth, first and foremost, pursuing M&A, where appropriate and returning excess capital to shareholders. As we look ahead to 2023, the strength of our balance sheet leaves us with ample capacity to allocate capital across our entire framework.
Specific to organic growth, we see opportunities in recruiting and continued investment in our technology platform. On M&A, we see opportunities in the succession offering where we are emerging from the pilot phase and closed four deals in 2022 for around $50 million. With regards to capital return, we plan to increase our share repurchases to roughly $250 million in Q1. And lastly, we plan to increase our quarterly dividend by 20% beginning in Q1.
To summarize, our balance sheet is strong, and we are well positioned to drive value through our capital allocation framework. In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results. As we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue investing to serve our advisers, grow our business and create long-term shareholder value.
With that, operator, please open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Alexander Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Hi, guys. thanks for the question. So, Matt, maybe we can start with the question around just the cash dynamics. Obviously, it's an area that creates a lot of anxiety for investors still. Maybe talk a little bit about dynamics you saw in December that kind of let the balances being a little bit better than we saw with some of the peers, what you're seeing so far in January and then, importantly, the demand from the bank channel given that the fixed extensions you highlighted in the deck seemed pretty robust. So maybe kind of walk us through the current environment and cash. Yes, sure, Alex. So, I think in December, we saw the typical seasonal build that you see from tax loss harvesting and rebalancing. And I think as you pull that forward into what we're seeing in January, that cash typically goes back into the marketplace.
So that $1.6 billion or so that we saw a build in December in January naturally went back into the market. I'd also highlight, from a seasonality standpoint, advisory fees for the three months of the quarter, the first quarter of the month, as I think you know well, is typically the highest month for advisory fees, and those are about $1 billion in the month of January. So, if you just look from a seasonal standpoint, you'd have a decline of around $2.5 billion, $2.6 billion in the month.
And then in addition to that and just commenting on the overall market activity, we have seen just broad adviser and investor reengagement in the marketplace. I think a good way to summarize that is our customer net buying metric. The highest month -- if you look at our monthly metrics, the highest month we've ever had was back in August of 2022 at $10 billion for the month.
For January, what we're seeing is just north of $11 billion, so the strongest engagement that we've had. And that money is really going back into the equity markets and, as you may expect, longer-dated fixed income securities and things like that. So that's naturally going to drive down balances when you pull those seasonal factors, and combined with the investment engagement, we expect January cash sweep to be around $60 billion -- in the $60 billion.
I think specific to the -- I think the third question, the last part of your question, on the market for ICA contracts. The headline I'd give you is it continues to improve throughout 2022, continued to improve in Q4 and maybe break it up into two buckets. The market for the floating rate balances, the demand continues to be well in excess of the deposits that we have, and you're starting to see that lead to price improvement.
So, for the contracts that we're putting from a floating rate standpoint now, they're more fed funds plus 10 or 15 as opposed to last quarter, they were plus five to 10 and then back in the heart of the pandemic, if we could place them at all, it was fed funds flat to down. So, the market there is quite good.
On the fixed rate side, we're able to add $4 billion in balances this quarter ranging from two to six years. And I think when you combine that with the progress in the past few quarters, we're now not at our high but starting to get close to the high that we've had from a percent of the portfolio at 45%.
And when we look ahead to Q1, we've got $2 billion of maturities coming up. And I think we feel quite good about being able to place those into new fixed rate agreements and, even beyond that, starting to be able to continue to grow the portfolio overall, just seeing the overall demand.
So, headline, I'd say from my side, Alex, is pretty good. Great. And maybe just a second question around the balance sheet. It's nice to see the leverage come down now below your guidance target, which I think you guys revisited recently to lower that. So, as you think about priorities between building out the lending practice, perhaps inorganic opportunities and maybe accelerating some of the share repurchases, how would you think about that? Yes. Well, I think, Alex, the key point on the lending side is it's not a big use of the balance sheet. So, it's really more about connecting the capabilities so our clients can use that. I think on the buyback, I think just going back to our overall capital allocation framework, I think we're focused on investing in organic growth first, M&A second and capital returns third.
And I think from a pace of the buyback, it would just all depend upon the opportunities that we see. So, if the opportunities to invest in organic growth weren't there or M&A wasn't as strong as we would expect, I think that's a scenario where we could accelerate buyback. And then the opposite is also true. We can slow it down if opportunities would lead there. So, the key for us is really to be flexible. And maybe I'd just reiterate that our center of gravity is really that $250 million. Great. Thank you, Matthew. And our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. Hi. Good afternoon Dan, good afternoon Matt. So, I really appreciated the additional granularity in terms of the expense guidance. Your prior expense guide was 15% growth in '23. This latest update appears better or at least a tighter range of 12% to 15%. Is that the right way to interpret the guidance, a bit better than what you offered up last time? And just looking beyond '23 and thinking about that longer-term expense growth algorithm, is there anything we can infer from those buckets that you offered as to what's a normal pace of expense growth, say, in a period where you're not accelerating your investment plans? Yes, Steve. I think on our plans, I mean they really -- they didn't change at all from Investor Day. I think the key is we gave our preliminary thinking there and really went through our typical year-end process to finalize those plans. And I think that's where the 12% to 15% comes from. So, I think the strategy that we have of using this environment really to advance our investments is just the same, and you're just seeing us now land the plane with a sharper pencil.
I think specific to the three categories, I think the answer to your question is, yes, it is informative. I think when you look at the investments to support our core business growth, right, assuming that growth is continuing, I think that level of 4% to 5% supports that growth.
When you look at the second and third categories, by definition, that's where we have flexibility. And we can adjust those based on the market and whether there's opportunity to spend in those areas or not, especially that third category where it's all about advancing things that we may have otherwise done in '24 and beyond that we're now going to do in '23. And just for my follow-up on organic growth, certainly encouraging to hear that the NNA momentum in 4Q has continued to start the year. I was hoping you could just speak to some of the factors that's driving that better NNA momentum? Just trying to gauge how much is environmental, so the strength in the markets, maybe increasing advisers in motion versus more idiosyncratic.
And you were talking about the pipeline strength in institutional as well in your NNA remarks, how much of that strength is coming from larger institutions? So, let me take that one, Steven. There's a lot there, so if I missed something, you give me guidance after I finish. So, Look, I think if we start as a jump-off point, last year, 80% organic growth rate, $96 billion in NNA, which is a pretty solid outcome against a challenging macro backdrop.
And I think irrespective of that backdrop, I think making the progress or working through sort of that environment, both in terms of our teams and advisers, you just continue to evolve capabilities, skills and operating in any potential environment.
So, I think as we look forward and we think about going forward, we feel good that the sort of the acclamation to an upper macro, if it sustains itself, that we can execute in it better and ultimately contribute improved or better growth. So that's how I would sort of think about the environmental. It may influence what I might call short- term progress around our growth ethics.
I think, probably more importantly, strategically, as we think about our opportunity those drivers of that strategy, right, those significant structural, big durable trends all remain in place. It's growing demand for advice. The appeal of receiving that advice through a financial professional, the attractiveness of the independent model versus other models all continue.
And I think we sit at the intersection of all of those and believe we're uniquely positioned to capitalize on that opportunity. And whether that's through our market leadership, singular focus on what we do, robust platform of which to leverage and use and differentiate or even the capacity and commitment to invest, but that was just speaking of to evolve platform and continue to differentiate it.
So, I think as we think about going forward, that comes up to that 7% to 13% sort of growth rates that we talked about across different macro environments, I think, is still highly relevant, still how we think about it. And I think last year demonstrated the ability to persevere through a tougher macro and still reside within that range. So that's how we think about the shorter run and the longer run.
I think to your click down on the enterprises within that, look, it's a channel that we've talked about is a durable growth contributor. We've continued to evolve our capability set with more wins and with good success with those relationships, create better advocacy from our clients and that IP and insight from being on the court for a couple of years working on those large enterprises is certainly IP that's hard to replicate without that experience itself.
And so, when we look at that going forward, it's a pretty appealing model that is finding a marketplace that is in need of that type of model, and we're pretty convicted around our solution. So, we do believe that, again, within those bookends of 7% to 13%, we do get some contribution from large enterprise. So, I hope that gives you a little color. Thanks, for taking my question. And our next question comes from the line of Bill Katz from Credit Suisse. Your question please. Okay. Unfortunately, my connection cut out a little bit, Matt, while you're talking a little bit about the ICA dynamics. I guess my broader question is, as you think about what's been happening in the forward market and expectations softening up a little bit, how is that informing the opportunity here to potentially accelerate the ratio of fixing out relative to the float? And then you mentioned that demand is very healthy. How should we be thinking about reinvestment rate opportunity? Yes. I think, Bill, our perspective on fixed rates really to get into that target range we have of 50% to 75%. And I think the -- if you cut out while I was commenting, I think the comment on the market is it continues to improve, right? It's not perfect, right? We can't move exactly where we want. But I think if you look at the trends throughout 2022 and as we look ahead into what we're seeing already in Q1, demand continues to improve.
So, I think we feel good about the maturities that we knew fixed rate agreements. You can see what we did in Q4 that we're targeting to go out in the five and even, in some cases, a six-year zone based on what the market will bear. And then when you look at the demand overall, in addition to those maturities, I think we feel like we've got the opportunity to grow it in some amount from there.
so, the headline is the marketplace is strong. And I think with where the curve is, we still think it makes sense to target getting into that range if the market will allow us to do so. Terrific. And then just going back to expenses, again, I apologize my connection just cut out. Of the variability to this sort of more refined 12% to 15% and sort of bringing forward that growth, should we be interpreting that, as we look out into '24, all else being equal, that the absolute level of this growth rate would decelerate? Or might you be in the same kind of situation where you would have the opportunity here to sort of advance your organic growth? And is it really now a point of trade-off between organic growth and margin as you think about the business? Yes. I mean I think when you get to our long-term cost strategy, Bill, where that fourth principle is really adjusting our cost to the market, right, so I think, as you may expect, we'll make judgments about 2024 as we get closer to that year. But I would emphasize from an optionality standpoint, when you look at that third category of 4% to 5%, that is opportunistic. The market, especially for 2023 with the interest rate benefits that we have, allow us to make those investments.
And you can look at our op margins with the tailwind of interest rates or op margins continuing to be quite strong, we're in a good place to do that. If the market does not allow us to do that, we've got the ability to adjust. So, I think I would definitely take away that we've got the flexibility. And when you start to look beyond 2023, we'll make those judgments as we get closer to that time period. And our next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan from JMP Securities. Your question please. Hi, thanks. Dan, Matt. I guess first question, as we think about the opportunity to move upstream with larger advisers and higher net worth over time here, what are the capabilities that you need to add to be able to do that? Do you have everything you need and just kind of investing and improving? Or are there other types of capabilities that are maybe incorporated in some of that expense growth that are coming that could really help accelerate that push? Yes. Devin, it's Dan. So, look, as we think about the opportunity set in the high net worth space, and I speak now of the end client segment when I refer to high net worth, that's a function of our advisers' overall evolving practices. And as they have clients or more clients that they have an opportunity to serve inside that category, that's really driven the demand for services and capabilities that traditionally may not have sat inside our overall sweet spot. And so, I think that's been the real catalyst for the driver of our contemplation of building out certain capabilities. And so, examples of that are us building out our own service around complex case design, right?
And so that would be an investment that shows up in the core G&A reference that Matt was making, as an example, to your question. I think you also see that in extended financial planning support. It's not just the technology, but it's the Paraplanning services that sit around it, as an example. So those are things that we're building ourselves or organic capabilities that we're building ourselves. So, as we've gone on the journey, we will -- we have built and we'll continue to build certain things that are in-house.
There's also other things that we think are important to serve high net worth types of clients, maybe that's tailored insurance offerings that we traditionally haven't done inside our own insurance agency or services like helping to sell a small or midsized business.
And that's where we'll -- we are developing strategic partnerships of which to provide those integrated solutions and services inside our overall offering rather than building. And so that's how we're putting together what we think is a compelling set of solutions that position our advisers to serve and support their high net worth clients.
Now as we built out those capabilities or we're in the progress of, it also challenges us then to say, well, how do we better deploy those to the marketplace or leverage those, if you will. And I think that's where we realized with the capability set that we have today, could we utilize that to even target what I might call advisers who specifically operate with only high net worth clients.
And I think that would be an example of how we better leverage these capabilities, and that's something we continue to explore in terms of how we go to market with this capability. But think about it that way, is we're building some of these capabilities. We've been on a journey, we're not completely there, but we've made some significant progress.
And then we'll look to the outside market strategic partnerships. And I'm doing that, I think we can take the capital-light model to what is a compelling value proposition, use it to support our existing advisers and help us potentially attract new. Okay. Great context, thanks Dan. Just a quick follow-up here on kind of the M&A market and conditions. You sounded reasonably optimistic around what you're seeing now. There was a big wealth manager or deal in the wealth management space announced today.
I guess just what are some of the themes that you're seeing in the market that is kind of the catalyst for activity? I'm not sure if it's the same across channels, but any context around maybe what's making you feel like it's a reasonable M&A market right now. Yes. I think we'll continue to see that ongoing trend around consolidation. I think you're continuing to see innovation around capabilities as well, and so that leads to transactions around a certain type of IP or capability set that firms may want to deploy or utilize in a different way.
And then we're seeing more robust activity around solving for succession planning at the individual adviser level and/or smaller practices level. And so, I think you're seeing a healthy amount of activity across the ecosystem. We continue to stay active in exploring all of those possibilities, right? And you see us deploying capital, as an example, the closings we did yesterday with Boenning & Scattergood and FRGIS.
I would just remind you our framework for exploring those possibilities, and you know these, first, it's in sort of side that what I would call growth opportunities in traditional markets where we see opportunity for purposes of growth to potentially acquire a practice, and Boenning & Scattergood would be a great example of that, what would be a great example of that. We also look in that second category where we can add capabilities faster through an acquisition than building them ourselves. We believe we've got to stay open and agile and nimble around that framework.
And then the final one, the third one, which is a little newer one and is aligned with this new capability of liquidity and succession, is putting capital work through acquiring these practices and being that bridge to that future successors. So, I think that's where we're active, that's where we're exploring potential possibilities. And we see pretty good activity going on in the consumer market. Great. Thank you so much. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Cho from JPMorgan. Your question please. Hi. Good afternoon Dan and Matt. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to touch on -- just to kind of zoom out a little bit and touch on the pricing trends you're seeing in your business. I guess just given the environment we're all operating in, I mean, are there some areas where you're looking to either take price or actually invest in price as you look ahead given all the different initiatives that you're dealing out there with the business? Yes, Michael, I'll take that one, and certainly, Matt, you add anything you want at the end. Look, we look at pricing as above our overall offering. Think about such capability, services, technology. We look at pricing as part of our overall investment strategy, if you will. And I think as we shared in the past, we've created a reoccurring theme of investing back into the platform, specifically trying to use price to help our advisers differentiate and win in the marketplace. And so I think that places that we've been historically focused on for the past, call it, four to five years has been typically around the advisory platform, right, 70%, 75% of new assets -- sorry, yes, new cash is going to those types of solutions, and we want to make sure that we're enriching the appeal of them.
And so as we look at 2023, you'll see us continue to lower pricing around our centrally managed platforms as a way to create more applications for advisers to leveraging middle all of those, refined with the enriched capability set that we're adding to them, more and more using them versus that was the type of purchase.
You're also seeing us look at transaction charges in certain areas where we're being very tactical around that. Although this holistic sort of lowering of transaction, we're trying to be very tactical about where we make those changes, such that we actually make the adjustments on where they make the most sense for our advisers that ultimately help them.
And so I think those are a couple of examples that we'll continue to pursue this year. So whatever we can do that we think is optimal to help our advisers differentiate and win in the places that matters most of them is what we're trying to solve for. Those are a couple. I hope that helps. Yes, it does. I appreciate the color. And then just one quick follow-up. Dan, I think you kind of referenced this just on the expenses. Just looking at the third bucket of expenses where we're talking about the accelerated portion. I guess, are there areas you'd call out that's going to receive those accelerated investments? Yes, this is Matt. I'll take that one. I think there's -- when you think about that third bucket, it's more about the timing of the investments. So there's no specific category. I think you go back to the investments that we're making in technology and capabilities that help improve our value proposition or help support and open up our expanded markets. And when you think about those plans, we've got multiyear plans on the things that we think are quite important. And that third bucket is really about, given the environment that we're in, accelerating some of those plans. So that's the headline there. I don't know, Dan, if there's anything you want to add. I would just give you an additional way to frame that. If you remember back at the Investor and Analyst Day that we did, we shared the framework around vertical integration and a lot of those investments are showing off that spectrum of opportunities that we have. So as we drive more and more solutions into sort of that lower in the ecosystem where it really helps the adviser operate at a local level, but you'll find it also coming all the way back to things that enhance our advisory platform. And so I think you're seeing an accelerated investment across that entire spectrum as opposed to any one specific play. So I hope that helps to keep your framework to think about how we think about the spectrum of investments and perhaps how that's been [indiscernible]. Great. Thanks so much, guys. Appreciate all the color. And our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt from KBW. Your question, please. Hi, good evening. Maybe just another question on centrally managed platforms. You mentioned that, in a response on pricing, the organic net new asset growth there is still strong but it's been decelerating over the past couple of quarters. Just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on the recent trends and then kind of where you see the opportunity to take that penetration rate to over time for the centrally managed business? Thank you. Yes. So obviously, with respect to our advisory platforms, that fits inside that overall spectrum of offering. And as we think about enriching that entire platform, one of the places we've been focused on is centrally managed solutions. And we continue to add more capabilities and more value there. We think about the investment content that's available, the ability for advisers to use that in different ways, really turning that into a UMA and expanding the SMAs that are available on it.
There's really cool enhancements and functionality that is materially improving the appeal and how one would apply it in more scenarios and cases. So we're excited about the potential opportunity and for it to continue to sort of grow share, if you will, in that overall mix of business, both with respect to advisory but we even think about it across a full spectrum of brokerage, because the more appealing we make this even at smaller accounts, where it's appropriate, and people feel that the plan is better served from that movement of brokerage to advisory, a lot of that would tend to move over to centrally managed solution.
So that's one way to think about how we add capability to make it more appealing to drive utilization. And I think we believe that upside can be significant, certainly continuing to invest in the pricing helps also drive the appeal and demand for it. And think about, as you think about last year and rightfully so, still good demand but the trend was down.
Historically speaking, centrally managed usually reacts more or is more impacted, if you will, by a challenging macro environment. The more volatility, the more sort of a downward trend in equity markets, and in fact, we had the combination of tough fixed income markets last year, and that's where we'll many times see an adviser sort of more want to put their hands on the wheel and drive that. So you're seeing some of that sort of volatility in the marketplace, the macro marketplace noise occurring in that trend. I think structurally speaking, we continue to invest in the appeal of it. And the more appealing we make it, the more it should drive up utilization on a relevant basis. I hope that helps. Good. Thank you. And then for a follow-up, maybe just a modeling question here for Matt. The DCA yield came in a bit above our expectation. I know that's formulaic really. But just wondering maybe you could provide an update on the number of accounts that flow into that program currently and how or if that number has grown recently? Yes. I mean I don't have an update on the number of accounts. I would emphasize, though, I think the point you're making, it is a fee per account. So the -- so we quote it in basis points, but it's a little hard for it to be predictive, just given balances to move up and down. So it's the account, I would emphasize they haven't changed materially. But when you get a pop perhaps like you've seen in this quarter, that may not be something that you would expect to see going forward just because it's not really rate driven, it's fee per account driven. Yes, thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Schmitt from William Blair. Your question, please. Thank you. On recruited assets, I'm just curious how the recruiting environment for advisers looks right now. I know you mentioned it is pretty strong for you. But are you seeing any competitors get more aggressive on pricing just with organic growth down for the industry, maybe they're trying to look for growth? Yes. So look, I think the recruiting environment, I think it's well documented over the last three years, the churn in the industry has slowed, right, from 2022 to -- sorry, 2020 to 2022, primarily driven on the backs of the pandemic and then the macro volatility last year, which are pretty extreme impacts. And so certainly, with less sort of swings in the batter's box, I think you have competitors that will tend to respond to that in different ways and some have gotten more aggressive on the transition of systems. That's what we're talking about, about being more aggressive.
And then certainly, when you add to that the rising interest rates that can be more robustly monetized, and thus so in underwriting around deals, you'll see transition systems get more aggressive in those types of environments. And I think it -- logic would have it, that's what would occur, and that's what we've seen over last three years.
I think, look, for us, we don't see any changes in the opportunity set. I think the -- as we think about it, the ongoing evolution of our capabilities, the expansion of our market opportunity set with our expanded affiliation models, introduction of our services group, advocacy of existing advisers from good experiences, are really the key drivers of that opportunity set and our ability to drive win rates regardless of what the churn or opportunity set is in the marketplace.
We did see the -- sorry, the market stabilizing more in the third and fourth quarter and more advisers now getting past that volatility and reengaging and exploring their strategic options. And I think to the extent that there's not some big shift in the macro, we continue to expect to see that trend occurring.
And you'll continue to see folks explore that movement from an employee-based model to independent model. We continue to see with more and more capabilities, folks in the independent model, looking for something that can serve and support them better and taking care of their clients. And finally, even with being able to help with their own succession planning creates another catalyst of opportunities.
So I think we think those things are much more important and bigger drivers of the ultimate sort of size of the movement, but certainly in the short run, there's been some noise or in immediate term, pretty extreme scenarios, right, of the macro, given the pandemic and the first equity markets last year since 2008.
I hope that helps give you some color on at least what we're seeing over the recruiting landscape. Yes, absolutely. Thank you. And then a question on the brokerage assets organic growth rate up 7% in the quarter. How much of that was driven by bank outsourcing? And I guess, like what deals specifically, any breakdown of that would be helpful. Yes. So the large financial institutions, that's what you're asking about, on the brokerage assets? Yes, right. Yes, it's relatively minor. I mean the growth rate was 7% for the quarter. Prior to that, it'd be 6.5%. So a relatively minor part of it in the quarter. Maybe to add to that, if you're curious around why the trend or better growth in brokerage over the past three to four quarters, I think that's the evolving interest rate environment and advisers using solutions that may be more brokerage-oriented solutions, whether that be fixed income or whether that be annuities of which to help clients seeking higher yield or higher rates. And so that's where you're seeing some of that growth come from that wasn't necessarily the trend prior to last year. Okay, that’s what I have looking for. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Gerry O'Hara from Jefferies. Your question please. Thanks. Maybe one for Matt. The leverage ratio of 1.4 coming down from 1.7, I think you said it kind of continue to grow in a higher interest rate environment. What do you feel is maybe sort of an optimal sort of long-term leverage ratio? I think some peers, both public and private, tend to run at a bit of a higher number. And just sort of want to get a little bit more color as to how you think this might be best set up to optimize the business, I think, kind of in a long-term environment? Thank you. Yes. I think the 1.5 to 2.5 times, I think, is really the leverage ratio that we think makes sense in a range of different economic environments. And I think the ability to maintain a strong balance sheet and have the capacity to invest for growth in a range of different environments, I think, is a key part of our value proposition.
I think it's a key part for our advisers and clients knowing that if the macro moves against us, and we're not at a leverage ratio, we're going to have to immediately pull back on investments or immediately pull back on being able to serve and support them and the host of capabilities that we have, recruiting and succession being an example.
So I think the 1.5 to 2.5 times, we landed on that with a view that that's the right leverage ratio in a range of environments. And I think it certainly a key part of the value prop that differentiates from some of the firms that you mentioned.
And I think where we are today, being at the low end or just below the low end of that, with a fair bit of capital deployment coming our way in Q1, including the acquisitions that we closed, as well as being positioned at that point in a macro that's, I think, anything but certain at this point, I think we like where we're sitting. Great. That’s it for me this evening. Thanks, guys. Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Dan Arnold for any further remarks. Thanks much, John, and I just want to thank everyone for taking their valuable time out to join us this afternoon, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.

With that, I would now turn the call over to Mr. Arnold. Thank you, Latania, and thanks to everyone for joining our call today. Over the past quarter, our advisers continue to help their clients navigate through market volatility and macroeconomic uncertainty. In doing so, they reinforce the value of their advice and collectively helped millions of Americans continue to pursue their financial goals and aspirations. We thank them for the important work and remain focused on our mission taking care of our advisers, they can take care of their clients.
Now as we look at the marketplace, we continue to experience the growing appeal of our model due to the combination of our robust and future risk platform, stability and scale of our industry-leading model and capacity and commitment to invest. As a result, we continue to make solid progress toward our vision of becoming the leader across the adviser-mediated market.
In that spirit, we will continue to focus on helping advisers and enterprises, solve challenges and capitalize on opportunities better than anyone else and thereby serving as the most appealing player in the industry. With respect to our performance, we delivered another quarter of solid results, also continuing to make progress on the execution of our strategic plan. I'll review both of these areas, starting with our first quarter business results.
In the quarter, total assets increased to $1.2 trillion as continued solid organic growth was complemented by higher equity margins. With respect to organic growth, first quarter organic net new assets were $21 billion, representing 7.5% annualized growth. This contributed to organic net new assets over the past 12 months of $99 billion, representing approximately a 9% organic growth rate. Recruited assets were $13 billion in Q1, bringing our total for the trailing 12 months to $85 billion. These results were driven by the ongoing enhancements to our model and our expanded addressable market.
Looking at same-store sales, our advisers remain focused in serving their clients and delivering a differentiated experience. As a result, our advisers are both winning new clients and expanding wallet share with existing funds. A combination that drove a sequential improvement in same-store sales in fuel, this increase occurred across all of our affiliation models led by solid growth in our enterprise team.
With respect to retention, we continue to enhance the adviser experience through the delivery of new capabilities and technology as well as the evolution of our service and operations company. As a result, asset retention for the first quarter was approximately 99% and 98% over the last 12 months. Our first quarter business results led to solid financial outcomes of $4.49 of adjusted EPS, which is more than double our level from a year ago.
Let's now turn to the progress we made on our strategic plan. Now as a reminder, our long-term vision is -- on the leader across the adviser center market, which for us is being the best at empowering advisers and enterprises to deliver great advice to their clients and to be great operators of the business.
Now to bring this vision to life, we are providing the capabilities and solutions that help our advisers, deliver personalized advice and planning experience and at the same time, through human-driven technology-enabled solutions and expertise, we are supporting advisers in their efforts to the extraordinary business.
Doing this well gives us a sustainable path to industry leadership across the adviser experience, organic growth and market share. As we look ahead, we continue to see both the growing demand for advice and increasing the appeal of receiving that advice through a financial profession, and we believe that our strategy positions us well to capitalize on these key structural trends.
Now to execute on our strategy, we organize our work around two primary categories, horizontal expansion, where we look to expand the ways that advisers and enterprises can affiliate such that we can compete for all 30,000 advisers in the marketplace. And vertical integration, where we focus on providing capabilities to solve for a broader spectrum of adviser means and in doing so, create durable, differentiated value.
Now while our strategy has not changed, we will use the framework of horizontal expansion and vertical integration to review our strategic agility. This structure is an evolution of our strategic plays framework, and you can see how the strategic plays map to this new orientation within our investor presentation.
With that as context, let's start with our efforts around horizontal expansion. This work involves meeting advisers and enterprises where they are in the evolution of the business by creating flexibility in our affiliation models, so they can design the perfect practice for themselves and clients.
As a result, this component of our strategy helps contribute to solid growth in our traditional markets, while also expanding our addressable market through our new affiliation models. Our recruiting and traditional markets continue to be a significant source of growth reaching a new first quarter high of approximately $9 billion in assets.
In the quarter, we continued to increase our win rates and expand the depth and breadth of our pipeline despite adviser movement in the industry remaining at lower levels. With respect to our new affiliation models, strategic wealth employee and our enhanced RIA offering, we delivered our strongest quarter to date, recruiting roughly $3 billion in assets in Q1. In each of these models, we continue to realize growing demand and expanding pipeline, which position them for increased contribution to our organic growth.
Looking ahead, we expect to carry this recruiting momentum into Q2 for both our traditional markets and our new affiliation models. And with respect to large enterprises, today, we announced that BMO will onboard the Wealth Management business of Bank of the West to our Enterprise platform. In addition, we continue to prepare to onboard commerce. Collectively, these two deals will add approximately $11 billion of brokerage and advisory assets in the second half of the year.
Looking ahead, we continue to build our pipeline as demand for our model growth. Now in Q1, we also continue to have success in our traditional banking credit space, adding approximately $1 billion of accreted assets from this change.
Now shifting to our vertical integration efforts. Here, we are focused on delivering value-added capabilities, services and technology that extend across an adviser's end-to-end business, all for the purpose of helping them differentiate and win in the marketplace and run driving business.
This part of our strategy is helping advisers deliver their differentiated wisdom insight and advice wrapped in an easily accessible and highly personalized experience for the client. In that spirit, this quarter, we continued to enhance our adviser's value proposition through their funds.
By introducing new account aggregation capabilities to help advisers consider their clients' holistic financial picture by enriching the end client digital portal through the expansion of customizable self-service capabilities and by evolving our research offerings to include increased market commentary, delivered how and where it works best for the adviser. Now in a separate play within our vertical integration strategy, we continue to expand and enhance our services portfolio and are encouraged by the evolving appeal of our value proposition and the seasoning of this business.
As a result of solid demand in Q1, the number of advisers utilizing our service group continued to increase. And we ended the quarter at over 3,300 active users, up roughly 30% year-over-year. Now as we work with advisers to increase the utilization of existing services, we're also continuing to create new services such as our partial book sales solution, where we provide the flexibility for advisers to sell us their smaller accounts with clients that don't necessarily fit their practice, thus creating more capacity for them to focus on managing and growing their business more robust. This service has been received well, and we are seeing solid early momentum, a growing pipeline of demand.
Now at the same time, we're seeing good success with our set of services that help solve the industry-wide challenge of up to 1/3 of advisers retiring over the next decade. In that spirit, over the past year, we've facilitated approximately 150 acquisitions among advisers through our M&A solutions program. And since launching our liquidity and succession capability in Q4, we have completed more than 10 of these deals with LPL advisers and have growing interest, both inside and outside of the LPL leak business.
In summary, in the first quarter, we continued to invest in the value proposition for advisers and their clients while driving growth and increasing our market leadership. As we look ahead, we remain focused on executing our strategy to help our advisers further differentiate and win in the marketplace. And as a result, we have long-term shareholder value.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt. All right. Thank you, Dan. And I'm glad to speak with everyone on today's call. As we move into 2023, we remain focused on serving our advisers, growing our business and delivering shareholder value. Against the backdrop of market uncertainty, our business performed well as we continue to execute on our strategic priorities.
In recent years, we've invested in capabilities, technology and service to enhance the experience of advisers, enterprises and their clients. At the same time, we've maintained a strong balance sheet with significant corporate liquidity and low leverage, positioning us to support our advisers and clients in a range of macro environments. This is most recently recognized by S&P, who upgraded our credit rating earlier this month, establishing us as an investment-grade credit with both our rating agencies.
By leveraging the investments in our platform and our financial strength, we continue to grow assets organically in both our traditional and new markets. Closed two strategic acquisitions, continued our momentum with our liquidity and succession capability and are preparing to onboard Commerce Bank, in Bank of the West in the second half of the year. We accomplished all of this while continuing to invest in our industry-leading value proposition and delivering record adjusted earnings per share. So as we look ahead, we continue to be excited by the opportunities we have to help our advisers differentiate and win in the marketplace.
Now let's turn to our first quarter business results. Total advisory and brokerage assets were $1.2 trillion, up 6% from Q4 as continued organic growth was complemented by higher [Indiscernible]. Total organic net new assets were $21 billion or a 7.5% annualized growth rate.
Our Q1 recruited assets were $13 billion, which prior to large enterprises was a record first quarter of the year. This included $3 billion of recruited assets from our new affiliation, the largest contribution since their launch a few years ago.
Looking ahead to Q2, our momentum continues across our traditional independent and new models, and we are on pace to deliver another strong quarter of recruiting. As for our Q1 financial results, the combination of organic growth, rising interest rates and expense discipline led to adjusted EPS of $4.49, the highest in our history.
Looking at our top line growth. Gross profit reached a new high of $1.02 billion, up $48 million or 5% sequentially. As for the components, commission and advisory fees net of payout were $215 million, up $43 million from Q4, primarily driven by higher advisory fees and a seasonally lower production.
In Q1, our payout rate was 86.2%, down about 220 basis points from Q4 and largely due to the seasonal reset of the production bonus at the beginning of the year as well as a nonrecurring benefit of approximately 50 basis points realized during the quarter. Looking ahead to Q2, we anticipate our payout rate will increase to approximately 87.5% primarily driven by the typical seasonal build in the production builds.
With respect to client cash revenue, it was $439 million, flat to Q4 as the impact of higher short-term interest rates was offset by a sequential decline in balance. Looking at overall client cash balances, they ended the quarter at $55 billion, down $10 billion, driven by record net buying of $37 million. Within our ICA portfolio, we added $3 billion of new fixed rate contracts, bringing our fixed rate balances to roughly 55% of the ICA portfolio within our target range of 50% to 75%.
Our ICA yield averaged 320 basis points in the quarter, up 29 basis points from Q4, primarily due to the increases in short-term rates. As for Q2, based on where interest rates are today and what we've seen with client cash balances so far in April, we expect our ICA yield to remain unchanged at approximately 320 basis.
As the full quarter benefit of the Q1 rate hikes is offset by the mix impact of lower floating rate balances. As for service fee revenue, it was $119 million in Q1, down $1 million from Q4, primarily driven by lower conference revenues, offset by seasonal increases in IRA. Looking ahead to Q2, we expect service and fee revenue to be roughly flat sequentially.
Moving on to Q1 transaction revenue. It was $49 million, up $2 million sequentially as trading volume increased slightly. Looking ahead to Q2, we expect a seasonal decline of a couple of million dollars. Now let's turn to expenses, starting with core G&A. It was $326 million in Q1.
For the full year 2023, we continue to promotional expense to increase to a range of $105 million to $110 million due to increased transition assistance resulting from strong recruiting and large enterprise onboarding as we prepare for Commerce Bank and Bank of the West to join us in the second half of this year. Looking at share-based compensation expense. It was $18 million in Q1, up from $12 million in Q4. In Q2, we expect a similar level of expense as the majority of our grants occur in the first 2 quarters of the year.
Turning to depreciation and amortization. It was $56 million in Q1, up $2 million sequentially, and we expect it to increase to approximately $60 million next quarter.
Regarding capital management. Our balance sheet remains strong. We ended Q1 with corporate cash of $234 million, down $225 million from Q4 as we closed on 2 acquisitions during the quarter. Our leverage ratio was 1.3x, down from 1.4x in Q4, driven by a combination of our continued growth and a higher interest rate environment, both of which have meaningfully improved our earnings. As for capital deployment, our framework remains focused on allocating capital aligned with the returns we generate.
Investing in organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A where appropriate and returning excess capital to shareholders. In Q1, we allocated capital across our entire frame. We continue to invest to drive and support organically. On traditional M&A, we closed on 2 acquisitions for approximately $150 million. Within our liquidity and succession offering, we closed 7 deals for around $100 million, and we continue to have a solid pace. With regards to capital return, we increased our share repurchases to $275 million in Q1. We plan to further increase share repurchases in Q2 to approximately $300 million.
To summarize, our balance sheet is strong, and we are well positioned to drive value through our capital allocation point. In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results. As we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue investing to serve our advisers, grow our business and create long-term shareholder value.
With that, operator, please open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. So maybe just kicking things off with a question for Matt on the enterprise channel. Recently, you've seen some really strong recruiting momentum within Enterprise. I was hoping to get your perspective on whether the recent stress in the banking space bolsters the case for banks to partner with LPL. And can you help quantify just where the enterprise backlog is today versus, say, the start of the year? Yes. I know you said for me, Steven, I think Dan is chomping up a bit on this figure. Yes. No, look, Steve, when you have circumstances of displacement in the marketplace as you were calling out, that can create challenges and/or opportunities and circle through some of the bank failures in Q1. We think back to 2020 with the pandemic, a much more significant impact from that.
I think in the case of the recent bank failures, we didn't necessarily see this disruption creating short-term opportunity because it was very short-lived and the impact somewhat muted. That said, I think at times like this, it does reinforce maybe some of the really important elements of this model.
So think about it this way, the value of human center port, which creates opportunity for advisers as they are providing guidance and folks need it most in times of uncertainty. It certainly helps reinforce the deal of us as a strategic partner to advisers given our strength and scale and robust capabilities, we sort of end up being even a quality. And then finally, I think right to your question or the point of your question, it does reinforce our value proposition for enterprises and in particular banks that type of disruption may be a catalyst for exploring different strategic options or alternatives for different business lines, as an example, wealth management.
And I think that certainly would create incremental demand as we go forward. Finally, our capital light model allows us to play offense and continue to invest back in the platform in order to enhance and further differentiate our reach and others perhaps can't do that in these disruptive markets are displaced a month. So I think we didn't see necessarily opportunity in the short run.
I think it does reinforce the attributes of this model and it's quite helpful to our long-term growth and our positioning in the marketplace where we can kind of turn this change in the market into unity across most disruptive sort of marketplace changes. So I hope that helps. It's really helpful color, Dan. Matt, I was really just trying to share the well, but my follow-up is going to be for Dan here. Just on the traditional independent channel, there is some evidence that recent broker-dealer consolidation activity is driving increased adviser churn. And just given the strong NNA results that we saw in March, how does the recruiting backdrop in the traditional market compared to last year? And do you expect to see an acceleration NNA given some evidence of higher adviser trend? Yes. Well, look, I mean, if we look just glance Q1 as perhaps jumping off to your question, Steven, you see the traditional recruiting markets in a solid place for us with $9 billion in assets. And that channel continues to continuously produce solid results and continues to increase over time as differentiation of our model and our capabilities creates a real appealing alternative to these advisers. And quite frankly, the flexibility in our different affiliation models gives them different sets of sort of problems or challenges to potentially solve for by moving to our platform that they're in a place where they're trying to evolve their practice depending where they are in the life cycle of their model.
So we certainly think that just as a baseline, we continue to see that part of the market strengthening and its opportunity from a recruiting standpoint. As you look forward to your point around other changes that players in the marketplace and the independent space may be contemplating or considering that certainly would take the lower baseline of churn we've seen over the last couple of years.
And obviously create what should be a much bigger appetite we set any time we change in the marketplace and new model that is going to trigger or be a catalyst for advisers to consider their sets of opportunity relative to how they practice this business going forward. And so we do believe that if those things occur, that does create more churn in the marketplace.
And we take our healing model. We take the growing capabilities out of our business development team to do a great job across all of these different affiliation models. And I think we addressed it play of and capitalize on that opportunity. So that's kind of how we see the traditional marketplace, both now and if things occur in the future, we'll be ready to is for those possibilities as they may [Indiscernible]. And our next question will come from Alexander Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Okay. So you guys announced a pretty sizable win in the RIA channel, I think, a couple of weeks ago. I think it's on the larger size from what we've seen in that kind of affiliation part of your model. So I was curious if you could speak to sort of the key attributes that maybe on the business for you guys and ultimately, what does the pipeline look like? And that part of the market and maybe just remind us on sort of the economics in that channel for LPL, either in the gross profit RIA terms or else? Thanks, Alex. This is Dan. I'll take the first part of that and then I'll flip it to Matt for kind of the part via that question. So first of all, yes, we had a nice win that you referenced a couple of weeks ago that we announced where the team did a great job of attracting CD Advisor Network, which is a new large RIA. And those apps will show up actually in second quarter or the current quarter that we're in. And look, I think this win does a couple of things.
First and foremost, reinforces the strong work the team is doing to create a really compelling and differentiated solution in this part of the market. A great example perhaps of that is how we're using our services portfolio to give these RIAs access to differentiated tools and resources, they had always had availability to access to, which are really meant to help them better operate with businesses as they go forward once on our platform.
So that's a great example of how we're building in what I might call a baseline of capability set and differentiation that can think is creating a more robust appeal for this part of the marketplace. I think if you click down specifically on CGA adviser network, and what were some of the attributes that may be attracted them, one, our very advisory-centered model I think coupled with innovative technology that they can create integrated workflows for driving efficiency in the practice and finally, in the flexibility of our solution to handle all of their assets in more integrated way on one platform.
And so at a high level, those were probably some of the bigger attributes that they were attracted to. And so look, I think as we look forward, overall, we're really excited about the opportunity and the momentum is building in this model. We have a number of new clients that have joined us so far this year as we referenced in the recruiting in Q1.
And certainly, there's more opportunities that are progressing in the pipeline. So we'll continue to invest in the capabilities here as we see this as a very attractive market to create that differentiated model and continue to contribute and accelerate growth. So hopefully, that gives you a little color on both that particular affiliation model and then specifically with CG Advisor Network. And then Alexander, on the economics, I mean, it's not too dissimilar from the enterprise channel or the large financial institutions, where on the RIA side, it would typically have a lower gross profit ROA, but the cost and specifically, the acquisition costs are also lower. So I will underwrite returns. So you get to a bottom line margin and economics that are compelling and similar to the rest of the business, but you have that dynamic similar to what you have on the large enterprise side. Okay. Great. For my second, maybe I'll ask a less question. Can we talk just about cash. I think you guys gave the ICA yield of 320 for second quarter, but maybe just an update on where cash stands today in the composition.
And also just around the philosophy you guys kind of starting on this journey of putting extensions in a couple of years ago, you're north of 50% now. Clearly, the volatility in cash balances has been something we have to live with for the last six to nine months. So as the environment continues to be sort of uncertain, do you guys anticipate to continue to extend and add more to big balances, or are you finding itself in a pretty good place here? Yes. Alex, I think on April, and I'll give some color on cash balances and maybe just how we're seeing organic growth pull through in April as well. And I think when you look at cash on both of those things as a reminder, which I'm sure you know, but the -- I'll remind anyways, there's 2 key seasonal factors for April that will hit first and first and foremost is the tax impact right? It's tax month annual taxes for our clients usually impact cash as well as NNA by about $1.5 billion.
And then in addition, given it's month 1 of the quarter, advisory fees primarily come out in that first month as well, which is around $1 billion. So those 2 seasonal factors would reduce cash by around $2.5 billion, everything else being equal. Then in addition to that, I think we've continued to see strong levels of investor engagement, but the pace of cash balance declines has continued to moderate.
So when you look at the incremental decline in April, beyond those seasonal factors, it's about $800 million. So if you look at the first 4 months of this year, the cash balance declines really peaked in January and have moderated each month since. And when you take those seasonal factors into account, the April decline is the smallest decline so far this year. So you put all that together, that it's cash sweep balances just above around $51 billion where we sit today.
On your point on fixing out the ICA balances, I think you -- I think the premise of the question summarized it well. We've got a target range of 50% to 75% with the $3 billion that we did put on this quarter. We're now within that range of 55%. And I think I like where we are. I think we feel well positioned. And of course, we'll monitor the environment from here.
And if things evolve where we think it makes sense to put on more fixed the environment there has gotten quite constructive, and we feel good about our ability to do that if it makes sense. But where we sit today in this market, I think we feel well positioned where we are. And our next question will come from Jeff Schmitt of William Blair. Just another one on the cash balances. So I think they're around 4.6% of client assets in the quarter. I understand you were saying that the pace kind of slowed, but appears to be driven by really strong sort of buy-sell activity. Are we approaching a level that you think even if the markets remain strong, it won't move below? Like I think you bottomed at 4.3% in 2019. Is that sort of a good support level? Yes. I think a few things. I think the headline answer is yes from a support level. I think the best -- the thing that we look at here, which I think you were referencing is really history is the best guy here and getting at, is there a natural amount of cash that sits in an account to manage it and to do things like facilitate rebalancing, facilitate bang advisory fees, customer withdrawals, all so you don't see an adviser not forced to make a trade that they would otherwise not make a trade to facilitate those things.
So when you look at our history, as you highlighted, when we've gotten to a place where advisers have their clients fully deployed into the marketplace, which has happened several times in our history, usually see it get down to that around 4% level. So history tells us that's the zone. And we're not seeing anything in this environment that causes us to think anything different. Okay. And then on core organic growth, I think you guided into the mid- to low teens kind of reiterated that view. What does that assume on interest rates? And would that change, I guess, if the Fed pause highest cutting in the back half of the year. How variable, I guess, is that assumption? Yes. Well, I think as I commented on the prepared remarks, right, we have prepared our spending plans to build throughout the year. So if we think there is a reason to pause or adjust, we certainly have that ability. I think we'd be very deliberate about that. I think the investments that we're making, we think, drive long-term value of the firm.
We've got our balance sheet positioned quite well to be able to do that. But if we do get an environment where the investments don't make sense or it does mean we need to pause we would, but I think sitting here today, I think we still feel quite comfortable that the 12% to 15% this year makes sense given the investments that we're making and the results that we think that will follow. And our next question will come from Kyle Voigt of KBW. A couple of follow-ups for me. The first is on Alex's RIA question. I believe CG was previously using TDA for custody and with the Schwab and Ameritrade integration happening over the next year, I think, primarily in Q3. Just wondering, are you viewing that migration as a potential catalyst for putting more RIA assets in motion, and are you targeting that as an opportunity to continue to have success in that channel. Much like we mentioned with regard to our traditional markets, that is certainly a change in the marketplace. It could be a catalyst for advisers looking different options and alternatives. And certainly, we believe that, that is a contributor to ongoing potential demand as not only we leave up to that transition, but even post that transition.
I think in terms of step function change and significant change management efforts, sometimes on the other side of those, the always look what poser would have expected a desire and wanted. And so I think that opportunity that extends both before the transition and potentially after relative to the potential opportunity set.
And I think what we're trying to do is just build a capable and feeling alternative that will structurally be attractive and create great opportunities for the advisers to see on our platform. To the extent we can do that, I think that differentiated value with the willingness and need to potentially look around at other options creates an interesting opportunity. That's what we're trying to play in. Great. And then a second follow-up is on the ICA. On the fixed rate side, I think a lot of the demand generally comes from larger banks that may have seen deposit inflows through the recent banking crisis. But in terms of that demand, I think you just noted that there were very constructive trends actually there. I guess, can you just provide a little bit more color on what you're seeing in terms of how constructive those trends are and maybe quantifying that? Sure. At a headline level, I think that the appetite of the demand for ICA balances overall, whether it be fixed or floating, is well in excess of what we have to deploy, right? So I think when we our balances were able to deploy on both sides. I think on the fixed rate side, we're just now positioned where we want to be, and we're able to do that during the quarter.
I think maybe to put some data behind it and where you could probably see it move in the marketplace itself is really on the variable rate side. And I think that when we're placing those deposits, we're starting -- if you look in the current quarter or the current market, those are now being placed at Fed funds plus 15 to 25 basis points. That was about a spread of 10 to 15 last quarter and compares to kind of flat to negative during the ended. So maybe that's probably the best place to focus on where you can see that demand for these deposits really show [Indiscernible]. Our next question will be coming from Michael Cyprus of Morgan Stanley. Maybe we could circle back to brokerage M&A strength there, quite robust, 5.5% or so organic annualized. It's up meaningfully from a year ago. So I was hoping you might be able to elaborate on what's driving the strength there on the brokerage side and how you think about the persistency of that. Let me take that. There's a couple of maybe primary drivers. As you say, you see some growth year-on-year of revision that is compared to basis. And I think One of the drivers would be we're in a rate environment that we hadn't seen for 15, 16, 17 years.
And in some cases, advisers opportunity to serve their clients to meet their needs in this rate environment leads to products that have maybe a utilization that is more appealing or easier to use as appropriate structure than an advisory. So you see some of that from way to say that, that might be familiar to or some type of bond treasury, et cetera; the other thing that I think that you see driving that growth is also the -- some of the mix in these larger enterprise wins that we've had.
They have a higher mix of brokerage than advisory. And certainly different than our typical mix of roughly 52%, 53% advisory. So when we transition those folks in, obviously, that has a shorter-term influence in the mix we see that as an opportunity. Once they get to our platform, it's a much more appealing and robust advisory platform that has more interest in pricing to the end client. We do see those as opportunities for them as a list to shift their mix over time more towards advisory. But that's what's causing that -- those are the primary drivers that you're on the ship. Great. Very helpful. And then just as a follow-up question. If we look at the gross profit ROA prior to the client cash, that also showed a very nice improvement year-on-year. It has been pretty steady in this 19 to 20 basis point range for some time. So I guess what do you see as some of the biggest opportunities to expand that over time, the gross profit ROA prior to client cash? What might be the 2 to 3 biggest of expansion over the next couple of years, where do you see some potential partial offsets? And ultimately, what level do you think this could ultimately achieve? Yes, Michael. I mean, I think what I'd emphasize is really the overall growth opportunities that we have for gross profit itself, right, things that we've talked a lot about on this call, but our overall organic growth bringing in and recruiting larger advisers, the enterprise channel, which drives gross profit growth, but actually has a lower gross profit ROA.
Like all of those things adding in our service and fee revenues and services group. Those things all drive growth there. And I think the key thing I would highlight from an ROA standpoint is as we become a larger and more diversified firm for both offerings and revenue drivers, they're just not all asset driven, especially in that service and fee revenue side, the growth that we've had in the large enterprise channel will show up as lower gross profit ROA, even though we're serving and supporting those clients in a way that can drive compelling margin. So I think it's less about the ROA from a basis point standpoint, it's really about the key drivers of our model that can drive a gross profit growth over time. And our next question comes from Brennan Hawken of UBS. Matt, I would love to circle back to the comments that you made about thinking that the prior level of cash as a percent of client assets would work as a trough this cycle. We've seen other firms, you laid out a few of the reasons for that, the need to have advisers catching the dividends and need for some base line of cash. But we've seen in other wealth management firms that have very similar business models, cash as a percentage of client assets go below prior cycle trough.
So I guess I'm just curious as to what gives you the confidence that, that trough is going to hold rather than a simple understanding that we're going to hire for longer, and therefore, prior trends might end up just being a bit different here and that fair too? Yes. Well, I think, Brennan, there's always scenarios where things can play out differently. But I think from our standpoint, history is the best guy, right? And I think from our business model, which I know you've -- you've heard us talk through a bunch, but the cash balances as a starting point are relatively small and they are transactional or operational in nature.
We've got a long-term average of around 5% or $7,000 per account. And when you look at that history, the primary factor that has moved those balances up and down is really based on the markets and where, and how advisers have their clients deployed and to your point on when that -- when those balances come down, it's typically come down to that 4%. We've seen it several times, most recently in 2021 if the market's really recovered post the onset of the pandemic. So that's what we're looking at. And I think it's a combination of the size of the balances and the history that we've seen. Okay. All right. That's fair. And just a ticky-tack one to follow-up. Yield on the money market sweeps has sort of seemed to compress a bit from where it was about a year ago, I had always thought of those as more or less fixed. Is there some sort of mix dynamic that's happening where something that's causing that to compress? And how should we be thinking about that going forward? I know it's a small impact. Just kind of curious. Yes. I think -- well, in recent periods, it's come up a little bit. You're referring to perhaps a few years ago, is that what you're looking at? No. The average yield in basis points on the money market sweep, it was 30. This quarter, it was 32 the prior quarter and then 38, in the third quarter... Yes. I just -- okay. So I'd put all those in a relatively similar zone not moving around a lot. Whenever you do see movement there, it's more about the mix is there a different firms or different paths. There's nothing from a pricing standpoint going on there. And as you said, the balances there are really small. So it's usually a mix. Our next question will come from Craig Siegenthaler of Bank of America. So we saw that annuity sales were up a lot. I think commissions were up 52% year-on-year. I'm curious white annuities are the clients buying? And have you seen an increase in surrenders of older annuities, just given the wide gap between where count rates are compared to where annuities were offered over the last decade. Yes. I think the short answer to your question is what I said earlier that in this rate environment that we haven't seen for an extended period of time, there's an opportunity to use fixed annuities as a way to help people with their desires around yield or yield that leads to lifetime income and that opportunity has largely been muted for an extended period of time.
And so because of that, it's not surrenders or exchanges from prior annuities, I think you would have seen that coming are being forced to come out of variable annuities that were set up and created for a different focus. And so this is typically new money that has opportunity to find higher yields with the pent-up demand for those higher yields that are, I think, well positioned and suited to support their long-term income needs in retirement. So that's the primary driver of that. And just 1 question on your advisory relationships. But what percentage of LPL advisers with advisory relationships, charge fees on total client AUA versus net client AUA after backing out client cash. Yes. Well, so first of all, there's limits to the amount of cash that someone can hold for a period of time within an advisory account or they're required to either put that money to work or move those assets out of that advisory account. So that's your control relative to high amounts of cash inside advisory accounts. That said, their cash that they use inside of the account at a appropriate levels as we talked about before is part of the fee that is charged. And our next question will come from Michael Cho of JPMorgan. I just wanted to follow up on capital allocation again. I mean you mentioned for the leverage continues to tick lower, and you've got $4 billion of firepower. If you think about the inorganic bucket, just given the changing backdrop and across bacon banking and I realize you just said nothing kind of near-term changes from recruiting or partnerships. But are there any segments or channels that you might be focused on more when you think about organic just as a LPL spire power just continues to grow.
And then just relatedly, just in terms of the new liquidity and succession offering, it looks like you're having some good success there with the growing pipeline. I mean can you just remind us how much capital you're looking to allocate there? And maybe just the capacity for a number of deals annually or a dollar amount. But just -- yes, if you can just provide an update there. Sure. I'll start with liquidity and succession. I mean I think that if you look at what we did in the quarter, I think it's a good guide and the opportunity here to focus here from a capital standpoint is it's relatively small, right? We're deploying capital, using disciplined return thresholds, which usually leads to purchase multiples in the 6 to 8x EBITDA zone.
The size of the deals are usually relatively small in the $10 million to $20 million range. So it's less a big use of capital, and it's more about really the capability that we're that we've built there to help transition practices to the next generation, right?
So that's the key for the offering. I think on your main -- I think on your first question, make sure we got it as far as the opportunity set in the interest in -- from an M&A standpoint. I mean I think when you just look at where we have participated as a company, it's across several channels, but anything that would really accelerate our strategy, whether it be in our advancing in our traditional markets, expanding into newer markets, so the employee channel is an example that we did.
And if we can do so in a way that just matches our strategy, that we've got the operational capacity to do it really well and then it meets our disciplined financial hurdles. I think that's how we'd be interested from an M&A standpoint. Dan, anything you want to add to that? We also look always at capabilities, the interesting capabilities that will accelerate our strategy and create a better opportunity with interesting returns versus building them ourselves or renting them. We are always open for spring that too. So that's just the only other element of M&A that I might. And then just a quick follow-up on the G&A. I mean, now you talked about some flexibility throughout the year, just given how things kind of shake out in the big picture. But are there any certain projects or initiatives that you'd call out that again, you might call in terms of the accelerated investments where you may pause if the environment changes later in the year? Not particularly. I mean maybe just to emphasize the construct and how we build up to the 12% to 15%. I mean I think that from a prioritization standpoint, we're investing first and foremost to support the core business. right? And each of those categories is about a 4% to 5% growth in the year. The second category is really about expanding our markets and scaling our new services.
And then that third category is really being opportunistic given the environment to accelerate components of the strategy. So if we are pulling back, it would be more in that it would be first in that third category, which is less about a specific initiative and more about -- we're just doing some things that we would have otherwise have waited until 2024 over and beyond. And our last question will come from Bill Katz of Credit Suisse. Just coming back to the opportunity to sort of picks up versus flow. So it sounds like the 55% is about where you want to be. And sort understand that you've done a great job of managing through the rate cycle in the past. But to play devil's advocate for a moment, if you look at the forward curve, and its point is pretty sharp production, if you will. And you think that the sorting is sort of coming to a conclusion and the cash balances are starting to stabilize, why not try and fix out a bit more just to reduce some of the risk to earnings in '24 and '25? Yes, Bill I think when we form that target range of 50% to 75%, I mean, it was contemplated that would be the range we'd want to be in a range of interest rate environment. And it's not about being clear going on rates and picking exactly when and how and what percentage to do. It's about increasing the stability of our earnings. And I think we like where we're positioned in that range I'm not saying we're going to -- we're going to sit there forever. That's how we feel today if the environment changes or the dynamic changes, we'll adjust. But I think we really like where we're positioned right now. Okay. That's helpful. And then just coming back to capital for a moment. Thank you for the guidance on buyback into a new quarter. But if I take that and your dividend, it looks like the payout ratio on sort of consensus numbers for the quarter, plus or minus some updates from today is almost 80%, 90%. And when I look at your corporate cash, that number ex the $200 million bogey that you normally like to keep handy leaves very little incremental liquidity.
So as you think about inorganic opportunities, liquidity and succession, and other use of cash. How do you think about the interplay between free cash flow deployment and balance sheet leverage, particularly given the macro backdrop? Yes. Well, I think the key thing there, Bill, is we'll manage liquidity based on our leverage ratio, right? So we're below the low end of our target range of 1.5 to 2.5. So we think about liquidity capacity across all three areas, right, investing for organic growth, M&A and returning capital to shareholders. I think we feel well positioned we're at that. We're below the low end of that range. So that's where we manage that and we feel good where we are. And I'm showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the conference back to Dan for closing remarks. Thanks. And I just want to thank everyone for taking the time to join us this afternoon. We certainly appreciate your investment in time. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

Over the past quarter, our advisors continued to provide their clients with personalized financial guidance on the journey to help them achieve their life goals and dreams. To help support that important work, we remained focused on our mission, of taking care of our advisors so they can take care of their clients.
This quarter, we continued to see the appeal of our model grow due to the combination of our robust and feature-rich platform, the stability and scale of our industry-leading model and our capacity and commitment to invest back into the platform. As a result, we continue to make progress toward our vision of becoming the leader across the advisor-mediated market.
In that spirit, we remain focused on helping advisors and enterprises solve challenges and capitalize on opportunities better than anyone else and thereby serve as the most appealing player in the industry. With respect to our performance, we delivered another quarter of solid results while also continuing to make progress on the execution of our strategic plan.
I'll review both of these areas, starting with our second quarter business results. In the quarter, total assets increased to $1.2 trillion as continued solid organic growth was complemented by higher equity markets.
With respect to organic growth, second quarter organic net new assets were $22 billion, representing 7.4% annualized growth or approximately 8% when adjusted for seasonal tax payment. This contributed to organic net new assets over the past 12 months of 84% billion representing approximately an 8% organic growth rate. In Q2, recruited assets were $19 billion, which represents a quarterly record, excluding periods when on-boarding large enterprises.
This outcome was driven by the ongoing enhancements to our model as well as our expanded addressable market. Looking at same-store sales, our advisors remain focused on serving the clients and delivering a differentiated experience. As a result, our advisors are both winning new clients and expanding wallet share with existing combination that drove solid same-store sales in Q2.
With respect to retention, we continue to enhance the adviser experience through the delivery of new capabilities and technology as well as the evolution of our service and operations functions. As a result, asset retention for the second quarter and over the last 12 months was approximately 99%. Our second quarter business results led to solid financial outcomes of $3.94 adjusted EPS, an increase of 76% from a year ago.
Let's now turn to the progress we made on our strategic plan. Our long-term vision is to become a leader across the adviser center market, which for us means being the best at empowering advisors and enterprises to deliver great advice to their clients and to be great operators of the business.
To bring this vision to life, we are providing the capabilities and solutions that help advisors deliver personalized advice and planning experiences to their clients. And at the same time, through human-driven technology-enabled solutions and expertise, we're supporting advisors in their efforts to be extraordinary business. Doing this well gives us a sustainable path to industry leadership across the adviser experience, organic growth and market share.
Now to execute on our strategy, we organized our work around two primary categories: horizontal expansion, where we look to expand the ways that advisors and enterprises can affiliate such that we can compete for all 300,000 advisors in the adviser-mediated market. And vertical integration, where we focus on providing capabilities that solve for a broader spectrum of adviser needs and in doing so, create durable, differentiated value.
With that as context, let's start with our efforts around horizontal expansion. This work involves meeting advisors and enterprises where they are in the evolution of the business by creating flexibility in our affiliation model, so they can design the perfect practice for themselves and for the client.
As a result, this component of our strategy helps contribute to solid growth in our traditional markets, while also expanding our addressable market through our new affiliation. Now over the quarter, we saw strong recruiting in our traditional independent market, reaching a new quarterly high of approximately $14 billion in assets.
At the same time, due to the appeal of our model and the efficacy of our business development team, we maintained our industry-leading win rates while also expanding the breadth and depth of our pipeline. With respect to our new affiliation models, strategic well employee and our enhanced RIA offering, we delivered our strongest quarter to date, recruiting roughly $4 billion in assets in Q2.
In each of these models, we continue to experience growing demand and expanding pipeline which position them for increased contribution for our organic growth. Looking ahead, we expect to carry this recruiting momentum into Q3 for both our traditional independent market and our new affiliation.
Now as a complement to our organic growth, we also recently announced the planned acquisition of Ground Capital, a California-based firm with approximately 260 advisors and $6.5 billion client assets. This transaction will give Ground Capital's advisors access to our differentiating capabilities, technology and service. We look forward to onboarding them early next year.
With respect to large enterprises, we recently onboarded Bank of the West and are on track to onboard Commerce Bank in August. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by our growing momentum and strong pipeline across the broader enterprise market, including in our traditional bank and credit loans.
Now shifting to our vertical integration efforts. Here, we are focused on delivering value-added capabilities, services and technology that extend across an adviser's end-to-end business, all for the purpose of helping them differentiate and win in the marketplace and run thriving business. In that spirit, this quarter, we launched a new performance optimization solution called Practice Hub. This capability delivers comprehensive data in a structured format, so advisors can better understand their performance on an absolute and relative basis.
And over the coming months, we will further expand the functionality by enabling it to generate personalized insights around additional services, technology and solutions we offer in order to help advisors enhance the overall performance of the practice.
Over time, we see Practice Hub becoming a key tenet of our adviser experience, leveraging the power of artificial intelligence to operate as a co-pilot for our advisors. And while we're still in early innings, we're excited about the growth opportunities that this innovation unlocks and how it will serve as an additional leverage point to help advisors run thriving business.
Now in a separate play within our vertical integration strategy, we continue to expand and enhance our services role and are encouraged by the evolving appeal of our value proposition and the seasoning of this business. As a result of demand in Q2, the number of advisors utilizing our services group continued to increase. We ended the quarter with approximately 3,500 active users, up roughly 30% year-over-year.
As we work with advisors to increase the utilization of existing services, we're also continuing to create new services, such as our tax planning solution, which is part of our broader suite of comprehensive advice and planning services. This new solution helps enable tax intelligent advice that can deliver material savings to clients and help further differentiate adviser's value proposition.
This service is receiving positive early feedback in demand in the market while also unlocking interesting synergies with our existing services portfolio. Now as we continue to evolve our services portfolio, we are leveraging our structured approach to innovation in order to address the needs of our broader adviser base.
In that spirit, we are creating streamlined versions of existing solutions to help advisors who may have less complex products. Examples of these solutions include CFOs essentials, digital marketing and payroll, all of which are progressing through our innovation pipeline. As we move forward, we remain focused on enhancing and expanding our services portfolio to better support our advisors and enterprises and to drive growth.
In summary, in the second quarter, we continued to invest in value proposition for advisors and their firms while driving growth and increasing our market leadership. As we look ahead, we remain focused on executing our strategy to help our advisors to further differentiate win in the marketplace and as a result, we've got long-term shareholder value.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt. Thank you, Dan, and I'm glad to speak with everyone on today's call.
In the second quarter, we remained focused on serving our advisors, growing our business and delivering shareholder value. This focus led to strong organic growth in both our traditional and new markets, and we continue to build momentum in our liquidity and succession offering.
In addition, we entered into an agreement to acquire the Wealth Management business of Crown Capital, onboarded Bank of the West earlier this month and are preparing to onboard Commerce Bank later this quarter. We accomplished all of this while continuing to invest in our industry-leading value proposition. So as we look ahead, we continue to be excited by the opportunities we have to help our advisors differentiate and win in the marketplace.
Now let's turn to our second quarter business results. Total advisory and brokerage assets were $1.2 trillion, up 6% from Q1 as continued organic growth was complemented by higher equity markets. Total organic net new assets were $22 billion or a 7.4% annualized growth rate. Our Q2 recruited assets were $19 billion, which prior to large enterprises was a new record. This included $4 billion of recruited assets from our new affiliation models, which is also a new record.
Looking ahead to Q3, our momentum continues, and we are on pace to deliver another strong quarter of recruiting. As for our Q2 financial results, the combination of organic growth, rising interest rates and expense discipline led to adjusted EPS of $3.94.
Looking at gross profit, it was $990 million, down $30 million or 3% sequentially. As for the components, commission and advisory fees net of payout were $218 million, up $3 million from Q1, primarily driven by organic growth and higher advisory. In Q2, our payout rate was 86.7%, up about 50 basis points from Q1 due to typical seasonality.
Looking ahead to Q3, we anticipate our payout rate will increase to 87.5%, driven by typical seasonality as well as the onboarding of Commerce Bank and Bank of the West. With respect to client cash revenue, it was $396 million, down $42 million from Q1, driven by a sequential decline in cash balances.
Looking at overall client cash balances, they ended the quarter at $50 billion, down $5 billion from Q1. The primary driver of the decrease was typical April seasonality when the majority of quarterly advisory fees and tax payments hit. As we move beyond April, the pace of declines moderated in both May and June.
Within our ICA portfolio, the mix of fixed rate balances increased to roughly 60% within our target range of 50% to 75%. Our ICA yield averaged 322 basis points in the quarter, up 2 basis points from Q1 as the increase in short-term rates was partially offset by a decline in higher yielding floating rate balances. As for Q3, based on where client cash balances, and interest rates are today, we expect our ICA yield to decline by a few basis points as the mix impact of lower floating rate balances is partially offset by the benefit of higher short-term interest rates.
As for service and fee revenue, it was $123 million in Q2, up $4 million from Q1, primarily driven by strong organic growth. Looking ahead to Q3, we expect service and fee revenue to increase by a few million sequentially, driven by revenues from our National Adviser Conference.
Moving on to Q2 transaction limit. It was $47 million, down $2 million sequentially due to decreased trading volume. As we look ahead to Q3, we expect transaction revenue to be relatively flat with Q2. Now let's turn to expenses starting with core G&A. It was $337 million in Q2.
Looking ahead, given our strong levels of organic growth and the variable costs associated with supporting that growth, we are increasing the lower end of our 2023 core G&A range by $10 million.
We now expect our 2023 core G&A to be in a range of 1,345,000,000 to 1,370,000,000. To give you a sense of the near-term timing of the spend in Q3, we expect our G&A to increase by $5 million to $10 million sequentially.
Moving on to Q2 promotional expense. It was $107 million up $5 million sequentially, primarily driven by increased transition assistance resulting from strong recruiting and large enterprise onboard.
In Q3, we expect promotional expense to increase to approximately $125 million to $130 million, primarily driven by conference spend as we will host our largest adviser conference of the year next week as well as the onboarding of two large enterprises, Bank of the West, Commercebank. Looking at share-based compensation expense with $17 million in Q2, down $1 million from Q1. In Q3, we expect share-based compensation expense to be roughly flat sequentially.
Turning to depreciation and amortization. It was $58 million in Q2, up a modest $2 million sequentially given it was a low deployment quarter. Looking ahead to Q3, our plans for technology spend have not changed. We expect more deployments in the quarter. As a result, we expect depreciation and amortization to be roughly $65 million.
Regarding capital management. Our balance sheet remains strong. We ended Q2 with corporate cash of $325 million, up $91 million from Q1. Our leverage ratio was 1.2x, down from 1.3x in Q1 driven by a combination of our continued growth and a higher interest rate environment, both of which have meaningfully improved our earnings power.
I would also note that earlier this month, we increased the size of our parent revolver from $1 billion to $2 billion. Given the significant growth of our business in recent years, the added capacity enables us to operate comfortably within our target range of 1.5 to 2.5x and leaves us well positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities.
As for capital deployment, our framework remains focused on allocating capital aligned with the returns we generate, investing in organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A where appropriate and returning excess capital to shareholders.
In Q2, we allocated capital across our entire frame. We continue to invest to drive and support organic growth. Specific to our liquidity and succession offering, momentum is building, and we continue to have a solid pipeline. To date, we closed 15 deals for approximately $200 million, including four deals for around $50 million in Q2. With regards to capital return, we increased our share repurchases to $350 million in Q2 as we took advantage of the pullback in our share price.
As we look ahead to Q3, we plan to repurchase $250 million of our shares, consistent with our plan to execute on our $2 billion authorization over two years. To summarize, our balance sheet is strong and we are well positioned to drive value through our capital allocation framework.
In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results. As we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue investing to serve our advisors, grow our business and create long-term shareholder value.
With that, operator, please open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for the question. Dan, why don't we start with the kind of broader discussion around organic growth. We've obviously seen a very steady improvement in recruited assets from you guys over the last few quarters 2Q of north of $18 billion. I think that was a record outside of the larger kind of enterprise recruitment that you've done. So maybe a little bit of color on what are you seeing on the ground in terms of various affiliation options that are driving this improvement? And how does this inform your net new asset growth expectations for the rest of the year? Yes. Thanks, Alex. So look, as a jumping off point, as you said, we saw 4% growth during the quarter. And I think prior to seasonal tax payments, you get closer to the 8% is probably to go back [ph] the top, if you think about the remainder of the year. And look, we also saw that momentum build over the last week where growth has nearly doubled with preceding quarters, excluding the impact of large enterprises.
So as you said and like proactively, really strong momentum in that traditional independent model and then our new affiliation models. Drivers of Q2 results or outcomes. I think you got to look at the 1% attrition rate or versus 99% for the pension rates and look at that as a really solid and going consistent outcome over the past three quarters. And then that's complemented by the strong recruiting inside of core delivery [ph] that we talked about.
I think if you look then into Q3 as we go sort of short term out into the next quarter, you saw good solid momentum building throughout the quarter across again, additional models and the affiliation models. So, we expect to see that momentum pull into Q3. And then that certainly then is complemented by the larger enterprises that are being onboarded in third quarter. So that sets up what we think is a really interesting and solid order of growth. It's driven both by the recruiting as well as low retention rates.
And then we're also seeing that steady contribution from same-store sales, especially in a marketplace where we've had higher rates and equity markets moving up, advisers are getting on for batter's box [ph] for the capital, as you see in our net buys from sales. And so, we think that sets up well as we look forward to the rest of the year. Hi, got you. Thanks. And Matt, a follow-up for you just around cash dynamics. So you guys are currently, I think, at about 60% fixed portion of the ICA portfolio sort of well inside your long-term range, but that's been largely a function of outflows that are coming out of the variable balances. So as you look at the maturity ladder here over the next, call it, 12 months or so and assuming the curve will stay kind of in line with the forward rate, what is your appetite to maybe reinvest some of these balances into floating rates to be at the lower range of your 50% to 75% allocation fixed and then within that, maybe just a quick update on where July balance is then as well? Thanks. I think that was two follow-ups, Alex. Two, we'll hit them. We'll hit them for you. I think so on the target range, I think we feel good where we are, which is right in the middle of the range of 60%. And I think you know this well, but just to reiterate, we did a lot of work on setting that target range and to be a range that we're comfortable with in a range of interest rate environments and primarily focused on stability of earnings and not trying to be clear going on picking spots in moments to invest when we think the curve is good from an interest rate standpoint.
So really like where we're positioned. I think the specific of your point, as those balances mature, we would intend to maintain that middle of the range. So, I don't think we need to move. But to the extent your question was when things mature, would you redeploy them, that would be - yes, that would be our perspective today. But it's really about being right in the middle of that range and being comfortable with that spot.
I'd highlight, too, in the environment for placing those cash rebalances from a fixed rate has continued to improve. So the demand is there. The pricing has improved, meaning the spread above where whatever term you are on the curve. We see a similar thing on the floating rate side. So, we've got a good environment to place those deposits to the extent that we want to do so. But headline is we like where we are on the fixed rate.
As far as how things are going in July, I'd say the headline is consistent with the broad adviser and investor engagement we've been seeing as well as the seasonality you would typically see in the month one of a quarter. So specifically on those cash balances, we have advisory fees primarily hit in the first month of the quarter, those are about $1.1 billion, so that will reduce cash in the month of July.
And then beyond that, we've seen, again, continued strong levels of investor engagement, continued elevated levels of net buying activity. I'd say consistent with the pace in Q2 I mean if you look at our trends there, we really peaked on that buying in Q1. So, July is looking more like the pace that we saw in Q2. And I think the cash balance declines themselves coming from that just continue to moderate lower than we saw earlier in the year.
And I think so far, we're in July, it's about a $600 million decline above the advisory fees of $1.1 billion. And maybe just to put that in context, when you look at the pace of decline we've seen since the moderation, which would be starting in May. It's about 1/5th the pace of decline that we saw earlier in the year, earlier in the year being January to April. So, we're seeing that moderation. Balance is still coming down slightly, but a much, much, much lower pace.
And while we're talking to, I know you didn't ask about it, I'll give you an answer to the fourth question you didn't ask, which is how organic growth is going in the month of July. And kind of building on Dan's comments, the momentum, especially from a recruiting standpoint, just continues into July that we saw in the first and second quarter. So prior to bringing on Bank of the West, we're tracking in the 6% to 6.5% growth -- organic growth zone for July, which compare that to July of last year, which was in the low 4% range.
So it's a nice improvement there. And then just under $5 billion of assets for Bank of the West will come on in July. When you add that, we're looking at organic growth of around 11% for the month. So taking a step back, we described July is just the momentum we saw in Q2 just continuing in a real positive way. Perfect. And thank you for all that. You bet. One moment for our next question. And our next question will be coming from Devin Ryan of JMP Securities. Your line is open, Devin. Thanks so much. Just want to start on the enterprise channel. Obviously, LPL now has a number of large validating wins there. Data that's built here with partners that you can now show to potential partners in the future. And so, I'd just love to talk about how the narrative has changed with enterprises where you can really explicitly show them the value prop. And at the same time, it seems like the bar just around regulatory and scale, which is only moving higher and higher for enterprises to operate through a broker-dealer. So, I just love to maybe hash it out a little bit and then what that means if anything for your pipeline there? Thanks. Devin, where you are, your hypothesis is right, obviously, as the business model has seasoned in and we have the clients who have experienced real results, right? The evolution of the dialogue is sort of a natural one as you suggested. And I think - so first and foremost, you start out with capabilities and make sure that hypothetically, they're going to enhance the economics. They're going to streamline and enhance the client experience.
They're going to create a more scalable model and a more competitive one for even tracking and maintaining better advisers. And then I think as we've been - you can ultimately make sure that capabilities to do that, and you can pull through those results and that creates then the opening and the white space to focus more time on then how do you help them go that business through the expansion of advisers and the practices as well as activity is.
And I think that's sort of the rhythm that we're finding where you produce those positive outcomes of enhanced risk management, operational efficiency and enhanced economics. And now we're in that stage of very intentional working to help them grow organically their ultimate results within their wealth management programs and platform. I think the other thing that we've been able to do is seasonal is completely reimagined and transform the onboarding or change management effort to bring these programs onto the platform.
That's always somewhat of an obstacle to work through any time as part of the value proposition. And I think the easier lower, we can make that hurdle. And then with the experience of being able to record expire outcomes, that's certainly is helping, I think, streamline not only make the model more appealing, but also make it sort of more beaches accessible right. So we hurdle [ph] that's there.
And so, that's where we are in the dialogue is being able to use those outcomes have a dialogue with larger enterprises traditionally the banks, but also expanding that value proposition outside of just banks to that broader enterprise by marketplace. And so as we do that, it's a longer sales cycle, but the pipeline continues to grow. And we feel really confident as we go forward that this is a growth that contributor to organic. Okay and thanks. We appreciate the color now. Just a follow-up on some of the technology initiatives. So I think last year, you guys have spent $270 million on technology. That's clearly growing again this year, and that's going to be many multiples of really the vast majority of your peers. And so I'd love to just maybe digging a little bit deeper. And if you can frame just the degree and importance of kind of this technology differentiation that you think you're building at LPL for those peers. And you touched on AI, Dan, the prepared remarks and application there. So just kind of interplay with that and maybe how you're thinking about AI applications just more broadly to improve the experience for advisers and also help reduce costs at the firm over time? Thanks. Yes, absolutely. So, we do think that the quality of the capability set, if you think about that vertical integration concept that we described to you, we think that is one of the most important elements of creating the model and driving organic growth. So with that as context and we think investing in that vertical integration strategy or reinvesting in that platform to enhance capabilities is a significant priority.
And we should allocate capital appropriately relevant to that on - so I gave you a bit of a framework to think about where we invest there. I give it to you over kind of six elements. One would be the end plan experience. So that's the adviser helping them with a holistic advice to continue to enrich 1 of the key elements of the art of being a financial advisers, all the advice. Third one is the wealth management platform that's been for how they solve the needs of clients next feed on their advice.
And then the other three elements are more about helping them operate successful and in advising business. So think about flexibility to building the perfect practice for them. That's where you get the affiliation models, that's where you also get the investment in service -- business services portfolio that we've been talking about it now. That's where you also get the investment in operating it.
We want to make sure that we create a favorable and efficient platform, which all of these advisers spin practice in. And then ultimately, I think we've got an enhancement of our overall service - those are the six categories that I call them commercial categories or in the context of needs for our clients that we're investing in both technology, capital for technology purposes and then also non-technology think about services.
And if we're creating this integrated platform, it creates better workflows and better services wrapped around that technology that ultimately help these advisers to create advisers and run driving businesses we think that's a winning formula to continue to create a more appealing platform that drives more successful outcomes for advisers.
With respect to your question around AI and where we sprinkle that in terms of that investment along the operating platform itself and within our service model, we're already using AI both in terms of think about robotics, machine learning as a way to scale, predictable and feasible operating processes. We're using AI in terms of enhancing the efficacy of our data analytics and determining aspects, action associated with our risk management efforts within our operating platform.
We've created a new digital capabilities that are now taking as much as 15% to 20% of the volume that has traditionally come into our service model to help folks with a better digital experience and incorporates an AI into that. And I think with generative AI, where you get into using AI for more creative activities, we see the interesting opportunity to continue to enhance both the adviser and the investor experience on Uber chance personalization.
I think also we see it as an opportunity to create efficiency in our own models where you think about those creative jobs, take them marketing, take engineers baked again in service and operations, and you begin to really think about enhancing the scalability of the model. So the reason we invest it gives you a little flare for kind of how we're allocating that investment and then how we're beginning to explore and utilize AI.
We've been using it for a couple of years, but I think with this degenerative AI or AI it opens up some interesting possibilities. We're just in the early innings of imagine. We like to ask and challenge ourselves. Imagine if we could create AI as an additional team member for every single practice, which is a highly efficient scale of the team and that's a pretty cool initiative being to solve through. I hope that helps. Yes, no it's very helpful. Thank you so much. Appreciate it. And one moment for our next question. Our next question will come from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Hi, good afternoon. This is Michael and I am going start this is on for Steven. I did want to start off going back maybe to the organic growth side. Certainly nice to see the ramp there through the end of the quarter. I did want to ask on the competitive dynamics. A larger independent player is planning to undergo a rather substantial restructuring effort.
It looks like some of the resulting attrition has been a relatively significant contributor to your recruiting year-to-date. Can you help us size how significant of a tailwind that's been? And how sustainable is this source of organic growth? Yes. So look, I think if you look at the marketplace, right, and what you're really getting at is how do we think about sizing of the marketplace, at least up through second quarter if you look at the opportunity set, adviser movement has largely remained pretty flat at around 5% turnover for the last year, which is a lower level movement than historical norms, as you well know. That said, there has been a mix shift in that sort of turnover, but we're seeing positive movement or more positive movement in the traditional independent market and there's been a slowdown from the wireless.
As we look out sort of and look forward at some of what competition is doing, whether it be through integrations, restructurings, et cetera. Those things can create more churn or more turnover in the marketplace. And we think we are well positioned across all of our different affiliation models to make sure that we can capitalize should that opportunity increase and more turnover occur in the marketplace that we're well positioned, capitalized and in much greater share of that opportunity that will emerge.
So we do think about structurally our opportunity, but we're also trying to position for different market opportunities that may emerge within the structural strategy. Very helpful. And then just switching over to expenses. Understanding it's a bit early maybe to be thinking about 2024 as we think about rate cuts coming down the pike and the strong organic growth you're seeing, how should we be thinking about core G&A growth beyond '23. It sounds like 4% to 5% is the first building block to run the business, but how much incremental investment should we be anticipating? Yes. I mean I think we're -- as you could imagine, we're in the midst of planning for '24 right now, and we'll share our thinking on it later in the year as we typically do. But I think to your question and maybe just highlight a little bit of how we're approaching it, which is, as we normally do, is focusing first on the investments really to drive and support organic growth.
And at the same time, making sure that we're delivering appropriate and compelling operating leverage and really balancing those 2 things. And I think when you look at 23%, the macro environment provided an opportunity for us to accelerate investments that we otherwise would have done in '24 and beyond. And that was driven by the opportunity that, that macro represented. So I think when we're planning for '24, it will all depend on what that macro outlook looks like. Of course, there's a scenario as you described that rates could start to come down.
So we will certainly factor that in, and we've got - I think our history demonstrates we've got the flexibility to adjust based on that environment. And we've also got, I think, the confidence to invest in things that - where we have the confidence they're going to drive growth. So we'll focus on balancing those things. And we'll share more color on those plans as we typically do at our year-end earnings call. But the headline would be our principles and our approach are going to remain the same. Great. And if I could just squeeze a quick housekeeping 1 in here. Tax rate was elevated during the quarter. What drove that? And if you could provide an update on what the go-forward outlook for tax, that would be helpful. Yes. I think about tax rate just as a kind of a core normalized tax rate in the 26% to 27% zone. We've been running below that for a while, primarily from tax benefits from employee stock sales and deductions that have come from that. And there were just fewer in the quarter. And that's why I kind of moved back up to that - closer to that normalized 26%, 27%. So I think all else equal, if you're looking for a placeholder for going forward. I think 26% to 27% is the best way to think. Thanks so much. And one moment for our next questions. And our next question will be coming from Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Your line is open Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. In addition to strong organic growth, you've also been active on the inorganic side. So was hoping you could talk about just the pipeline and conversations and how we should think about inorganic uses of -- or for growth as we think about the remainder of this year and kind of the current backdrop of what's out there. Yes. So as we go forward, we'll continue to use M&A as a complement to our organic growth. So no change there as you suggested. And I think, look, as we in order to do that or execute well on that, we're consistently assessing the marketplace and the landscape and are typically focused on 3 categories of opportunity, the first for transactions to grow in our markets where we can capitalize on our market leadership and add scale.
In those cases, we're able to create value for the advisers and those practices when they transition onto our platform. And we look across the landscape of -- I'll think about anywhere from smaller broker-dealers and RIAs upward. Examples of that is bidding [indiscernible], and of course, most [indiscernible] from capital. So again, I think we remain focused on the marketplace we do think there will be ongoing consolidation, and we remain positioned to explore those opportunities. I think a complement to that, we also look to places or transactions that could add capabilities right, where we can create value for advisers and ultimately help them drive efficiency into their practices or enhance growth.
Any time we think about that type of transaction, we'll, of course, look at it through the lens of build, buy or partner as capabilities and transactions include advisory world and [indiscernible] and those [indiscernible], we continue to really evolve how we think about investing back capabilities and how they ultimately create value in unintended places when we originate those so we like that type of opportunity.
And then finally, the third is just deploying capital against the liquidity and succession needs that are out in the market. And certainly, this gives us a pathway to put capital work that meets our disciplined return thresholds and solving a really important question for advisers in the marketplace in a rather differentiated or unique way. And we've got continued opportunity internally with respect to helping our advisers. There are already on a platform with that question and we're beginning to see external exploration as well as how we help advisers that part on the platform with that type of need. So that's the framework.
That's kind of where we've got our focus, and we continue to assess the marketplace for those opportunities remain. That's helpful. And then Matt, just a follow-up on the promotional spend guide, the step-up, which you cited associated with the onboarding as well as the conference. Can you separate out that so we get a sense of kind of the economics associated with some of these larger onboarding enterprise customers? Yes. Well, directionally. I mean, I think when you look at the guide for Q3, it's really driven by three factors. Conference timing is the biggest second on-boarding of the 2 large enterprises and third is really supporting organic growth. So I think when you look at conference spend, that is -- that first bucket, that is the biggest driver.
As a reminder, it's our largest conference. It happens in Q3 every year. We've got over 8,000 attendees coming, which is a new record for us, which we're excited about, is just the engagement from our clients and their guests and being in person with us. So it's our largest conference and the largest at that conference has been. So that's the biggest component of the sequential change.
Now we do have two large enterprises that we are onboarding in 1 quarter, right? So that would typically be elevated, both Bank of the West and Commerce. And then the last thing I would hit is just overall recruiting momentum. When you look at the quarter -- the strong quarters we had in Q1 and Q2 and the strength of our pipeline coming into the related transition assistance that would come from that would also be a driver. But broadly, that first bucket conferences is going to be the largest piece of that. Great. Thank you. And one moment for our next questions. And our next question will come from Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. You guys have had some early success with your newer RIA-only model. I was hoping you could talk about your competitive positioning there, how your offering and pricing differs from others in the marketplace on the RIA only model. as you look out over the next 12 to 24 months, what sort of enhancements that you might be able to make to that offering to further accelerate growth from here? Yes. Thanks for the question, Michael, and happy to provide some color on enhanced RIA model. So headline is, look, the RIA market, as you know, is large and fast growing, which presents interesting strategic opportunities. So we have been investing to position ourselves for outsized share gains there. And how we think about allocating those investments, well, first and foremost, it's created a differentiated offering in the marketplace.
And while at the same time, improving our awareness that we are a competitive and credible alternative to more of the income in the marketplace. So as we do this, our right to win continues to increase, and we believe that positions us well as we go forward, both in the near term and the long term. If I give you a little bit more color, as you ask on sort of how we think about enhancing the value proposition. Certainly, the flexibility in our model to handle all assets in a more integrated way on our platform continues to be an advantage. Certainly, then that's complemented by the vertical integration strategy.
We're able to provide value not just at the traditional clearing custody level within the ecosystem, but also with respect to technology operating platforms, wealth management platforms, all the way down into if you think about the business services that we've been innovating on the last 3 years. And so it's an end-to-end value play that we think makes for the most interesting differentiation RAAs that are out there. So they don't have to build that or if they have that stuff and have operated in an inefficient way or one that doesn't add value, we can do it in a more efficient expected way.
We think that's an appealing angle to take the marketplace. And then finally, as we grow in both the results, the solutions, the success and then greater awareness for our presence in the marketplace. We think those things position us well to continue to drive more growth from here. And I think we've seen good progress over the last 1.5 years. We're encouraged by that. Great. And just a follow-up question on the essentially managed assets that continues to grow in line with the rest of the business holding steady, about 15% of advisory assets, it looks like. So hoping you could talk about some of the initiatives as you think about expanding penetration of centrally managed assets there, how are you thinking about building out the product set here as you look out over the next year or two? Yes, it's a really interesting question. As you said, there's some pull opportunities, we think, to continue to enhance the feel of that model and reduce the cost in both that combination ultimately, I think, drives greater and greater utilization. So with the evolution of models-based practices, our continued ability to enhance our platform that really sets up for that efficient models-based practice and even then partnering with our sponsors to integrate their capabilities within that model's marketplace is where some cool innovation and work is going on. That not only adds value for our advisers, it also creates value for our sponsors that will then economic opportunities for us.
I think as you look at continued what I might call it value for an end investor think self-indexing or individual indexing and/or tax overlay. And I think we're deploying some of those capabilities in the second half of this year. just further strengthen the value of the advice that the adviser is providing to their clients, but also to the sense that we can do that in the centrally managed platform and highly efficient and integrated way for the adviser creates greater fuel and let the model.
And then finally, just the expansion of the investment content available there, we've really expanded our SMAs this year. On the equity side, we're adding income SMAs in the second half of this year. And so ultimately, that turns it into a true UMA, which will only drive further utilization. So those are the ways we think about some of the ways of enhancing the capabilities to continue to drive the appeal of that model and thus the greater yields. Great. Thank you. And one moment for your next question. Our next question will be coming from Kyle Voigt of KBW. Your line is open. Hi good evening. Maybe a few follow-ups for me. Matt, you had record EBITDA margins in the first half of the year at 54%. And I guess my question is not as much about 2024, but more of a longer-term question about margins. If we think about LPLA continuing to kind of gain scale and drive growth over the coming years, do you think there's still significant operating leverage left in the model from where you sit today at 54%. And if so, can you kind of help quantify how you think about those longer-term incremental margins? Yes. I mean I think when you -- if you look at our margins and history here is very helpful and the macro environment, the interest rate environment, of course, is going to inform those. But I think when you've looked historically, I think not only us, but our industry, when you're in periods where interest rates are near their lows, like running in the -- which we, in our recent past, of course, have seen when you're running with margins in the 35%, 40% range, you're doing somewhat well in that environment. And when you're in an environment like we're in now, with interest rates high, getting up to that 50% and above, I think it's just running at a good level as well. And I think those are just good bookends to think about in general.
I think as far as what we can deliver in the future, I think, ultimately, it's going to be connected to our ability to deliver a compelling value proposition to clients, our ability to continue to expand and grow across our affiliation models as we get scale in each of those areas.
We're able to balance delivering not only a great experience for those clients, but also doing it in an efficient way that allows us to deliver earnings to the bottom line and always balancing how much of that to then reinvest to drive further growth from here. So I think the opportunity, if we're successful in all those areas is indexing to the macro environment point that I made to most certainly drive more operating leverage. And I think ultimately, the balance and judgment about how much of that to reinvest to further expand our value proposition and further drive growth as judgment calls that we'll make. But I think the opportunity is there for successful. Understood. And then just a follow-up on the cash discussion. You've previously noted that 4% as being around a floor level on cash as a percentage of assets, it sounds like you're now slightly below that 4% level in July to date. But it seems, as you said you're continuing to see that slowing cash declines, excluding those fee billings. I just wanted to reconfirm whether anything has changed at all from an adviser behavior standpoint over the past months or quarters that would lead to a different view in terms of defining that floor level of cash at around 4%. No. I mean, I think keep in mind, month 1 of any quarter, you typically see a cash balance decline. But I think as we maybe take a step back and the nature of the cash that we have in these accounts is largely operational, it's typically small balances for rebalancing, paying fees, facilitating customer throws. And I think when we just look at our experience when clients are fully deployed into the market, cash does typically bottom out at those levels required to manage the account. And that typically meant a natural for around 4%.
And I think -- when we look at the market we're in now, I think it's fair to say that advisers and their clients are especially engaged when you've got a strong fixed income market that we've been in for quite some time, that's now getting coupled with a strengthened equity market.
And that's leading to net buying activity and levels that are roughly double historical levels. So I think as we sit here, at least looking at the end of the quarter, which is where I'd focus at roughly 4% of AUM, I think the dynamics of our cash and the transactional nature hasn't changed. I think we're getting pretty close to what we would think would be full levels of deployment and kind of reaching a point of natural resistance on moving much lower. Now could it go below 4%, of course. But I think based on what we see in our analysis, we don't think it would go below 4 by a substantial amount. Understood. Thank you. And one moment for our next questions. Our last question will come from Brennan Hawken of UBS. I just got one left. Mine have been asked and answered. Any way or guidance you can provide for thinking about how the upcoming deals, the deals that you've announced and we have coming down the pipe could impact the payout rate. I know in the past, sometimes, some of the deals have had an impact. Anything coming from these upcoming deals? Yes. And you're - Brennan, you talked about the large enterprise onboarding Bank of the West in commerce? Exactly. Yes. Yes. I think as a general point, those larger enterprises have a higher payout rate. We have a lower -- from an AUM standpoint, we've got an advantage in serving them from a scale standpoint on the cost side. So operating margins are always compelling or compelling on those.
But yes, the payout rate would -- all else equal go up. So if we -- I did give a little color on payout rate for next quarter at 87.5%, that would be driven by a handful of things, but primarily the seasonal build and the production bonus but also bringing on those large enterprises that, in general, have a higher payout than the average. Okay. So the 87.5% would fully bake in the impact of those two deals? No, it would be the following quarter because they're going to be joining during the quarter, but it's just as a headline point when we bring on large enterprises, they'll typically buy us up to pay out a little bit, not dramatically. Got it. Thanks a lot. And I'm showing no further questions. At this time, I would like to turn the call back to Dan Arnold for closing remarks. Thanks to everyone for taking the time to join us this afternoon. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Arnold. Thank you, Tanya, and thanks to everyone for joining our call today. Over the past quarter, our advisers continue to provide their clients with personalized financial guidance on the journey to help them achieve their life goals and dreams. To help support that important work, we remain focused on our mission of taking care of our advisers so they can take care of their clients.
This quarter, we continued to see the appeal of our model growth due to the combination of our robust and future platform, the stability and scale of our industry-leading model and our capacity and commitment to invest back into the platform. As a result, we continue to make solid progress in helping advisers and enterprises solve challenges and capitalize on opportunities better than anyone else and thereby serve as the most appealing player in the industry.
With respect to our performance, we delivered another quarter of solid results while also continuing to make progress on the execution of our strategic plan. I'll review both of these areas, starting with our third quarter business results.
In the quarter, total assets remained at $1.2 trillion as continued solid organic growth was offset by lower equity markets. Third quarter organic net new assets were $33 billion, representing 11% annualized growth. This contributed to organic net new assets over the past 12 months of $97 billion representing approximately a 9% growth rate. In the quarter, recruited assets were $31 billion, including $12 billion from Bank of the West and Commerce Bank. Prior to large enterprises, Q3 represents a quarterly record for recruiting.
This outcome was driven by the ongoing enhancements to our model as well as our expanded addressable market. Looking at same-store sales. our advisers remain focused on taking care of their clients and delivering a differentiated experience. As a result, our advisers are both winning new clients and expanding wallet share with existing clients. Combination that drove solid same-store sales in Q3.
With respect to retention, we continue to enhance the adviser experience through the delivery of new capabilities and technology as well as the evolution of our service and operations functions. As a result, asset retention for the third quarter and over the last 12 months was approximately 99%. Our third quarter business results led to solid financial outcomes of $3.74 of adjusted EPS, an increase of 19% from a year ago.
Let's now turn to the progress we made on our strategic plan. Now as a reminder, our long-term vision is to become the leader across the adviser center marketplace, which for us means being the best at empowering advisers and enterprises to deliver great advice to their clients and to be great operators of their business. Doing this well gives us a sustainable path to industry leadership across the adviser experience, organic growth and market share.
Now to execute on our strategy, we organize our work around 2 primary categories: horizontal expansion, where we look to expand the ways that advisers and enterprises can affiliate with us and vertical integration where we focus on providing capabilities that solve for a broader spectrum of adviser needs. And with that as context, let's start with our efforts around horizontal expansion.
This work involves meeting advisers and enterprises where they are in the evolution of the businesses by creating flexibility in our affiliation models, such that we can compete for all 300,000 advisers in the marketplace. As a result, this component of our strategy helps contribute to solid growth in our traditional markets, while also expanding our addressable model.
Over the third quarter, we saw strong recruiting in our traditional independent market, adding approximately $13 billion in assets. And as a result of the appeal of our model and the efficacy of our business development team, we maintained our industry-leading win rates while also expanding the breadth and depth of our pipeline. With respect to our new affiliation models, strategic wealth, employee and our enhanced RIA offering, we delivered our strongest quarter to date, recruiting roughly $5 billion in assets in Q3.
Subsequent to launching these models a few years ago, we have continued to enhance their capabilities and thus further differentiate their value. Add to that the growing awareness of these models in the marketplace, and that combination is creating more demand from prospective advisers. As a result, we expect to see a sustained increase in growth within our new affiliation models.
Next, the traditional bank and credit union space continues to be a consistent contributor to organic growth as we added approximately $1 billion of recruited assets in Q3. During the quarter, we also continued to make progress with large enterprises, onboarding Bank of the West and Commerce. The early feedback from these transitions has been positive as we continue to apply the learnings from previous onboardings and to further enhance the experience.
Looking ahead, we are confident that our industry-leading onboarding experience, matched with the expanding appeal of our model positions us well as a compelling alternative in this part of the market. In Q3, we also announced that Prudential Financial would onboard its retail wealth management business to our enterprise platform in the second half of 2024. This milestone reinforces the appeal of our value proposition for enterprises and reflects our commitment to help solve for the unique and complex needs of a broad spectrum of institutions.
Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the momentum and strong pipelines across the enterprise market. Now within our vertical integration efforts, we are focused on delivering a comprehensive platform of capabilities, services and technology that help our advisers differentiate and win in the marketplace and run thriving businesses.
Now over the past quarter, we continued to make progress across several key fronts on this part of our strategy, including continuing the journey to build a world-class wealth management platform. This work includes evolving and enhancing our advisory platforms through simplified and lower pricing, enhanced trading capabilities, value-added services like text management, and the expanded investment choice and flexibility within our UMA plan. These efforts will help our advisers continue to provide more value for the clients and the differentiated and more personalized way.
Now as an additional part of our vertical integration strategy, we continue to expand and enhance our services portfolio and are encouraged by the evolving appeal of our value proposition and the seasoning of this business. As a result of solid demand in Q3, the number of advisers utilizing our services group continued to increase. We ended the quarter with approximately 3,700 active users, up 26% year-over-year.
As a reminder, a recent innovation in this portfolio is our liquidity and succession solution, which is resonating with existing LPL advisers, where to date, we have deployed approximately $275 million of capital close 20 [indiscernible]. And with the benefit of our learnings and insights, we recently began offering this solution to advisers that are external to LPL and are encouraged to see the early interest building.
Finally, this service is also enriching the appeal of our model and by doing so, providing another differentiated solution to support our adviser recruiting efforts. In summary, in the third quarter, we continued to invest in the value proposition for advisers and their clients while driving growth and increasing our market leadership.
As we look ahead, we remain focused on executing on our strategy to help advisers further differentiate and win in the marketplace and as a result, drive long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt. Thank you, Dan, and I'm glad to speak with everyone on today's call. In the third quarter, we remain focused on serving our advisers, growing our business and delivering shareholder value. This focus led to strong organic growth in both our traditional and new markets, and we continue to make progress with our liquidity and succession solution.
In addition, we onboarded Bank of the West in Commerce Bank and are preparing to onboard the wealth management business of Prudential. We accomplished all of this while continuing to invest in our industry-leading value proposition. So as we look ahead, we continue to be excited by the opportunities we have to help our advisers differentiate and win in the marketplace.
Now let's turn to our third quarter business results. Total advisory and brokerage assets were $1.2 trillion, unchanged from Q2 as continued organic growth was offset by lower equity markets. Total organic net new assets were $33 billion or approximately an 11% annualized growth rate. Our Q3 recruited assets were $31 billion, which included $12 billion from Bank of the West in Commerce. Prior to these large enterprises, this was a quarterly record for overall recruiting as well as for our new affiliation models, which contributed $5 billion in the quarter.
As for our Q3 financial results, the combination of organic growth and expense discipline led to adjusted EPS of $3.74. Gross profit was $1.10 billion, up $20 million or 2% sequentially. As for the components, commission and advisory fees net of payout were $219 million, up $1 million from Q2. In Q3, our payout rate was 87.3%, up 60 basis points from Q2 due to typical seasonality in the onboarding of Bank of the West in Commerce Bank.
Looking ahead to Q4, a reminder that the production bonus increases throughout the year and is typically highest in Q4. So we anticipate our payout rate will be approximately 88%. With respect to client cash revenue, it was $378 million, down $18 million from Q2, and as cash balances declined $3 billion to $47 million. This marked the smallest quarterly decline we've seen this year. Within our ICA portfolio, the mix of fixed rate balances increased to roughly 65% and within our target range of 50% to 75%.
Our ICA yield averaged 318 basis points in the quarter, down 4 basis points from Q2, driven by a decline in floating rate balances. As for Q4, based on where client cash balances and interest rates are today, we expect our ICA yield to decline by roughly 5 basis points due to the mix impact of lower floating rate balances. As for service and fee revenue, it was $136 million in Q3, up $13 million from Q2, primarily driven by revenues from our National Adviser Conference and IRA.
Looking ahead to Q4, we do not have any large adviser conferences and expect seasonally lower IRA fees. Given this, we anticipate service and fee revenue will decline by roughly $10 million sequentially. Moving on to Q3 transaction revenue. It was $50 million, up $3 million sequentially due to increased trading volume. As we look ahead to Q4, we have seen an increase in trading activity in October. So based on what we have seen to date, we would expect transaction revenue to increase by a couple of million sequentially.
Now let's turn to our strategic relationship with Prudential. In August, we announced that Prudential will onboard its retail wealth management business on to our platform, including the roughly 2,600 advisers serving approximately $50 billion of client assets. The investments we are making in connection with this relationship will not only help us serve Prudential and their advisers, but also improve the experience for our existing advisers and help unlock a broader opportunity to serve enterprises.
With respect to the ongoing earnings benefit from Prudential, we continue to estimate a run rate EBITDA benefit of approximately $60 million once they are on board. Looking ahead, we will continue to provide updates on the progress we are making as we prepare to onboard Prudential. With that said, in terms of the cost of transition, we continue to estimate total onboarding and integration costs of roughly $125 million, with approximately $20 million expected in Q4.
Now let's turn to expenses, starting with core G&A. It was $342 million in Q3, up $5 million from Q2. Looking ahead, given our strong levels of organic growth and the variable costs associated with supporting that growth, we are increasing the lower end of our 2023 core G&A range by $5 million. As a result, we now expect 2023 core G&A to be in a range of $1.35 billion to $1.37 billion. Moving on to Q3 promotional expense. It was $140 million, up $33 million sequentially as we hosted our largest adviser conference of the year during the quarter.
We also incurred roughly $6 million of Prudential related promotional expense in Q3. Looking ahead to Q4, we expect conference spend to decline by approximately $20 million. At the same time, we will be ramping preparation for Prudential and expect related onboarding and integration costs to increase by roughly $15 million from Q3. So overall, we expect Q4 promotional expense to be flat to down $5 million sequentially.
Turning to depreciation and amortization. It was $65 million in Q3, up $7 million sequentially. Looking ahead to Q4, we expect depreciation and amortization to increase by roughly $5 million sequentially. As for interest expense, it was $48 million in Q3, up $3 million sequentially driven by the impact of higher short-term interest rates on our floating rate debt and increased usage of our revolver. Looking ahead to Q4, given current debt balances and interest rates, we expect interest expense to increase by approximately $1 million from Q3.
Regarding capital management, our balance sheet remained strong. We ended Q3 with corporate cash of $309 million down $16 million from Q2. Our leverage ratio was 1.3x, up slightly from Q2. As for capital deployment, our framework remains focused on allocating capital aligned with the returns we generate. Investing in organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A where appropriate and returning excess capital to shareholders.
In Q3, we allocated capital across our entire framework. We continue to invest to drive and support organic growth, allocated capital to M&A within our liquidity and succession solution and return capital to our shareholders, repurchasing $250 million of shares. As we look ahead to Q4, we plan to repurchase $200 million of our shares, keeping us on track to execute on our $2 billion authorization over 2 years.
To summarize, our balance sheet is strong, and we are well positioned to drive value through our capital allocation frame. In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results. As we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue investing to serve our advisers, grow our business and create long-term shareholder value. With that, operator, please open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will be coming from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. I wanted to start off with a question just on the organic growth outlook. The 11% NNA figure came in at the higher end of the 7% to 13% range you guys have talked about in the past. I would say what really stood out was the strong result relative to the slowdown in NNA that we saw at some of your peers. I was hoping you could unpack what were the biggest contributors to the share gains in the quarter? And with the recruited assets tracking up 40%, how confident are you that this level of organic growth can, in fact, be sustained? Steven, it's Dan. Let me take that. And certainly, we can build off of that answer. So look, I think in the short term, we've got a jumping off point that as you said, it's in a solid place of 11% growth for the quarter. And probably just as importantly, we saw a diverse contribution across all of our adviser and enterprise models, which I think speaks to not only the volume of growth, but the breadth and diversity of the sources of growth.
And I think if I highlighted a couple of things inside Q3 that maybe are significant to that overall outcome. The first would be we continue to see low levels of attrition in that 1% to 1.5% zone. That's certainly a solid outcome and reinforces the appeal and the execution quality of the operation day to day. And I think it's complemented by the solid performance in new store sales where we recruited $31 billion of assets for the quarter.
And if you click down on that $31 billion of assets, I think if you look at that prior to large enterprises, right, Q3 had quarterly high recruiting of $19 billion in assets, which is more than double a year ago. And I think we take out or back out some of the lumpier nature of some of the large enterprise recruiting to put down underneath that. Again, you see the diversity of that growth in new store sales as well as it happening across all of our different adviser-oriented models. And you feel we feel pretty good about the sustainability of that opportunity set.
And so look, the drivers of that, right? It's the flexibility of the affiliation model gives us and puts us in a position of competing for potentially any of Pfizer that's looking for a newer, better home. It's continued expansion of our capabilities to help us differentiate our model, and then you continue to invest in simplifying the onboarding to make it easier and easier to move and take friction out.
We believe we do those things well, and it creates a key contributor to our overall growth and good solid sustainable growth rate as we go forward. So I hope that helps. That's really helpful color, Dan. And for my follow-up for Matt, surprise, surprise a question on client cash. 3Q cash levels were down 5%. And maybe more resilient than the sweep deposit declines that we saw of roughly 7% to 10% at peers. That being said, cash outflows did continue in September. How are client -- cash balances trending so far in October? And are you anticipating any seasonal benefit to 4Q cash levels from tax loss harvesting? Yes, Steven. So I think on -- just -- and maybe to answer the last part of your question first, I think if history is a guy, you typically do see some seasonal build in at the end of the fourth quarter. Typically in December for some cash or tax loss harvesting. So I'd be surprised if we did not see that this year. It's pretty common. I think on the core of your question, when we look at how things are going in October, I'd say that the headline is on the cash sweep side as we continue to see some of the stability that we started to see in the third quarter.
And I'd specifically -- and a reminder that advisory fees primarily come out in the first month of the quarter, and that's for October would be a little over $1.1 billion which is going to immediately bring down cash, but cash flows outside of that have been relatively flat here almost at the end of the month. So that would put cash sweep at around $46.2 billion is really those adviser fees coming out. And from a percent of AUM would put it right at 3.8% of AUM, which would be the fourth month in a row that we were at that level.
So I think when we look at those trends, and I think as we've talked a bit about before, we're starting to get to a place where you've got a natural amount of cash necessary to really manage the account in -- of course, it could go down further from here, but I think you're starting to see those resistance levels that we've talked about before in those balances.
Now some of the other drivers there, maybe just to speak to how organic growth is going because a lot of that drives and brings in cash as well. When we look at what we've seen in October, is really continuing some of those positive trends that Dan was just talking about in Q3. And keeping in mind that the seasonal nature of the first month as well on organic growth with those advisory fees come out as well, when you look at what we've seen so far for October prior to any additional assets coming onboard from Bank of the West in Commerce, organic growth is running in the 6% zone. That compares to 4% prior to large enterprises in October of last year. So we're continuing to see that strength there.
And then there's about $1.5 billion of AUM left to come onboard from those 2 institutions and -- some of that may come in, in October. So that would buy us up from there. So overall, I think I'd summarize October as stability is starting to show in cash sweep and organic growth continuing to come in at solid levels. And one moment for our next question. And our next question will be coming from Alexander Blostein of Goldman Sachs. This is Luke on for Alex. If we could start with Prudential, we've seen LPL expand into new channels a number of times with the insurance channel being the newest one with the Pru partnership. Can you just talk through how you expect this opportunity to expand over time? And how you think about the TAM? And then could you also refresh us on the P&L dynamics and the timing you're thinking through there? Let me start with answering that and then Matt will come in and answer maybe [indiscernible]. When you look at the headline level, if you take a step back and just look at the large enterprise opportunity set, with respect to the bank space. As you know, we onboarded 2 new large enterprises this quarter, and we continue to see opportunity set in that large enterprise space of those that continue to act as their own broker-dealers and RIAs and do the business in house, and see an interesting TAM that would consider a different strategic approach.
And so I think those wins reinforce that value proposition, our continued investment in our experience in managing and working with these large enterprises that certainly help us as we go forward in that part of the large enterprise space. And as you said, the announcement of the Pru win opens up a different part of large enterprises in this case, perhaps insurance solution sets and/or part of the market space in. And look, for there, we think -- again, we take that similar chassis. We're building some personalized and interesting customized solutions or Prudential that we think will resonate with other solutions in that part of the space. They've got similar needs from a value proposition and hoping to think about the improvement in driving efficiencies within their models, shifting their risk profiles, enhancing economics and even working to stimulate top line growth.
All things that I think similar large enterprises as we are looking to do, these are things that we're working on collectively with both banks and ultimately, the Prudential. So we think there is a relevant opportunity. We think Prudential opportunity is a catalyst to open up more discussions in that part of the space. So we think, again, the broader enterprise, large enterprise market is an interesting continued durable growth opportunity for us both on the bank side and on the broader insurance. If that helps. And then just following up on the financial dynamics and reminders, there are about $50 billion of flying assets. We would expect to onboard them in the latter part of '24, and that's when our estimated run rate EBITDA of $60 million would start when they're fully onboarded. Between now and then is really the onboarding and integration costs that estimate overall $125 million.
And if you look at what we've done so far in the third quarter and our guide for the fourth quarter, that puts broadly $25 million of that in 2023, meaning the remaining $100 million would come through in 2024. And then once they're onboarded, you again, would be back to that $60 million EBITDA run rate. Awesome. Super helpful. Thanks for walking through everything there. Switching topics a bit for the follow-up. This quarter saw an acceleration of service and fee revenues up 11% quarter-over-quarter. Can you just talk through what drove that? And how do you think about revenue opportunities for existing services? And then related to that, you recently expanded access for your outsourced CFO services. What are high-level expectations there for both FA uptake and revenue opportunities? Yes. I'll take the first part of that, and then, Dan, if you want to jump in on the CFO solutions, which I know is your favorite solution with this line as well. I think -- so on service and fees, I'd say there's 2 primary drivers. I think the first is just seasonal factors that come through in the third quarter. We've had our largest -- our National Adviser Conference in the third quarter and there's revenues and fees that come along with that for the product sponsors that are there.
And then second, the third quarter is a seasonally high quarter for IRA fees. So those 2 things came through. But then second, I think maybe from a longer-term standpoint is really organic growth of the business, and we've got fees associated with that are specific to advisers on our platform. So as we continue to grow the number of advisers we serve and support, you've got recurring fees and things that come along with that, and those show up here as well.
So those are the 2 broad drivers. So I think when you look ahead to Q4, that's why we expect the decline of $10 million is really that seasonality coming -- the seasonal factors coming out. But I think the core from a long-term standpoint is the more we drive organic growth, more we serve and support advisers on our platform. this section or this item will continue to grow. That also includes the fees related to our services portfolio. So maybe I'll turn it over to Dan to talk about the CFO solution. Yes. Thanks, Matt. And -- so look, if you think about our services portfolio, just start with a broader context and then we'll put down on your specific question. Initially, when we rolled out these solutions or the services portfolio, the initial bundle of services were really more relevant for our larger practices. And if you didn't have a complex practice, let's use as an example, our initial rollout of CFO solutions, then that solution may not be relevant to you or it may be at a price point that makes it out of reach for you.
And so learning through that sort of first iteration around of innovation, we realized that a lot of the capabilities within the original CFO solutions were needed for all advisers to figure out how to package those in a different way at a lower price point and still create that leverage point of value for our advisers, then that would be a good problem to solve for and one that will create real value for our advisers. And so that's what you saw with this new rollout of what we call CFO Essentials. That again, it will reach a much broader set of our 22,000-plus advisers or being much more applicable to them, and we think meet their needs at a price point that makes sense and continue then to drive the utilization and growth of that overall kind of suite of CFO type solutions.
We're doing that on the marketing side as well. So these are just, I think, places where we continue to innovate on that overall portfolio. With a fine point on that, we now have 13 solutions in our overall services portfolio, which many of them are relevant across -- or could be relevant across our entire adviser base. We've got 3 more solutions that we will roll out in the near to intermediate term and another handful in incubation. So it continues to be a place of innovation for us, and we think there's still a good bit of opportunity to continue to help build leverage points for advisers in the spirit of helping them run driving businesses. So that's kind of the context around CFO Essentials. And our next question will be coming from Devin Ryan of JMP Securities. Great. Would love to just maybe start on the RIA channel, really nice momentum, particularly on net new assets there in the quarter. and, I guess, particularly in the corporate RIA. I would love to just maybe dig a little bit into the drivers this quarter and then just the outlook and also whether the Schwab Ameritrade conversion was a factor this quarter or even just going forward as you kind of consolidate some of the large players there, just want to think about kind of some of the incremental opportunity for LPL? Devin, it's Dan. Let me try to cover the sort of [indiscernible] points that you're exploring. I think first and foremost, if you look at overall just advisory growth in general, right? You continue to see success and progress we have in both same-store sales and new store sales across, again, all of our different types of affiliation models. So that would cover your corporate RIA or hybrid RIA solutions or pure RIA solutions. And I think we still see about $0.75 of every new dollar invested going to advisory. So that's where you're going to pick up the contribution from same-store sales.
And you still see conversions or transitions from brokerage to advisory services. Those are your tailwinds that are that are overall driving that advisory growth. I think if you pull back then and look at the different affiliation models and how we're positioned in the marketplace, certainly, the diversity of our different models continues to help us attract a diverse set of advisers and advisers that are frankly do more and more advisory when they join LPL.
And you're seeing that in the traditional space as we continue to attract more and more larger advisers with more complex practices, you look across our different new affiliation models, right, employ strategic well and pure RIA. A lot of those will be breakaways from wires that will come with significant advisory books. And if you just click down on those new affiliation models, as we said, this quarter represented a record in terms of recruiting of $5 billion of assets.
If you look back over the last 12 months, we've actually recruited $14 billion and new assets to those affiliation models, which is 50% of what we've overall recruited since they've been launched. And certainly, that mix of business that tends to have more significant percentages of their books in advisory is again another driver. And I think as we continue to have success with those models, as we continue to invest in, they come more and more feeling, there's more and more awareness of them, invest in more demand. We certainly are well positioned to see that advisory business grow.
I think specifically relative to maybe your question around Schwab and Ameritrade, it's probably more the pure RIA business, and we do see that as a continued interesting place, of which to compete and try to win. So we continue to invest in our solution and our model to ensure that we create a differentiated solution that will help us be positioned to win and capitalize on whether it be market share opportunity that's created by consolidation or just ongoing demand for that type of solution.
And I think as we try to position ourselves as a more vertically integrated strategic partner that creates more value for the adviser. We think that positions us well to participate and when an outsized share of market as we move forward in this space. All right. follow-up here just for Matt. Thinking about kind of the ICA yield glide path maybe beyond 4Q. So you have $6.5 billion of contracts maturing next year. We're just modeling kind of -- this kind of rolling off ratably. But is there any sense of, as we get closer there, just more color on the cadence, what that could look like. And then as we think about also the base rate on ICA and even on the floating book today, how much improvement are you seeing? I just -- it seems like, and we're hearing that there's more demand in the bank system. And so just kind of what the uplift might look like there? Yes, Devin. On the fixed rate side, I think the -- of that $6.5 billion, about $0.5 billion rolls off in the first quarter and then the rest of it is evenly throughout the year. So about $2 billion a quarter. And I think our plans would be to reinvest that in new fixed rate contracts, the same way we have been in that 3- to 5-year zone. And I think when you look at the rates in that environment, the demand here is just as strong as it is on the floating rate side. So to your point on kind of spreads above the base rate.
So if you look at where the curve is for a 3- to 5-year money at this point, you're in the 450 to 470 range, but we're starting to see with the demand for deposit spreads on the fixed rate side as well. So you can you can think maybe more closer to or up to 500 basis points for those contracts when they're rolling off on average at 250. So rounding up, I'd say, an opportunity to kind of double the earnings on those balances as they mature.
On the floating rate side, I think we've seen spreads in the 15 to 30 basis point range, which I'd say is historically high. But we've probably seen that for the last couple of quarters. So you're starting to see that flow through on the floating rate side. But a broad point, you can just see in the pricing, the -- if you are a supplier of deposits, the demand is there and the pricing is quite good. And our next question will come from Ben Budish of Barclays. I wanted to follow up on some of the commentary on Ameritrade. We've seen some kind of media press indicating that there may be a pickup in sort of outbound to alternative custodians and other kind of services providers. I'm not sure if that's something you can comment on, but would great if you could. But even if not, maybe another sort of question along the same lines is if that were the case and you were seeing a pickup post Labor Day. How long does it typically take for an adviser who is showing interest to convert if you're successful there? Yes. So for us, I think I'd answer that more broadly that we see all registered advisers as an opportunity to potentially affiliate with one of our models, and we obviously invest in a significant business development team. It is out in the marketplace, exploring those opportunities. I think we continue to create real structural value that creates demand and appeal across our model, it's first and foremost, the opportunity.
But if you're doing that well, and you have the efficacy of a good business development team will then when market opportunities may arise in the short run, and we challenge ourselves to be agile and nimble to be able to capitalize on those regardless of what they may be and when they may occur. And so that's the combination that we think about how we go to market, right?
You create good structural differentiation and value, you have a great team that can go tell that story and then you're agile and nimble when opportunities come up that may be created for whatever reason. So look, when there's transitions that occur in the marketplace, just in general back to your latter question, there's generally opportunity that may occur around the transition of assets from one custodian to another or one broker-dealer from another. And depending on the complexity that may occur in that transition, typically, then there's some opportunity that may arise post that, whether that be because of new environment, service challenges, new technology, whatever the case may be change management challenges that may occur, that may create some unrest.
And that may create some opportunity. And again, I think we try to be well positioned and well prepared to capitalize free conversions, post conversions when those may occur and where that opportunity may occur. I hope that helps. Yes. Understood. Maybe one -- just quick follow-up just on corporate cash for the last few quarters been running ahead of your target level. Just to what degree is that maybe conservatism or just a matter of timing for the end for the quarter? Or is that more intentional? Any color you could share there would be helpful. Yes, you bet. Short answer is timing, right? I think when you look at our overall liquidity, it's more about managing our overall leverage ratio I think the corporate cash balances end up being a little bit of timing. As simple as that. . Our next question will be coming from Dan Fannon of Jefferies. I wanted to follow up on NNA and the outlook. And just what the backlog looks like today maybe versus last quarter or a year ago, and we've heard about more industry churn or churn for advisers picking up. And would you echo that? And what does that mean for potential acceleration in terms of that adviser adds over the next kind of 6, 12 months? . Yes. So look, I think the headline, as we said earlier, from a recruiting standpoint is we continue to see that as a solid lever and driver of growth or contributor to growth both in the short run and longer term. So if I just put a little color on that for you. When we look out at the environment explore how we position ourselves to win. We typically start with the opportunity set where you went to adviser movement.
I would actually reflect it as more flat over the last year, it's somewhere around 5.5% movement or turnover. We haven't seen a big move up from that, but it's more sustained and we call it that range down for now. What has happened is there's been a bit of a mix shift in some of the movement or turnover where we've seen the movement amongst the independent market picked up where some of the movement has slowed down from the wires as an example.
That said, given all of that -- look, I think what we do is challenge ourselves into how do you succeed regardless of the volume of movement. And I think we continue to see our win rates improved despite the lower level of movement. And with the diversification of our models, right, that mix shift that I spoke to is more of a neutral point for us as, again, we try to compete competitively for all 300,000 advisers that may move. So the overall churn we've overcome those lower levels of churn. We do think that they will come back over time. there's lots of reason to believe that, that number begins to pick up and more trend back towards the norm.
And so if we can sustain higher win rates because we've got a more appealing model, we've gotten better at recruiting matched with the flexibility of our model, I think -- we think that positions us well as we go forward. I think if you look at the competitive landscape, again, we haven't seen significant changes or material changes across the playing field there. That said, it's what we talked about in the last question, there are moments in time in the marketplace where there may be some elevated movement because an organization is going through some strategic transition.
And we always try to position ourselves there to get a bit of an over index gain on those opportunities when they may occur. I think if you add all of that up and you look out over the intermediate term, if you look at our growing pipeline, the growing sort of appeal of our different affiliation models. The strength of our adviser recruiting matched with the nice complement of bigger mandates in the enterprise marketplace.
And we feel good about our short and intermediate opportunity for recruiting. And then longer term, I think we go back to our structural advantages and really back to our strategy where we continue to see growing a feel in demand for advice, the attractiveness of the adviser or the independent model matched with the desire to receive that model from a financial professional, the overall demand for advice continues to give us a big tailwind.
If you take our market leadership in the independent model singular focused on really understanding and innovating in it. Robust feature platform we have to jump off from -- in our capacity and commitment to invest back into the model. And we think that certainly positions us long term to capitalize on current large demand that exists today, but the growing demand for advice is going to create more opportunity going forward and our ability to differentiate and hope that helps. Yes, that's helpful. And I guess, Matt, just a follow-up here on expenses. So first, is the promo expense missed the guidance for the third quarter. So curious about what drove that? And then as we think about G&A, I know there's elevated spend because of the environment and the solid organic growth. If we -- and looking at Slide 24, it's obviously been on the trajectory higher for several years. If we think about longer term, not so much for just '24, what is a reasonable growth rate do you think for G&A spend to maintain these solid levels of organic growth? Yes. I think just -- I'll hit the promo first. I think when you look at our guide for Q3, which was in the $130 million to $135 million range, we came in at $140 million, really just a factor of the timing of the large enterprise onboarding expenses. We had both Bank of the West in Commerce come on board in the quarter. That's the quarter where those expenses are typically the highest.
And then we started the integration onboarding work for Prudential, which we've got an overall estimate of $125 million, and that is still our estimate just ramped up a little bit faster. So it's simply the timing of expenses associated with those. I think that was what I'd highlight for Q3. I think to your second question on overall core G&A growth, I mean, I think we plan those investments and spend in each and every year, with a focus on making sure we're investing to drive and support organic growth, making sure we're balancing that with delivering operating leverage. And then I think perhaps to the core of your question, adjusting those levels based on the macro environment.
And I think that's where we get to -- what we're doing this year is having an up level of investment in spend that I think really helps improve our value proposition, our capabilities to our advisers and this is one of the drivers of our success in organic growth. And I think when we think about that over the long term that things like that would be dependent upon the environment, right? So if you remember, from the guidance of 13% to 15% growth this year, about 4% to 5% of that was really based on the opportunity of the environment.
So I think when you're thinking long term, I think that's a bucket where you can put aside and say, we just be opportunistic for that amount if the environment was there. And I think when we get back to what we're spending on, what we're doing this year, we think it's been quite the right decision and a good use of capital. Our next question will be coming from Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley. Maybe just continuing with expense related questions. Just on the promotional expense. We've seen an uptick in recent years. I understand there's been some investments made to support that. Just as we look out over the next couple of years, how should we think about sort of an underlying true run rate of expense growth for -- on the promotional side in order to maintain the organic growth that you guys are looking to achieve? And I think on the promotional side, you also called out about $100 million of onboarding for next year. Should we think about that all fully coming out in '25? Yes. Well, I think when you look at the drivers, it's really 3 things. And I think on that last point, on the $100 million for Prudential. It's related to large financial institutions and those institutions coming on board. So I think that we think about our opportunity set, I think we would expect to have those be an ongoing opportunity. But to the core of your question, if there weren't any in a year or there weren't any large financial institutions coming on board those expenses would go away. That $100 million is specific to Prudential, meaning once that's onboarded, unless there's others coming on board, you wouldn't have a spend level of that amount.
But the other -- and the key drivers of the growth overall outside of the number of large financial institutions or enterprises we have are coming on board. There's really organic growth, right? And I think when you look at the amount of organic growth that we have, the transition assistance associated with that and the amortization of that, that's primarily what shows up in the growth for promotional and it's about the size of our recruiting. I think we talked about it a bunch on this call and during this Q&A, but the amount of recruited AUM that we're bringing on board is increased substantially in the capital that helps bring them on board and the expense shows up here.
The other one I'd highlight to a much smaller extent is just conference spend, right? That's based on the number of advisers we have at the firm, the bigger we get, the more value there is in engagement with more of those folks in person at our conferences that would naturally rise. But I think the 2 key things are number of large financial institutions coming on board and then just the level and amount of our organic growth, those would be the 2 big drivers. Great. And just a follow-up question on D&A. I think you had called out about $200 million of platform investments to be capitalized. I imagine that's going to come through the D&A line. Just how do we think about the time frame and cadence for that to come through? Yes. And that's associated with Prudential as well. So if you think about Prudential overall of $325 million of investment. And a reminder, there's no transition assistance that comes along with that. That's the total investment. So the timing will be like typical to a large financial institution. It will be mostly leading up to and during the quarter of onboarding, but there can also be some that comes across after that. And then you get into based on the technology that we're putting in place which are typically amortization periods, call it, in the 4- or 5-year zone once they're deployed. So we should think about that $200 million coming through over 5 years or so, roughly. Is that fair? Yes. Yes, once it's deployed, 4 or 5 years following that. So I think that's a good way to think about it. . One moment for our next question. And our next question will be coming from Kyle Voigt of KBW. Maybe just one on the regulatory environment. It sounds like the DOL is set to propose a new fiduciary rule very shortly. Obviously, I don't have many details at this point, but just wondering if you could comment high level on the state of the business today relative to 2016, remind us of some of the more meaningful changes that were already implemented ahead of the prior DOL rule that was ultimately vacated. And would be great to kind of hear how you feel about potential expense needs to comply with any new rule proposal, given the investments that were already made to comply with the prior rule. Yes. So let me take that one in. And so look, there is a DOL proposal that's under review at the White House Office of Management and Budget. And that's the procedural step, as you know, before the proposal is released to the public comments. So there's not a lot of insight on what's contained inside of that. I think there's been a lot of spectate to dialogue about what that may be.
But I think we'll learn more as we move to the next step. I think what we do believe is that once it moves to public comment, it's a long process, of which to work through, ultimately, either some proposed changes that may occur from that and/or not. And so I think you'll see a good public dialogue about what's being considered. That said, I think we did, as you said, did significant work back in 2016 and had some full innovation even around some products like mutual funds as an example that didn't ultimately -- wasn't ultimately utilized as we -- as the 2016 fiduciary rule was struck down and ultimately pivoted to the regulation best interest.
What is different, and I think -- and by the way, that will serve as a great baseline, a lot of the innovative work that we did. Some we use today in Reg BI, some we're not using, and we think it prepares us well of which to ultimately pivot and/or adjust for whatever changes may occur in the rule. I do think that the dialogue around the rule itself is a bit different in context, the circumstances are different. And as you know, Reg BI has just really been released out into the marketplace for a couple of years and -- we do think it proposes a higher standard of care, which we are aligned with.
And we think the SEC is the right regulator to create that rule across all parts of business, both retirement and non-retirement. And consequently, we think that because of that rule is in place, the consideration set for that and allowing that to run its course and ensure that it's effective and ultimately establishing and aligning around that higher standard of care, we think, has a lot of relevance in the dialogue that will occur.
And if you go back to some of the proposals in 2016, I think there is the big risk that ultimately you take away choice and that begins to harm low and middle-income investors by limiting access to brokerage advice those smaller retirement accounts, which obviously, systemically, it's not a good outcome and would be a big [ earning ] in [indiscernible] which I think will have a lot of pushback and a lot of relevant concern around that potential outcome.
So we just believe the circumstances are different to have this sort of public debate and open review around the process. All that said, if there are some changes incrementally, we do think we're well prepared to pivot and add those and continue to deliver a choice between both brokerage and advisory, we always believe it's principal choice, this is another option and we think it will serve investors [indiscernible] on that. So I hope that gives you a little color. The point is we don't really know yet. I think there is something that is being considered, and we think it will be a good healthy debate, and we'll be well-prepared. Great. And then just for my follow-up, just on the liquidity and succession solutions. You know that you're now opening that externally. I guess is there any way to frame how meaningful that could be relative to the size of the capital deployed internally they disclosed so far? And then second part of that question, and I know this topic comes up from time to time, but curious if you could give us any updated thoughts on potentially offering your broader business solution suite externally? Yes. So look, I think -- let me take the strategic part of that and then I'll turn it over to Matt to ask you -- to address your capital question. So look, the liquidity and succession solution that we came up with was on the premise of solving a big need, right, 1/3 of advisers potentially retiring over the next 10 years, certainly a relevant problem to solve and team did a great job of coming up with a differentiated creative solution that has ultimately been very appealing to existing LPL advisers that we're facing that same problem of challenge.
And I think because of its differentiated nature, it made sense for us to take those learnings and insights and then to potentially offer that outside of our platform. In doing that, high probability to those assets, and if we offered it to the external marketplace, we've then moved to the LPL platform, that would be the concept as another way to motivate them to move to our platform. Because of the demand and the interest that we've generated internally and because of the learnings that we've had just in the basically 45 days, we've been in market around it. We think it's going to have some interest and be broadly appealing to the outside marketplace.
We'll learn more hard to size right now because we just don't have enough data to support that. But we do think it's a feeling in another way to attract assets to the LPL platform and be a smart deployment of capital in order to do so. So that's kind of where we are now in that journey. More to come as we learn more. But at least that's how we think about it strategically. With respect to our other services that we may offer outside of the platform, I think we continue to have set that aside as a future possibility. We continue to see opportunity internally on -- with respect to our growing number of advisers on the LPL platform, and innovating on new solutions and expanding that portfolio set versus broadening the distribution outside of the LPL platform.
So think about that as our near-term focus is continue to add more services and supporting our growing platform here. I do think it's a relevant question at some point to ask, could you logically apply that outside of advisory base. Do you want to take that? Yes, Kyle. I think that -- I mean, the headline is that I wouldn't see any different level of capital deployment taking it external, other than to highlight when you're taking this externally, you're really doing 2 events. There's a recruiting event as well as the [ L&S ] transaction, the citing succession solution. So think about it from a capital deployment standpoint, a good frame would be that knowing that those 2 things would be occurring. But I think the headline point is nothing from a capital standpoint that will be different than we've talked about before. These are relatively small amounts of capital deployment on an individual level. It's more about, as Dan is covering the strategic connection of this capability from an adviser standpoint and our long-term growth. And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

Over the past quarter and throughout 2023, our advisers continue to provide their clients with personalized financial guidance on the journey to help them achieve their life goals and dreams. As we enter the new year, we thank our advisers for their continued commitment and dedication while we remain focused on our mission of taking care of them so they can take care of their clients. During the fourth quarter, we continued to see the appeal of our model growth due to the combination of our robust and feature-rich platform, the stability and scale of our industry-leading model and our capacity and commitment to invest back into the platform. As a result, we continue to make solid progress in helping advisers and enterprises solve challenges and capitalize on opportunities better than anyone else, and thereby serve as the most appealing player in the industry. With respect to our performance, we delivered another quarter of solid results while also continuing to make progress on the execution of our strategic plan. I'll review both of these areas, starting with our fourth quarter business results.
In the quarter, total assets increased to [ $1.4 trillion ] as continued solid organic growth was complemented by higher equity markets. Regarding organic growth, fourth quarter organic net new assets were $25 billion, representing 8% annualized growth. This contributed to organic net new assets for the year of $100 million, representing approximately 9%. In the fourth quarter, recruited assets were $17 billion bringing our total for the full year to $80 billion. Prior to large enterprises recruited assets for the full year were $67 million, an increase of nearly 50% year-over-year and a new annual record. This outcome was driven by the ongoing enhancements to our model as well as our expanded addressable market. Looking at same-store sales, our advisers remain focused on taking care of the clients and delivering a differentiated experience. As a result, our advisers are both winning new clients and expanding wallet share with existing clients. The combination that drove solid same-store sales in Q4.
At the same time, we continue to enhance the adviser experience through the delivery of new capabilities and technology and the evolution of our service and operations. As a result, asset retention for the full year was approximately 99%. Our fourth quarter business results led to solid financial outcomes with adjusted EPS of $3.51, which brought our full year total to $15.72, an increase of 36% year-over-year. Let's now turn to the progress we made on our strategic plan. Now as a reminder, our long-term vision has become the leader across the adviser centered market. To do that, our strategy is to invest back into the platform, provide unprecedented flexibility in how advisers can affiliate with us and to deliver capabilities and services to help maximize adviser's success throughout the life cycle of their businesses. Doing this well gives us a sustainable path to industry leadership across the adviser experience, organic growth and market share.
Now to execute on our strategy, we organize our work into two strategic categories: Horizontal expansion, where we look to expand the ways that advisers and enterprises can affiliate with us such that we compete all 300,000 advisers in the marketplace; and vertical integration where we focus on delivering capabilities, technology and services that help our advisers differentiate win in the marketplace, be great operators of the business. Now with that as context, let's start with our efforts around horizontal expansion. Over the fourth quarter, we saw strong recruiting in our traditional independent fund, adding approximately $14 billion in assets. As a result of the ongoing appeal of our model and the evolution of our go-to-market approach, we maintained our industry-leading win rates while also expanding the breadth and depth of our pipeline. With respect to our new affiliation models, strategic wealth employee and our enhanced RIA offering, we delivered our strongest year-to-date, recruiting roughly $15 billion in assets, nearly double the total of the prior year.
As we look ahead, we expect the increasing awareness of these models in the marketplace and our ongoing enhancements to their capabilities will help drive sustained increase in their growth. Next, the traditional bank and credit union space continues to be a consistent contributor to organic growth as we added approximately $1 billion of accreted assets in Q4. In addition, large enterprises remained a meaningful source of recruiting in 2023 with the addition of Bank of the West and Commerce. For 2024, we continue to prepare to onboard the retail wealth management business of potential financial. Now as a part of that process, our team has been on the road meeting with potential advisers to provide them a preliminary orientation to our platform, and the early feedback has been positive. Looking ahead, we are confident that the appeal of our value proposition for enterprises, match with our track record of successful execution, positions us well to help solve the needs of a broad spectrum of institutions.
Now within our vertical integration efforts, we are focused on investing back into the model in order to deliver a comprehensive platform capability, services and technology that help our advisers differentiate and win in the marketplace and run thriving businesses. As part of this effort, over the past quarter, we continued to make progress on our aspiration of delivering an industry-leading services. This work includes continuing to make our service model more flexible and efficient through a multichannel approach. The purposes of which is to offer a broad spectrum of service options including human-centric support, digital capabilities and artificial intelligence so that we can provide advisers the information they need and the channel that works best for them. In that spirit, over the last year, we have continued to expand our digital capabilities, including our digital hubs, which provides advisers always on support and centralized an intuitive form. Our investments in this area enabled us to expand from 2 digital hubs to 11 over the last year, with the newest being our [ Tax Hub ], which helps advisers process tax business in a streamlined and highly efficient way.
While we are still in the early innings of the adoption of this capability set, the percentage of advisers interactions that go through digital channels has roughly doubled over the last year from 10% to 20%. And as we continue to refine these capabilities, we believe that digital solutions can ultimately serve as much as 50% of our service interactions. Now as an additional part of our vertical integration strategy, we continue to expand and enhance our service portfolio and are encouraged by the evolving appeal of our value proposition and the seasoning of our capability. And as a result of solid demand, the number of advisers utilizing our portfolio of 14 available services continues to increase, and we ended the year with nearly 3,900 active users, up 27% from a year ago. Looking ahead, we remain focused on addressing the needs of a broader set of advisers and are innovating on new services that will directionally double the size of our services portfolio over the next 2 years. And one of the latest innovations in our services portfolio was inspired by our broader efforts to tackle the adviser transition coins. Which has historically been an industry-wide pain point given the friction and complexity changing firm.
That said, rather than seeing the transition process as a headwind, we view it as an important strategic opportunity. As the easier we can make it for advisers to change firms, the more it will drive adviser movement in the industry, where we are well positioned to benefit the market leader in recruiting. To help solve for that opportunity, we have developed several new transition capabilities and solutions, including live testing environment for advisers to familiarize themselves with our platform board transition, fully automated stages of the onboarding process and the suite of transition services that includes short-term admin, branding and bookkeeping support, which helps simplify the transition and onboarding journey ultimately accelerate advisers readiness and growth. Early feedback on these transition services has been positive, and they are proving to be a catalyst for additional subscriptions as 40% of advisers who use these solutions end up subscribing to one or more of our other ongoing services.
And as we move forward, we will continue to challenge ourselves to solve for advisers' needs at every stage of their practice in order to help them build the perfect business for themselves and ultimately maximize their systems. In summary, in the fourth quarter and throughout the year, we continued to invest in the value proposition for advisers and their [indiscernible] while driving growth and increasing our market. As we look ahead, we remain focused on executing on our strategy to help our advisers further differentiate and win in the marketplace and as a result, have long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt. All right. Thank you, Dan, and I'm glad to speak with everyone on today's call. Before I review our fourth quarter results, I would like to highlight our progress during 2023. Against an evolving market backdrop, we maintained our focus on supporting our advisers and their clients while executing on our strategic priorities. We continue to grow assets organically in both our traditional and new markets, successfully onboarded new enterprise clients and continue to make progress with our liquidity and succession solution. So as we enter 2024, we remain excited about the opportunities we have to serve and support our more than 22,000 advisers, while continuing to invest in our industry-leading value proposition and drive organic growth.
Now let's turn to our fourth quarter business results. Total advisory and brokerage assets were $1.4 trillion, up 9% from Q3 as continued organic growth was complemented by higher equity. Total organic net new assets were $25 billion or approximately an 8% annualized growth rate. Our Q4 recruited assets were $17 billion, which brought our total for the year to $80 billion. Looking ahead to Q1, our momentum continues, and we are on pace to deliver another strong quarter of recruiting. As for our Q4 financial results, the combination of organic growth and expense discipline led to adjusted EPS of $3.51. Gross profit was $1.7 billion, down $3 million sequentially. Our payout rate was 87.6% up 30 basis points from Q3 due to the seasonal build in the production moves. Looking ahead to Q1, we anticipate our payout rate will decline to approximately 86.5% as the production bonus reset at the beginning of each year.
With respect to client cash revenue, it was $374 million, down $4 million from Q3 as average client cash balances declined slightly during the quarter. Client cash balances ended the quarter at $48 million, up $1 billion sequentially, marking the first quarterly increase since the second quarter of 2022. Within our ICA portfolio, the mix of fixed rate balances ended the quarter at roughly 60%, within our target range of 50% to 75%. As a reminder, during Q4, there were roughly $2.5 billion of fixed rate contracts that matured. We placed $2 billion of these maturing balances into new 5-year contracts, yielding approximately 415 basis points, which is roughly 85 basis points higher than their prior yield. Looking more closely at our ICA yield, it was 317 basis points in Q4, down 1 basis point from Q3. As for Q1, based on where client cash balances and interest rates are today, as well as the yields on our new fixed rate contracts, we expect our ICA yield to increase by approximately 5 basis points. As for service and fee revenue, it was $131 million in Q4 down $5 million from Q3.
This decline was primarily driven by lower [indiscernible] following our largest adviser conference of the year in Q3 as well as seasonally lower higher [ rating ]. Looking ahead to Q1, we expect service and fee revenue to decrease by approximately $5 million sequentially on lower conference. Moving on to Q4 transaction revenue. It was $54 million, up $4 million sequentially due to increased trading volume. As we look ahead to Q1, based on what we have seen to date, we would expect transaction revenue to increase by a couple of million sequentially. Now let's turn to expenses starting with core G&A. It was $364 million in Q4, bringing our full year G&A to $1.369 billion. This was within our outlook range and for the full year, represents approximately 15% growth. As a reminder, this included an opportunistic 5% of incremental spend focused on accelerating our capabilities as we took advantage of the favorable macro environment. Now as we look ahead to 2024, we plan to return to more normalized levels of spend, concentrating on investments that enable organic growth and drive operating leverage in our business. In addition, our ongoing investments to scale our business are driving greater efficiencies.
Pulling this together, we expect our 2024 core G&A growth rate to be roughly half the rate we saw in 2023. More specifically, we intend to grow 2024 core G&A in a range of 6.25% to 8.75%. As for Q1, we expect core G&A to be in the range of $360 million to $370 million. Note that this core G&A spend is prior to expenses associated with Prudential. As we move closer to onboarding them towards the end of this year, we'll provide an update on 2024 core G&A. I would just emphasize that we expect only a small amount of spend in 2024 as the majority of these costs will be incurred in 2025. Moving on to Q4 promotional expense. It was $138 million, down $2 million sequentially. As lower conference spend was partially offset by higher prudential related onboarding and integration costs. Looking ahead to Q1, we expect promotional expense to be roughly flat as we have one of our largest adviser conferences during the quarter, which will be offset by seasonal declines in marketing spend.
As for regulatory expense, it was $9 million in Q4. Looking forward, given the increased size and scale of our business, we would expect regulatory expense to be roughly $10 million per quarter. Looking at share-based compensation expense. It was $16 million in Q4, flat compared to Q3. As we look ahead, we anticipate this expense will increase by approximately $6 million sequentially, as Q1 tends to be our highest quarter of the year, given the timing of our annual stock boards. Regarding capital management, our balance sheet remained strong in Q4 with corporate cash of $184 million. I would note that during the quarter, we completed our first investment-grade debt offer. Issuing $750 million of senior notes. With that, our leverage ratio increased to 1.6x and is within our target leverage range of 1.5 to 2.5x. Turning to how we deploy that capital. Our framework remains focused on allocating capital aligned with the returns we generate, investing in organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A where appropriate, returning excess capital to shareholders.
In Q4, we deployed capital across our entire frame as we continue to invest to drive and support organic growth, allocated capital to M&A within our liquidity and succession solution and return capital to our shareholders repurchasing $225 million of shares. As we look ahead to Q1, we plan to repurchase $200 million of our shares, keeping us on track to execute our $2 billion authorization over 2 years. Turning now to interest expense. It was $54 million in Q4, up $6 million sequentially. Looking ahead to Q1, given current debt balances and interest rates, we expect interest expense to increase by approximately $7 million from Q4. In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results. As we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue investing to serve our advisers, grow our business and create long-term shareholder value. With that, operator, please open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Maybe just to start off with a question on core G&A and organic growth. The double-digit organic growth you've achieved these past 3 years, it's really been bolstered at least in part by significant investments in the platform, and core G&A has also grown at a double-digit clip as well. So the updated core G&A guide for '24 certainly surprised positively. It does imply a significant moderation as you noted, Matt, in expense growth. But should we expect a slower G&A growth to drive a commensurate slowdown in organic? Or do you feel the NNA momentum can be sustained even with the moderation in G&A spend? Yes, Steven, I'll give you some color here, but the answer is going to be the latter. I think the investments are moderated and our confidence and conviction around continuing to drive organic growth is just the same. Now the details below that, just building a little bit on what I shared in the prepared remarks, the cost strategy or investment strategy remains driving investments prioritizing to drive organic growth, as well as driving productivity and efficiency. And I think what's probably most relevant in this conversation is also adapting as the environment evolves. So if you look at, to your point, on 2023 and growing 15%. You kind of break that into -- that 15% into 3 equal categories of about 5% each. The first was really about serving and supporting the core business growth. The second was about continuing to make investments to really improve our value prop, through and establish ourselves in the new models and addressable market to scale our services, things of that nature. And that third category, that third 5% was really just being opportunistic about the market really accelerating investments. And I think when you look at the guidance for 2024, our plans for 2024, it's really pulling back in that third category. So we're continuing to make the investment growth. We're continuing to make the investments to improve our value proposition and capabilities in just those two things, and this may get really to the core of your question, that would typically lead to core G&A growth in the 8% to 10% range. But then you put on top of that, the investments we're making for productivity and efficiency which do create capacity to invest each and every year are getting even better. And it's that final point that brings us down to the 6.25% to 3.4%. So hopefully, the color helped there, but I think the headline point is our conviction on continuing to deliver organic growth in this high single digits remains. That's great to hear. And for my follow-up, Matt, I was hoping you could just provide an update on January trends. I know it's a seasonally weaker month, typically for both M&A and cash. And just with cash trends also stabilizing over the last 6 months, just speak to your confidence level that some of these sorting headwinds, which have gotten a lot of their play are largely in the rearview. Yes. I think I'll start on cash. I mean the headline is we really saw a cash start to stabilize back in July. So really, if you look at the second half of the year, even by the month, we ended the year at a pretty similar level of where we ended July. So I think what we're seeing in January is really a continuation of that stability. So just a reminder, the seasonal factor that does hit in January is advisory fees typically hit primarily in the first month of the quarter. So we -- so those do reduce cash balances. It's around $1.2 billion. Outside of that though, we've continued to see stability. So the amount of cash balance moving from customer activity was actually a slight increase in January. So you put that together and cash balances overall for the month are down $1.2 billion, but it's primarily driven by those fees and the activity is actually a slight increase. So I think headline is continuing to see stability on the cash sweep side.
On the organic growth side, and maybe just -- I'll give a little bit of context and perspective on the overall quarter as well as the month of January. To your point on your first question, when you look at the last 3, 4 years of really driving and delivering that high single-digit organic growth, given the nature of Q1, the first quarter is usually a little bit lower. So in those years, it was typically in the 6% to 7% zone. So if we look at what we're seeing for Q1 '24, is really delivering something in a similar place, that's 6% to 7%. The only thing I would highlight and the reason for this color is we would expect January to actually be a little bit lower than normal in the 1% to 2% zone, and then February and March actually to be higher than typical, really at those high single digits, really coming together at a 6% to 7% for the quarter. And really, the reason for that is that the seasonal factors that we just talked about on the cash sweep side, meaning advisory fees hitting in the first month of the quarter as well as you have on the NNA front, that normal slowdown in the first half of January because of the [ gender ] closing in the second half of December as well as advisers taking time off. You have those normal factors that come through in January.
Two things I would highlight, though, for this can. First is recruiting. Our recruiting continues to be strong. You may recall, Q1 of last year, we set a new record in recruiting prior to large enterprises at around $13 billion. We're on track to exceed that in the first quarter this year. So continued strength there, just the timing is a little shifted more towards February and March. So you got a little bit of weakness in January. And then on the attrition side, a little bit of the opposite and that attrition is going to be a little bit heavier in January versus February and March. As we had two practices that were acquired to part during the month. And that's normal. It happens from time to time. We just happen to have two in a single month in January. Outside of that, our retention remains consistently high with the levels we've seen. So lots of color there, but I would headline it in, we're looking at Q1 and continuing in that 6% to 7% zone. And you're just going to have a little bit of a different shape to the quarter with January in that 1% to 2%. Lots to unpack there, but thanks so much for the detail, Matt. And our next question comes from Alexander Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for the question, as well. Dan, I was hoping we could talk a little bit about the large enterprise channel for you guys. It's been an area of significant success over the last couple of years. So maybe talk a little bit about deal activity expectations for 2024. And in particular, curious about the level of engagement you guys are seeing from insurance company clients on the back of the Peru deal. Yes. Thanks, Alex. So look, with respect to our large enterprise channel, we opened this market up back in 2020 with a novel outsourcing solution. And initially, we targeted larger banks and have seen some success up to this point, capturing about $85 billion of assets to our platform. If you look at the total market for banks and outsourcing of wealth management for wealth management, it's roughly in and around $1 trillion. We believe our experience, reputation and capability set, it's a compelling solution that helps continue to strengthen that pipeline and offer up an interesting durable growth opportunity as we move forward. That said, at the same time, we took our solution that was targeted to banks and we made some additional investments and capabilities and personalized options, which enabled us to extend the appeal of that model to, as you said, the insurance companies or product manufacturers that operate wealth management solutions. And now that market represents an additional $1.5 trillion of opportunity. And with the Prudential announcement, it was a catalyst for additional inquiries, exploring the question. So why aren't they outsourcing? and we continue to progress in these discussions and explore others. They're still in the early stages, but we do believe this part of the pipeline will continue to evolve as well. So if I summarize it, as we move forward, we believe our market leadership capability set and a real deep IT for this enterprise channel creates a really unique growth opportunity for us. We're excited about. Great. And a quick follow-up for you, Matt. So nice to see you guys moving forward with reinvestments of the [ 6 ICE ] maturities, the $2 billion that you mentioned. How is demand holding up in the ICE channel for additional fixed maturities as we kind of think about the $6.5 billion tranche that's coming out this year. And is there a way to sort of accelerate some of that reinvestment? I know you provided a schedule. Kind of how that shakes out over the course of the year. But any opportunity to move a little faster in case rates to start moving lower to lock-in wider spreads? Yes, Alex, I think on the demand, the demand is strong. Like if you look at the $2 billion that we did place into new contracts towards the end of the quarter, we're able to place them in 5-year contracts. So that's kind of the longest duration that the market typically offers, which is where we prefer to be right now. And we're able to place them at a 30 basis point spread above where the curve is. And I think we've talked about for a long time in this marketplace, there really were no spreads to the curve and sometimes they're even discounts. So I think that's probably the most empirical data that the demand is out there is strong. And you see similar demand on the floating rate side as well. On The second part of your question, the opportunity to accelerate really aren't there. It's kind of the nature of a fixed rate contract, right, for the same reason on both sides of the equation from a bank liquidity standpoint where they get it on their side. It's not a very common thing. So I wouldn't expect any opportunities to accelerate it. But as you noted, we have -- when you look at the year, we've got $6.5 billion coming up. And if you look at the marketplace right now, we'd be able to place them in even higher rates. And if that 5-year point is available, we'll be excited to do it there as well. So market is good, but acceleration opportunity is probably not there. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Maybe just a question on the prudential expenses. First, I just wanted to confirm that the $125 million of the integration and onboarding expenses in the promotional line are onetime and still expected to entirely roll off by the start of 2025. And then can you just help frame the size of the incremental G&A growth we should think about million either on a percentage basis year-on-year or framing relative to the size of the Pru expenses in promo that will be rolling off in '24. Yes. Sure, Kyle. I mean I think on the $125 million, yes, they are definitely onetime and specific to bringing Prudential on board. I think the majority of them will be in 2024. So if you look at what we spent so far in '23, it's in the $25 million, $26 million range. of that remaining $100 million that will primarily be in '24. But just depending on the timing of when they come on board, some of that could flow over into 2025. Now the total amount wouldn't change. It's just a -- it would still be $125 million. It could -- some of it could just go into 2025, but the majority would be in 2024. On the core G&A front, I think the headline I would give you in kind of emphasized in the prepared remarks that the amount we expect in 2024 is relatively small, and it's all about the timing of when they come on board. I think to your question of how to dimension it, I think I'd just go back to the estimated EBITDA when it's fully ramped, which is around $60 million. And maybe just look at overall margins in our business around 50%, that should give you a sense of the overall expenses. That would go along with it. So I think if you did something like that, you'd be directionally correct. I'd just emphasize that it's -- from a cost standpoint, it's likely to be primarily in 2025, just given the timing of when they're going to come on board is towards the end of '25. Understood. And then just on the follow-up, if you just ask on the M&A environment, we're seeing a macro backdrop now that I expect to be more favorable for M&A in the sector. Markets are at all-time highs. We're starting to see some clarity on interest rates, at least relative to the past year or 2. So just wondering if you could speak to the opportunities you're seeing in the market, whether bid-ask spread between sellers and buyers maybe narrowing and the number of -- or types of deals that you're seeing come across your desk now versus maybe this time last year? Let me take a stab at that one. It's Dan and hopefully, I'll get all your questions inside of there. So I think, as you know, M&A remains a core part of our strategy complement to our organic growth opportunities. And to your question, we focus on three primary categories of opportunities. One is first to grow in our market. So potential acquisitions might include both broker-dealers and RIAs. Examples of that are our [indiscernible], [ Acquisition 101 ], Reed acquisition and then found Capital, which we're closing earlier this year. So those are good examples of how we might look across the marketplace for those opportunities. And look, as the industry continues to consolidate, we would expect to be a participant in that consolidation. The second type of transactions that will look at is to add capabilities and these are capabilities where we would ultimately evaluate allocate and should we allocate capital to build, buy or partner. And to the extent this accelerates our desire to create that vertically integrated, feature-rich platform and, this is where we would look to an opportunity like that. As capability transactions would include advisory world and delays. And to remind you, delays a trading platform that we're turning in to what we think will be a really industry-leading trading and rebalancing tool that we're making available to our entire client base in early in the [ Spring ]. So excited about that type of transaction and what we can do with it. The third type of category or example of a transaction would be deploying capital against this newest capability of liquidity and success. Certainly gives us a put our capital work in a way that both meets our disciplined return thresholds and then helps both internal and external advisers solve a really important question around this succession needs and requirements that we've talked a lot about over the next 10 years. And again, I think in doing that, it positions us well to not only do that for internal advisers, but also to potentially create that solution for those that aren't part of our enterprise today. So if you just summarize all of that, we consider M&A opportunities, a core part of our strategy, but we will remain discipline to make sure that the framework with which we assess them as they benefit strategically, financially, culturally and operationally, and we'll do it with good discipline around each of these two. I hope that helps. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Okay. Great. A question for Dan. I was interested by the comments you made about some of the new service innovations and really to encourage advisers to move and, I guess, move to LPL. And I guess I took that more as LPL looking to win more advisers in motion. But if I look at industry churn, it's been pretty anchored at 5% to 6% in recent history. So I'm just curious, based on what you just talked about, whether it's some of the innovations in the services portfolio or just that you're seeing more broadly occurring in the industry that could really change that 5% to 6% rate, and it would seem like it would be a pretty big deal, if you can. So just love to get a sense of kind of what those innovations actually mean? And then can that rate move for either LPL reasons or industry reasons? Yes, good question. So I think if we just sort of start with the first question around churn or that movement in the marketplace. And we continue to see adviser movement remain flat. Think about that in the range of 5%, 5.5% over the other part of the last couple of years, which is you know is below norms. Now there has been some mix shift in that turnover where it's coming from. In fact, in the last year, you've seen movement in the traditional independent market move up where there's been a slowdown as an example from the wires. That said, notwithstanding all of that, I think we first and foremost look at our overall win rate what is moving across all of our different affiliation models as a way to continue to understand their absolute appeal well as their hopefully growing appeal as we invest more into the platform or the model. And as we said earlier, despite this lower movement in advisers. If you look at the relative market share we're picking up in our win rates, you've seen those increases over the past 3 years with that investment back into the model. And I think look, for the newer models, not only do we have higher opportunities to enhance the capability set there as they're on a -- just a pressure journey, if you will, in terms of our investment capabilities there. Also, their seasoning, the going awareness and credibility they have in the marketplace can also be a catalyst for higher win rates there. So it's not just even the investment. It's that it's growing seasoning around our right to win, if you will, with those new models.
And then finally, to your point, I think one of the things that we look at is we can't completely control the movement of advisers in the marketplace. What could we do to contribute to it in this notion of concept making it easier to help laser move from one practice to another given that being what we believe is one of the big hurdles for advisers moving, boy, if you could solve that or begin to break that down and imagine that in different ways and thus create a much different rubric, if you will, for the change management effort sort of associated to moving the A to B that, that could be a real catalyst to increase that movement in the industry. And so that's the question I think we're trying to explore and that I alluded to in my remarks, and we're using our services portfolio and some of the ways at which we've learned how to add value to advisers and helping them operate, fund their practices and realize that we tweak them a bit and offered them while someone is going through a conversion, that actually could be a catalyst to making easier to go through that change management. And thus, it's successful at doing that more structurally, but then you could see the knock-on effect, if you will, of potentially accelerating the movement and with our ability to recruit and our positioning of our models in the marketplace, certainly, that's a strategic opportunity for us. So that's how we pulled that together. I hope that color added some little... Yes. Thanks, Dan. That's great color. And I guess my follow-up is just it's interrelated to that. So terrific momentum in recruited assets in 2023 and really the new affiliation models are clearly resonating in the market. And I believe you said $15 billion from those new channels in 2023. So that would seem to imply I mean the legacy channels would be around $50 billion to get to the $67 million total, if I'm correct there. So on the new affiliation channels, the contribution continues to scale and those mature, should that look like something similar to, call it, the $50 billion from the legacy channels? Or I'm just trying to size because they're growing so quickly, kind of what they look like at maybe maturity or something that's more mature like or maybe it's well above 50, but just want to get some thoughts on kind of where we're coming from to where we're going just because there has been such a tremendous growth there, especially when you split it out separately. Yes. It's a great question. And I think as we think about those longer terms and what is that possibility I think we start with the size of each of those markets. And that we've broken down in the employee base market is the largest one of all in that $11 billion to $12 trillion range or RIA in the second. And then -- and then the sort of Swiss model that we have is a subset, if you will, typically those coming out of an employee-based model. And so, if you think about the opportunities that associated with those, I think you would start with that broader market and then you begin to then drill down on -- what's our right to win? What's our ability to win, what are the capabilities necessary to continue to grow our win rates inside those markets. And then if you do that, it's reason to believe, given the size of those markets relative to the traditional independent that even if we achieve half of the win rate or the success rate we do on our traditional independent channel that those begin to make sizable contributions that as you were estimating -- look more like the contribution on the independent side. So what I'm not suggesting is we'll get there, what I am suggesting is that's an opportunity that it is port continuing to work into, invest into and challenge ourselves to achieve the type of win rates we have on the independent side in these large markets. I hope that helps. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. This quarter saw the biggest kind of quarter-over-quarter increase in sales-based commissions looks to be somewhat driven by annuities. So curious about your outlook for that and in the context of what the DOL has proposed, how you think that might change behavior or not going forward? Yes. Let me take that one. Thanks for the question. We have seen some momentum, frankly, since rates have gone up, but you've seen the interesting growth in the utilization and probably predictable growth in the utilization of fixed annuities. And then when the equity markets move and have volatility in them, and variable annuities can also be interesting opportunity to deploy capital. And so I think it's been a nice tailwind for annuities for the better part of the year -- last year plus, and you're exactly right. Fourth quarter just reinforced that. I think as we go forward, the question around the DOL is a good one relative to brokerage and advisory. And I think as we think about that, we go back to our playbook we used in '15 and '16 time frame where -- as from a principal standpoint, we believe that maintaining choice for advisers' clients is in their best interest and our interest in making sure that we do the things necessary to preserve the choice for advisers between brokerage and advisory and our ability to ensure that we can help them adequately do that as the rules change relative to Reg BI. And then again, if the DOL rule ultimately goes through and changes that slightly making sure that we're prepared to help them pivot where they can successfully continue to do that business where it's in the best interest of the fines. And I think hard to argue with making sure that you provide people choice and then ultimately enable those advisers to serve them and offering need to [indiscernible]. That said, I do believe that in many cases, annuities will continue to be used where they're needed, where they make sense as a rollover option or where they make sense in helping someone as we talked about earlier, with downside protection, it's still participating in the upside for the equity markets, there's good places to use them. I think that -- what we will see though is in other areas, you'll probably see a bigger shift to the utilization of advisory. It's just tougher to do brokerage business. There may be some places, small accounts, there may be other scenarios where given the two options, the adviser ultimately utilize the adviser solution. We're still in the best interest of the client, but also just in the spirit of making sure the business can be better than efficiency. So we do believe that's a trend hence, the investments in our advisory platforms, vertical integration we have around our adviser offering, again, lines up well with structural [indiscernible]. So put a capstone on it. we will and make sure that we're positioned to enable brokers to continue to be used. I do think that the DOL rule would create some headwind on the percentage of brokerage business that we see. -- but it won't be a complete change. You'll still see it utilized for some turnout helped. Understood. And then just as a follow-up, I think, Dan, you mentioned 99% retention in 2023. And then Matt, you called out January a couple of departures. So just curious if we can get some context around maybe what happens in January and if you think retention might be slightly different given the environment as we think about 2024 more broadly? Yes. No, our sense of it is look, we got to make sure we execute on our strategy. We've got to invest in our capabilities, and we've got to deliver attempt to deliver an extraordinary experience on a daily basis. We have solid trends there, strengthening NPS scores, evolving capability. We expect that retention rate in that 98.5% range to 99% range to be a good way to think about our good centering point, if you will, on retention for this year outside of the example of what Matt used, where someone sells the practice to potentially solve for succession solution. And look, that was the a trigger that we launched our liquidity and succession program a year ago gave us a great opportunity to go solve that really important question that many advisers had those two examples, maybe we didn't launch ours and time enough to get a swing at those. And though we won't win them all, we do believe we've got a really a few innovative solution that will position us well, not only help serve our clients already on our platform. We actually use it as a way to attract new assets to the platform because not only do we have a rich value proposition that we serve and support the daily needs we also can help them with their succession. So that's how we're [indiscernible]. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Ben Budish with Barclays. I think most of might have already kind of been covered, but maybe just one for Matt on the core G&A growth. Can you just talk a little bit about what gets you to the high or low end of the range as a potential is going to be not too impactful for this year. So what are the sort of factors that could drive that up or down? And at what point in the year do you start to get a better sense of where that shakes out? Yes. I think what typically drives us within the range is the costs associated with supporting the growth that happens during the year. I think if you look at Q4 of 23 of this quarter is a good example where we came in within our range, but at the high end of the range, and that was really about the variable costs associated with growing, whether it's variable compensation associated with that growth of the direct cost to ramp up. So that's typically the driver within that range, those things. Our next question. And our next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. I just wanted to come back to, Dan, some of your comments earlier just around the movement of advisers across the industry that you alluded to. Curious what's driving that change that at the industry level. I hear you on some of the services portfolio innovations that can help move it in your favor for you guys, but just at the macro backdrop for the broader industry. Just curious what might lead that churn to pick up here versus slow down even further? And then how do you see the sort of backdrop evolving if interest rates are cut? Yes, yes, good questions. Look, I do think you've got a number of different things that might create a slight headwind on movement than at the aggregate had brought it down from I don't know, historically, 7% kind of range for movement. And we would expect things to return and normalize over a period of time. These little headwinds that I referenced, some of it is still a bit of a hangover from COVID and just some of the change in complexity that was created as people work through that, I think, is one. I think a second one is you just got -- you've had a volatile market with a lot of geopolitical uncertainty that surrounds it and advisers avoid sometimes making big strategic moves or pivots or adjustments in periods of time where they've really got to be focused on the clients, and they don't want to create more change in the midst of uncertainty. And I think that's been something that we've seen over the last couple of years that have created some uncertainty. And I also think you see advisers also pivoting in a new world of post pending what they learned from that? What pressure does it put on their practices the growing complexity of regulations may drive up costs. The whole digitalization of their businesses and their offices and what does that mean? And how do they think about what is the best partner for them going forward. What are the types of services that are new to them to transform their practice. I think just trying to assess what those options and alternatives are in a world that's flipped on the side.
And now you throw AI on top of that, which in the short run, creates lots of noise and exuberance. Unfortunately, it's also a shiny penny that sometimes doesn't always lead to good productive outcomes. And so I think as we get further down the road of assimilating some order to the house being flipped on its side in some cases and helping them really see where they can use technology really wisely to drive productivity with again, either leverage tools or outsource risk management to lower their costs associated with a world that's getting tougher and tougher from a regulatory standpoint, where they really do think about, hey, how do I drive growth? And what do I need in my value proposition to do that? How do I leverage folks that I think those are some of the interesting questions that is they're able to solve those. It enables them to move forward in a little more informed way and thus at a faster pace. So those are some of the little , I think, skirmishes, if you will, that we're trying in as we go forward in time. It will help return maybe movement back to a more normal [indiscernible]. Great. And just as a follow-up question for Matt. On promotional expense. If I adjust for the large enterprise one-timers over the past couple of years, it looks like the underlying promo expense has been in the mid- to high teens. Does that sound about right to you? And arguably, that's in the context of high singles organic growth. So another question there. If we expect that sort of organic growth to persist in the high singles. Should we expect a similar mid- to high teens pace of underlying promotional expense going forward, excluding the large one-timers? Well, I think the -- probably the best way to think about it is just hone in on the key drivers of the growth. And I'd put it in three categories, which could have different trends. I think the first is organic growth overall. That's typically the biggest driver and the TA associated with bringing recruiting on board is a driver of that. So the amount of recruiting that we do is really the driver there. TA rates really have not -- have been fairly stable, haven't changed recently. So I think where recruiting goes is where that would go. The second is conference spend, and conference spend more kind of trends with the overall number of advisers that we have at LPL, right? They're really important part of how we engage with them, how they engage with each other. So as the firm scales, you could expect that spend to scale. And then lastly, as you highlighted, it's really the onboarding expenses associated with those large enterprises. So that really can be a little bit hard to predict because it depends on the firms that come on board. Credentials is a great example. We've got good insight into spending in '24 and good insight into spending overall to bring that on board. It just depends on what happens on the other side of it. So I'd really put it into those three categories, that kind of trend differently each. It just depends on how those three things play out. And our next question comes from Michael Cho with JPMorgan. I just want to touch on enterprise quickly again. And I have just a quick 2-parter here. You talked about a healthy pipeline and sort of an uptick in conversations since the potential announcement. But in terms of kind of looking ahead, I mean, does the potential onboarding and limit your bandwidth at all to do more prudential type deals. And then second, just longer term, looking beyond Prudential, I mean how should we think about framing the potential benefits to LPL's operating scale and leverage as you continue to gain critical mass within the enterprise opportunity set? [indiscernible] So Look, on the first one, I think we see an interesting pipeline on both sides of that in advice channel, as I said before, banks and on the insurance manufacturer related space. And with that portfolio comes to continued opportunity, right, to continue to explore and learn both how we're doing the existing programs and how that drives innovation to create more appeal and the second is every time you bring one on, how do you create a more automated have a better playbook to be more efficient at doing that, so you can do that better and faster and more economically at a lower cost. And so I would tell you we're much better than we were 3 years ago when we brought our first larger enterprises on and we continue to automate more and more of that kind of change management of onboarding effort process. And as you rightfully said, to the access that you're able to do that, not only are you going to create more interesting economic outcomes by lowering the amount of investment up front in these opportunities. You also can bring them on at a faster pace. And so I think we're working our way into to being able to be very thoughtful about how we bring these on and an order as assuring that's, first and foremost, we get the experience right, that you continue to operate your existing platform at the level that you want to. And then if you -- as you, again, get better and better at that, I think we can mine those up and bring those in a faster and faster pace. And that's what we're challenging ourselves to do without being overly precise and exactly how that would look or what that looks like. I think we begin to challenge ourselves with pragmatic opportunities to think how do you shorten that onboarding and change management network. So that's the problem [indiscernible]. Matt, you want to... Yes. Yes. I think the answer is a resounding yes on are there benefits to scale. I think when you look at just starting high level with the overall value proposition of this channel and the things that we're building you're bringing on clients where they're -- once they're on their platform, a big part of the attraction is getting access to our capabilities and allowing them to grow that channel faster on our platform. So you get a place where you're increasing your levels of organic growth. I think maybe to the core of your question, on the cost side, in each of these instances, now you're typically building out capabilities or technology that's really important to that particular enterprise, but they're usually applicable to others as well, right? So you're not only making sure that you have the ability to serve and support this particular client that you're bringing on, but you're usually enhancing those capabilities for things that the rest of LTL or the rest of this channel would like. And I think crew is a very good example of that. where we're not only bringing on capabilities specific to Prudential. We're building out a platform that can actually open up a much larger channel for us and to recruit more on. So a headline point is at least scale benefits and hopefully, those examples are helpful. And this concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back to Mr. Dan Arnold for closing remarks. Hey, I just want to thank everyone for taking the time to join us this afternoon, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thank you. And this concludes today's conference call.

With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Arnold. Thank you, Michelle, and thanks to everyone for joining our call today. Over the past quarter, our advisers continue to provide their clients with personalized financial guidance on the journey to help them achieve their life goals and dreams. To help support that important work, we remain focused on our mission, taking care of our advisers so they can take care of their [ clients ].
During the first quarter, we continued to see the appeal of our model growth due to a combination of our robust and feature-rich platform the stability and scale of our industry-leading model and our capacity and commitment to invest back into the platform. As a result, we continue to make solid progress and helping advisers and [ mission ] solve challenges and capitalize on opportunities better than anyone else and thereby serve as the most appealing player in the industry.
With respect to our performance, we delivered another quarter of solid results while also continuing to make progress on the execution of our strategic plan. I'll review both of these areas, starting with our first quarter business results. In the quarter, total assets increased to $1.4 trillion as continued solid organic growth was complemented by higher equity markets. Regarding organic growth, first quarter organic net new assets were $17 [ billion ], representing 5% annualized growth. This contributed to organic net new assets over the past 12 months of 96% representing approximately an 8% growth.
In the first quarter, recruited assets were $20 billion, which represents a quarterly record for [ recruiting ] periods when onboarding large institutions. This outcome was driven by the ongoing enhancements to our model as well as our expanded addressable markets.
Looking at same-store sales, our advisers remain focused on taking care of their clients and delivering a differentiated experience. As a result, our advisers are both winning new clients and expanding wallet share with existing clients, combination that drove solid same-store sales in Q1. At the same time, we continue to enhance the adviser experience through the delivery of new capabilities in technology and the evolution of our service and operations functions. As a result, asset retention first quarter was approximately 97% and 98% over the last 12 months. Our first quarter business results led to solid financial outcomes with adjusted EPS of $4.21.
Let's now turn to the progress we made on our strategic plan. Now as a reminder, our long-term vision is to become the leader across the adviser center marketplace. To do that, our strategy to invest back into the platform provide unprecedented flexibility in how advisers can affiliate with us. Hence, to deliver capabilities and services help maximize adviser success throughout the life cycle of the businesses.
Doing this well gives us a sustainable path to industry leadership across the adviser experience, organic growth and market share. Now to execute on our strategy, we organize our work into 2 strategic categories: horizontal attention, where we look to expand the ways that advisers and institutions can affiliate such that we are positioned to compete to all 300,000 advisers in the marketplace.
In vertical integration, where we focus on delivering capabilities, technology and services, to help our advisers differentiate and win in the marketplace to be great operators of their businesses.
And with that as context, let's start with our efforts around horizontal expansion. Now over the first quarter, we saw strong recruiting in our traditional independent market, reaching a new quarterly high of approximately $15 billion in assets. At the same time, due to the ongoing appeal of our model and the evolution of our go-to-market approach, we maintained our industry-leading win rates while also expanding the breadth and depth of our pipeline. With respect to our new affiliation models, strategic wealth, employee and our enhanced RIA offering, we delivered another solid quarter, recruiting roughly $2 billion in assets. And as we look ahead, we expect that the increasing awareness of these models in the marketplace and the ongoing enhancements to our capabilities will drive a sustained increase in their growth.
Next, in Q1, we added approximately $3 billion of recruited assets in the traditional bank and credit union space which continues to be a consistent contributor to organic growth. During the quarter, we also continued to make progress with the large institution marketplace where we announced that Wintrust Financial will onboard 2 of its wealth management businesses [ prior to ] our institution services plan. And at the same time, we continued our preparation to onboard the retail wealth management business of Prudential Finance. Collectively, these 2 deals will add approximately $66 billion of brokerage and advisory assets by early 2025.
Now as a complement to our organic growth, we also announced the planned acquisition of Atria Wealth Solutions, which supports approximately 2,400 advisers and 150 banks in credit unions, managing approximately $100 billion of [ advisory assets ]. This transaction will give Atria advisers access to our differentiated capabilities, technology and service. We are on track to close the transaction in the back half of this year and complete the conversion in mid-2025.
And finally, we're seeing solid momentum for liquidity and succession solution. As demand continues to build with existing LPL advisers while also creating interest with advisers outside our ecosystem, including our first signed external deal in the quarter.
Now within our vertical integration efforts, we remain focused on investing back into the model to a comprehensive platform of capabilities, services and technology that help our advisers differentiate and win in the marketplace and run thriving businesses. As a part of this effort, we continue to make progress across several key areas of focus, including our ongoing journey, build a world-class wealth management platform. And within that body of work, we are focused and meeting evolving the investment needs of our advisers and their clients, including the increasing interest for nontraditional investment products. To help solve for that demand, we are reimagining the end-to-end experience of our alternatives platform, including enhancing our custodial and operational capabilities for alternative investments making it simpler and easier to utilize, manage and transact these products.
And at the same time, expanding our alternative investment product offer, for over the last year, we have more than doubled the number of products available for advisers to utilize.
Another key area within our vertical integration efforts is the continued enhancement of the experience of our advisers deliver to their clients. One of the primary ways we do that is providing increased flexibility for advisers to tailor their ideal plan and experience. For example, we designed [ Account View ] our in-client digital platform which adviser can personalize access to features on a client-by-client basis.
In addition, we recently launched a series of enhancements to our in-client statement which provides increased flexibility in the channel of delivery and the cadence that clients see the information, also adding a unique interactive digital experience to further enrich the traditional statement.
Our continued work on our services portfolio is also a key area of our vertical integration strategy. And as a reminder, these services help solve for a broad spectrum of advisers and institutions need, and in doing so, help position them to deliver great advice and be great operators of the businesses. In that spirit, we are developing a number of solutions that help advisers expand the breadth and depth of their advice including the more effective utilization of financial planning, catering to the more complex needs of high net worth investors and delivering more personalized investment.
For example, as a part of our efforts to enrich our planning capabilities. Last year, we introduced our tax planning service, which is seeing strong demand in the market. And more recently, we expanded our high net worth services to enhance our adviser support of their high net worth aspects and clients through [ client ] case design, state planning and investment product analysis and the early indications have been favorable.
Finally, we're in part with our latest innovation, our new outsourced Chief Investment Officer service, which provides advisers with personalized investment expertise powered by LPL [ Visor ]. And based on the initial feedback, this is unlocking additional growth and efficiency in our adviser practices. Collectively, these services help expand our adviser's value proposition to their clients, enable them to win new prospects and increase the differentiation of the feel of our platform. As we move forward, we will continue to solve for our advisers' needs at every stage of their practice in order to help them build the perfect businesses for themselves, and ultimately maximize their success.
In summary, in the first quarter, we continued to invest in the value proposition for advisers and their clients while driving growth and increasing our market leadership. As we look ahead, we remain focused on executing our strategy to help our advisers further differentiate and win in the marketplace and as a result, drive long-term shareholder value.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt. Alright. Thank you, Dan, and I'm glad to speak with everyone on call. As we move into 2024, we remain focused on serving our advisers, growing our business and delivering shareholder value. This focus led to another quarter of strong organic growth in both our traditional and new markets, and we are preparing to onboard the wealth management businesses of Prudential and Wintrust.
In addition, we continue to build momentum in our liquidity and succession solution, including our first signed deal with an external [ practice ]. We also entered into an agreement to acquire Atria Wealth Solutions, which we plan to onboard to our platform in mid-2025. So as we look ahead, we remain excited by the opportunities we have to serve and support our nearly 23,000 advisers while continuing to invest in our industry-leading value proposition and drive organic growth.
Now let's turn to our first quarter business results. Total advisory and brokerage assets were $1.4 trillion, up 6% from Q4 as continued organic growth was complemented by higher equity margins. Total organic net new assets were $17 billion or approximately a 5% annualized growth rate. Our Q1 recruited assets were $20 billion, which prior to large institutions was the highest quarter on record. Looking ahead to Q2, our momentum continues, and we are on pace to deliver another strong quarter of recruiting.
As for our Q1 financial results, the combination of organic growth and expense discipline led to adjusted EPS of $4.21. Gross profit was [ $1.66 ] billion, up $59 million sequentially. As for the components, commission advisory fees net of payout were $260 million, up $41 million from Q4, primarily driven by higher advisory fees and a seasonally lower production modes. Our payout rate was 86.6%, down 100 basis points from Q4, largely due to the seasonal reset of the production bonus at the beginning of the year. Looking ahead to Q2, we anticipate our payout rate will increase to approximately 87.5%, primarily driven by the typical seasonal build in the production.
With respect to client cash revenue, it was $373 million, down roughly $1 million from Q4. Looking at overall client cash balances, they ended the quarter at $46 billion, down $2 billion sequentially, driven by advisory fees paid during the quarter. Outside of those fees, cash balances were flat to Q4.
As for our ICA portfolio, the mix of fixed rate balances increased to roughly 65%, within our target range of 50% to 75%. Looking more closely at our ICA yield, it was 323 basis points in Q1, up 6 basis points from Q4. As for Q2, based on our client cash balances and interest rates are today, we expect our ICA yield to decline by a few basis points.
As for service and fee revenue, it was $132 million in Q1, up $1 million from Q4. Looking ahead to Q2, we expect service and fee revenue to be roughly flat sequentially.
Moving on to Q1 transaction, it was $57 million, up $3 million sequentially as trading volume increased slightly. As we look ahead to Q2, based on typical seasonality and activity levels to date, we would expect transaction revenue to decline by a few million from Q1.
Now let's turn to expenses starting with core G&A. It was $364 million in Q1. For the full year, we continue to anticipate core G&A to be in a range of $1.455 billion to [ $1.491 ] billion. As a reminder, this is prior to expenses associated with Prudential and Atria.
Moving on to Q1 promotional expense. It was $132 million, down $6 million from Q4 due to lower onboarding costs for large institutions. Looking ahead to Q2, we expect promotional expense to increase by approximately $10 million sequentially due to increased transition assistance resulting from strong recruiting in large institution onboarding as we prepare for Prudential to join us in the fourth quarter. Looking at share-based compensation expense, it was $23 million in Q1, up $7 million from Q4. As we look ahead, we anticipate this expense to be at a similar level in Q2.
Turning to depreciation and amortization. It was $67 million in Q1, down $1 million sequentially. Looking ahead to Q2, we expect depreciation and amortization to increase by roughly $5 million sequentially, which includes technology development for Prudential. Regarding capital management, our balance sheet remains strong. We ended Q1 with corporate cash of $311 million, up $127 million from Q4. Our leverage ratio was 1.6x flat with Q4. As a reminder, we expect to close our acquisition of Atria in the second half of this year and plan to finance the transaction through a combination of cash and debt.
Following the close, we continue to expect leverage to be approximately 2x, near the midpoint of our target leverage. As for capital deployment, our framework remains focused on allocating capital aligned with the returns we generate, investing in organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A where appropriate and returning excess capital to shareholders.
In Q1, we deployed capital across our entire framework as we continue to invest to drive and support organic growth, allocated capital to M&A within our liquidity and succession solution and return capital to our shareholders, repurchasing $70 million of shares in January. We paused share repurchases for the last 2 months of the quarter to ensure we maintain a strong and flexible capital position, we closed on our acquisition of Atria. Following the close expected in the second half of this year, we will evaluate restarting share repurchases consistent with our existing capital frame.
In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results. As we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue investing to serve our advisers, grow our business and create long-term shareholder value.
With that, operator, please open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is going to come from the line of Devin Ryan with Citizens JMP. First question, I just wanted to dig a little bit on recruited assets, had a really nice quarter, up [ 57% ] year-over-year, but also a bit stronger than the net new asset trend and maybe that's just a January dynamic. But I just want to maybe digging a little bit about the divergence that you saw this quarter between these 2 metrics. And then more broadly on recruited assets and the outlook, it sounds like you're still seeing a really good recruiting pipeline. So I just love to get a little more context on that and kind of what you're seeing between both legacy channels and some of the newer affiliation channels. Yes. So Devin, it's Dan. Let me try to go in maybe a sequential order around those questions that is helpful. So first, maybe let me just tick Q1, I think, organic growth, which I heard inside your question. So during the quarter, we posted 5% organic growth. And given the seasonality we typically see in Q1, we would have expected that to be more like 7%. And while the underlying drivers of the business were strong, there were a couple of things in the quarter that drove the roughly 2% difference.
The first was some impact from the timing of onboarding recruiting, which equated to roughly 1% to Q1 organic growth. And that's just really a function of the recruiting, as we mentioned, I think, back in January's call, a lot of it happening in the second half of the quarter. And that gives you a little tailwind going into the second quarter.
And then the second thing that we mentioned last quarter as well was that there were 2 acquired practices that departed in January which accounted for a 1% impact to our attrition. So outside of those impacts, which we would categorize as a bit of noise, the underlying drivers that set us up well for the rest of the year remain intact and that's where you were getting at that record level of recruiting. The strongest pipelines that we've had [ or so ever ] historically and our continued low levels of adviser attrition that was consistent with the experience over the last couple of years. So we feel good coming out of the quarter and how we see that opportunity emerge over the remainder of the year.
I think you mentioned a bit of the -- perhaps some, how we think about new stores specifically or recruiting going forward, maybe it was second part of your question. And I think, look, we had a really nice quarter, $20 billion in recruited assets. You see significant growth year-on-year across all affiliation models. And at the same time, at expanded addressable market, our increasing win rates, it's driving that deep pipeline that I mentioned as we [ deep ] pipeline as we've seen and certainly is supportive of where we head going forward. And that gives us a really solid conviction that we're well positioned to continue to win a larger share of advisers in motion with respect to recruiting. And I think when you add them to the committed wins we have in the large institution marketplace, that sets up with a solid opportunity with respect to new store sales as we move forward. So hopefully, that gives you a little color on the quarter and then a little color around the recruiting [ firm ]. Yes, Dan. Really helpful. And just a follow-up, this is kind of interrelated, but just on the economics of all that. So the theme of competition in the space is continually been coming up. I know it's always a competitive market, so nothing necessarily new. But we look at transition assistance, it's up 6% sequentially, 25% year-over-year. I know that's directionally trending with growth. But can you maybe just talk a little bit about kind of the competitive dynamics and kind of the economics around recruiting and transition assistance? And how you feel like LPL is positioned around kind of those economics, let's say, transition deals or maybe a little bit higher than they have been. Yes. Let me start that and then Matt, you add any color on economics you think would be helpful. So look, I think with respect to the recruiting environment, right, we always start with the opportunity set. Adviser movement over the last 12 months has hovered around 5%, which remains lower than the historical norms. That said, despite those low overall movement, our win rates continue to move higher. And certainly, that's an encouraging trend relative to how we think about the opportunity set.
And then two, I think when we think about the environment, we look at the competitive landscape and the participants have remained largely the same. As do the priorities that advisers are looking for when they evaluate their options to potentially move. And as a reminder, the first priorities is around capabilities, technology and service. That's where we continue to further distinguish ourselves as we invest back into our model.
Next is the ongoing economics, which haven't changed significantly over time. And I think in the independent space, especially create a compelling and interesting scenario for advisers. And then lastly, you get transition assistance rates, which we've seen pretty stable over the last year and feel good about how we're well positioned across our portfolio of different affiliation models in terms of how we support that adviser to make that transition.
So given all of that, the strength of our overall value proposition continues to resonate, and we remain really confident that the ongoing appeal of our model positions us well to sustain our industry-leading win rates and market share. I don't know you want to add anything to that, Matt? I wouldn't not really add to that. I just underscore the point, I think on, Devin, on capabilities is really what matters from a decisioning standpoint on advisers and where they're joining firms. And I think from a TA standpoint, as Dan said, the rates have really been stable for quite a while. I think it's for us and the growth there, it's more about the recruited AUM itself that's coming on board, which I know you see in follow the numbers. But Q1, which is typically the seasonally lowest quarter of the year, bringing in $20 billion prior to any large financial institutions, I think is the driver there. So it's about the level of recruiting. TA rates have been pretty stable. And one moment as we move to the next question. our next question is going to come from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. You guys mentioned liquidity succession a couple of times this afternoon, and it's been coming up in [ other calls ] as well. So maybe level set for us kind of where that business is today, just maybe in terms of size or AUM, however you want to frame it? And how meaningful do you expect this to be to your organic growth targets, which I guess, continue to be in the high single-digit range in terms of M&A over the next couple of years? Yes, Alex, I'll start there just on some of the -- maybe the economics and capacity parts of your question. I think we're quite bullish on this offering and the solution. The economics are compelling and I think from a capacity standpoint, I think there are ultimately limitations on the number of deals we can do in a given year. So if you look at what we've done since we launched the program, since 27 to date, I think when we look at our team in capacity and how you bring these practices on board. I think probably max capacity per year, I would think about in the 30 to 40 [ zoom ]. So then when you put the financial aspects against that from a capital standpoint, we're applying capital consistent with our M&A framework. So they will deploy capital here at about the 6 to 8x EBITDA range. These deals are relatively small in the $10 million to $20 million zone, I would say, skewed towards -- closer to the $10 million side of it.
And then financially, the economics are pretty attractive in that the ROA of these firms effectively doubles when we purchase them. So if you're in the thick of the 30 basis point zone, we'd be earning 60 basis points once we are on the practice. And that's largely a function of the reduced payout onto advisers. So that's where you would see those economics show up.
So those are the economics. So I think it's really financially compelling, but I think maybe even more exciting or more compelling is really the strategic value of this solution. Maybe Dan, may be better, if you want to jump in there? [indiscernible]. Dan, I'm sorry, I don't think we could hear you, unfortunately. I don't know if it's my phone or maybe other people in the call are same. It was user error on my part. Sorry about that. So let me start over. And again, I think as we've discussed before, our opportunity set is really driven by trying to solve that big strategic question of how do we help potentially as many as 1/3 advisers retire and transition the businesses over the next 10 years. And while there are a variety of options that are available in the marketplace. We think ours is really differentiated and compelling one in a very elegant way to help these advisers transition their practices to take care of them, to take care of their team, to take care of their clients and ultimately create a bridge to the next entrepreneurial leader or owner.
And in that spirit, I think since we've rolled it out to our advisers, it's been -- which was late in 2022, it's been very, very appealing for those that are exposed to those possibilities. And as Matt said, we closed roughly 27 deals to date. And given the success with our existing advisers. Now we've extended the question to the external marketplace and in the fourth quarter began to explore how we could help those advisers that are on the LPL platform with the same type of solution to that big question of how do they transition their practices. And as we mentioned, we were fortunate enough to close our first deal in Q1, and we've got a pretty solid pipeline building there.
So I think we see it as this multidimensional opportunity of supporting and helping our existing advisers extend those assets on our platform for another generation of advisers and then to also, as a catalyst for growth to complement the other opportunities that we focus on and have to drive growth. And we think it's a compelling differentiated solution. A little hard to replicate. So we think it will resonate in the external market. Great. No, that's very helpful. So my second question, kind of related, I guess, to some of the new initiatives. You guys have been super busy in the last few months with a number of deals, [ H2 ] obviously being on the larger size. How should we think about the capacity for incremental M&A, call it, over the next 12 months as we're sort of waiting for [ H2 ] close? And then obviously, you guys have to integrate it. And then as part of this [ H3 ] conversation, maybe you can hit on the competitive dynamics in the bank channel post this deal, given that we're a pretty sizable player there. Yes. So I think -- listen, relative to onboarding these programs and making sure that we have the ability to support and scale them. I think it is something that we've been working on since the good fortune of onboarding some of the larger financial institutions, BMO and [ MT ] in 2021. And so our guide principle when we explore any growth initiative, whether it's organic win, like large institutions or even an acquisition like Atria is ensure that, we're going to continue to deliver an exceptional experience to our existing advisers and that then we provide a seamless transition for advisers that are joining our platform. And that spirit, we've continued to evolve our transition approach because we've iterated, we've improved and gotten a lot better over the last few years. We established a disciplined operating rigor. We use seasoned run books and automation, all in the spirit of delivering a high-quality successful outcomes that are repeatable and sustainable. And with each iteration, as I mentioned, we continue to enhance the efficiency and efficacy of how we execute the onboarding process.
Now the important part about that is that certainly then improves and enhances quality that we deliver but also the pace at which we can deliver these. And I think as we continue to go forward with each iteration, we adopt new ideas, new concepts, new ways of which to do them in a simpler and faster way, and we'll continue to work on that and iterate that I think will help us know and deliver an industry-leading onboarding experience but do it in the simplest and fastest way possible in the market. So that's sort of the context of how we think about increasing the capacity to support that ongoing opportunity.
I think -- and then your second question, remind me what it was? Sorry. Just the competitive positioning in the bank's channel, institutions channel after you guys integrate Atria, there are a sizable player there, and now you have obviously more presence in that channel with them eventually under your umbrella? Yes. So again, I think we've seen that marketplace as sort of an emerging opportunity where we took a novel concept back in 2020 as we began to offer it to the marketplace and establish a significant advantage from just having market share developing and growing IP around how to support and serve those clients. And then ultimately, continuing to evolve our capability set to make sure that we can help them in terms of their risk profile of cluster around this business line or service increase or enhance financial results or [ management ] performance of their programs to create operational efficiency and scalability into their programs and then ultimately to support them with growth. If we can do that within this value proposition and then have the advantage of the history and the experience of operating and working with these clients better practice at onboarding through the change management, a very complex effort. But that gives us a distinctive disadvantage in the marketplace that we think really resonates when we go out and share that with any [ prospective ] new clients.
So I think we feel great about our positioning in the marketplace, the insights and perspective that we've been bringing forward that have enriched our value proposition that again, it's hard to do if you hadn't had the experience from [ doing so ]. So I think about that leadership. We think it's pretty durable and an interesting ongoing growth opportunity. Thank you. And one moment as I move on to our next question. Our next question is come from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. So I wanted to start with a follow-up on just the liquidity and succession discussion. Matt, you alluded to some of the limitations on the pace of deployment. But I was hoping you could just speak to the cadence, how that this has been launched externally that we should be contemplating? And given the higher year-on-year payout ratio guide for 2Q when should we expect to see those reductions in the adviser payout rate as some of that liquidity and succession accretion really starts to come through? I think on, so on that last point, right? I think when you look at the payout, there's a handful of things going on. But I think you're already seeing it within the payout rate just based on the 27 deals we've done so far. So maybe, if you just looked at payout rate year-over-year for Q1, so just to eliminate kind of seasonal production build. And as a reminder, the Q1 payout for last year had a 40 basis point kind of catch-up onetimer. So overall, payout was flat year-over-year.
And there are 2 things in there that actually drove out up a little bit. The first is kind of building on what Dan was just talking through the institutions channel and the growth in the institutional channel, which I think you had a much higher payout than the average, also has a much lower cost to serve, lower TA rates. When you get down to things, bottom line economics like [ half ] margins quite compelling. But if you're just looking at the [ pet ] rate, you're going to see that grow as that business grows.
And then we had some pricing reductions or pricing investments on our corporate advisory platform. We had announced those last year, this took effect on the first quarter. So had those 2 things that bias pay out up. But then liquidity and succession did drive payout down to offset that. So there are moving parts in there, but you are absolutely starting to see that go up in the payout rate. Maybe not on an individual quarter-to-quarter just given the size of our overall business, but you are starting to see that over time.
I think on the capacity point, and not sure we're specifically doing that. So maybe just a follow up if we're not hitting that. But I think overall, when you look at whether it's internal or external, and you think through the process to onboard these teams, make sure we're putting the proper field management in place, all the complexities associated with it. That's really where the 30 to 40 deals per year comes from just to make sure that we're bringing those on board in a way that really delivers the strategic value that Dan was describing earlier. Really helpful color, Matt. And for my follow-up, just a question on cash levels and expectations around reinvestment, just given the significant number of fixed-rate contracts coming due, I believe, roughly $6 billion over the next 3 quarters. Where are those fixed contracts going to get renewed relative to that 240 basis point back book? And should we expect that that's all going to be renewed in fixed rate contracts, given that we are starting to see some signs of cash stabilization? Yes. I mean I think on the plans to renew, I think we like being in the center of that range, that 50% to 75% range, which is where we are now. So we'll make decisions and judgments about that. But I think with a stable cash balance and being at 65%, I think it's a fair assumption to assume our plans would be to renew.
When you look, maybe just to look at the next quarter, so not have to go too far out, the maturities, that $2 billion of maturities are towards end of next quarter and those specifically are at 200 basis points right now. So they're kind of below that average a year. And if you look at where we would typically place in the 3- to 5-year range, where that marketplace is. I think in today's market, you can assume in the 450 basis point range is where we place those. So of course, things can move between now and [ the end of ] Q2 where we're sitting right now, you'd be going from 200 basis points up to the mid-40s on that $2 billion. And one moment as we move on to our next question. And our next question is going to come from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Maybe just circling back to the enterprise channel. You guys have had a lot of success there over the past couple of years. I'm just hoping you could talk a little bit about the pipeline for new mandates, how those conversations are evolving. And then on the [ Pru ] platform, more broadly on that. I was hoping maybe you could speak a little bit to the Pru platform that you've customized and built for Pru, just how that differs from what you've done with other enterprise clients and how you might be able to take the sort of capability set into other channels or markets over time? Yes. So with respect to the institution pipeline, we have continued opportunity to -- it swings in the [ batter's ] box in the large bank space. Obviously, we've had an established a series of a number of years of success in bringing those clients on an success that those institutions are having what's on the platform from a financial performance standpoint, from new capabilities and solutions and features, I think certainly reinforces the value that the model can provide them and thus helps us in those ongoing dialogues with other opportunities within the bank space. That's about a $1 trillion opportunity or a marketplace. And so there's a number of opportunities that remain out there, and we're encouraged by the dialogue we're having in that part of the marketplace.
And then I think also with the win with Pru, right? We expanded that market to include kind of wealth management solutions that are owned or operated by audit manufacturers and specifically insurance companies. And I think that's certainly [ dive in ] created the opportunity to have a number of dialogues companies that are similar in nature to a Prudential and certainly exploring the possibility of outsourcing, where an outsourcing solution wasn't always available in that part of the marketplace. And so a longer sales cycle and sort of longer iterative consultative approach to that large [ urge ]. We are encouraged by the emerging dialogue and discussions we're having in that for the markets.
I got your first question. Your second one, ask again, please? Sorry, the first part was just on the pipeline for new mandates and conversations. And then the second part was just around the Pru [ single-built ] platform and opportunities to take that elsewhere to other markets or channels over time. Yes. Thank you. Sorry. So I think I answered the first one. So on the second half, with respect to some of the capabilities that we're thinking about relative to Pru, part of the opportunity in exploring that and solving for that was I think creating what I think are 2 interesting applications that are somewhat novel in the marketplace today. The first one is the expansion of our platform that will enable the audit manufacturer and the LPL suite of products to exist in a single experience.
And if you think about that relative to insurance, as an example, that can be a really important element and differentiator where you get a really seamless integrated solution set across your entire product offering in, again, that's kind of a novel concept in a hypothesis of a lot of folks thinking, wow, that would be a really interesting thing to solve for and I think inside this opportunity we're solving for that. So we're really encouraged about that. And again, once you do that, that can be valuable to any number of other different larger institutions that might value that.
Second one would be an integrated operating platform that embeds workflows and connectivity, not only through our systems, but to the parent and third-party systems. And so it's kind of a cool operational efficiency, again, across the landscape and [ once ] they do, that makes it easy for them to collaborate, operate and work with us in a very integrated way. So those are just 2 [ applications ] I think we think are really, again, interesting and differentiating them but also applicable to other potential prospects. I hope that helps. Just a follow-up question, if I could, just on client cash. Just curious what you're seeing in terms of underlying client behavior, I realize the cash allocation a bit lower today versus historical. But when you look at the customer behavioral trends under the hood with cash going out of the account, just curious if there's anything different now that you're seeing relative to historical, and as you kind of look out from here, is there a certain macro or rate environment that you think would be helpful in terms of analyzing cash allocations to [ parent her ]? Michael, yes, I think -- I mean, the headline is -- and I think you can see it in our metrics. I think we've seen stability in the category of near full deployment for quite some time now, right? Look at Q1 results and cash balances kind of remained in that just above 3% zone, largely coming down just by fees in the quarter. So I think you're starting to get to that place where you're really at full deployment. And I think from an environment standpoint, and where things could go, I think history is the best guide. I think we're in a place where clients are [ full ] to deploy, the equity markets are rising. Interest rates are high, and they're fully deployed in the market. And I think when we've seen environments that are the opposite of that, where they're in more of a defensive position, you see cash balances come back up, right? That doesn't feel like that, of course, in the moment, but I think that is the behavior we've seen time and time again. And I think that's the dynamic we would expect to continue.
All that being said, I'd just emphasize, we are seeing that stability where cash is really coming down for things like paying fees and things as opposed to deployment in the marketplace has gotten pretty stable in the last quarter or so. One moment as we move on to our next question. And our next question is going to come from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Matt, there was something you could talk to the factors that are going to get us -- or get you towards the low or the high end of your G&A growth for this year and now that we're 4 months in, kind of where you think you're tracking based upon current trends. Yes. I mean I think when you look at it, just the first quarter, right, from an annualized rate, we're at the low end of that guidance. And I think when you look ahead to Q2 would probably be something in a similar zone. So I think we're -- we feel good that we are tracking towards our guidance overall. I think the things that can move us within that range or similar to things that are in the prior years, which is more about our levels of organic growth, opportunities that we see during the year that really drive, whether it be variable cost, variable compensation, or the costs associated with that growth.
But the headline I would give is, we feel comfortable of landing within that zone. And just a reminder, that is prior to expenses associated with Pru and Atria and to the extent that those impact core G&A, we'll give updates later in the year on that. The headline is we feel good. Understood. And then, Dan, I was hoping you could provide some updated thoughts around the DOL rule. Obviously, we got the full proposal last week. Any changes to how you were thinking about it and what you said previously? Yes. So as you said, a hot topic over the last week since the release. But look, the headline is that I think the final rule reflects [ of ] changes from the original proposal and generally better aligns with the SEC's Reg BI, which we believe is a good thing for investors. And as you probably have seen the rules is scheduled to be [ compacted ] in September, although there is a 1-year transition period for firms to acknowledge [ fiduciary ] established and comply with specified conduct standards. So that's probably a long-winded way to say so. There's probably a year time line in and around getting any changes that need to be required or made in your compliance programs in place such that you can build new responsibilities.
That said, our team is working to finalize the design and implementation of our compliance program. And again, we feel good about that preparation and the ability to execute around the effective framework -- effective dates and framework that we've seen thus far. We're able to leverage some of the work we did in 2016, which ultimately wasn't implemented, in addition to some work that we've already done connected the Reg BI. So at the same time, there are a few areas like around rollovers where we'll have to deploy new approaches and solutions, again, we can come, they're solvable for us.
All that said, it's safe to assume that there will be litigation challenging the rule as there was a case with successful litigation we saw back in response to the 2016, we all of that could potentially impact both the compliance approach that any other stake in the time line. So we draw out on that, but we do think it was a better landing spot than originally. And one moment as we move on to our next question. And our next question has come from the line of Bill Katz with TD Cowen. So just coming back to cash for a moment. To the extent that we follow the forward curve from here, and I appreciate your comments, Matt, that there's some cyclicality longer -- no longer looking on this. But just sort of using your current AUM base, even if I use apply an 8% growth rate against that and sort of assume a 3% allocation and I adjust for [ core ] billings. Should we be thinking of a scenario of sort of flatter client cash here until a more strident change of interest rates as we sort of think of the models? Well, I think you walking through your model there, Bill. I think the headline point is if you're assuming the environment remains the same, I think assuming cash is fully deployed in the market, I think it's assumption. I think the -- I think the point you're making is we continue to grow, that growth does come with cash. So I think modeling that versus the fees we pay and things of that nature, I think is a good way to look at it, and maybe the bottom line, I think when you look at the cash as a percent of AUM, where we are in that low kind of 3% [ down ] you're certainly getting to the point of friction from going below that when you've got to have a certain amount of cash to manage balancing, paying fees, facilitating withdrawals or just a natural resistance when you get down to the levels that we are.
So I think that was where you were probing, but those levels would be what makes sense to us, and there's certainly cash that comes along with growth, if that's what you're trying to confirm. Okay. That's helpful. And then just 1 clarification and 1 question. You mentioned that your ICA yield might be down a couple of basis points quarter-on-quarter. And I guess, I'm almost surprised just given the high reinvestment rates and you're getting more favorable gross spread on the Fed fund on the variable side. So can you just maybe explain that. But the broader question I have is going on to just the liquidity and [ sources ] opportunity, success [ liquidity ]. Can you talk a little bit about, maybe you started one, Dan, you sort of highlighted that you saw [ secured ] the first one, so congrats on that. What's the same size of that look like? And then just from a [ Department of Labor's ] perspective, if you're getting 60 basis points on that incremental deployment, why not ratchet that up and slow some of the lower gross profit ROA, but larger transactions in the enterprise side? Maybe I understand the puts and takes as you think about allocation. All right. Well, I'll start with part one of your simple question there. I think on the ICA yield, just the timing. So I think when you look at the decline quarter-over-quarter, the fixed-rate maturity that I think we would reinvest at from 200 basis points to 150, that comes at the very end of the quarter. So if you just look at where cash balances are at the moment. You would just have a movement of those variable ones. So I think the point I would hit is that truly that maturity, just coming at the end of the quarter. So you'll see that benefit pull through assuming it comes in at the rates that we talk through, they're in the marketplace right now. You see that come through in the third quarter.
I think on the L&S economics, maybe I'll just give a comment there and then turn it over to Dan. I think it's -- it's not necessarily about pure decisions on capital allocation where to put it. I think it's about these advisers in finding a succession offering that works for them and doing it in a way that is very thoughtful and helpful in them on our platform and really hits the marks of the really strategic benefits of the transaction itself. And I think that's what leads to our thoughts on the capacity of 30 to 40 a year, as opposed to just some financial choice. And maybe I don't know if Dan has anything you want to add to that. Yes. So Bill, you were speaking to the opportunity set. Again, it goes back to, in many cases, what we're solving for is the succession for these advisers. And I think given the size of that need has driven the proliferation of maybe innovation in that area to try to solve for it. And so if it's -- there's 300,000 advisers in the marketplace and 1/3 of them are going to retire over the next 10 years, that would be a total opportunity set.
I think, for now, [ lost ] transactions have been targeted for larger practices because we do these transactions, just it could be a complex administrative process to work through it. And so it's probably not fair to say then it's all 100,000 that are retiring in the next 10 years as the opportunity set.
That said, the strength around the administrative complexity to do these deals will certainly get easier as everyone in the marketplace learns iterates involves on how to do that. And that constraint then will allow that capacity to go up. And as firms learn how to work these folks and do it in a highly successful way, then again, I think that constraint will go up and you'll see increased number and sizes of these over time. And so that's how we think at least about how we think about the opportunity set and make sure that we have a compelling value proposition to support these folks who transition over. And once we serve them in the context and the capacity that they are being served in is, I think, as an employee of LPL and thus as part of a transition of the succession plan over the 5-year period of time, we're delivering value and capabilities that we've built in a lot of our affiliation models that enable us to do that really efficient and effective way.
And so we can scale that where we couldn't have if we didn't have the 3 or 4 years of experience in building those capabilities. And so I think it's just that front-end administrative operational work for doing these deals, and those again, we get more efficient on the scale up. We do think, again, it's compelling opportunity that is some relevant for folks that are in traditional employee-based models. It's relevant for anyone that has their own independent business, just trying to explore how to transition business and create a success outcome that's good for them. So it is a relevant business across the -- sorry, a relevant opportunity across the industry, and again, I think we'll continue to innovate all and get better and better at it. I suspect we'll have competition out in the marketplace because it's a big problem to solve. But we think we've got a good head start and good infrastructure, which to leverage and scale. And one moment as we move on to our next question. And our last question is going to come from the line of Benjamin Budish with Barclays. I wanted to first maybe, 1 more follow-up on cash levels, but maybe asking about the April update more holistically. So on cash, it sort of sounds like your comment about the variable piece moving with given the timing of adviser payments and taxes, perhaps cash continues to decline in April, but you also sound quite optimistic on the recruiting pipeline. Any color you can give in terms of what you're seeing there in terms of net new assets in April, end of the month is almost at an end. Yes, you bet. I mean, I think we've got 1 more day of data to [ see on that ]. But the headline I'd give you on April, it's shaping up, a bit better than you would expect, especially given the seasonality that you hinted at in your question of what you see in April.
So starting first on client cash balances. The 2 seasonal factors that do hit April are first, to your point, taxes, right, taxes get paid in April. That for us typically reduces cash by about $1.5 billion. And then the second factor is advisory fees. Those primarily come out in the first month of the quarter, April, obviously, being the first month of Q2. That reduces cash by about [ $1.25 ] billion. So those 2 seasonal factors together, all equal would drive a decline of nearly $3 billion in cash sweep for the month.
But to the point on stability outside factors, we actually have seen cash balances grow by over $1 billion. So you net it all out, and cash balances for the month of April are down just $1.5 billion where we sit right now. And then to your point on organic growth. We're continuing to see the strength that we've talked about in Q1. Those same dynamics, taxes and advisory fees do hit NNA in the month of April. That would -- would reduce NNA by about $3 billion or about 3%. But outside of that, when you factor in the recruiting levels that we've had that have -- that ramp that's come into April as well as we continue to see from a strength in the month of April. We're seeing organic growth in the 5% to 6% zone which as a reminder, April is typically the slowest month of the year from a growth standpoint. So at 5% to 6% for that month, I think it's a solid start to the quarter. Great. And then my follow-up. Just in terms of promotional expenses, I guess 2 questions. One, can you unpack a little bit the prudential related expenses? I guess, how much was in Q1? And then for the step-up you indicated in Q2, how much are you expecting that's [ Pru ] specific versus the increase in the [ Q1 ].
And then at a high level, can you kind of just walk us through what happens over the next, like, year, say, with Prudential and Atria, Prudential, I understand there are promo expenses coming off for Atria, Presumably, there's separate M&A spend, but TA, we should be ramping up. So how are you thinking about the growth in that line over the let say, 4 quarters? Yes. You bet. Matt, I think when you look at specific to Q1 and Pru, we had about $17 million of promo-related expense related to Pru in Q1. We'd actually expected in a low $20 million range. It's a little bit why promotional came in a little bit better than we had guided and the reason why next quarter is up by about $10 million. It's really a shifting of the timing of spend related to Pru.
I think when you look at the overall year or 2, your question on what's going to drive promotional and I'll get to the Pru specific pieces of that. But I think there's really 3 factors when you look at the full year. And the first in Q1 is organic growth, right? Pru specifically from recruiting that we talked a little bit about earlier in the call, primarily the level and amount of recruited AUM that comes on to the platform with Q1 had a record prior to large financial institutions. The good momentum we have going into Q2, I think we feel like that will be a key driver of promotional expense going up this year for a very good reason that it's the recruited assets coming on the platform, with TA rates really stable.
The other item is our conference, right? So that is really in line with the size and the table of the firm. Our conferences are where we get together. We connect with our advisers. They're really importantly valuable, and we would scale that with the size of the firm.
And then lastly, to deploy in your question on Prudential, Atria really wouldn't impact Prudential this year. But Prudential, and just as a reminder, for that deal overall, we estimate $325 million of spend to bring them on. $200 million of that is in technology spend that Dan gave a little bit of color on earlier. And then the other $125 million is really onboarding integration costs. That's what shows up in promotional. We've incurred a little over $40 million so far through the first quarter. So the remaining $80 million to $85 million that will primarily come through in the remainder of this year. So those are the drivers. And hopefully, that gives you a little bit of a double click on Prudential itself. Thank you. And I would now like to hand the conference back to Dan Arnold for any closing remarks. Yes. I just want to thank everyone for making the time to join us this afternoon, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Arnold. Thank you, operator, and thanks to everyone for joining our call today. To set the stage for tonight's call, I'll start by taking us through our quarterly business results and hand it over to Matt to cover the financials. Then before we open the call up for Q&A, I'll take a few minutes to share our perspective on recent events in the marketplace related to [indiscernible].
Okay. With that as context, over the past quarter, our advisers continue to provide their clients with personalized financial guidance on the journey to help them achieve their life goals and dreams. To help support that important work. We remain focused on our mission, taking care of our advisers so they can take care of their clients. During the second quarter, we continued to see the appeal of our model grow due to the combination of our robust and feature-rich platform, stability and scale of our industry-leading model and our capacity and commitment to invest back into the platform. As a result, we continue to make solid progress in helping advisers and institutions solve challenges and capitalize on opportunities better than anyone else and thereby serve as the most appealing player in the industry.
Now with respect to our performance, we delivered another quarter of solid results while also continuing to make progress on the execution of our strategic plan. I'll review both of these areas, starting with our second quarter business results. In the quarter, total assets increased to $1.5 trillion as continued solid organic growth was complemented by higher equity markets. Regarding organic growth, second quarter organic net new assets were $29 billion, representing 8% annualized growth. This contributed to organic net new assets over the past 12 months of $104 billion, also representing an 8% growth rate.
In the second quarter, recruited assets were $24 billion, bringing our total for the trailing 12 months to a record $93 billion. These results reflect the continuing appeal of our model as well as the strength of our recruiting across our expanded addressable market.
Looking at the same-store sales, our advisers remain focused on taking care of their clients and delivering a differentiated experience. As a result, our advisers are both winning new clients and expanding wallet share with existing clients, the combination that drove solid same-store sales in Q2. At the same time, we continue to enhance the adviser experience through the delivery of new capabilities and technology and the evolution of our service and operations function. As a result, asset retention for the second quarter was approximately 98% and 98% over the last 12 months.
Our second quarter business results led to solid financial outcomes with adjusted EPS of $3.88. Let's now turn to the progress we made on our strategic deployment. Now as a reminder, our long-term vision is to become a leader across the adviser-centered marketplace. To do that, strategy is to invest back into platform to provide unprecedented flexibility in how advisers can affiliate with us and to deliver capabilities and services to help maximize adviser's success, throughout the life cycle of their businesses. Doing this well gives us a sustainable path to industry leadership across the adviser experience, organic growth and market share.
Now to execute on our strategy, we organize our work into 2 strategic categories: horizontal expansion, where we look to expand the ways that advisers and institutions can affiliate with us such that we are positioned to compete for all 300,000 advisers in the marketplace; and vertical integration, where we focus on delivering capabilities, technology and services, to help our advisers differentiate and win in the marketplace, be great operators of the business.
And with that as context, let's start with our efforts around horizontal expansion. Over the second quarter, we saw strong recruiting in our traditional independent market, reaching a new quarterly high of approximately $19 billion in assets. At the same time, through to the ongoing appeal of our model and the evolution of our go-to-market approach, we maintained our industry-leading win rates while also expanding the breadth and depth of our pipeline.
With respect to our new affiliation models, strategic wealth employee and our enhanced RIA offering, we delivered another solid quarter, recruiting roughly $4 billion in assets. And as we look ahead, we expect that the increasing awareness of these models in the marketplace and the ongoing enhancements to our capabilities will drive a sustained increase in their [ book ].
Next, in Q2, we added approximately $1 billion of recruited assets in the traditional bank and credit union space, which continues to be a consistent contributor to organic growth. During the quarter, we also continued to make progress within the large institution market where we advanced our preparation to onboard the retail wealth management businesses of Prudential Financial and Wintrust. Collectively, these 2 deals will add approximately $66 billion of brokerage and advisory assets by early 2025.
Now as a complement to our organic growth, we are on track to close the acquisition of Atria Wealth Solutions later this year to complete the conversion in mid-2025. As a reminder, this acquisition will add approximately 2,400 advisers and 150 banks and credit unions, managing approximately $100 billion in client assets. In addition, we're seeing solid momentum within our liquidity and succession solution as demand continues to build with existing LPL advisers and with advisers outside of our ecosystem, including the signing of another external deal in Q2.
Next, I want to update you on our OSJ ecosystem. A reminder that for many years, we have collaborated with large OSJ in serving and supporting independent advisers on our platform. We've been actively working to strengthen our alignment with these firms for a number of years, driving incremental changes to the broader OSJ ecosystem over that period. This year, we put a capstone on those efforts. And through that work, there were a couple of isolated firms that surfaced, as strategically misaligned with our mission and model as they were limiting adviser's ability to choose how and where they do business. That posture is in stark contrast to our core principles of adviser independence. And as a result, we have resolved to separating these relationships.
Collectively, these firms have roughly $20 billion of client assets, which began to offboard from our platform in July. At the end of the day, these separations will strengthen our overall ecosystem and position us to better serve the great part on our platform. Now within our vertical integration efforts, we remain focused on investing back into the model to deliver a comprehensive platform capabilities, services and technology to help our advisers differentiate and win in the marketplace and run thriving business.
As part of this effort, we continue to make progress across several key areas of focus, including our ongoing journey to build a world-class wealth management platform. And within this body of work, we are developing a comprehensive suite of trading capabilities that will help advisers deliver a differentiated client experience and manage their advisory business more efficiently and effectively.
In that spirit, we're rolling out a new trading system, ClientWorks Rebalancer, which enables advisers to rebalance models across multiple client accounts at one time and deliver a more personalized client experience across the book of business. In doing so, our aspiration is to help more advisers run models-based practices and ultimately turn trading from the administrative function into a strategic asset.
The initial feedback from ClientWorks Rebalancer has been positive. We're seeing solid early adoption. In summary, in the second quarter, we continued to invest in the value proposition for advisers and their clients while driving growth and increasing our market leadership. As we look ahead, we remain focused on executing our strategy to help our advisers further differentiate and win in the marketplace and as a result, drive long-term shareholder value.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt. All right. Thank you, Dan, and I'm glad to speak with everyone on today's call. In the second quarter, we remain focused on serving our advisers, growing our business and delivering shareholder value. This focus led to another quarter of strong organic growth in both our traditional and new markets. And we are preparing to onboard the wealth management businesses of Prudential and Wintrust. In addition, we continue to build momentum in our liquidity and succession solution, closing 6 deals during the quarter and signing 1 deal with an external practice.
Lastly, we remain on track to close on the Atria transaction in the second half of the year and plan to onboard their business in mid-2025. So as we look ahead, we remain excited by the opportunities we have to serve and support our 23,000 advisers while continuing to deliver an industry-leading value proposition and drive organic growth.
Now let's turn to our second quarter business results. Total advisory and brokerage assets were $1.5 trillion, up 4% from Q1 as continued organic growth was complemented by higher equity markets.  Total organic net new assets were $29 billion or approximately an 8% annualized growth rate. Our Q2 recruited assets were $24 billion, which prior to large institutions, was the highest quarter on record. Looking ahead to Q3, our momentum continues, and we are on pace to deliver another strong quarter of recruiting.
As for our Q2 financial results, the combination of organic growth and expense discipline led to adjusted EPS of $3.88. Gross profit was $1.079 billion, up $13 million sequentially. As for the components, commission advisory fees net of payout were $263 million, up $3 million from Q1. Our payout rate was 87.3%, up 70 basis points from Q1 due to typical seasonality. Looking ahead to Q3, we anticipate our payout rate will increase to approximately 87.5%, driven by the typical seasonal build in the production.
With respect to client cash revenue, it was $361 million, down $12 million from Q1, as average client cash balances declined slightly during the quarter. Overall client cash balances ended the quarter at $44 billion, down $2 billion sequentially, driven by a record client net buying activity of $39 billion.
Within our ICA portfolio, the mix of fixed rate balances increased slightly to roughly 70%, within our target range of 50% to 75%. As a reminder, during Q2, there were roughly $2.1 billion of fixed rate contracts that matured. We placed $1.7 billion of those maturing balances into new 3- to 6-year contracts, yielding approximately 420 basis points, which is roughly 220 basis points higher than their prior yield.
Looking more closely at our ICA yield, it was 318 basis points in Q2, down 5 basis points from Q1. As for Q3, based on where client cash balances and interest rates are today as well as the yields on our new fixed rate contracts, we expect our ICA yield to increase by approximately 10 basis points.
As for service and fee revenue, it was $135 million in Q2, up $3 million from Q1. Looking ahead to Q3, we expect service fee revenue to increase by approximately $10 million sequentially, driven by revenues from our annual Focus conference as well as higher IRA fees. Also, depending on the timing of the previously mentioned separation from a couple of large OSJs, we could record up to an additional $5 million of fees.
Moving on to Q2 transaction revenue. It was $59 million, up $2 million sequentially due to increased trading volumes. As we look ahead to Q3, we expect transaction revenue to be relatively flat with Q2.
Now let's turn to expenses starting with core G&A. It was $371 million in Q2. Looking ahead, if our strong levels of organic growth continue into the second half of this year, we would expect to be in the upper half of our 2024 core G&A guidance range. As a reminder, this is prior to expenses associated with Prudential and Atria. To give you a sense of the near-term timing of the spend, in Q3, we expect core G&A to increase by $5 million to $10 million sequentially.
Moving on to Q2 promotional expense. It was $148 million, up $16 million from Q1, primarily driven by Prudential-related onboarding costs as well as increased transition assists resulting from our strong recruiting. Looking ahead to Q3, we expect promotional expense to increase to approximately $170 million to $180 million, primarily driven by conference spend as we will host our annual Focus conference next month as well as continued Prudential-related onboarding and integration costs.
Turning to depreciation and amortization. It was $71 million in Q2, up $4 million sequentially. Looking ahead to Q3, we expect depreciation and amortization to increase by roughly $8 million sequentially, which includes approximately $3 million of technology development related to Prudential.
Regarding capital management. We ended Q2 with corporate cash of $684 million, up $373 million from Q1. Our leverage ratio increased slightly to 1.7x, within our target leverage range of 1.5 to 2.5x. I would note that during the quarter, we issued $1 billion of senior notes, the proceeds of which will be used to finance our acquisition of Atria. As for capital deployment, our framework remains focused on allocating capital aligned with the returns we generate. Investing in organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A where appropriate and returning excess capital to shareholders.
In Q2, the majority of our capital deployment was focused on supporting organic growth as well as M&A, where we allocated capital to our liquidity and succession solution and closed on the acquisition of Crown Capital. Specific to share repurchases, a reminder that we paused buybacks following the announcement of the Atria acquisition. Our plan remains to evaluate restarting share repurchases following close, which we expect to occur in the second half of this year.
In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results. As we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue investing to serve our advisers, grow our business and create long-term shareholder value.
Before we open the call up for questions, I'd like to turn it back over to Dan. Thanks, Matt. I'd be remiss not to acknowledge recent developments in the marketplace related to cash revenue and speculation on the potential read-throughs to our business. We've been evaluating the announced changes to better understand the emphasis, magnitude and competitive implications. As for the firms that have made changes, they have different business models and monetization plans, so we can only speculate as to the issues they may be addressed.
As it relates to LPL, we continuously strive to ensure advisers have choice and the tools and products they use to serve their clients in a comprehensive look and feel good about our position, both competitively and regulatory. To that end, and specific to line cash, our broad-based range from solutions for operational balances to cash-like alternatives when seeking yield or solutions like our sweep deposit program, which offers expanded FDIC insurance and immediate liquidity to the transaction with [indiscernible], to positional money market funds, those seeking higher yields in a liquid product to CDs and fixed income funds to achieve interest rate exposure and various maturities.
In all, we feel good about the strong complement of cash solutions we provide. In that spirit, we do not have plans to change our pricing and believe our product set provides adviser solutions they need to successfully serve [indiscernible]. As always, we will remain agile and nimble as we continuously evaluate our solution set and control framework for opportunities to enhance our.
With that, operator, please open the call to questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. So Dan, just appreciated the remarks around some of the sweep cash developments across the industry. Clearly, you have no plans to adjust sweep pricing on the platform at this time. Just looking out over the next few years, do you anticipate any wholesale changes to sweep deposit pricing and how sweep cash is monetized across the industry more broadly? Yes. Thanks for the question. And look, maybe just a little context of our jumping off point and then I love the sort of future question. At the highest level, we have evaluated all of our pricing in the context of our overall strategic pricing framework and value proposition, which we review regularly. So within that framework, we consider a host of factors, including industry benchmarking to ensure that we competitively position ourselves in the market. So specific to the pricing of our cash sweep program or our ICA, we take a dynamic and thoughtful approach, including household AUM-based tiers that range anywhere from 35 to 220 basis points. And that typically puts us in the top half of the marketplace and that's where we are today.
And of course, as you look out over the next year and you look at the dot plots, you expect rates to change over that period of time. It certainly will influence some of that pricing. But that's kind of where we are from a jumping off point and how we've approached it up at this point. I think as we look into the future, we obviously don't know what exactly the pricing might look like. But I do believe it challenges all of us to evolve and transform and maybe even disrupt our fair value proposition, including pricing, all in the spirit of helping our advisers better serve and support their clients. And that's what we've been trying to do over the last 5 years that we shared with you all that journey of investing back into the adviser's value proposition by lowering prices in areas that matter most to the advisers and their clients.
In exchange, we're obviously then enhancing the value that we provide them. Now with respect to cash sweep pricing, is just one 1 element of the various discrete pricing mechanisms we consider and not one of great priority to the advisers. That said, as we think about the future, we'll continue to focus on pricing through a highly strategic win, evaluating all fees and charges at the aggregate of our value proposition and in context of the overall priorities and needs of the advisers and their clients.
And to the extent that we're compelled to make a change with respect to this cash sweep program, I think because of our scale, because of our vertically integrated solution, because of the number of different affiliation programs that we have, we have great flexibility in how we think about our options and alternatives from a pricing standpoint and believe that across the aggregate of our different pricing options and alternatives, that we can make most any adjustment do it in a very competitive way and most likely turn it into a strategic opportunity.
So I hope that helps in color. We don't know exactly what that looks like, but that's the discipline and the framework and the approach that we take with respect to our pricing model. No, it's very helpful color, Dan, in framing your philosophy around that. Maybe just sticking to the same topic but just looking at it from a growth strategy lens. You had another strong quarter of M&A, continue to be active on the liquidity and succession front. Just given some of the unknowns around the developments relating to sweep cash, whether it's competitive or regulatory, just want to get a sense of whether that would alter your approach to underwriting deals. And do you anticipate any changes to TA for you and industry peers in light of some of these developments? Yes. Let me let Matt start with that, and then I'll follow with any color. Yes. Steven. I think when you look at TA, just first and foremost, a reminder of what's most important for advisers when they're determining and deciding to change firms, right? Their top priorities are really the capabilities, technology service, that's Tier 1 for them. And then second is ongoing economics. And third is TA to really just facilitate, as the name would say, assist in the transition from one firm to another. I think our approach of underwriting to returns, which we've been doing for quite some time at 3 to 4x EBITDA as a general rule, wouldn't change. And I think when you look across our revenue model, to the extent things move up and down within that, we've always reflected that. We've underwritten this way across a range of interest rate environment.
So I don't think that would change. We don't expect that to change. I'm just reiterating that there are other things that are much, much more important. And perhaps emphasizing Dan's point, I'll turn it back over to him that we don't -- we feel good where we are positioned from a value proposition to specifically for cash sweep, unless you want to. Yes. I just might add that I reinforce it's the availability of the product set to give the advisers the necessary flexibility they need to meet their clients' needs. If I'm looking for yield or I'm looking for income, we make it very easily and accessible for them to access those solutions necessary to meet the needs of their clients. We're looking to simplify our client's life and make it very easy to pay for fees or get quick access to some liquidity or to store some cash in between trades, et cetera, then we have sweep vehicle that is intended to do that. And I think that's the key to the advisers that you give them the necessary flexibility so they can deliver a great experience to the client and have the solutions necessary to help them achieve their life goals and dreams, and we think that our portfolio does a good job of doing that. And our next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan from Citizens JMP. I guess first question, I want to ask on the centrally managed accounts specifically because we've received some questions on that as well. And so it would be great just to get the percentage range of cash in these accounts. And then if you can just talk about kind of the fiduciary obligation, either at the adviser level or at the firm level, when appropriate, on advisory cash and centrally managed accounts and maybe how that's different from just fee-based more broadly, if at all? Yes, Devin, I'll start there. I mean I think when you look at Centrally managed, we've got around $127 billion of assets in there. It's about 8% of total assets. From a cash standpoint, just similar to our business overall, the cash levels from a transactional cash standpoint are at low levels. Think about it as about 3% of AUM like our business overall. And in those models, right, if there's a portfolio allocation to cash beyond that, that goes into what Dan was just talking about those invest in cash options. So it would go into things like money market funds, treasury, short-term bonds and things like that.
So I think when we look at the cash allocations within centrally managed, I'd just reiterate our overall perspective that Dan articulated, I think, quite well, applies just the same to centrally managed, and we feel good about how that is set up, how that is priced and the value prop both on transactional cash, but as well as those invest in cash products that are really available for advisers to make sure that they can serve and support their clients as needed. I just would add that our allocation to cash within our centrally managed programs are consistent and the same across all models, whether they're contributed to by LPL research for external third-party management. So there's a consistent and common structure. Okay. Terrific color. And then just as a follow-up, can you remind us on what the OSJ economics generally look like on an EBIT ROA basis relative to the firm-wide average? I believe they're lower, but would love to just get a little color there. And then we know this topic has been in the headline a bit, not too surprising. But do you anticipate other OSJs to potentially exit intermediate term? It sounded like this was maybe part of the mutual process. But just wanted to get a little bit more color on expectations there. Yes, Devin. I'll start on the returns. You're right. I think when you look at our overall gross profit ROA for the firm, it's in the low 30s. For the firms that we're talking about, this $20 billion, it's around 2/3 of that, so I think, in the low 20s. So the returns are lower. And then from an organic growth standpoint, these folks weren't growing. They were actually a drag or a reduction on organic growth. So I think lower returning, lower growing would be the headline on those firms. Maybe on Dan, I'll turn it back to you on the OSJs overall. Yes, Devin. And as we look forward or strategically, I think now that we've strengthened and done a good job of aligning with these large OSJs, I think we're more convicted than ever that we can collectively pull through the synergies of our relationships and serve and support advisers really well, which ultimately will contribute to the overall growth of the business. I think we feel great about where we landed and it's work that it needed to be done, and it was done over an extended period of time dating back to 2018.
So I think in working through it, there are some key things that we focused on and solve for, one was making sure that we're well aligned on the value to be delivered by both parties, us and them refining the policies on how to operate within our ecosystem and then the legal agreements that help memorialize all of that. And I think that's the right structure that gives us the foundation to go forward and work with these folks is a real contributor to growth, and I hope that helps. And our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. So sticking with the topic, I guess, of the starting season, I appreciate that you might not have the perfect visibility and what sort of happened with some of your larger competitors and the details and rationale obviously seem to be pretty murky there. But can you discuss how LPL's advisory offering might differ from what's transpired to the larger banks? And I guess what gives you confidence that you will remain insulated from any regulatory action that may result in either higher client credit and rates or incremental shift to money market funds or kind of other high-yielding options? So is it a function of disclosure or is it a function of account size? Anything else that you could provide supporting your view and thinking there would be great. Yes. Alex, let me start with just maybe how we think about the programs being different. And then I'll answer your bigger question around how do we think about our positioning from a regulatory standpoint going forward. So I think, look, as a starting point relative to the differences in the programs, we don't have an affiliated bank proprietary mutual fund complex. So we don't have that same structure or potential conflicts of interest, and we certainly have a different monetization program because of that with our cash sweep solution.
As you know, they would tend to monetize that business, both on the cash sweep as well as potentially through the banks. And then the foundational structure around why we don't have proprietary products and the potential elimination of conflicts associated with essentially also earning asset management fees. So those are, I think, foundational or big sort of foundational difference, if you will, in our models.
Second, those companies sweep programs potentially don't have or only sort of single sleeve through their banks, right? And where we have a program that contracts with ultimately third-party banks, and so we can actually create added benefit with our program through that by having 10x the amount of FDIC insurance limits, $2.5 million for an individual, $5 million for a joint account is another place where I think there's a fundamental difference in our programs in our platforms from a value standpoint.
Additionally, as part of our cash program offerings, we make all of the positional money market funds available to our advisers with a really low entry point of $10,000 and which is less typical in a lot of those, I think, firms that have contemplated moves. And for purchases in an advisory account, there's no ticket charge associated with these movements in and out of the money funds. And so we've tried to make it really easy and accessible to access a money market fund or any other of the alternative cash-light solutions so that these advisers can make sure they're easily meeting the needs of their clients and performing their duty of care,  if you will.
So that's just some of the high-level places we're different. It's not meant to be exhausted. It's not meant to be comprehensive, but it gives you a little color.
Maybe to your second part of your question, and as I said in the prepared remarks, we feel good about our positioning from a regulatory standpoint. Now why do we think that maybe a little color around that? If you take -- create a framework around the regulatory guidelines, these typically will focus on duty of care obligations, operating control environment and disclosure requirements. And as such, we regularly review all of these elements to ensure that we're operating within the prescribed requirements and guidelines.
So with respect to duty of care, we regularly review our sweep program and cash investment products to ensure we're meeting both our conduct standards and the needs of our advisers and their clients and that we provide the flexibility and low barriers to entry in our solutions for investing cash to help our advisers serve and support their clients, and that's what I was just referring to earlier. And that is done consistent with their obligations as advisers. And then we don't provide incentives for advisers to direct allocations to cash sweep programs, another important point, I think, with respect to duty of care.
Now with respect to controls, there's any number of controls that we might have, but the one specifically in this area is we actively monitor the levels of cash position with an advisory accounts, making sure that advisers are actively managing those accounts, and there's not idle cash sitting in there that is not optimized, aligned with the clients' goals and objectives for that overall portfolio.
And then with respect to controls -- I mean, sorry, and then with respect to disclosures, we provide clear and transparent disclosures describing the features in terms of our programs, including the fees we earn relative to the yield clients receive. So to that end, that's why we feel that our cash offering controls, monetization, framework, meet the needs and the expectations for all of the [indiscernible]. I know that was a lot, but I'll pause there. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Maybe just continue with the same theme, understanding that you don't have plans to change your sweep pricing. But maybe just to clarify, I was just hoping you might be able to unpack like what might lead you to change it at some point? What might be those different scenarios? And to what extent have you heard from regulators on your sweep rates or disclosure practices and such? Yes. I think, Michael, with respect to the second part of your question, as an ongoing matter around our ongoing reviews with regulators, this is always a part of their review, and we've had that consistent and constant discussion with them along the way, part of the reason we feel very confident in our regulatory positioning today. I think with respect to the first part of your question, first and foremost, when we look at pricing, it's through the strategic lens, and we're always looking to make sure that we do two things: how do we make sure that we are differentiating in the marketplace with our overall sort of holistic value proposition; and then two, is that well aligned with our advisers' needs and their clients' needs. And those are the two biggest drivers that we think about relative to how we might invest, innovate or evolve our pricing strategies.
In the past 5 years, we've very much focused on advisory and transaction charges because that's sort of where the trend in the business was going, and that's where our advisers really challenged us to focus on. And so that's what drove that activity. And that's a great example of those two being the real catalyst for how we think about that. I think with respect to any other drivers, I mean, we should always be challenging ourselves to think outside the box. What can we learn from other places, other industries around how they create value, how they price, how they may create new value that extends new revenue streams that then could offset pricing somewhere else. So I think those are all part of how we challenge ourselves from an innovation standpoint to evolve this business model to ultimately enhance the value to the end client and to the adviser. And if we do that really well going forward, we'll create a lot of shareholder value through that.
So the good news is because we're vertically integrated, we have a clearing solution. We're broker-dealer. We're an RIA. We've created lots of services that are down inside the adviser's ecosystem. With that vertical integration, we've got lots of different levers of revenue, of which we could think about hey, where do we innovate to create new levels of revenue if we wanted to modify or change 1 level of revenue, we can look at that as an investment back into the business. What we can look at it as a -- that's a bigger priority for advisers. So we'll offset that with a fee somewhere else.
So I think that's the sort of the flexibility and the approach that we take in terms of scenario planning and trying to think about how we evolve this pricing, again, and best in line with serving the advisers and the client. I hope that helps. There's nothing specific, but at least gives you the sense of how we think about it. Great. And just a follow-up question, if I could here. Just as you look at the actions of others across the industry and based on conversations you're having with folks across the industry, including regulators, do you have any sense whether or not the goalpost is moving beyond practices that have been accepted over the years that are disclosure based? That is not our sense. I think there's a pretty tidy and clear regulatory framework, of which that we all understand how to operate in. That regulatory framework governs the entire aggregate value proposition and relationships that we have with clients. And again, I think anywhere where there may be a potential conflict within that overall aggregate business model, there's a requirement to disclose and to be clear to set that expectation for the clients so that they can make an informed choice. And that's a very logical and very principled way to approach it. And we think when we begin to change principles, it's much, much harder to change that. And so we don't necessarily see that on the landscape. I will tell you we're not clairvoyants, so we don't have all the answers, but we're not seeing signs that, that would ultimately change going forward. It's a great question. And our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt from KBW. Maybe I'll start on the same topic that everyone else has, but just a follow-up on the advisory cash discussion. You mentioned that 3% of the centrally managed program is in sweep. I guess can you provide any color on cash as a percentage of client assets for total advisory accounts in the corporate RIA, so on the $568 billion of assets or so? I think you -- in the past, you've mentioned that typically, there's higher cash allocations in those accounts versus brokerage, but I'm not sure if that's still true today. Yes. I think when you look at cash as a percent of AUM overall, it's around 3%. The Century manages a little bit above that. And I think when you look at the rest of advisory, it's still in the same ballpark, but it's a little bit above centrally managed. I think on brokerage, that cash is around 2.5%, that's because brokerage has a lot of business and accounts that just simply have no cash at all, like annuities and direct business on the mutual fund side. So you end up brokerage overall ends up having a smaller balance or a smaller percentage. But headline point is on the outside of centrally managed on the advisory side, it's in the same ballpark, just a little bit higher. That's helpful. And then, Matt, just wondering also if you could give an update on July to date sweep cash balances. And related to the OSJs that are off-boarding towards the end of this month or starting this month, any color on if they have a similar cash as a percentage of client assets as well, which I think would imply maybe $600 million or so of an impact that we should expect to show up in the monthly figures this quarter? Yes, I think so. So on how things are trending so far in July, I mean, the headline I would give you is it's shaping up to be the month. And especially when you factor in the seasonality that I think you're well familiar with on month 1 of a quarter, but I'll walk through that. I think specific to client cash, so a reminder that seasonality is advisory fees primarily hit in the first month of the quarter. So that will reduce cash in July by around $1.4 billion, all else being equal. And flows outside of that have been an inflow of around $700 million. So when you put those two things together, what we've seen in from a cash sweep standpoint in July is a decline of around $700 million or putting it at around $43.3 billion.
To add to that on the organic growth side, those advisory fees impact organic growth just the same, hitting that first month at $1.4 billion. And outside of that, the momentum we've seen in the first half of this year and as we saw in this quarter, has really continued. So I think that puts us from an organic growth standpoint in July, looking at something in that 6% to 6.5% zone, keeping in mind that it's usually the lowest month of the quarter.
Now those numbers are -- to your point on the OSJs, those numbers are prior to any impact of those OSJs leaving. We'll make sure as we report results to clearly delineate the impact that those have had, meaning how much of that $20 billion is flowed out. We'll just make that clear going forward. Very little has flowed out so far. And to your point on cash, I don't think there's anything distinct different from an amount of cash standpoint from those two firms. But again, we'll make it clear in the metrics as probably over the next 3 or 4 months is when it will flow out. We'll make it clear so you can see that versus the rest of the business. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Cho from JPMorgan. I'm going to skip the regulatory cash discussion. I just wanted to follow up on the OSJ. Matt, you talk through kind of the timing and that you'll delineate kind of going forward. I was just curious what -- and this is not necessarily new, but what kind of areas were particularly misaligned as you characterized? And going forward, Dan, you touched on it a little bit, how would you frame the potential for other OSJs maybe falling into similar buckets over time? Yes. So going forward, to answer your second part of your question, because of the alignment and the structure we put around the program, there's very little probability that, that would occur. I think back to your first part of your question, we see in some cases where an OSJ may buy up their advisers practices, turn them into more of an employee-based construct. And ultimately, because of that approach, it's more of a captive type of model at that point, which again is very different from the principles of independence and providing the flexibility for those advisers to move those assets where they want to or bill where they want to. And I think that's our point. As soon as they began to lose the principles of independence within the model, we have a hard time with that sitting within our platform and within our [indiscernible]. So that's an example of something that I think we were just trying to make sure we had alignment on and tease out such that as we go forward, that foundational principle is in place across our collective ecosystem. Hope that helps. Great. And then just to switch gears a little bit, just on the annuity side, annuities can remain solid. Clearly, the rate environment has helped and continues to help. I'm wondering what you're seeing at the incremental level that the strong demand in recent quarters or years could be nearing any sort of normalization point yet, just given strong growth that annuities has been seeing on LPL's platform. Sorry, what was the second half of that? You just broke up a little bit. Yes. No, on the -- any sort of normalization that you might see on the strong demand? Sorry, got it. Okay. Thank you. Yes. So look, I think that if you look at the marketplace and the growth, call it over the last year or 2, is very much a couple of things happening. The foundation of an annuity as it supports and help someone with the retirement planning is clearly a relevant problem to be solving for many folks as they think about one of those all important life goals. And so it's a relevant solution across a broad opportunity set. And with the rate environment becoming very, very different than the one we lived in for an extended period of time, it has created an opportunity, obviously, to help clients solve for creating that revenue stream or income stream in retirement and certainly whether it be a fixed or variable annuities are well positioned to do that.
As with a steepening yield curve may occur as we go forward, that also is helpful with respect to variable annuities in terms of the features and benefits that they provide. And so that is obviously something that if you've got more appealing features and benefits relative to the macro, then obviously, that's something that can differentiate annuities relative to other options and alternatives.
From a seasonality standpoint, I look at it, it's probably more of a product choice in solving a really important need for a broad set of an adviser's clients than necessarily a found opportunity, if you will, to create new asset gathering opportunity because the features are more sound. I think it's ultimately more of how do you ultimately pick which solution you're going to use to best serve and support the client.
So I don't think it necessarily create some step down or step up as much as it's just a demonstration of a heavier utilization in a product given the market conditions. That said, as we evolve and grow our number of advisers on our platform, that certainly is a tailwind to the overall volumes of brokerage solutions or in this case, annuity solutions being done. So that certainly does provide some tailwind. I hope that helps. You want to add anything to that? No. Well said. And our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon from Jefferies. So just a question on the environment for recruiting. Obviously, $24 billion, quite strong in the quarter. Can you talk to the economics of those assets today versus maybe what you were underwriting a year ago? And then ultimately, you talked about good momentum, I think, into July and the backlog. So maybe some characterizations around how that's progressing as we think about the rest of the year. You want to hit the first part? Yes. Yes, Dan. I'll start. On the economics and underwriting, kind of to my point earlier to Steven's question, I think our underwriting approach and economics haven't changed. I think we underwrite returns, TA and the economics there are really the third thing that advisers are looking at. But the return hurdles in the underwritings have not changed. If you think about it as recruiting in general, comes on board at 3 to 4x EBITDA, and that has not moved much. Yes. With respect, maybe to your second question, just again, as you -- as we said the margin as you just said as a jumping off point, you had recruited assets of $24 billion in Q2 and $93 billion over the trailing 12, which is a solid place for momentum. And we continue to see that momentum into the third quarter. I think we're seeing it across all of our affiliation models. So you've got good diversification in that opportunity set. That's being driven by this continued evolution of the appeal of our model and then that breadth of market that we serve, given the different affiliation models. So as we look in the third quarter, we certainly see momentum there. And beyond that, given those sort of structural value that we're creating inside the model, our go-to-market strategy and efficacy around how we deliver that to the marketplace, we feel are pretty good strong structural trends.
So as we look out even further and beyond third quarter, we feel good about that momentum across all of our models. At the same time, we have some built in as we've talked about institutions, large institutions that have yet to onboard that collectively represent $66 billion in sort of recruited large institutions. So that certainly is a tailwind to that outlook as well. So you got really good positioning across all models in your adviser recruiting and then on the institution side, you've got that already committed wins in the pipeline. And then beyond that, we feel good about that evolving and growing pipeline at cost of large banks as well as insurance set. I hope that helps. Yes. That is helpful. And then just a quick one, Matt, on expenses. The promo spend is a sizable pickup both sequentially as well as year-over-year. I think you said conferences, but I mean you have this conference every year. So just curious about the magnitude of the pickup. And then should we see that normalize again in the fourth quarter after, I guess, what would be seasonal pickups? Yes. I mean I think a couple of things. I think the conference from a seasonality standpoint, it is in Q3 each year. So just given a little -- I was giving color on the sequential change. The other thing I'd keep in mind is specific to the onboarding costs associated with Prudential. Just a reminder of the spend there to bring them on board, there's no TA associated with Prudential is really important to them is really the technology build and the process to get on board. So when you look at the -- what we're spending there, $125 million of integration cost and $200 million of technology, that is the entire amount that's being spent there, and a lot of that will show up in promotional.
So when you think about the trends, especially year-over-year, probably the spend-related Prudential, which will -- when you look at the overall spend, probably peak for the 2 highest quarters or likely be Q2 and Q3 related to that. I think when you get on the other side of that, meaning on the other side of our largest conference, you get into Q4 and you get on the other side of Prudential-related spend, I think then you get into the core drivers, just the level and amount of our recruiting, right? So the underwriting TA hasn't changed, then it's really just driven by the -- really the tonnage or the amount of recruiting we're doing, which I think we've covered a few times, we keep hitting new record levels.
So we think it's a good use of capital, but hopefully, that helps give you a little sense as to why that number is increasing. It's largely a timing of conference in Prudential. And our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken from UBS. I'd like to ask a question on the upcoming fixed rate maturity. So you guys are now at about 70% of the ICA and fixed rate. Are you going to continue to roll the maturities into fixed rate? Or at this point, is there some benefit to seeing the floating rate side pick up bring you closer to the middle or even lower end of the targeted range? Yes, Brennan. And I think when you look at our approach there in targeting 50% to 75%, and I think looking at what I think most folks would conclude a peak rate environment that we're in right now, I think while we always want to be within that range, I think we like being towards the, call it, the upper half of the range and where we are now, just given where the rate environment is. So I think as we move forward in the next couple of quarters, we got about $2 billion maturing each quarter based on where sweep balances are overall and where rates are overall, we'll make those choices. But I think in the near term, I think we like being in that upper half. When you look at where rates are for those fixed rate contracts, we typically will deploy in the 3- to 5-year point on the curve. And those rates, including the spreads that you can earn, which are in that 20 to 30 basis point range are around 400 right now. So that should hopefully give you a sense as to where we deploy that, which would be above the rates that they're currently earning. So I hope that helps with the headline is, we like 50% to 75%. We like being kind of towards the top half of that just given where the rate environment is. Great. Matt, that's helpful. And then second question, I noticed that the adviser loan growth was a little healthy here quarter-over-quarter, up about 12%. And I know that you closed some deals, so I expect some might be deal related, but really it would be helpful if you could maybe unpack some of the contributors to that growth here. Yes. I think from a TA standpoint, remember, there's 2 things in there. We don't necessarily break them out in the release. But there's all -- there is TA as well as repayable loans, right? So it's not all entirely TA related. For the components that are TA related, just emphasize kind of what we're talking about before, the underwriting standards have not changed. We do continue to deliver record levels of recruiting. So it's more volume, but the rates that we're paying are consistent. And just keep in mind that TA is not the entire driver of that line item. Okay. Was there some contribution from the recently closed deals though in that growth? Yes. So I think when you're talking about adviser loans, so the recently closed deals were acquisitions. So that would be -- that would come out in a different spot, and it would show up in goodwill and other places. Specific to the loans, that would just be to the extent we're doing growth-related loans or things of that nature, the primary driver is typically TA, and it would just be connected to the record recruiting in the quarter. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Dan Arnold for any further remarks. Just thanks, everyone, for taking the time to join us this afternoon. And we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Take care. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.
