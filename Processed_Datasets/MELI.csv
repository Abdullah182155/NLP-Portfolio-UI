While we believe that our assumptions, expectations, and projections are reasonable in view of the currently available information, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.
Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed on this call for a variety of reasons, including those described in the forward-looking statements and Risk Factors sections of our 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on our Investor Relations website.
Finally, I would like to remind you that during the course of this conference call, we may discuss non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures can be found on our first quarter 2018 earnings press release, available on our Investor Relations website.
Now, let me turn the call over to Pedro. Thanks, Federico. Hello, everyone and welcome to our first quarter conference call for 2018.
Let me get us started off today by laying out a three-point summary of the highlights from this quarter. First and most importantly, our key volume and operational metrics across businesses continued to deliver above-market performance, sustaining some of the fastest rates of growth we have seen in the last few years, despite having the Easter holiday season that took place in the first quarter this year versus having occurred during the second quarter last year. Hence, we continue to build our position as a preferred commerce and payments provider for Latin American consumers.
Second, our U.S. GAAP revenues as reported under new revenue recognition standards that came into effect during the quarter will show slower growth than the just mentioned underlying business volume metrics as a consequence of free shipping investments being netted out of revenues rather than as costs of net revenues from this year onwards.
And third, due to unplanned cost increases from shipping carrier partners in Brazil, our margin structure for this quarter that is already the seasonally weakest quarter of the year came in below our expectations.
Despite accounting and cost structure modifications, we remain encouraged by the sustained pace of growth in business metrics, as I'll detail in a second, and are confident that we can optimize our pricing and cost structures to return our financial model to the appropriate profit level, while continuing to solve primarily for our objective of share gains, volume growth, and scale competitiveness.
With that, let me now walk you through a detailed overview of the business metrics I've just alluded to, starting with marketplace key business trends by geography. Our Brazilian business grew units sold by 68% and GMV on an FX-neutral basis by 71% year on year, as our free shipping program, which has already reached 62% of total sales measured by volume, continues to drive the business, also complemented by incremental customer acquisition spend, as we continue to observe improvements in customer lifetime values that encourage us to invest more aggressively in customer acquisition.
It's important to highlight here that we have been able to sustain yet another quarter of historic market-leading growth rates despite increasingly tougher comps. Additionally, Brazil has delivered record buyer engagement in terms of items sold per unique buyer, accelerating for the fifth consecutive quarter.
Moving on to Argentina, where the business continues to recover both from a units sold and GMV perspective, on an FX-neutral basis, gross merchandise volume grew above 50% for the second consecutive quarter, reaching 53% growth year on year. Items sold delivered equally solid performance, growing 44% year on year, one of the highest growth rates in five quarters. This was in part aided by easier year-on-year comps, but also due to the positive impact of the launch of our free shipping and loyalty program, Mercado Puntos.
And Mexico still yielded the second highest growth rate ever from a GMV perspective. Mexican GMV grew on an FX-neutral basis at 77% year on year, while units sold also did so at an even stronger 106% year on year. This is the third consecutive quarter of triple-digit growth in units sold for that geo. We also saw record buyer engagement metrics in Mexico, even within the previously mentioned context of having lost an estimated 6 percentage points of GMV growth due to the Easter holiday that happened in March this year.
We are also encouraged to see significant acceleration in countries like Chile and Colombia, which are beginning to take shape as complementary engines of growth for the company. Chile grew units sold at its fastest pace on record, accelerating to 83% year on year, while GMV on an FX-neutral basis accelerated to 58%, boosted by the combination of our free shipping and loyalty programs and increased marketing investments. Exiting the quarter, free shipping had already reached 77% of total merchandise volume sold.
Colombia is following suit as well, delivering the fastest pace of gross merchandise volume growth in the past six years, which was on an FX-neutral basis 44.6%, also on the back of the success of free shipping and higher investments in customer acquisition. It's not a coincidence that within less than a year of launching in Colombia, our free shipping program already covers 50% of total gross merchandise volume sold. In line with that, units sold accelerated to an all-time high of 68% year on year for the first quarter of 2018.
As a result of these solid results by segment, consolidated marketplace KPIs delivered yet another quarter of great performance across the board.
During the first quarter of 2018, on a consolidated basis, units sold grew 51% to 80.1 million. Excluding Venezuela from last year's comp, now that we have deconsolidated that operation, would yield units sold growth of 66% year on year, the second highest growth rate in unit volumes over the past six years.
Gross merchandise volume surpassed the $3 billion mark, reaching $3.1 billion, growing 34% year on year in dollars, while on an FX-neutral basis GMV growth was 43% year on year. Again, if we exclude Venezuela, GMV growth was 54% in dollars and on an FX-neutral basis would have been 64% year on year.
Unique buyers on our platform grew by 28% during the quarter versus prior-year quarter, also one of the highest growth rates in unique buyers over the last multiyear cycle. Excluding Venezuela from last year's comp, unique buyers would have grown by 38% versus the prior year.
Units sold per unique buyer accelerated for the 16th consecutive quarter. This means an individual consumer is buying 50% more from us on a quarterly basis than they were just a few years back.
And finally, live listings, a measure of the depth of inventory on our platform, grew by 50% year on year during this quarter, reaching 127 million listings. That's also the fifth consecutive quarter of growth in this important KPI, above 50%.
Let me move on to payments. MercadoPago has also kicked off 2018 on a very strong note. On-platform total payment volume grew by 62% year on year on an FX-neutral basis. Strong growth and adoption of MercadoPago in our Brazilian and Mexican marketplaces, where penetration reached 100% of gross merchandise volume, as well as Argentina, where penetration continued to grow, reaching 98% of gross merchandise volume, were the most significant drivers of growth.
In line with that, Chile and Colombia are also contributing, as they are in marketplaces. On-platform MercadoPago penetration in Chile gained 35 percentage points versus last year, reaching 77% of GMV, while Colombia gained 20 percentage points to 79% of GMV now being paid for using MercadoPago.
We also continue to see growth and tremendous future potential in MercadoPago away from our marketplace. We continue to engage both consumers and merchants as we grow our scale and generate more value for our growing base of payers and receivers. Many of these businesses are key additions that generate payment use cases that are attractive to millions of existing and future Pago consumers.
Some important adds during the quarter were: one of the largest telecom operators in Latin America in Movistar; leading camera manufacturer Nikon; OfficeMax; and Groupon, just to name a few.
From a geographic standpoint, Mexico and Chile were highlights for the quarter, growing the merchant services off-marketplace total payment volume on an FX-neutral basis by 63% and 157% year on year respectively. Argentina also contributed to this growth story, as it maintained its momentum, growing merchant services total payment volume on an FX-neutral basis for the third consecutive quarter above 60% year on year.
Our offline efforts are beginning to take off as well. Through the build-out of our mobile POS network and MercadoPago wallet-enabled payment services, we are reaching more and more consumers in the offline world. Mobile POS total payment volume was an important contributor to the results of this off-marketplace segment, as we continue to witness strong acceleration in devices sold that yielded on an FX-neutral basis total payment growth in the mPOS segment of nearly 450% year on year in Brazil, while in Argentina the trend was equally encouraging, as TPV for mobile devices grew on an FX-neutral basis north of 1,000% year on year ,while sales of devices also grew above 1,000%, albeit both coming from a small base.
We also continue to execute behind our efforts to build out our mobile wallet network. During the quarter, we significantly boosted these efforts by integrating payments functionalities into the Mercado Libre app, which now enables payments capabilities for the installed base beyond just MercadoPago app users, creating an installed base that is roughly approximately 14 times larger in terms of daily active users on the Mercado Libre app than on the MercadoPago app.
One more note on our FinTech initiatives and their progress, during the first quarter we surpassed the $100 million mark in our merchant credit portfolio for the first time. Mercado Crédito is a strategic offering for our ecosystem, which will increasingly drive merchant sales growth, strengthen synergies with our marketplace, and ultimately build higher merchant loyalty and retention.
As we dive deeper into how our merchant cohorts perform, we continue to observe that those merchants who adopt our credit solutions not only see an increase in their sales volume on our platforms, but they are also continuing to take on additional working capital loans to keep funding their growth on Mercado Libre. We will continue to invest behind these innovative credit offerings in order to provide financial solutions to our small and medium-sized sellers and help them scale their business faster.
Let's now get on to financials, where as I briefly mentioned in the introduction, the changes brought about by FASB ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, applied to our shipping subsidies impact our numbers with regards to revenue recognition. I'd like to remind you that greater detail on this can be found in the accompanying presentation to these prepared remarks as well as in our 10-Q filing with the SEC.
When we began to offer free shipping services, either partially or fully subsidized by us, we determined that the amount we subsidized was a form of consideration, such as a sales incentive in the form of free shipping. This meant that we provided a consideration to the buyer, which consisted of a free service. Consequently, in the past we accounted for that cost to be characterized as an expense in the cost of net revenues as opposed to netting it out of net revenues, given that it was recognized in the third-party shippers' income statement.
Going forward, however, this interpretation will change as we adopt ASC 606. From now on, in the instances where Mercado Libre subsidizes the costs of shipping, we will account for those costs by netting them from revenues as opposed to booking them directly as a cost line item under cost of net revenues, as in the past. As a result and in accordance with ASC 606, shipping subsidies for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 amounted to $112.5 million versus $4.3 million for the same quarter a year earlier.
The year-on-year increase in these shipping subsidies came about mainly as a result of two factors. First of all, during the prior-year quarter, free shipping had only been launched in pilot phase in Mexico, whereas this year free shipping already covers 62% of GMV in Brazil, 77% in Mexico, 48% in Colombia, and 44% in Chile. This growth in coverage, maintaining all other variables constant, would have alone accounted for an incremental $102 million of subsidies for shipping costs.
The second factor is that we've incurred additional costs due to an unanticipated price increase by our main shipping carrier in Brazil, Correios, that amounted to an incremental $11 million. This price increase was made retroactive to March 6, while our price increases to pass on some of these increased costs to our buyers and merchants, and therefore partially offset the increase in price occurred later on, only in mid to late March. So if we combine the price increase and the incremental adoption of MercadoEnvíos and subsidies to free shipping, we get to a total of $112.5 million of shipping subsidies during Q1.
One final clarification on this respect, the adoption of the aforementioned new revenue recognition standards will not have a material impact on the company's consolidated balance sheets and statements of cash flows or net income.
Moving on down our financials, as now reported on a full retrospective basis, in accordance to FASB ASC 606, net revenues ascended to $321 million, a growth rate of 19% year on year in U.S. dollars and 30.1% on a FX-neutral basis. If we exclude the netting revenue effects in accordance with ASC 606 on free shipping costs, then these gross billings would have been $433.5 million, a growth rate of 58.2% year on year in dollars and 70.3% year on year on an FX-neutral basis. Please refer to an accompanying table in our 10-Q and earnings press release filed with the SEC in order to reconstruct these gross billing numbers.
On a segment basis, first quarter revenue growth was as follows: 18.9% in Brazil; 79.6% for Argentina; 39.1% for Mexico; 35.5% in Colombia; negative 3% in Chile; and 90.6% in Uruguay, all of these expressed on an FX-neutral basis. If we exclude the effects on net revenues in accordance with ASC 606 on a segment basis, monetization trends were strong in all countries.
For the first quarter of 2018, gross billings growth would have been as follows: 78.5% for Brazil; 87% for Argentina; 77% for Mexico; 61% in Colombia; 47% in Chile; and 91% in Uruguay, all of these also expressed on an FX-neutral basis.
Additionally and also as a result of the implementation of ASC 606, we have changed how the information is presented for net revenues in the products and services we offer. As of January 1 this year, net revenues from shipping services will be included as part of our enhanced marketplace services and no longer accounted for in non-marketplace products.
With that, from a product revenue stream perspective as-reported basis, enhanced marketplace revenues, which now include the shipping revenues and subsidies, decreased by 21% year on year in U.S. dollars to $141 million. This year-on-year decrease was driven by the effect of adopting ASC 606 during the quarter primarily. Non-marketplace revenues grew by 97% in dollars to $180.3 million
If we break down non-marketplace revenues, payment revenues, including all MercadoPago non-marketplace revenue streams, grew on an FX-neutral basis by 130% year on year to $145 million. Other non-marketplace revenues, including classifieds and advertising, grew 31% in dollars year on year to $35 million.
Looking at our cost structure for the quarter, the combination of a seasonally weaker margin quarter, aggressive planned-for investments in sales and marketing, and the unplanned changes in our shipping cost structure led to lower than anticipated EBIT and a quarterly loss. Gross profit ascended to $163 million, representing 51% of revenue versus 63% in the first quarter of last year. This deterioration in gross margin is primarily explained by the formulaic changes in revenue, meaning a lower revenue basis, and structurally from the following factors: added costs from the growth in our investments in delivering best-in-class customer service to our users, which resulted in 110 basis points of margin contraction; 177 basis points of year-on-year margin contraction that's attributable to investments in hosting, as we deploy away from our private cloud to public clouds that give us greater agility and flexibility in developer ops; 411 basis points of margin contraction that came about from the collection fees due to incremental adoption of payment solutions; and rapid growth in our mobile POS businesses that led to 409 basis points of gross margin compression, as the costs of selling hardware grow to support our quickly expanding merchant network in Brazil and Argentina.
Operating expenses totaled $192.2 million or 60% of revenues versus 39% of revenues during the same period last year. In addition to the same formulaic impact of a lower revenue base, the 20% margin contraction was driven primarily by the following factors: 833 basis points of incremental customer acquisition and branding investments, as we continue to invest for sustained top line growth and brand equity creation, as improved lifetime values bolster our confidence in the long-term returns behind these investments; 511 basis points of incremental spend on buyer protection, mainly as a result of late delivery credits granted to buyers as MercadoEnvíos grows adoption on our marketplace; 157 basis points of bad debt provisions, mainly from loss provisions on our average merchant and consumer credit portfolio that stand at roughly 4.66% loss ratio during the quarter; and 291 basis points in G&A increases, mainly driven by accruals on our long-term retention plan. These combined effects yielded an operating loss of $29.4 million or negative 9.2% of revenues versus 23.5% during the same period last year.
Below operating loss, we benefited from $9.2 (sic) [$9.2 million] (25:05) of interest income, down 24.4% year on year, as a result of lower interest rates in Brazil as well as lower float in Argentina. In our ForEx line, we saw a $5.6 million gain, attributed for the most part to the devaluation of the Argentine peso and the Brazilian real over U.S. dollar net asset positions, accounting for $3.1 million and $0.9 million respectively, and also a $1.7 million gain arising from the Mexican peso revaluation over the U.S. dollar net liability position in Mexico.
We had $10.7 million of financial expenses, mostly corresponding to financial interests related to working capital funding for the payments business in Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile, and also to interest accrual on our convertible bond issued in 2014. The aforementioned effects led to a net loss before taxes of $25.4 million for the first quarter of 2018.
Income tax gain was $12.4 million, mainly as a consequence of higher pre-tax losses recorded in Mexico and Brazil, partially offset by higher income tax expense in our Argentine subsidiaries during the first quarter of 2018 due to a higher pre-tax margin. All of this results in a net reported loss of $12.9 million and a basic net loss per share of $0.29.
Purchases of property, plant, and equipment, intangible assets, and advances for fixed assets totaled $23 million during the quarter. Cash, short-term investments, and long-term investments at the end of the quarter totaled $543.3 million.
Before I end the call, I'd like to state that we're as excited as we have ever been about our growing business. We will continue to drive the success of the company through building on our market position as a leading innovator throughout Latin America and leveraging our regional breadth, trusted brand, and increasing installed base of engaged users.
Going forward, executing on this business plan will continue to be our first order of priority. We will strive to maintain ourselves as a leading e-commerce and payments platform in the region while delivering a sustainable financial model that finds the right balance between earnings and investing behind innovation to deliver benefits for our users. We have the conviction that as we follow this path, we will deliver long-term shareholder value through an increasingly attractive and growing ecosystem. We're excited about the opportunity that lies ahead of us and look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the remainder of this year.
Thank you. And with that, we can now take your questions. Our first question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Yes, thanks. Pedro, can you talk about your efforts in Brazil to decrease your dependence on Correios given the price hikes, and what you're going to be tweaking on a go-forward basis in terms of either just passing on some of the incremental cost to either the seller or the buyer? I know you guys have rolled through some of those change already, but I'm interested in what the strategy is going to be on a go-forward basis for the balance of this year. Thanks. Hi, Stephen. Thank you. So as you know, part of our strategy in terms of building out our logistics network is to complement our existing drop-ship network with increased volumes out of our fulfillment centers and drop-ship centers and build out an increasingly more robust network with multiple carriers. So if there's a silver lining to the Correios price increase, it's that, to a certain extent, the increased costs on the drop-ship network probably generate an added incentive for sellers to more quickly move over to the other alternatives, and I think primarily the fulfillment option, which is one we're quite enthused about. And so I think the plan remains the same as it's always been. The increase in cost hopefully adds slight tailwinds to that migration more and more towards fulfillment and other carriers that we will be onboarding on our network.
And then in terms of how we manage the financial model, I think what's already been done is what we can state. We don't guide other than that. But what we've already done in terms of pricing in Brazil is we have passed on some of those costs on to buyers and sellers. We continue to offer significant subsidies to try to drive the lowest cost of shipping possible on our platform, but we've also passed on some of those incremental costs, as we also try to manage the financial model in a responsible and healthy way. And if I may follow up here, between I guess the many different initiatives right now like logistics, payments, et cetera, where are you focusing your engineering resources right now? So probably I would say the two areas of great focus for us in terms of company priority and therefore where engineers are being distributed are logistics and the build-out of the technology that operates our warehouses and that run the intelligence for our drop-ship network and all the other initiatives we have around logistics. And the second area which is one we continue to think has tremendous opportunity and we're seeing some very solid early-stage results from is the entire payments business. Okay, thanks. The next question comes from Franco Abelardo with Morgan Stanley. Hi, Pedro. Thanks for taking the question. First question is on the GMV growth. How much of the slowdown in local currency GMV to 54% this quarter is related to the changes in the free shipping incentives that implemented after the Correios price increase in Brazil? And considering that those adjustments were done only March this year, is it fair to assume further GMV slowdown in the second quarter? And if not, what are the initiatives that MELI can take to avoid or minimize those impacts? That's the first question.
Also related to that, we couldn't see unique sellers metrics. How much did you grow your unique sellers base this quarter? Or maybe in a more qualitative approach, have you seen some of the sellers at MELI platform migrating to other marketplace platforms that have been very aggressive in Brazil on your competitors? Those are my questions, thank you. Great. So first of all, let me just recap some of the numbers from the prepared remarks. Brazilian gross merchandise volume on an FX-neutral basis didn't decelerate. It actually sustained the same level of growth from the prior quarter, and it grew 71% year on year in Brazil. So our Brazilian business continues to perform very strongly despite the price increases towards the end of the quarter.
When we look at the supply side, which is obviously an important part of driving that continued very strong growth in merchandise volume, we disclose sellers and buyers on an annual basis, not on a quarterly basis. I think I gave a readout for live listings, which is probably a metric of depth of inventory on the platform. At the end of the day, I think consumers are interested in being able to find the products they want. Obviously, more sellers means you have a deeper inventory, but that's probably a more useful metric. Live listings in Brazil year on year grew by 52%. We continue to see very solid gains in terms of sellers.
We haven't seen any material change in seller churn, so it's not something that's concerning us at this point. If a seller is leaving Mercado Libre to go sell elsewhere and no longer sell on our platform, that's not something that is concerning us right now. And again, I think the most important part of the question is Brazil really had a very, very, very solid quarter in terms of unit and volume growth rates. Okay. So as a quick follow-up, so you don't expect impacts from the changes in shipping costs to GMV growth in Brazil, or is this something that maybe the comparison base is also getting harder in the second quarter is something that makes sense to expect volume in that directionally way? I'm not asking for guidance here. Again, we tend to not make any forward-looking statements. I don't think you've characterized what I said well. I think I said look, Brazil had a very solid quarter. We continue to see a business that's performing incredibly well. There is elasticity obviously to total cost. And when you pass costs on to consumers, that does generate some reverse elasticity. So no, it's not that it doesn't have any impact, and clearly March was weaker than previous months. But overall, I think given the magnitude of the price increase, the site continues to perform very strongly. Okay, got it. Thanks. Our next question comes from Irma Sgarz with Goldman Sachs. Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just when you look across your different geographies and specifically in Brazil, it looks like a significant amount of your growth. I guess less so in this quarter, but generally the growth has been coming across the different geographies from lower-ticket items, and the unit growth or volume growth has been quite substantial, specifically in the markets where you've got earlier rollout of free shipping, like in Chile, in Colombia, but even Mexico, where it's already obviously in place for a longer period of time. So I'm wondering. How do you think about the burden that this volume growth drives in the form of free shipping for your business, and how do you look to continue? Does it mean that it makes you more vulnerable in geographies where a lot of the growth has been coming from volumes and where you're seeing lower ticket items and where you're seeing shipping rates going up? Hi, Irma. So let's parse out your question because I think there are a few things in there. So first of all, the dramatic increase in our cost basis on shipping is a Brazil-only phenomenon. If you look at Brazilian gross merchandise volume on an FX-neutral basis, it actually grew more than units. So average selling prices in real are slightly up in Brazil.
I think you're accurate in saying that the price increases have a greater impact on lower ASP items from a volume perspective. From a cost perspective, because we tend to have less subsidies on cheaper items, it's the contrary. But yes, in the case of Brazil, I think the headwinds from the price increase impact lower ASPs more than higher ASPs, and that's part of the delta between volume growth and unit growth in the quarter.
I think the other geographies, we haven't seen significant changes in our cost structure. We continue to see robust growth. I think we highlighted Chile and Colombia that have been performing incredibly well, and that's primarily on the back of the growth and adoption of MercadoEnvíos and our free shipping initiatives. So in other markets, we continue to see strong growth and no impact on lower or higher ASP items. That is very clear. And when you just think – if you could just help us think philosophically about when you see elasticities being a little bit more negative, let's say, for the lower ASP items in Brazil, for example, would you tend or would management tend to increase the subsidies to hold up the volume growth, or would you say there's a point where you want to be preserving profitability, even if that means that the GMV growth on the back of low volume growth will be potentially slowing down more than you had maybe initially expected? Irma, I think one thing we've always said about how we manage the cost structure on shipping is that there are many different levers, and I think it's a constant process of iteration. If you look at the lower ASP items since the Correios price increase, they've actually gone already through two variations in prices. And so clearly, as the data comes in, I think we're reassessing what's happening with the volume, what's happening with profitability, and that's the way we intend to manage this going forward.
I think we don't want to overreact and slow the business down too much. We've said all along we manage for long-term growth and scale. On the other hand, we do want to be cognizant of our financial model, and so we have passed on some of the incremental cost to consumers. And like I said, we've already changed prices twice on lower ASP items. So it's an ongoing process of iterating and trying to find the right equilibrium, and we'll continue to tweak the price structure as we go forward. Helpful, thank you. Our next question comes from Deepak Mathivanan with Barclays. Hey, guys. This is Aki on for Deepak. Thanks for taking my question, so two questions on Argentina. Firstly, I was wondering if you could talk about the financial impact from the currency volatility that we have seen recently. And then secondly on the free shipping adoption, anything you can share there in terms of what percentage of units are under the free shipping program or any other metrics you can share there on Argentina? Thank you. Okay, so I'll take the first one first because that's easy. Too early to tell, obviously, there's a part of our business, which is the MercadoCredito business or installment plans on Mercado Libre, that have an underlying cost basis determined by the cost of borrowing in Argentina. We tweaked prices a little bit as rates have moved, but this is the last few days, so no read-throughs that we can announce yet. When we announce the next quarter, we'll give you some more visibility. We don't really have any right now because it's right in the middle of everything.
In terms of free shipping, Argentina continues to – I think Mercado Libre grows penetration as a consequence of shipping and loyalty. It's been a country that's always had lower penetration than the other markets. And although it continues to be the case, the percentage of volume that is being bought with free shipping is already up to almost a third of total GMV, so it's definitely moving in the right direction. Thank you. Our next question comes from Ravi Jain with HSBC. Hi there, a quick question here. So if I look at the cash flow basically from operations and CapEx, et cetera, it's probably negative $50 million to $60 million. Part of it is working capital. But the question I have is within the non-marketplace revenue streams, which of them are you the most excited which can accelerate rapidly and offset the investment that you're doing in free shipping and customer acquisition costs, et cetera? Do you have a target for free cash flow for the year, or thoughts on would be really helpful?
And the second question, just following up on an earlier question on fulfillment in Brazil, just more a two, three-year horizon, where do you see fulfillment as a percentage of GMV by Mercado Libre in two or three years from now? Do you see it going to 50%? Do you see it closer to 100% in three years? Just some thoughts on that will help us. Thank you. Okay, so in terms of non-marketplace businesses, and I think there are two pieces to your question. I don't know if they're necessarily linear in the answer. In terms of the non-marketplace businesses, like we said before, the non-enhanced marketplaces, I think there is a lot of optimism within the company around the payments space and the payments opportunity. We think those could be significant contributors to revenues and margin.
The cash flow on payments, because of the way we manage it where we are generally selling receivables, selling coupons, and we've stated our goal to also sell the loan portfolio as we move forward, potentially is also positive. But I think you need to think of that business as a financing business, where cash flow calculation is slightly different. So longer term, it could be a cash generator. Shorter term as we accumulate the loan book, it's actually potentially a cash consumer.
We don't disclose any annual cash flow targets or quarterly cash flow targets, and I think the business continues to be in investment cycle, so it's probably not the moment for us to be focusing on cash generation. I think we're fortunate enough that most of our businesses are cash flow positive. We don't really have strong CapEx investments in our fulfillment operations because of the way we manage these for now are primarily lease agreements, long-term lease agreements. And so they're more OpEx than CapEx for us, and that also generates an asset-light and cash-generative business profile, even as we get more and more into fulfillment and logistics.
And seguing onto fulfillment and logistics, again, we don't disclose long-term goals. I think we have said that we really believe, and we're seeing that in Net Promoter Scores and end-user data, that the user experience when items are being fulfilled by us is already delivering better results, faster times, and higher NPSs. So it's really important for us to move volume towards fulfillment at whatever pace we can, the faster the better.
It's probably a little bit early for us to have a clear sense of where it will be in three years. This is still very early stage. I think if you keep asking the question over the next few quarters and we have a little bit more history in both Brazil and Mexico and eventually more in Argentina, maybe we can give you a better answer of where we think we can be in a few years. Fair enough, thank you so much. Our next question comes from Robert Ford with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Hey, thanks for taking my question. Pedro, I had three for you, if I may, please. In your comments, you mentioned confidence in terms of optimizing pricing and cost to return to profit. Can you touch on some of the specific adjustments that you may be considering?
And then second, the Brazilian Association of E-commerce was able to obtain an injunction on the Correios price hikes. That seems to be holding up so far. Can you talk a little bit about the difference in jurisprudence behind your earlier injunction and theirs and your ongoing efforts to obtain a similar rollback on the Correios pricing?
And then lastly, could you touch a little bit on how GMV is trending in Brazil in April and early May, now that you've seen in a more extended period of those higher shipping costs in the system? Thank you. Great. So adjustments in profit, a few things, Bob, or returning to profitability. Q1 by design was already going to be a low-margin quarter. It has a lower revenue base. A lot of the salary adjustments and cost adjustments are already made. So there's a natural tendency built into our initial projections of margin improvement as the year progressed. Obviously, we were already running at a low margin projection and with the change in cost in Correios plus some incremental costs from late deliveries from the fourth quarter where we were paying out the credits in Q1, I think pulled us below the profit level into the red. So there's just natural scale as the business grows going forward.
We have passed on some of those price increases to both merchants and consumers. That happened to work at the very tail end of the quarter and delayed because, if you recall, Correios was able to reverse the original state retroactively. So there's a delta of about three weeks I think it is between the effective price increase and our reaction by passing cost on to consumers, so there's some incremental margin improvement from that.
And then going forward, as I said in my earlier remarks, I think we continue to tweak the pricing on different routes, different weights, and different specificities, so it's not a blanket price increase as the last one. Now we get more into fine-tuning. And the combination of those things, at this point in time with the knowledge we have now, gets us to profitable quarters going forward.
Second question on the injunction, so I'm not a lawyer here, but the initial reversal of the stay on our process was reversed, not on any technical merit, but simply because the residing judge was not in attendance. And so it was reversed until his return. He is back. He has now begun to hear the case. We don't know when he will eventually put forth his new ruling. But so on our end, there isn't any technical or jurisprudence that was used to reverse the stay. It was essentially I'm an interim, and so I'm not going to rule on this.
And then the final piece I think implied in your question is, under process law in Brazil, we can't be party to two rulings. So we decided to not ask why or if we can use the other one, but rather to stick to our guns with the merit of our case, which we think is actually stronger. So now we just need to wait for the residing judge to rule.
And then the final piece on GMV, again, we don't comment on the existing quarter. I think we've said that the tail end of March there is some elasticity to price increases, and we can give you guys the full readout when we get to the next quarter. Fair enough, thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Erickson with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Hi, thanks, just first a housekeeping question. Just even with the new net revenue reporting, gross margin still came in pretty far below the pre-free shipping levels. Can you just highlight maybe what's driving that? Great, so I'll walk you through very quickly. You actually have in the PowerPoint that accompanies the prepared remarks a waterfall that breaks out the gross margin trajectory year over year. The biggest impact is obviously just the lower revenue base when compared to prior year. The reason for that is that there are significantly more free shipping subsidies in Q1 of 2018 than there were in Q1 of 2017. So that's the biggest driver of gross margin compression. It used to happen at the COG level. Under the new accounting for revenue norms, it happens at the revenue level because it's the growth in GMV, the growth in units, the growth of most of the KPIs that drive a lot of the variable costs continued to trend-line where they were, but revenues obviously are growing at a much lower trend line because of the contra-revenues that are included in the calculation.
And then incrementally, if you just want to see which costs have grown the most, most of the margin compression, so about 450 bps, are concentrated in the sale of the mobile POS devices. That business is growing incredibly fast, but it does have a short-term gross margin impact because of the cost of the devices. Second, collection fees, mainly from payment processing, as Pago continues to grow very, very well. And then the last two are some hosting costs as we move from private cloud to public cloud, and then customer service and user experience costs that, again, those grow primarily variably in line with units sold and TPN, whereas revenues are now growing at a lower trend line. Got it, thanks. And then just in light of the Correios situation, have the intermediate targets for margins that you and the board target changed at all, meaning I'm sure the longer-term targets are unchanged? But is the board now willing to incur maybe slightly larger costs during this period, given how much of it is simply out of your control? Thanks. So again, we don't disclose those targets. I think what I said in the previous answers is this is a company that really is looking at the long term and is primarily focused on sustaining its top line growth. And top line, I think we should look at it for this particular conversation until we comp out the year in terms of the gross billing metric that we now offer in the disclosures and GMV, so how much is our gross merchandise volume growing.
And so I think given that, the process now is one of tweaking and trying to not simply defend a specific margin or EBIT target, but rather make sure that we're looking at sustaining the growth of the business, our rates to scale, but at the same time making sure that we're doing it in a way where we continue to manage the financial model responsibly. And we've always said those targets are artificial constraints that help us make that decision and allocate capital as we move forward. Got it. And then just one last one, if I could, just any more color on the sales and marketing spending? It seems like that picked up a lot. You mentioned it was some planned things. Just any color on what those things were would be great. Okay, so a couple of things here. I think in terms of the underlying customer acquisition costs – or investments, those have gone up. Obviously, revenues are also up. So margin contraction there isn't as significant, just the customer acquisition costs.
What we called out in the prepared remarks probably had – so there's about maybe 700-ish – 800-ish basis points from customer acquisition costs of contraction. The majority of our marketing investments continue to be performance-based and online-based. It's 830 basis points there. Then there are another 510 basis points, which are the credits to buyers who receive their packages later than our delivery promise, and some of those were spillover from Q4. And then there are another 160 basis points from bad debt. A lot of that is on the growing portfolio of consumer credit. That still has a very attractive default rate given what the interest rates in Latin America are. It's around 4% default rate, but it did add about 160 basis points of margin contraction at the bad debt level. Perfect, thanks. Our next question comes from John Coffey with Susquehanna. Hi. Pedro. This is a payments-related question. I was wondering. How should we think about the relative growth of Pago mobile, Pago off-platform, and Pago when it's weight-labeled for third-party websites? Hi, this is Osvaldo. So in terms of the off-platform business, the three of them are improving very aggressively, and we look at total (57:23) growing at 111% year on year. That's in broad terms, and 122% year on year in local currency. And if we're to open the three different business we're in off-platform, both wallet and mPOS are growing above, in the case of mPOS growing at 100% year on year, and there is a wallet of around 300% year on year, so both growing faster than the peer online merchants have been. Okay, great. Thank you, and just one last follow-up. What do you find is the biggest hurdle when you're signing up a merchant to use Pago? So I think we've had different challenges in each of the countries, but we are not facing huge hurdles to our own merchants. I think we're entering two very different businesses. One is the wallet. The other is mPOS, and those are usually most of them long-term customers, a lot of them but with very small volume per month. When it comes to larger merchants, they are mostly online. So that's basically switching costs or integration costs is usually a hurdle. And so processes are usually longer, but I don't see them as a huge hurdle. All right, thank you. Our next question comes from Richard Cathcart with Bradesco. Hi, good evening, so a couple of questions I'd like to ask on shipping in Brazil. First of all, Pedro, you mentioned that the MELI fulfillment option, you're seeing better user engagement metrics around that, one of the reasons I think that you're managing to get deliveries out more quickly. Could you just let us know how quickly you are managing to get those deliveries done through the fulfillment center and how that compares to the Correios deliveries?
And then secondly, just a more medium or long-term question about logistics in Brazil. Given that e-commerce has grown so much, you're seeing a lot of volume growth at MELI and also other companies, and you're trying to shift your alliance off of Correios onto third-party providers. Is there any concern that there may be a capacity crunch at some point in the future amongst these the third-party courier businesses? Thanks. Great, so let's see. The delivery times we don't disclose, I think suffice to say that the fulfillment times are significantly better in terms of total time when they go from our fulfillment centers to consumers versus Correios. And I think that the combination of both our fulfillment delivery (1:00:46) time in Brazil right now actually being quite good for the market, and that the Correios average, given that they also happen to do a lot of the more remote deliveries, is not that good.
So we don't disclose the delta, but certainly it's a material difference in terms of how long it takes to get something between click to your doorstep if it's fulfilled by us versus the average of the Correios or drop-ship network. There are certain deliveries that on the Correios network, primarily the more dense and the more competitive routes, where we actually use a faster option, Sedex. So those have competitive speeds, but when we look at the average of the drop-ship network, the difference is quite significant.
In terms of capacity going forward long term, it's a good question. I don't know the answer to that. I do think that we clearly are very focused on that, on making sure that we're doing everything that's within our control to continue to onboard as many new merchants. And when I mentioned at the beginning the build-out of our network design, what we're trying to accomplish is to make sure that we start building out an increasingly more complex network where we can start doing zone skipping, where we can start breaking out regional carriers for specific regions. And so again, we will have to figure out a way to find the necessary capacity to deliver for the growth of our business, and that will be a combination of adding more and more carriers and potentially figuring out other innovative ways to deliver goods. Thanks. And just a quick follow-up on that second answer, if I may. Roughly how many third-party carriers do you use in the main (1:02:48)? Is it in the tens, teens, or does it go into the hundreds? Not at all, I think the currently it's closer to single digits. I think as we grow that out, I don't know what the end game is. I don't think it will be in the hundreds over the next few years, but certainly we will continue to onboard more and more carriers. I think another consequence of the significant price hike from Correios is that it's also obviously accelerated our appetite and our focus and therefore the engineering that we're putting behind onboarding a growing number of carriers. Excellent, that's clear. Thanks very much. Our next question comes from Tom Champion with Cowen. Good afternoon, guys. Thank you for all the detail and transparency around the price hike. And not to belabor the point, but for those of us not located in Latin America, I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit about how other carriers or logistics providers might be responding to Correios's moves. Are they looking at this situation opportunistically and trying to win your business?
And then maybe just a small housekeeping item, going forward, will your reports resemble today's where you provide the billings, shipping, and net revenue detail, or will it just be on a net revenue basis? Thanks very much for your comments. I think the honest answer to the first question is I don't know how the local Brazilian logistics carriers are reacting. I'm looking around the table, but I don't have anyone from the logistics organization here. So we'll get back to you on that one. I don't want to make anything up. In terms of our focus, yes, we have signed agreements with a growing number of the well-known carriers and are working on onboarding them right now. How they reacted from a price perspective or how aggressive they've been commercially, we'll get back to you on that one.
Disclosures, sorry, so I think at least for the four-quarter transition period going forward, where we have the most marked differences because of the dramatic growth in our shipping subsidies, our plan is to continue to disclose gross billings. I think beyond that, it will just be a matter of seeing whether it continues to be as relevant in understanding the underlying trends in the business, or if once we've already normalized the rapid growth of shipping subsidies they won't be necessary. So we'll reassess sometime around next year. For the next few quarters, I think barring any unexpected situation, you can expect to continue to have that breakout because it really is fundamental in being able to understand how the business is performing. Great, thank you. And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to our host. Great, thank you. Lots of questions, so we appreciate the interest. Obviously, there's a lot going on. And as always, we look forward to speaking with you again with the progress on the second quarter of this year in a few months. Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.","the Mercado Libre earnings conference call for the quarter ended march 31, 2018 is being recorded . the conference call is being broadcast over the internet and is available through the Investor Relations section of our website . we may discuss non-GAAP measures during this quarter .",0.0

Now, let me turn the call over to Pedro. Thanks, Federico. Let me kick off today's call by saying that our business continues on a positive trajectory. The outlook for our industry is as positive as ever, and our investment thesis remains intact. The Internet is rapidly becoming a driving force for Latin America to develop and modernize faster, turning a history of underdeveloped infrastructure in the areas of retail and banking from a disadvantage to an advantage as it allows for innovation to flourish unencumbered by existing legacy players. It is in this context of inefficient retail and payments industries that we are deploying our technology solutions, allowing consumers to leapfrog traditional means of buying, selling, and paying straight into digital used cases. This long-term secular trend, digitally-enabled commerce and money bodes well for MercadoLibre's future growth prospects and marks the path for significant long-term value creation for both our users and shareholders.
Never losing sight of this promising long-term outlook, it is also fair to say that the second quarter of this year has been a transitional quarter for us with mixed result. As a consequence of events in Brazil that were beyond our control, principally the price increases from our major postal partner and the May truckers strike that lasted 10 days and had a negative impact on e-commerce, we've had to adjust our operational model to rebalance growth and profitability. Throughout the quarter we have had to carry out price increases, limit the amount of shipping subsidies offered and accelerate the deployment of our logistics operations in Brazil and Mexico so as to be able to return to profitability during the second half of the year.
As a consequence of these necessary modifications, we have seen a deceleration in our growth rate in these market. Notwithstanding this lower yet still robust growth, we trust the operating model put in place for the second half of 2018 is the correct profitable one that sets us up for the sustainable long-term value creation I outlined in my opening remark.
With that context, let's begin by taking a look at our marketplace business highlights for the quarter. Let's start with our largest market, Brazil. On an FX neutral basis, GMV there grew 44%, and items sold 43% year-over-year. The deceleration in growth is explained for by the most part, the price increases carried out in late March, tougher comps, and the truckers strike that started during the end of May, and finally, rationalization of the availability of free shipping subsidies in certain route and categories carried out in June.
Beyond Brazil, on a per country basis, results were more encouraging. In Mexico, another critical market for us, FX neutral GMV grew at 73% and continued to grow at one of the fastest rates of the last 2 years. Items sold in Mexico grew at a very strong 91% year-over-year as our free shipping program reached 92% of shipped merchandise volume and was complemented with successful execution of seasonal promotional initiatives during the second quarter such as the Mexican Hot Sale week.
Argentina continues accelerating both in units sold and FX neutral GMV basis. FX neutral GMV grew for the third consecutive quarter above 50%, reaching 57% growth year-over-year. Items sold delivered the fastest pace of growth in the last 10 quarters, growing 54% year-over-year, aided in part by easier comps as well as promotional initiatives similar to those in Mexico.
Colombia was a highlight for the quarter as we reignited vibrancy on the platform as our free shipping and loyalty programs begin to gain critical mass there. From a GMV perspective, on an FX neutral basis, Columbia delivered the fastest pace of growth in the past five years, reaching 45% year-over-year, while items sold also followed suit accelerating to an all-time high of a 100% year-over-year growth.
And finally, Chile, which is also on a solid growth trajectory, delivered FX neutral GMV growth of 53% year-over-year, while in units sold it delivered a record 82% year-over-year growth as MercadoPago gains rapid adoption on our marketplace there and free shipping also expands its footprint. Growth during the quarter had a strong impost (00:07:45) from increases in buyer engagement. Brazil, Mexico and Argentina are all maintaining user engagement momentum as items per unique buyer per quarter grew again above 20% when compared to last year. Chile and Colombia grew at an even faster clip in this metric at 42% year-over-year and 32% respectively. Consequently, items sold per unique buyer accelerated for the 21st consecutive quarter and surpassed five items purchased per quarter when looked at on a consolidated basis for all our marketplace.
These segment results in our key retail performance indicated translated into a strong consolidated marketplace quarter. During this quarter, units sold on a consolidated basis grew 39% to $85.4 million. However, if we exclude Venezuela from last year's comp, now that we have deconsolidated that operation, same country items sold growth was 51% year-over-year. Gross merchandise volume reached $3.14 billion, growing 15.2% year-on-year in dollars, while on an FX neutral basis GMV growth was 35.9% year-on-year. Here again, if we exclude Venezuela, same country GMV growth was 29.3% in dollars and on an FX neutral basis would have been 52.5% year-on-year. Same country unique buyers grew by 16% versus the prior year, and excluding Venezuela, unique buyers would have grown by 24% year-on-year.
And finally, live listings, where we remain the top e-commerce offering in product assortment accelerated for the sixth consecutive quarter above 50% year-on-year. It was also the first time in our history that we exceeded 150 million listings available on our website.
Before we move on to payment, let me give you a quick status update on where we are on our logistics initiative. During the month of June we launched our second cross-docking center in Brazil, contributing incremental capacity to our logistics network and allowing us to gain more control over network efficiency.
Exiting the quarter close to 10% of the shipped volume in our Brazilian operation was being handled by partners on our logistics network of cross-docking and fulfillment centers versus the remainder of the volume still running on our dropship network. Mexico continues to delight our consumers with great service levels in logistics. 98% of shipments there were made within the promised delivery window and 78% of these occurred in less than 48 hours.
We're also able to report that during the month of April, we began operations of our new 323,000 square foot fulfillment center in Mexico City managed with our in-house proprietary warehouse and transportation management technology. Although at quarter's end we were still fulfilling single digit of total shipped orders from that fulfillment center, the amount of orders we are processing is growing fast and we expect for our fulfillment solutions to grow in share of payment for many years to come.
In Argentina, we drove adoption of shipments made on our network to a record high 40% of shipped volume entirely through our existing cross-docking centers as fulfillment operations operated for MELI are only scheduled to launch there in the first half of 2019.
Let's now move on to payment, an ever more important building block for our business. The growing scale of MercadoPago in tandem with better user engagement and higher retention were powerful catalysts that contributed to the solid on marketplace payment volume growth we delivered during the quarter.
On an FX neutral basis, consolidated on marketplace total payment volume grew by 49% year-over-year, driven by strong penetration gains in Chile, Colombia and Uruguay, which were partially offset by lower TPV growth in Brazil. Almost nine out of every 10 items sold on our marketplaces are now already being paid for and settled with MercadoPago. As a result of this nearly full adoption of MercadoPago on our marketplaces, we now can increasingly reassign resources in the payments teams, towards our off marketplace opportunities, fintech, where we believe the opportunity is enormous.
With greater focus in resources than in the past, our off marketplace efforts are beginning to pick up speed. TPV grew 142% on an FX-neutral basis and 96% in U.S. dollars, growing almost 3x faster than on marketplace growth TPV on an FX neutral basis. The excellent execution in off-platform payment efforts both online through our merchant services business and offline through our mPOS offerings and mobile wallet businesses are resulting in a growing share of payment volume away from MercadoLibre's marketplaces. Over the last year alone, off-platform total payment volume has gained almost 10 percentage points, reaching almost a third of total payments during the quarter.
On a segment basis, Brazil was a stellar performer again as FX neutral off-platform total payment volume grew for the fifth consecutive quarter above a 100% year-over-year and delivered the fastest pace of growth in over a year, reaching a 170% year-on-year. Argentina followed suit, delivering the second straight quarter of FX neutral off-platform total payment volume that was north of 100%. Mexico, Colombia and Chile were also strong contributors with FX neutral TPV accelerating on a year-on-year basis to 88% in Mexico, 103% in Colombia and 110% in Chile.
Let me now take a moment to talk about the biggest driver of this growth in off-marketplace payments in Brazil and Argentina, our online to offline initiatives powered by the rollout of our mobile point-of-sale devices and (00:15:05) branded credit card unit. When we began distributing mobile POS devices, we made our first steps in providing bottom-of-the-pyramid merchants the ability to accept credit cards and offered them opportunities to engage in commerce whence (00:15:21) they were traditionally excluded.
The growth of these mPOS devices sold and FX neutral TPV yielded from mPOS devices in Brazil and Argentina have been key levers to continue scaling off-platform payments ecosystem and this quarter's results were an example of that. On an FX neutral basis, TPV on mPOS grew north of 550% both in Brazil and Argentina as we continue to serve long tail merchants, a segment of sellers we believe is still largely underpenetrated.
Mexico also delivered encouraging results on the mPOS business with record sales of devices in May and June, as we launched a new device and improved performance of online customer acquisition channels. On the card side, the installed base of cards has reached nearly 1 million prepaid cards linked to MercadoPago accounts in Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico, allowing our users to use their stored balances on our merchant mPOS devices or wherever MasterCard is accepted, both in online and offline venues.
During the quarter we also took further steps to grow our offline service offering through the build-out of a proprietary alternative payments network powered by QR codes and our digital mobile wallet. In our view, this network has the potential to empower millions of people throughout Latin America to participate more actively in the formal economy than ever before.
As such, we officially launched our QR code and mobile payment ecosystem in Argentina this quarter as we began to scale our two-sided payments network, adding important lifestyles (00:17:13) merchant that drive greater frequency of use and payment volume. Along those same lines, we are encouraged to see unique payers and unique collectors in our mobile wallet business growing well, as each type of user grew triple-digits year-on-year during the quarter, albeit still from a small base.
And finally, within the Fintech ecosystem, our merchant and consumer credit business is also performing well. We are proud to be able to empower buyers and sellers by improving the flow and access to credit to them and we took important steps in those respects during the second quarter, principally in Brazil.
On the merchant side, we began to unlock capital constraints to growth in our credits business, as we began securitizing, funding from private investors in order to provide loans to our merchant base without being limited by our own capital capacity. On the buyer side, we launched our consumer credit lending business, taking another important step in stimulating demand by offering more compelling credit offerings to (00:18:24).
This is an important milestone for us, as it will not only begin to allow many of our buyers who do not hold the credit card to be able to purchase on credit in our marketplace, but also improve the value proposition for those buyers who do own a credit card but are constrained by its low limits. During the quarter, our credits business surpassed the $10 million mark in revenues for the first time, reaching $13.9 billion, growing triple digits both on an FX neutral basis and in U.S. dollars on a credit portfolio of $112 million.
Having covered the strong quarterly KPIs, let's move on to a more challenging picture on the financial side. As mentioned earlier, financial results during the first half of the year were affected by the abrupt changes in the cost structure of our logistics operation at a period in which our free shipping offering has been in rapid expansion. Consequently, Q2 was a transition quarter where we spent the better part of the period adjusting our financial model in order to realign with our commitment to deliver profitable growth.
We feel that we have made strides in this direction and will continue to make changes to our pricing model and free shipping program as we see fit and have found pricing levels towards the end of the quarter that deliver both profit and growth once again.
During the second quarter, gross billings came in at $432 million, a 36% growth and on an FX neutral basis a 65% year-on-year growth. This marks the 14th consecutive quarter of FX neutral growth above 60% year-over-year. On a by country basis, gross billings were strong across the board. For the second quarter of 2018 and on an FX neutral basis, gross billings would have been as follows; 68% for Brazil, 78% for Argentina, 63% for Mexico, 64% for Colombia, 62% in Chile, and 84% in Uruguay, all of these expressed on a constant currency basis.
Shipping subsidies totaled $97 million, down 13% versus last quarter. This quarter-on-quarter contraction was attributed to two main factors. The first one is related to our efforts in optimizing the unit economics and subsidies in our free shipping program in Brazil, where we limited the availability of free shipping for certain categories and routes, second and third cities of the Northeast of Brazil as a response to the price increases from our main logistics partner at the end of the quarter. The second is due to the Brazilian truck strike; this action affected volume of sales and shipments of free shipping for approximately 10 days during the end of May and beginning of June. As a consequence of this tinkering and optimizing of the free shipping program, we were able to accelerate net revenue growth versus Q1, as it came in at $335 million growing 18% year-over-year and accelerating 14 percentage points to 44% year-over-year when looked at on an FX neutral basis.
Bear in mind that during the quarter, U.S. dollar growth rates were negatively impacted by the devaluation of currencies in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico. The Argentine peso devalued by 33%, the Brazilian real by 11%, and the Mexican peso by 4.5%.
On a segment basis, as reported quarterly net revenue year-on-year was solid as well. Brazil grew at 40%, Argentina at 68%, Mexico at 71%, Colombia at 51%, Chile at 42% and Uruguay at 84%, all of these once again expressed in constant currencies. Non-marketplace revenues were a strong contributor to revenue growth, reaching a $179.2 million, growing 72% in U.S. dollars and accelerating for the sixth consecutive quarter on an FX neutral basis to 96% year-over-year.
Non-marketplace revenue growth was driven for the most part by the stellar performance of our payments' revenue streams off-marketplace, which on an FX neutral basis grew above 100% for the second consecutive quarter, reaching a 132% year-on-year growth; and advertising, which also contributed to the strong performance in the segment, accelerating to 65% year-on-year growth on an FX neutral basis and gaining share as a percentage of revenues.
Gross profit ascended to a $159.7 million during the quarter, representing 48% of revenues versus 60% in the second quarter of last year. This deterioration in gross margin is primarily explained by the formulaic changes in revenues due to the implementation of ASC 606. For comparative purposes, COGS as a percentage of gross billings represented 40.6% this quarter versus 35.5% for the same quarter last year.
Additionally, the cost of mPOS devices, issuance of MercadoPago credit and debit cards, increased collection fees from our growing payments business, and increasing costs of deploying our infrastructure on public clouds explain the gross margin compression. We have included a detailed breakdown of these and also the OpEx margin evolution that I am about to cover in the slide that accompany this presentation.
Operating expenses totaled $188 million or 56% of revenues versus 50% of revenues during the same period last year. OpEx margin deterioration is also primarily explained by the formulaic changes in revenue recognition due to the implementation of ASC 606. For comparative purposes, operating expenses as a percentage of gross billings represented 44% this quarter versus 45% for the same quarter last year.
As reported, drivers of OpEx compression were incremental marketing costs, as we continue to invest for growth, increased loan loss provisions, as our credit portfolio grows, and buyer protection payouts as a consequence of deteriorated service levels by logistics partners during the quarter in Brazil. Operating losses, therefore, amounted to $28.2 million or negative 8.4% of revenues versus negative $29.4 million in the prior quarter despite having been impacted by increased shipping costs in Brazil during the entire three-month period versus only 14 days during the first quarter.
Further down on our P&L and with details also presented in the accompanying slides, we reported a net reported loss of $11.3 million and a basic net loss per share of $0.25. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $144.2 million. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities during the three-month period was primarily driven by improvements in the cash generation of our payments business in Argentina, as we discounted a larger volume of receivables than in the past.
Wrapping up, purchases of property plant and equipment, intangible assets, and advances for fixed assets totaled $24 million during the quarter. Cash, restricted cash, short-term investments and long-term investments at the end of the quarter totaled $605 million. This concludes my review for the second quarter.
Summarizing what we've seen, we believe that the secular trend of the Internet and e-commerce in the region are playing to our strengths, leaving us well-positioned to drive our future growth. As we move into the second half of 2018 and beyond, we will continue to drive sustainable efficiencies through cost discipline, while also fostering innovation, reducing complexity in our processes and improving the user experience for our users. I look forward to keeping you updated as we continue to grow our platforms and strive to capture the still nascent opportunity behind payments and commerce throughout Latin America.
And with that, we can now take your questions. And our first question comes from Mike Olson of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Good afternoon. I had two questions. First, should we assume that you're planning to return to profitable growth in Q3 and beyond? And if so, what would that focus on becoming profitable, again due to GMP and revenue growth rates in Brazil? Should we expect further deceleration due to less free shipping and lower subsidies I guess? And then second, is advertising becoming material to revenue at this point? Do you expect we'll see it continue to make up a larger portion of the mix and is it fair to say that advertising is a higher margin business than any other segments of your business? Thank you. Thanks, Mike. So on Q3, we can get into detail once we announce the Q3 numbers. As you know, we don't guide. I think what we've tried to say is that what we are carrying out is a balancing act between growth and profitability, always continuing to prioritize growth; and thinking through (00:29:20) investments that benefit us in the long-term, we will continue to carry out. And so I think what you've seen us trying to adjust throughout the second quarter to find that right balance is what we will continue to do going forward.
Advertising is a high-margin business for us. It's a business that has been delivering very solid growth rates, but I wouldn't call it material yet. It still represents low single-digits of overall revenue – of gaining share. I think there is a lot of long-term potential there, but at its current size despite its growth, I wouldn't call it a material portion of our business. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Pedro, I think your items sold per buyer continues to accelerate as you called out earlier. And I guess we'd like to look at the rate of change in that metric as well and I think you know the rate of change I think – it seems like that the latest cohort of buyers you're bringing in is purchasing at probably over 10 items per buyer. So I'm just wondering if that's directionally the correct item to look at, and it seems to suggest that people are purchasing at a velocity that's 2x what they might have doing a year ago. So I'm just wondering if you're seeing a material improvement in customer lifetime value there? Thanks. All right. Stephen, bear in mind that the improvement in engagement is not solely driven on very, very active new cohorts, but also on improved engagement levels from existing cohorts. So, overall, we continue to see improvements. Yes, the newer cohorts typically are more active, but if the math you're doing is assuming the older cohorts are flat and then all the incremental is from the newer cohorts, you're probably going to overstate the level of activity in the newer cohorts. What we're seeing as a consequence of the improved experience of the free shipping program, the loyalty program is beginning to kick in is just in general more purchases per user. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from Ravi Jain of HSBC. Your line is now open. Hi, Pedro. Could you just give us a little bit color on your fulfillment build-out in Brazil? Are you actually seeing sufficient CapEx spend by the third-party logistic providers for the scale that you are planning to build-out and some color on the evolution of what we should expect in the next 6 months, 12 months? And the second question would be on the mobile wallet adoption, some color on that whether that is accelerating the QR codes penetration as well in Argentina and in Brazil? Thank you. Great. So on fulfillment, like we said we have opened a fulfillment center in Brazil. We've also began to expand the footprint of cross-docking centers we have. So far we have not come up with any sort of constraints in terms of existing floor space or CapEx that have been given to us by our providers. And so we continue to expect to ramp up both of those pieces of our own network, both fulfillment by MELI's services that are nascent but growing nicely and also the cross-docking operations that allow us to (00:33:26) cross-docking centers from one set of carriers, do the middle mile with one set (00:33:33) of carriers and then last mile with a third set of carriers which means significantly improved service levels and also lower costs. So what you should expect from us as the year progresses is a greater number of our shipments moving away from the dropship network primarily ran by Correios (00:33:53) more and more to fulfillment and cross-docking centers that then allow us to use different, more efficient carriers. This is Osvaldo (00:34:05). On the mobile wallet front basically we have been (00:34:09) through our payments for some time that we basically really launched in May in Argentina – end of May in Argentina. During April and early May, we were building a solid merchant network and at the end of May, we launched rapid promotions with all of our user base. We also migrated the payment functionality which was only available on the follow up to the MercadoLibre as a wide (00:34:38) base. And we are very excited by the early results.
It's still very early to tell because as said (00:34:45), we launched end of May (00:34:47) in the quarter. We are very excited with the growth we are seeing. Thank you. That's helpful. Thank you. And our next question comes from Deepak Mathivanan of Barclays. Your line is now open. Hi, guys, thanks for taking the questions. Two questions from my side. So, regarding the new 5 reais seller fees for lower ASP items that you have put in place recently in 3Q, are you seeing any signs of seller growth impacted by the new fee? How are seller generally reacting to it? And then second question, nice to see the volumes on cross-talking ramping in Brazil. What will be the long-term monetization model for fulfillment solutions? Is it something that you think you can generate additional revenues either as incremental take rates or is it a solution to drive higher velocity and better user experience? Thank you. Great. So the new structure on flat fees I think has as an objective to generate incremental revenues that allow us to then reinvest in building a better user experience primarily by being able to offer free shipping on shopping carts where the inventory is still not fulfilled by us and is being fulfilled by multiple sellers and we have to pay more than one shipment within a single shopping cart.
And so, in terms of generating that incremental revenue, it's being successful and we haven't necessarily seen significant seller pushback in terms of seller churn. What it does do by design almost is, since it generates a flat fee per unit sold, it has a much greater impact on the seller's margin on lower average ticket items than on higher average ticket items. And so, we've seen greater headwinds to units sold than we have to GMV. I think all-in, we're very pleased with the results because they align with what we were trying to do, which is to generate the incremental revenue so that it could be reinvested in a better shopping cart experience for users, regardless of if the inventory is being fulfilled by us or not.
In terms of cross-docking and fulfillment, I think the current strategy is much more focused on rapidly ramping up that service offering; it allows us to lower the cost of shipping, it allows us to offer much faster and more reliable shipping and we think it really, really strengthens the value proposition of our marketplace for both our buyers and sellers if all these shipments are going on our own network or being fulfilled by us rather than through the dropship model. So that's where the focus is now, is on better time and lower cost. I think longer term, we can consider whether we also want to turn that into a revenue generator or not. It's not where the focus is right now. Great. Thanks, Pedro. Thank you. And our next question comes from Brad Erickson of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Hi there. Couple follow-ups here. First, are you able to unpack kind of the exact impact of Brazil GMV from the truckers strike from the deceleration in the quarter? And then second, can you just remind us what your free shipping exposure was in the quarter in terms of the portion of units in Brazil and just kind of how that compared quarter-over-quarter? Okay, great sorry. So, as you know parsing out specific drivers when things are happening on the site simultaneous is more of an art than a science. I think directionally our sense is that the truckers strike could have impacted marketplace in Brazil by anywhere between high-single digits to low teens of GMV.
And again, this is all happening simultaneous with the changes that we've been carrying out to the free shipping program and many other things. In terms of the exposure, the free shipping, I think – sorry, to – just to make sure I understand the question, is it the coverage of free shipping during the quarter or what percentage of shipment are growing going our network versus the dropship network? The latter. Okay. So if you take into account the ramp-up in our cross-docking plus our fulfillment, yeah, it's beginning to get into high-single digits of overall GMV. And bear in mind that the fulfillment centers were launched about a quarter or two ago. So it's still early, but really beginning to ramp-up if we combine cross-docking and fulfillment, but still a long way to go. Got it. And then just a follow-up on the mobile POS units that you're shipping, just talking about how you're finding the cost of customer acquisition there evolving and maybe just talk about any potential for maybe bigger spending campaigns, marketing campaigns down the road as you look to build that offline part of the business. Thanks. Osvaldo speaking. Growth has been flat the recent months in Brazil, also stable in Argentina. I think we are comfortable with the level of (00:41:33). Of course we would like to grow as much as possible but we are comfortable with the level of acquisition (00:41:41). Got it. Thanks. Thank you. And our next question comes from Richard Cathcart of Bradesco. Your line is now open. Hi (00:42:57). Richard, sorry, your voice is very, very faint. Hi, sorry about that. So, just on payments in Brazil, you know there has been some noise recently about changes – kind of various potential changes to Central Bank regulation perhaps moving payment terms on credit cards from D+30 to D+2 (00:42:25). So I just wanted to ask, kind of in your mind what are the potential big changes in regulation on the horizon that could potentially affect your payment strategy and kind of how do you think that could potentially affect the business? Thanks. We have – so those rumors actually have been coming and going over the last (00:42:54) quarters already, and so far has been no changes. Remember that in our case, we are not an acquirer, and we can say, by acquirers we are an aggregator, so if we were to get paid in D+2 (00:43:08), instead of D+30 (00:43:10) would be a positive for us. Most likely that would imply a change in commercial conditions, so it's not so easy to forecast what will happen. But I do think it still remains to be seen if there will or not be any changes to Central Bank (00:43:26). Okay. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from John Coffey of Susquehanna. Your line is now open. Thank you. Hi, Pedro. When it comes to off-marketplace MercadoPago on third-party websites, can you say what's bigger for you now (00:43:54) would this be white label processing or the more payments made via the MercadoPago button? And how would you expect this balance to look over the next few years? Sorry. So, you're asking for what we call the merchant service business, which is payments on other digital properties. What the most... Yes. ...predominant form is, payment buttons or...? ...or more the white label? Well, I know you do some processing for some websites where maybe MercadoPago wouldn't show up at all in name but it would be behind the scenes. Okay, Osvaldo again. I'd say in – based on a country by country basis, (00:44:37) is mostly white label, so you would not see MercadoPago so often because it's mostly APIs integration, server to server integrations. In the case of Argentina and Mexico and the smaller (00:44:48) markets, many times we own the check out, so you see MercadoPago check out a lot (00:44:54). But that's where a merchant get more sophisticated in every market. We tend to see higher impact of white label in particular. Okay. And do you expect that – so you expect probably as merchants get more sophisticated across all of your markets, they would probably be white label as an overall percentage. Do I understand that right? Yes, that's correct. Okay. Thank you. That's all. Thank you. And our next question comes from Bob Ford of Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Hi, everybody and thanks for taking my question. Pedro, can you comment a little bit about behavior of your seller and consumer portfolios? And now that you've secured third-party funding, how should we think about the ramp of those services? Okay. So, as we mentioned, the consumer credit business continues to evolve very positively becoming an increasingly larger contributor of revenues for us. When we mention that they are a contributor of incremental bad debt, I think primarily what we're trying to say is, previous years we didn't have this business, and so there wasn't any bad debt to book. Now that we have it, its margin contraction, but not because the level of bad debt is something that is of concern to us or exceeds our expectations and we feel that it's appropriately-priced bad debt. And so that business continues to be incrementally contributor in terms of revenue and still a margin-attractive business. I think the funding primarily has began to free up cash primarily, so one of the drivers of the improvements in cash flow for the quarter. It doesn't necessarily signal that we will accelerate the rate of distribution of credit because we continue to take a long-term approach to this and we want to make sure that we continue to manage risk accordingly. And so, just because we have third-party capital to deploy, it doesn't mean that we are going to alter either our models or launch more aggressive models or necessarily accelerate this beyond the same prudent approach we've been taking so far. We think the long term opportunity here is significant, but we also think that by taking it step-by-step is how we will generate the most value as we learn our way through both merchant and consumer credit. That makes perfect sense. Thank you very much. Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks. As always, thank you for – everyone for your interest and we look forward to giving you a third quarter update, answering some of the questions pertaining to the third quarter that we left open now. And for us it's back to work; there is still I think a lot going on at the company we're quite excited about and we will report back in a quarter's time. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.","the Mercado Libre earnings conference call for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 is being recorded . the conference call is being broadcast over the internet and is available through the Investor Relations section of our website . we may discuss some non-GAAP measures during this call .",1.0

Now, let me turn the call over to Pedro. Hi, everyone, and thank you for joining the call.
I'm pleased to report another quarter of solid performance in our business. From a top line perspective, gross billings ascended to $463 million, growing 25% in U.S. dollars and 48% on an FX neutral basis. On a country-by-country basis, gross billings were even stronger in our main countries. 69% growth for Brazil, 83% for Argentina, and 84% for Mexico. From a bottom line perspective, operating losses showed a 61% reduction versus last quarter, coming in at $11 million, and with a breakeven EBITDA as we've continued to make progress over the last three months in adjusting our operational and financial model for sustainable profitable growth despite strong currency headwinds and additional adverse policy changes from our carriers in Brazil.
Before I walk you through the highlights for the quarter, one comment on disclosure. You'll notice that many of the metrics we had been sequentially updating in the past will not be covered in my prepared remarks today as we've now included them in an accompanying presentation to the third quarter 2018 earnings script available on our website.
So let's begin this time with a fintech progress report as it has become a growing area of focus for our organization. Quarterly TPV reached $4.5 billion, a growth of 74% year-on-year on an FX neutral basis, excluding Venezuela. During the quarter, off-platform TPV explained 80% of the total incremental total payment volume as we increasingly focus our efforts on our growing online to offline payments offerings, successfully expanding the financial services we offer our merchants and growing the markets we are currently in.
During the month of September, for the first time ever, not only MercadoPago processed more total payment transactions off-platform than it did on MercadoLibre marketplaces, but total payment transactions surpassed the 100 million mark in a single quarter. This is a testament to the stride we've made growing our fintech ecosystem over the last few quarters. This growth has been driven in large part by our mPos business, which continues to fire on all cylinders. During the quarter and on a consolidated basis, FX neutral total payment volume from mobile Poss grew 636% year-on-year.
Going forward, we'll remain focused on merchant signup as we look to continue growing the number of net new ads to our mPos solution, which is already robust and forming a large and growing installed base of active merchants, processing payments through us. We see this segment as a still underserved and very large total addressable market that is also going to be key to the distribution of most financial product and services we would develop in our fintech portfolio.
We're also very pleased with the progress we're seeing in our mobile wallet initiatives, which have reached an important milestone this quarter, crossing the 1 million monthly active payers mark in a single month. In line with that, active payers grew triple-digits in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico during this quarter.
Through the MercadoPago wallet, an individual can set up our mobile wallet within minutes and be able to send peer-to-peer payments, top up his mobile device, pay for utilities, store money, and pay physical world merchants via our growing QR payment network.
As we continue to build greater ubiquity and add more usage cases to our two-sided network, total payment volume from the mobile wallet on an FX neutral basis should also continue to grow triple-digits year-on-year in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico as it did during the third quarter of 2018.
This quarter also marked an important breakthrough in the rollout of new fintech products as we launched our asset management feature in Argentina. Since its launch, we are enthused to see that asset management users have invested almost 20% of the total stored balance that existed in MercadoPago, indicating good product market fit from the get go, and increasing our commitment to the regional rollout of this new product.
We believe that all these results are indicative of the large market opportunity that exists for this type of service. Unbanked or under-banked users typically struggle with savings products as they usually do not have the know-how to access more sophisticated options, and are generally offered less competitive yields on traditional savings accounts. So, in essence, what we believe makes our asset management product disruptive is its ability to bring an inclusive and attractive wealth management product to individuals and SMBs with minimal transaction costs and complexity.
Today, if you're a small saver in Latin America, there are very few venues to invest your money in, and that bodes well for us as we are uniquely positioned to change that as we scale out these asset management products throughout the region.
Let's move on to some of the highlights in the marketplace business now. The marketplace business continues to show great resiliency. We've delivered solid growth rates despite increasingly tougher comps and reductions in shipping subsidies we offer. On a consolidated basis, gross merchandise volume reached $3 billion. On an FX neutral basis, that growth is up 28% year-on-year. However, excluding Venezuela, which we've deconsolidated this year, FX neutral growth would have been an even stronger 38% year-on-year.
On a market-by-market basis, Mexico continues to consolidate as an engine for growth in our business. Since early 2017, we've grown the size of that business by a factor of roughly 2.5 times as we leverage our depth and breadth of selection, fast and free shipping value proposition, and aggressive customer acquisition investments to gain incremental share of wallet from our Mexican buyers. Consequently, Mexico has delivered seven consecutive quarters of items and FX neutral GMV growth above 65% year-on-year. All this at the same time as we continue to hold our leadership position in brand awareness and reach in Mexico.
As we continue to build out the scale advantages in that market, we grow our level of comfort in our competitive position and ability to eventually deliver a profitable and growing P&L for that market.
Moving on to our largest market, Brazil, the marketplace grew on an FX neutral GMV at 33% year-on-year, sustaining 12 consecutive quarters of FX neutral growth above 30% on the back of tougher two-year comparisons and shipping subsidy reductions we carried out in order to improve monetization rates and unit economics in that market.
This is an encouraging data point as in Brazil, according to EBIT, e-commerce is calculated to be growing at roughly 15% year-on-year in local currency indicating we continue to gain share of overall e-commerce despite the deceleration in our business.
Staying on Brazil, as a result of launching the BRL 5 flat fee in July for all items sold worth less than BRL 120 and also the restrictions that we placed on selling items worth less than BRL 6, units sold have decelerated sharply to 1% year-on-year. Although this is never optimal, it is self-inflicted and comes with the intended benefit of growing average ticket levels that drive the improved economics for our free shipping program that we were able to deliver during the quarter. Also important is that despite the reduction in the sales of low-ticket items, volume per unique buyer continues to grow at a healthy clip both in dollars and local currencies.
Moving further south, Argentina continues to maintain momentum, both on an FX neutral basis in GMV and also in unit sold growth, rising to 49% year-on-year for both metrics as our free shipping and loyalty program continues to gain traction, despite the challenging macro and currency trends during the quarter in that market.
On free shipping, we're pleased to report that within less than a year of the launch of the program, almost half of all our sales in Argentina are already being delivered to consumers without them having to pay anything for the shipping.
Let's now move on to our logistics progress report, another critical building block of our enhanced marketplace vision. The adoption of our proprietary logistics network is making strides. Exiting the quarter, over 15% of the shipments through MercadoEnvíos were sent through it rather than in our dropship network.
As we continue to have greater control over the end-to-end shipping experience, we visibly eliminate friction, improve customer satisfaction, and consequently drive greater frequency of use and share of wallet. Not only is the mix of shipments through our prop network growing, but the efficiency of that network is also improving. Over the last year, we've been able to shorten our lead times by almost 20% on a consolidated basis on that proprietary network. Brazil is the geography where we've observed the greatest improvement as we shorten lead times by 1.9 days versus last year. Additionally, we've also improved lead times in Mexico and Argentina where we've seen improvements of approximately half a day in both countries.
We've also made advances in advancing our dropship network in Argentina where we've launched a MercadoLibre Flex logistics solution. This application will enable our sellers to adopt proprietary MELI technology while leveraging their existing logistics relationships with small carriers to deliver products within hours in large metropolitan areas through our MercadoEnvíos logistics network.
One final update on delivery times, a key metric we use to guard service levels. During the quarter, on a consolidated basis, the percentage of items delivered within 48 hours increased by 15 percentage points versus a year ago. Mexico has led the way with almost 80% of all volume being delivered in two days or less, while Argentina and Brazil also continued to improve their share of shipments delivered in that time window.
Now that I've covered the key highlights on operational KPIs for the quarter, let's move on to financials where we've continued taking steps to balance our financial model as a result of the unforeseen changes in cost structures of our logistics operation in Brazil during the previous quarters of this year. We feel we've made inroads on that trajectory towards profitability despite additional pressure during this quarter from unforeseen and large currency devaluations. Going forward, we'll continue to make changes in shipping subsidies and pricing as we see fit in order to finally achieve this goal.
On top of the solid growth in gross billings during the quarter that I mentioned at the opening, increased efficiencies in managing subsidies also drove strong revenue growth on an FX neutral basis. Consolidated net revenues came in at $355 million accelerating on an FX neutral basis 14 percentage points sequentially to 58% net revenue growth year-on-year.
Just as with gross billings, on a country-by-country basis, net revenues were strong in our main countries. 56% growth for Brazil, 68% growth for Argentina and 168 percentage growth for Mexico, all of these expressed on an FX neutral basis.
Gross profit ascended to $170 million during the quarter, representing 48% of net revenues versus 58% in the third quarter of last year. Net realizable value discounts on mPos devices, warehousing costs, and increasing costs of deploying our infrastructure on public clouds explain the gross margin compression. We've included a detailed breakdown of these and also the OpEx margin evolution I am about to cover in the slides that accompany this presentation.
Operating expenses totaled $181 million or 51% of revenues versus 49% of revenues during the third quarter of 2017. Main drivers of OpEx margin compression this quarter were attributed to buyer protection payouts, increased loan loss provisions from our credit portfolio, and incremental marketing costs as we invested behind promotional campaigns and online advertising.
For comparative purposes, OpEx as a percentage of gross billings, was 39% this quarter versus 40% the same quarter a year ago, a 100% basis point leverage in operational expenses. As a result and as mentioned earlier, operating losses contracted by 61% versus last quarter to $11 million despite higher free shipping penetration on a sequential basis as we better optimized the availability of our free shipping and loyalty options and have driven better economics behind these.
Below operating income, we saw $15.9 million in financial expenses attributed for the most part to interest accrual on the new convertible note we issued this quarter, due 2028, and also working capital facilities we took out in Argentina, Uruguay and Chile. Interest income decreased by 39% year-on-year to $8.6 million due to the devaluation of the Argentine peso and a lower float in Argentina as we've launched our asset management product.
Our Forex (17:47) line was positive $3.9 million as a consequence of a $5.2 million (sic) [$5.1 million] (17:52) gain arising from U.S. dollar reevaluation over our Argentine peso net liability position in Argentina, which was partially offset by $1.3 million of losses arising from the appreciation of the Mexican peso over our U.S. dollar net asset position in Mexico.
As a consequence of all this, net loss as reported for the third quarter was also lower versus the previous quarter at $10.1 million, resulting in basic net loss per share of $0.23.
That wraps up the high-level strategic review of the quarter. We remain convinced that a key measure of our success will be the value we generate over the long-term for our shareholders. This value will come to fruition as a direct consequence of how quickly we solidify and extend our current leadership position throughout the region. The hurdles and threats we will face to achieve our long-term vision are aggressive ingenious and well-funded competitors, growth challenges and execution risks, and the need to deploy considerable investments to meet an expanding opportunity throughout multiple countries.
However, not only online commerce and fintech is still huge and under-penetrated market, but we feel very positive about what we've accomplished so far this year, and continue to remain even more excited of what we will be able to achieve as we move into the end of this year, 2019 and beyond.
Thanks. We can now take your questions. Our first question comes from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. Hey, good afternoon. You focused a lot on payments in your prepared remarks. Just wondering what you're seeing from a competitive standpoint for payments in the region? And is this a case where multiple players can win in the midst of a huge market opportunity, or is it more of a winner-take-all market in your view? Thanks. Hi, Mike. So this is obviously a very, very large TAM. This is a combination of both our aspiration to gradually move consumers away from cash payments to digital payments, combined with having a very strong value proposition or consumers in the region that today are non-banked or under-banked in addition to whatever opportunities exist to gain bank, consumers and existing plastic or digital transactions. So the size of the opportunity really is enormous. And given the size of the opportunity, obviously competitors will arise. But as always, if we continue to focus on ourselves in the long-term, we think there's a chance to build a very, very healthy and sizable business there. Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Okay. Thanks. Pedro, I wanted to talk about your efforts to take down friction (21:33) in Brazil and decrease your dependency on Correios. Wondering, as of this quarter, like what percentage of the units in the country are now off-Correios and how much you think you can pull off on either a quarterly or on an annual basis? Thanks. So we disclosed the consolidated number of shipments that go through our prop network. We're not disclosing that by country. Suffice to say that we continue to make some positive moves in terms of building all the necessary building blocks for our proprietary network in Brazil. We now have a fulfillment center that's operational and very, very rapidly expanding its square meter footprint. We have multiple cross-docking stations. We're beginning to aggressively do zone skipping and optimizing on that network. So I think a lot of the heavy lifting that we've been doing over the last three or four quarters should begin to give us better and better returns as we move into the fourth quarter and 2019.
We still have a significant reliance on Correios for this holiday season and probably moving into the beginning of next year. I think, fortunately, Correios' efficiency and their performance has also dramatically improved over the past few months, which is one of the reasons we've seen the improvement in delivery times that were mentioned in the prepared remarks.
So I think things are moving along very well on that front, but building out a logistics network is something that will take multiple quarters, and we'll continue to give you progress reports on that as we move forward. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Ravi Jain with HSBC. Hi, Pedro. Just following up on the payments question here. Given all the competitive landscape you're going to see, especially in Brazil, can you just conceptually give your views on three different streams? One is payments on platform, one is off-platform online, and off-platform offline. As to where is the biggest growth opportunity and how will the profitability of these three different streams in the longer term differ from each other? That would be really helpful. Thank you. Hi, Ravi. This is Osvaldo. So what we've seen today is we are very pleased with how we have been evolving, first on platform and then online, but what we see today is that e-commerce (24:32) in Latin America is between 4% and 5%. For the addressable market, it's significantly higher offline than online, and that is what we are seeing in terms of growth rates, growth with our mPos and wallet, and where we are seeing most of the growth over the last year. And we expect that trajectory to continue, and so we will leave that eventually.
Offline will be larger than online. Still, it's a long way to go there because majority of our volumes comes from MercadoLibre and that already the mPos piece and the wallet piece are significantly adding more growth than the traditional online merchant services. Thank you. Our next question comes from Franco Abelardo with Morgan Stanley. Hi, everyone. So, my question is about the seller's base, especially in Brazil. Did you see any churn in the seller's base after the flat fee rate and maybe because of competition arising in the marketplace environment in Brazil you continue to see new sellers entering the off-platform? Thank you. Great. So you look at the results in Brazil, right, growth in GMV above 30% coming in at 33%, that's significantly above everyone who's reported so far. And I think that it's a confirmation that business in Brazil, despite the strong headwinds from cost pressures and all the tinkering that we've been undertaking, continues to perform very well.
There has been a decrease in overall number of new sellers as we, by design, began to remove the sale of very low ASP items. But if you look at gross merchandise volume, essentially what we've done is we've increased the ASP and we've removed a lot of very low value items that were also very difficult to conciliate with our very aggressive and very well received by our consumers free shipping offering. I think seller churn from competitive pressures or from the modifications we've made don't seem to be something that's excessively negatively or materially negatively impacting the results in Brazil. Thank you. Our next question comes from Marcelo Cantos (sic) [Marcelo Santos] (27:22) with JPMorgan. Hi. Good afternoon. It's Marcelo here. I had a question about the changes, the fine-tuning you're making in Brazil, tweaking the prices. So that is – is that mostly over, I understand it's never over, but is it mostly over the bulk of the changes? And do you think now you have more stability on that front? Or you are still looking to make some more tweaks and maybe to improve profitability? So, as you can see from the evolution in the profitability or the reduction in EBIT losses, we've obviously gone in the right trajectory over the last three quarters. I think a lot of the significant modifications were carried out over the last two quarters. Now, going forward, we need to continue to monitor what happens with pricing and continue to adjust if prices have similar levels of changes as they did in the past, which we don't anticipate. But the reality is that especially the state-owned carrier has continued to change their commercial conditions over time.
And also as we continue to improve in terms of more fulfilled delivery, more delivery on our proprietary network, that also could potentially open either the need or the possibility to continue to change pricing and costs. So I do think it's going to be an ever-evolving situation, but the big impact like the introduction of the flat fee or the reduction of key routes, which were the most significant drivers of changes in costs but also changes in demand, I think were carried out in the prior quarters. Great. Thanks a lot. Thank you. Our next question comes from Thiago Bortoluci with Goldman Sachs. Yes. Hi. Good morning – good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for taking the question. My question is on Brazil GMV growth. We saw a change in the growth drivers this quarter with growth being much more driven essentially by price and not by volumes. Is it fair to assume that this trend should continue during the next three quarters until we see normalized comps for the flat fee? Or was there any specific issue impacting only this quarter? Thank you very much. So just to clarify terminology. Yes, you're correct, what we did is eliminate, literally you can no longer list items on the platform for less than BRL 6. So that has eliminated a lot of transactions that we no longer wanted on the platform, which has slowed down unit growth significantly. But when you look at volume growth, because the average selling prices are now higher as we have removed that very cheap long tail stuff, has actually held above market rates of growth of 33%. And that's something that, as you anticipate, we should expect to remain in place until we comp this quarter next year because we don't have any current plans to reintroduce listings for less than BRL 6. So growth over the next year will be focused on gross merchandise volume and not so much units because of this change in policy. That's clear. Pedro, thank you very much. Thank you. Our next question comes from Deepak Mathivanan with Barclays. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. So, first, can you talk about potential operational constraints that you would see that shift into more 1p (31:20) managed logistics solutions? In other words, do you think there are sufficient partners out there that can support the volumes to achieve your goals on this program?
And then secondly, when should we expect some kind of monetization initiatives to kick in and cover some of the costs associated with warehousing and cross-docking that you're incurring for this? Great. So our answer on operational constraints, I think, continues to be consistent with the prior quarters. We continue to add a growing number of carriers to our proprietary network that are doing increasing percentages of last mile delivery, that are doing zone skipping efforts for us. And so far we have not come up against availability of carrier capacity on our prop network.
Now, our prop network is still in the early stages and will continue to grow at a very rapid pace, and we'll see what happens in the future. But so far we haven't come up against capacity constraints nor do we anticipate that going forward.
In terms of the management of profitability and costs, we have carried out the corrections over the last few quarters. What we said is we'll continue to tinker. We believe that as we begin to offer more and more fulfillment service for our merchants and continue to improve delivery times in Brazil, which should sustain above market levels of growth in our business if we are able to deliver on all that. There continues to be room for pricing on the platform, especially for the sellers who we will be fulfilling for and taking care of their deliveries on our proprietary network.
So we do think that there still are possibilities and drivers for margin improvement. That's not where the focus is right now. The focus continues to be on rapidly rolling out the proprietary network. Thank you. Our next question comes from John Coffey with Susquehanna. Hi, Pedro. Thanks for taking my call. My question is on mPos. In Brazil there's a number of competitors trying to sign up SMBs for credit acceptance. How does Mercado differentiate itself such that a new merchant signs up with you instead of (33:58) or another competitor? What we're doing is two-fold. First is we are leveraging our (34:19) that is driving most of our sales in terms of mPos. And then in terms of – the other thing we're doing is offering a comprehensive financial solution. So we started offering merchant grades a long time ago, a couple of years ago in Argentina then Brazil and Mexico. And then we had extended that to our mPos machine. In that way, we have gained a lot of volume over the last year, and we're very excited with the growth we're seeing. Great. Thank you. Thank you. And our final question comes from Richard Cathcart with Bradesco. Hi, guys. Good evening. I just wanted to ask a question about the merchant credit in Brazil. Just wondered what you're seeing relatively early on in the product's life, what you're seeing in terms of demand from the sellers, and what you're learning about risks. And then also, if you could just kind of give a bit of a view whether you're looking at this product mainly as a way to drive your own revenue growth or whether it's also where you can kind of try and help the sellers to drive their own GMV growth on the platform, which in turn will also help your GMV growth. Thank you. So let me take the financial question, and then Osvaldo can give you some color on the demand we're seeing in how that business is performing.
The credit business, not just in Brazil but overall, is one that we're very enthused about. We're seeing very good results there. We see it as both. We see it as a business that will be one of our drivers of monetization and high margins, but at the same time it also is an extremely important driver of our sellers being able to sell more, as it's becoming for many sellers a prime source of working capital to grow their businesses.
So I don't think necessarily there's a trade up there. Credit spreads in the region are very, very interesting and attractive. And even with a very compelling value props for our sellers, probably better for them than what they would get from traditional banks or financial institutions, so it drive their businesses and it still delivers a profitable high-margin revenue stream for us. Then in terms of originations in the last few quarters, we have not increased there the volume of originations in the aggregate (36:55) for the market. I'd say that is related to two things. First one is, during the third quarter this year in Brazil, we extended the number of (37:05) loan money to (37:07) usually lasts 12 months, but many of our target we have reached in just first quarter, and we have increased loans in the second and third quarter, but not as many as during the third one.
Second factor has been the macro in Argentina. In Argentina given – on one hand, increase in interest rates; on the other hand, devaluation. When you look at amount of originations in U.S. dollars, those numbers have decreased over the last two quarters, but it's something that we believe is sensible given that (37:42) in the last quarter. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's question-and-answer portion of the call. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Pedro Arnt for any closing remarks. Great. Thank you, everyone, for listening in. We are fully focused on the Q4 quarter here. Many of the countries have already started with their big commercial dates, Cyber Mondays and whatnot, so a lot of exciting work being done in the company that we will update you on in February. Thanks a lot. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect, and have a wonderful day.","MercadoLibre's earnings conference call for the quarter ended september 30, 2018 . this conference call is also being broadcast over the internet . a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures can be found in our third quarter 2018 earnings press release .",1.0

I am Federico Sandler, Head of Investor Relations for MercadoLibre. Our senior manager presenting today is Pedro Arnt, Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, Marcos Galperin, Chief Executive Officer; and Osvaldo Giménez, Executive VP of Payment, will be available during today's Q&A session. This conference call is also being broadcasted over the Internet, and is available through the Investor Relations section of our website.
I remind you that management may make forward-looking statements relating to such matters as continued growth prospects for the company, industry trends, and product and technology initiatives. These statements are based on currently available information and in our current assumptions, expectations and projections about future events. While we believe that our assumptions, expectations and projections are reasonable in view of the currently available information, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.
Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in this call for a variety of reasons, including those described in the Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors sections of our 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on our Investor Relations website.
Finally, I would like to remind you that during the course of this conference call we may discuss some non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures can be found in our fourth quarter 2018 earnings press release available on our Investor Relations website.
Now, let me turn the call over to Pedro. Thanks Federico. Let's kick off today's call by doing a quick, high level recap of the year that has just ended. We've closed out a challenging year that has combined a few significant challenges with transformative positive initiatives. On the more challenging front, changes in our logistics cost structure in Brazil forced us to claw back our free shipping initiatives and to introduce a flat fee structure that negatively impacted vibrancy on our marketplace.
These changes in free shipping combined with year-over-year comps that already lapped the launch of free shipping during the prior year led to deceleration in our marketplace business as the year progressed, despite two-year average growth rates that have remained fairly stable and still above market.
On the flip side, 2018 was also a year of significant positive developments that set us up extremely well for the long run. During last year we launched and have begun to scale our own logistics network that will in time allow us to deliver better service levels at lower costs in both Mexico and Brazil. We've expanded our installed base of MPOS devices in Brazil and Argentina with strong results in terms of devices sold and total Payments volume, which in Mexico we are beginning to gain traction.
We also successfully launched our wallet and QR initiatives in Argentina and are already replicating those initiatives in Brazil and Mexico. And finally, we redesigned our pricing and incentive programs by meaningfully optimizing investments so as to consistently improve EBITDA and accelerate constant currencies net revenue growth during the fourth quarters of the prior year. It is with this positive second half momentum that we move into the first quarter of 2019 and beyond.
Our efforts going forward will continue to be centered on capitalizing on the adoption of e-commerce in the region as millions of consumers move their purchasing share of wallet online and increasingly pay through digital and mobile means. The trend is clear for us. As we improve the online shopping and Payments experience, customer trust, confidence, engagement and retention go up, which ultimately drive further adoption of our ecosystem and positively flow through into our financials.
Let me now delve into the fourth quarter results. Perhaps most importantly, meaningful advances were made on the logistics front. On a consolidated basis mean delivery times improved 30% on a year-over-year basis allowing us to deliver 50% of our shipments in three days or less. Specifically in Brazil over the last year we have been able to improve by 10 percentage points the amount of packages being delivered in 48 hours or less, while we also reduced median delivery times by two days.
This is not only a consequence of improved service levels of our main shipping partner in Brazil, but also the result of the advances we have made in moving volume on to our managed logistics network. On a consolidated basis, over 20% of all shipments were already done through our network of fulfillment and cross docking centers. Penetration of this managed network reached 17% in Brazil, 15% in Mexico, and 55% in Argentina during the fourth quarter of 2018.
Overall adoption of the MercadoEnvios solution in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina are also worth calling out. Brazil gained 11 percentage points to 91% of all packages being delivered on our managed network. Argentina gained 16 percentage points to 49% and Mexico gained 14 percentage points to 94%.
Depth of inventory and selection, another key area for our marketplace business also remains robust. During the quarter we improved product discovery and deepened breadth and depth of selection. In Brazil for example, live listings grew for the fourth consecutive quarter above 50% year-on-year to 57%, reflecting MercadoLibre is still the marketplace of choice when it comes to assortment and depth of selection in that country.
Our Official Stores initiatives also delivered positive results further improving the quality and discovery of inventory on our marketplace. Driven by special dates and the shopping season, Official Stores gross merchandise volume penetration was solid in main countries; Mexico at 14% up from 7% last year, Brazil at 13%, up from 9% last year, and Argentina also with 13% up from 10% last year.
The growth in Official Stores penetration is attributed not only to solid hunting commercial efforts in on boarding well-known brands, but also driven by the rollout of a more complete intellectual property protection program which is giving brands better tools to increase their comfort level to sell on MercadoLibre.
During the fourth quarter we on-boarded the likes of Estée Lauder cosmetics, MAC, the Gap, just to name a few. As a result, GMV on an FX neutral basis excluding Venezuela that has been deconsolidated grew by 31% year-on-year. Keep in mind this is on the back of the toughest comp from 2017 where GMV grew 67% year-on-year. The combination of both years yields a two-year average yearly growth rate that nearly hits 50%.
For a regional overview, let me start in Brazil. During the fourth quarter of 2018 on a local currency basis GMV grew 24.4% year-on-year. Tougher comparisons versus last year where Brazil grew at 71% year-on-year as well as pricing adjustments we implemented to improve the unit economics and low ticket items and allow us to rebalance our growth and profitability, explained for the most part the year-on-year deceleration.
In Mexico, we continue to have a position of strength when we look at share of purchases and GMV. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2018 on a local currency basis, GMV sustained solid momentum growing at 56% year-on-year. Just like in Brazil tougher comps over the same period of last year explained for the most part the lower growth rates delivered during the quarter.
Staying on Mexico, and the results of having greater control over user experience by pushing for greater mandatory adoption of MercadoPago and more recently of MercadoEnvios, we've observed an 11 percentage point improvement in our net promoter scores over the previous year. This is a clear indicator that we can drive greater customer satisfaction as we become more and more involved with the end-to-end buying experience.
Finally, Argentina continues to demonstrate resilience in spite of strong macroeconomic headwinds and the rollout of caps to limit the number of free listings per seller that we allow. GMV on a local currency basis grew by 48% year-on-year during the fourth quarter.
Let's now move on to our Fintech and Payments progress report for the quarter, another area of strategic importance for us. We believe that not only are we facilitating payments and credit on MercadoLibre's marketplaces through MercadoPago and MercadoCredito, but we continue to deploy our online based Payment solutions off of MercadoLibre.
Given the size of this structural opportunity we've been accelerating the distribution of our online to off line products and services as we envision MercadoPago as a powerful disruptive provider of inclusive financial technology solutions. In particular, for those segments of the population who have been historically underserved and which in many instances operate in the informal or partially formal economies of the region.
As a result of the aforementioned push into offering O-to-O services away from our marketplace total Payments volume surpassed the $2 billion mark for the quarter for the first time ever reaching $2.1 billion during Q4 2018. Within those online to off-line solutions, mobile POS are still the most relevant.
MPOS TPV continued growing triple digits both in dollars and local currencies and continue to gain incremental share of our total Payments volume. On a consolidated basis, MPOS TPV grew by 365% year on year on an FX neutral basis driven by sustained growth of our installed base of devices in Brazil and Argentina where TPV on an FX neutral basis grew north of 300% and 500% year-on-year respectively.
During the quarter we also made inroads into the build out of our alternative Payments network through our mobile wallet initiatives. For the three months ended on December 2018 our digital mobile wallet was used by millions of active payers reaching an active base that was four times larger than it was a year ago mobile wallet TPV transactions also delivered solid results growing north of 450% year-on-year.
One of the several payment usage cases we are focusing on to scale our mobile wallet is QR Payments in stores. On the latter, we have begun to see encouraging results in Argentina since it was the first country where we were able to offer our full line of online to off-line Payments solutions. We've been successfully on-boarding both lighthouse merchants that bring brand equity and ubiquity to our wallet, as well as smaller stores.
A case in point, within less than two months of launching McDonald's has become the number one ranked QR in-store payments in terms of TPV on our network. It is also important to highlight that QR in-store payments all revenue represents more than 40% of total wallet TPV for Argentina.
We continue making progress in expanding our inoperative products in order to align the right incentives for our users to begin to fund their digital wallets with cash as opposed to credit or debit cards. As such, in December we launched our asset management solution in Brazil for individuals and merchants. Results have been encouraging so far as the amount of money invested as a percentage of MercadoPago stored balances in Brazil is already higher than what it is in Argentina within only one month of launch.
In Argentina the asset management product continues to gain traction as within only six months of launch invested funds already represented 40% of MercadoPago stored balances. Our merchant and consumer credit products are also scaling nicely, further strengthening the portfolio of financial services we are able to offer our users. Loan originations re-accelerated again growing by 31% during the fourth quarter to a total loan book of roughly $96 million.
We've also expanded financing sources for the loan products raising third-party funding in Brazil and Argentina as our merchant credit business continues to gain traction. During the quarter, we were able to raise over $31 million from the Inter-American Development Bank, while in Argentina we issued our second public trust which successfully gave this access to capital markets to offload the loan book.
Finally, our merchant services business has re-accelerated growth during the quarter. Successful execution in Argentina through our Gateway solution, complemented by fast growth in Brazil, Colombia, Uruguay, and Peru explained the solid results in this business during the quarter.
Now that I've covered the key operational highlights for the quarter, let's move on to our financial progress report. The steps we've taken over the past year to recalibrate our growth and profitability has made significant strides as we delivered the second consecutive quarter of positive EBITDA. Our improvement in profitability is in large part a consequence of our better understanding of how to optimize, leverage, and distribute shipping subsidies to maximize sales and conversion rates. Going forward we will continue to make adjustments to our shipping subsidies and prices as we see fit in order to fully achieve this goal.
Let's move down the P&L starting with gross billings. We delivered the 19th consecutive quarter of consolidated gross billings growth above 60% year on year on an FX neutral basis. The robust growth we delivered during the quarter was driven in part by improved monetization on our marketplaces as well as continued pace of execution in our off platform revenue streams particularly in Payments.
On a by country basis, gross billings delivered positive results throughout the most important regions Mexico accelerated to 88% year-on-year, Argentina to 93%, and Brazil reached 60% year-on-year growth. Moving down the P&L, net revenues also continue to grow at a healthy clip with an FX neutral growth rate of 62% year-on-year. Gross profit remained stable versus last year ascending to $205 million representing 48% of revenues during the quarter.
Warehousing and shipping costs net realizable value discounts on MPOS devices and increasing costs of deploying our infrastructure on public cloud explain the gross margin compression over last year. We have included a detailed breakdown of these and also of the OpEx margin evolution I am about to cover in the slides that accompany this presentation.
As reported, operating expenses ascended to $206 million or 48% of revenues versus 75% of revenues last year due to the Venezuelan deconsolidation charges. If we exclude the cost of deconsolidation, operating expenses would have been $182.2 million or 50.9% of net revenues the prior year resulting in a year-on-year OpEx scale of about 285 basis points. The main drivers of this OpEx scale during the fourth quarter of 2018 can mainly be attributed to sales and marketing product development and G&A.
For comparative purposes, if we exclude the Venezuelan deconsolidation, OpEx as a percentage of gross billings was 38.3% this quarter versus 41.7% the same quarter a year ago, a 335 basis point leverage in operational expenses. As a result, operating losses contracted by 98.8% versus last quarter despite higher shipping discounts on a sequential basis as we better optimized the availability of our shipping program.
The low operating income we saw $16.4 million in financial expenses attributed for the most part to interest accrual on the new convertible note we issued last quarter due 2028 and also working capital facilities we took out in Argentina, Uruguay and Chile. Interest income increased by 61% year-on-year to $14.3 million mainly attributable to the stability of the Argentine peso and rising interest rates in that country, increased invested volume in Brazil as well as the proceeds of the convertible note issued in August 2018 which also generated more investment returns.
Our ForEx line was negative $4 million attributed for the most part as a result of the $4.7 million loss from the U.S. dollar revaluation over Argentine peso net asset position in Argentina which was partially offset by a $0.9 million gain arising from the appreciation of the Mexican peso over our U.S. dollar net liability position in Mexico. As a result of all this, net loss as reported for the fourth quarter was also lower versus the previous quarter at $2.3 million resulting in a basic net loss per share of $0.05.
That concludes our review of the fourth quarter of 2018. I'd like to end the call by saying that we remain as confident as ever of the improving value proposition we are offering our users across the region. With this validation of our product end market fit, execution will be as always our main focus going forward. We must remain laser focused on leveraging the scalable platform businesses we've built in retail, marketing, logistics and fintech to differentiate ourselves in an ever more competitive market as we push forward with the democratization of commerce and money throughout Latin America. Thank you.
And with that, we can take your questions now. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Mike Olson from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Hey good afternoon. You reported kind of an interesting set of metrics through Q4 with accelerating revenue growth. Profitability was better, but then decelerating GMV growth and it seems like some or all this impact on GMV was self-inflicted, but just going forward should we expect GMV and revenue growth to kind of more closely aligned with each other or continue to diverge? And then a second question I had is just on the competitive environment there's obviously been some media chatter in the past couple of months of some larger e-commerce players potentially getting more aggressive in Brazil, I'm just wondering if you see anything on your end? Thanks. Hi Mike. So there is a balancing act between growth and profitability and that's the balancing act that we've been carrying out throughout the back half of last year after the changes in our pricing structure and shipping in Brazil. And part of that is just the underlying business nature of finding the right level of incentives to find the right equilibrium between growth and profitability. The other piece is just an accounting manner that sense a significant portion of our shipping subsidies flow through the P&L as contra revenue as we optimize those, it's natural to see an acceleration in net revenues.
I think going forward, certainly the comps will get progressively easier as we move into 2019 on the GMV front and that's probably the key trajectory we're comfortable commenting on in terms of forward-looking statements. Competitively, I think we've always said we look at all our competitors. We try to understand what others are doing. Brazil has always been a very competitive market. We continue to deliver above market growth this quarter. If you look at the two-year stock I would say significantly above market growth to account for the tough comp from last year.
I think there are quarters where certain smaller players potentially grow more than us. But if we look over longer terms, our trend in terms of market share has been very solid and continues to be encouraging and we need to continue focusing on our users. We need to continue building out our logistics network, rolling out our ecosystem of Payments and that will give us what we believe is the most robust platform play to continue to grow both our retailing and fintech initiatives for the long run. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Edward Yruma from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Hi, good afternoon guys. A couple of quick questions on the proprietary logistics network. Obviously you're seeing some strong results to date. Help us understand the capacity outlook and how much slack do you have in as usage of this grows and how should we think about your build out capabilities as we think about '19? Thank you. Great. So I think the way that we're approaching future be that in long-term capacity is by ensuring that this network that we're building has multiple sources of delivery capacity whether that be first mile, last mile, long-haul, whatever. So it's a combination of large established carriers of smaller regional carriers and even in more localized small and midsize businesses that can do deliveries for us as well as independent truck drivers. And we're trying to stitch this all together through our technology, so that that ensures that we are able to scale that logistic demand that we will have from multiple sources.
So it's not unlike what we're seeing being built by certain large e-commerce players in the U.S. where the volume is not entirely done by the large scale carriers, but it's a combination of multiple sources. So, so far we haven't really hit capacity constraints and I think we continue to build out these different sources of future delivery capacity so as to avoid capacity constraints. This is one of the reasons we've always felt that we believe that building out the logistics network off balance sheet through 3PL is what makes the most sense, is it allows us to scale quickly and guarantees long term capacity. Got it. And one other follow up off if I may. It seems like the MPOS market is getting increasingly competitive. I guess how do you think about pricing on the devices and kind of the current competitive environment and how that may change adoption option rate? Thank you. Hi Edwards, this is Osvaldo, hello. It is getting more competitive, but so far most of the competition we're seeing in Brazil has been related to device prices. We have been able to limit the discount we gave recently and continue to grow the number of devices we are selling. And we have not yet seen competition in the upfront, what the fee the fees charged to the merchants we have seen so far we are very confident and we'll be able to continue delivering growth in this business in Brazil. Great, thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Irma Sgarz from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Yes, hi good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Firstly, I think if I looked at the numbers correctly the confirmed user growth actually on the margin accelerated a little bit. So I was wondering if you could impressively consistent growth over the last decade or so and with growth rates in the mid 20s. So I wanted to just understand the margin, like what are you seeing and what are the big sources of growth whether it's geographies or customer cohorts?
And then the second question, just in terms of the as a growth that you've seen on the one hand side it seems to be two different trends between GMV growth on the one hand side being really driven by the ASP or the average ticket whereas in TPV we see some different trends where it's really mostly the number of transactions or entirely the number of transactions that's been growing - that's been driving the growth. So if you could just sort of parse out specifically on the TPV front what we should be expecting going forward and whether that's just basically a reflection of the multiple initiatives that you have specifically in the off platform space? Thank you. Hi Irma. So let me start with the marketplace and Payments units versus volume question. So on the marketplace as you know we've launched a series of initiatives recently that have affected the units sold of low ticket items, we've introduced a flat fee and we've also capped the possibility to sell very cheap items on the website, so as to weed out a lot of the stuff that really wasn't worth being sold on the platform and that's generated an increase in average tickets and a significant deceleration entirely focused on these very low average selling price units on the marketplace. So that's the explanation for Marketplace.
On Payments I would say, on Payments it's a very different story as your question I think posed market payments right now has multiple use cases that are being attacked both online to offline and also online with very different average ticket prices, something like a cell phone top up, obviously will have a lower ASP than in store QR, utility and service Payments will have high ASPs, and so in Payments I think growth should be robust on both fronts and the number of transactions we process as we go after more and more use cases, both offline, through our wallet and QR initiatives and MPOS and also online as we continue to grow the merchant service business.
So I think they have underlying growth trends that are very different and that's why I think in Payments you can see both, TPB and TBN [ph] growing very nicely and in marketplace we've seen a deceleration in units sold. In terms of user growth, although there is an acceleration in confirmed registered users, I think really what we've seen is buyers, it's a metric that I would say in the quarter is not necessarily one that we are particularly pleased with and I think there's a lot of focus on re-accelerating buyer and new buyer growth as we also disclose.
Obviously, we're still in the early stages of the Internet. There are still millions and millions of users who don't use our services and who we continue to focus on attracting and bringing on to the marketplace. So I think we should continue to see solid growth from new users, but also more importantly with the large existing base of users we have and whose engagement has continued to trend positively when we look at GMV per user or orders per user that should also be a significant driver of growth just the higher engagement of existing users. Great, thanks very much. Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Ford from Bank of America. Your line is open. Thank you and good evening everybody. Pedro, you haven't spoken about merchant loans in a while. Now that you're recalibrating, could you talk a little bit about your comfort levels in terms of pricing and sizing risk across different risk cohorts and how you see that business scaling both on and offline? Yes, so we took a pause in the middle of last year as we were allowing the models to get better and recalibrate some of the loan loss provisions. What we've seen is a reacceleration in originations because we've also seen improvements in loan loss provisions and the margin and profitability profits from the credit books have improved.
And so, I continue to think that we're managing in the right way which is when we're comfortable with the loan loss provisions and the margins that we're getting out of the credit business we will step on the gas a little bit more and when for whatever reason we're a little bit more skittish we will slow down originations, so prudent management of that. The opportunity continues to be extremely large, and I think over time continuing in this cautious manner, we should see the size of the book and the amount we originate continue to grow into the foreseeable future. This is a business that we continue to be very, very encouraged and excited about. And your deployments of capital so far, they've been across wide spectrums of riskiness or have you, are you going gradually incrementally into cohorts that are incrementally more risky? So I think, again this is so early stage that it's not just about growth from riskier cohorts. As our fintech ecosystem grows we begin to have more and more channels of customer acquisition that we can cross-sell the loan portfolio. So it's not that we're necessarily moving only into riskier cohorts on the marketplace, we're now extending loans to MPOS users, eventually we can move into Yelp and wallet users, QR in-store users. So there is still plenty, plenty of room to grow the loan book within user cohorts that are still attractive and who we feel comfortable managing the risk line and then there's also geographical growth. Of course, thank you very much. Thank you. Our next question comes from James Friedman from Susquehanna. Your line is open. Hi it's Jamie at Susquehanna. Thanks for taking my questions. Great results here. Pedro, I was just going ask a couple on the Payments and then one on the marketplace, so I want talk about on the dynamic between off-platform and on-platform TPV. It looked like it was above $7 billion on the off-platform. I guess when can we anticipate off-platform potentially eclipsing on-platform? And I know you don’t like to make before projections, but is that too specific a question, just what are some of the dynamics there as off-platform gets so much traction now? Pardon me speaker, please take yourself off mute. Yes, sorry about that. I'll answer now with the mute button turned off. So the growth opportunity in off-platform is obviously significantly larger than on-platform. To your question, last quarter was the first quarter that in terms of transactions we've already begun to see in TPN for the first time in our history off-platform away from the marketplace being larger than on-marketplace. And when we look at growth venues obviously on-platform we'll continue to grow driven by the growth of our marketplace business. When we look at everything we're doing off-platform, there are significantly more markets that we're attacking and opportunity for growth.
So I think in the not too distant future we will see TPV also being larger off-platform than on-platform. And as we've always said we still aspire for that to be multiple times larger than on marketplace and we can see that with the divergent growth rates already between Payments and GMV and also if you were to look at off-platform and on-platform TPV, off-platform TPV is growing significantly faster. Got it and if I could just switch gears, thank you for that. So, where are we in the assets, light versus assets heavy journey on the logistics side, how should we be thinking about that, because your previous answer seemed like it was emphasizing asset light, but then we know, you've described the warehouse build-out strategy in North and South et cetera. Yes, it is in general like how should we be thinking about that process over time? Okay. So, I think, and this happens a lot in these industries that evolve. I'm not so sure how useful asset light or non asset light is becoming within retail if you look at the way e-commerce logistics are evolving. So when we look, when we talk about warehouses, if we talk about last mile, first mile, long-haul, airfreight, none of those vehicles, airplanes or warehouses are on our balance sheet and in that sense it's asset light. Now if you were to look at the level of operational control and operational design that we exert over those third party logistics operators it’s continuously increasing as we try to inject more and more efficiency in the operations, improve service levels and lower cost.
So obviously, we are way beyond, I would say waist deep in logistics capabilities within the company, hiring out logistics people and having significant oversight over the design and quality of our logistics network, but we don't necessarily own most of those assets for now. And I think for the short term we haven't signaled any change in that design. And as always longer term we will do what gets us the best results for our users in terms of if it makes sense moving those things away from OpEx to CapEx and bringing them on balance sheet. But I think that's more of a longer term decision. Right now we're focused on continuing to build out the logistics in the different countries, primarily by using 3PLs. Thanks for the color. Thank you. Our next question comes from Marcelo Santos from JP. Morgan. Your line is open. Hi, thanks for taking the question. So the first is Pedro, could you conceptually break down the profitability of your various business and I'm not asking for a specific number, but what is above LatAm and what kind of level, like you have the MPOS business, you have wallets business, you have the credits business. So how could we think about the components of the profitability right now? This is the first question.
And on the second question and more specific to the wallet, what is the plan to bring features like money indirectly from accounts, users being able to receive salaries to do bank transfers, what is the outlook for these kind of services to be incorporated into the wallet in several countries, because this could potentially make the wallet a competitor to more traditional banking services. Okay, so always remember that we don't want to unnecessarily handover competitive information and so therefore, I'll give you a general sense of how we think about the different businesses right now. But we don't disclose specific margin structures. So right now obviously our marketplace business is a business that is both one that we are investing aggressively behind in the short term, in terms of shipping subsidies, build out of the logistics.
And it's also a tremendous distribution platform for everything else we do. And so, we're running that one at a positive margin but a low margin. I think of that business longer term given the scalability it has simply from top line growth and OpEx scale it's a business that we firmly believe over the long term will deliver improving margins as it gains leverage.
And then with Payments it's a combination of things. The point business now that the installed base has gotten to a nice scale is the business that begins to deliver positive EBIT and should contribute more and more EBIT if there aren't significant changes to pricing or cost. Credit is also a business that we see as a generator of high margins that we can reinvest.
Obviously the wallet QR in in-store business are ones that we are investing aggressively in right now as we build out this alternative Payments network. So I would say for the foreseeable future we continue to be more in growth and investment mode, but all of these businesses are businesses that are at the right scale, obviously have leverage and margin gains that we will be able to deliver once we build out the scale size behind these businesses? With regards to the second point, with regards to the wallet and the money in salary kind of make process, I think there are, those are things that are straight on at the same time. But certainly, I think on the regulatory front where last year both in Argentina and Brazil it became legal to pay salaries into goodwill accounts. In the past it was not legal you have to pay through a bank account and so now that it's legal we need to make it easier to do fund transactions from a bank account. And that is already happening in Argentina and I think this is one country where we have the front end [ph] because now it's very, it's regulated by the Central Bank that it should be straightforward to transfer money from any bank account into a virtual account. It's starting to happen. Not all banks have promoted it right yet, but it is starting to happen because it is being regulated by the Central Bank.
We expect something similar to happen in Brazil and Mexico, but I will say we are several steps behind there, because still there's not a central system where you can do those transfers real time and online. Eventually, it is something that has happened in many other places, but it is not yet available in Latin America, but in the [indiscernible] you could be able to pull funds out of a bank account. This is something that hasn't mandated in Europe with Payments service directed too and it's something that has been in conversation in some countries, but it's not mandated in many countries in Latin America and yet, and that could be a big difference.
At the earnings and salary, the other thing that is starting to happen where we need to develop our product roadmap and wanting it to make it easier to pay salaries, because even if it was possible it wouldn't be as easier from our platform. The second one is to be able to pay supplier. It is starting to happen, but it's scalable yet, because originally our product is more soft as a product to collect funds as well as to pay out funds.
And in the meanwhile, what we have done is, create the asset monitoring functionality in Argentina and Brazil, so as to encourage users to keep money in the wallet, so that is more likely for them to make payments out of that wallet rather than withdrawing from a bank and then make payments. So it is totally on our roadmap this year and we expect to see much progress in several of the countries joining during the year. Perfect, thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Deepak Mathivanan from Barclays. Your line is open. Hi, this is Mario Lu on for Deepak. I have a couple of questions. On the Payments business, now that you see multiple cohorts on the consumer wallet and have four times more mobile users than last year, any user trends you can call out in terms of stickiness, usage, spending levels compared to traditional credit cards? And secondly, CRAIOS has increased shipping rates multiple times over the past few years. Can you just give us an update whether you expect to see any this year? Thanks. So, we'll get to the wallet. We are starting to see a cohort with a little more of dating, but keep in mind that only Argentina which was the first country where we launched in-store Payments, we launched that end of May last year. So we only have seen pretty much half a year of results. What we're seeing is increased use of multiple products so it's people who sometimes start by ramping up the mobile phone, they start paying utilities and then using QR code payment.
So we are seeing increase in the number of people use, have used and multiple use cases. And I think, we feel that the majority of growth is coming from new users that is because it's a new product and was started recently and we are growing 4x year-on-year. So when you look at all these numbers, the total number of use cases for each year is still probably flat and but it is mostly related to the growth number of users and even during the holiday we continued to receive more. In terms of CRAIOS, I think we do expect increases in price much more in line with what had occurred in other years, unlike last year where really a change in pricing was absolutely unforecast and we believe something that we really were not expecting. That's not what's going to happen this year. I think we have a good sense of what the increase will be. And as we continue to move volume away from CRAIOS and optimize our subsidies and free shipping initiatives. We don't even think that we necessarily we will have to pass the full cost of the price increase onto users, but only a portion of that. So this should be a fairly manageable price increase given all the conversations we've had. Great, it's very helpful. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Ravi Jain from HSBC. Your line is open. Hi, good afternoon. I have a couple of quick questions. One is on the selection on the product selection and how are you going to kind of broaden that out especially given the competitive environment in Brazil and perhaps in Mexico as well? Could you give us some color on maybe your thoughts and initiatives for consumer packaged goods or is it cross-border e-commerce. And the second question is on the Payments I mean the Mexican Central Bank is now pushing the banks to adopt their payment system Cody. Does that mean you need to accelerate the roll out of the asset management ecosystem in Mexico? Do you see Mexico as getting more attractive Payments country? Thank you. Let me start with the second one regarding Cody in Mexico. So I think that our first impression we took a look at it and we did not come out very impressed with the product, but so far the Bank of Mexico is mandating these for bank regulated institutions. At this point we are not a regulated institution yet, so we would not be able to participate in it. However, as I was saying we were not very encouraged about the resource in that the product we had in Argentina is significantly better that. So we are comfortable with sticking to our plan. Also it remains to be seen how willing are the banks to encourage these [indiscernible] networks because it would cannibalize their debit card fees. So we will continue with our plan to replicate what we're doing in Argentina. Great, and consumer packaged goods and cross-border trade, just to put in perspective first of all, I think combined those two marketplace lines still represent less than 5% of GMV between 3% and 5%. So glass half full is that there is significant room for product mix shift as we grow into those categories, but they're still small.
Most of our efforts over the last few quarters there have been around product, features that are tailored for those two different products, improving the logistics of international sales for sellers that are sourcing from the U.S. or from China in our cross-border offerings and more recently allowing sellers to send bulk inventory that we manage from them in our fulfillment centers for cross border trade and in CPG stocking up on skews on SKU count.
I think we've crossed the 5000 SKU count. The next objective is to get to roughly 10,000 SKUs but that also shows that it's relatively early on in our CPG efforts and this year will be an important year for us as we continue to focus on making both those business a more meaningful overall portion of our GMV, and I think both really have a lot of upside potential for us. Thank you. That's helpful. Thank you. Our next question comes from Marvin Fong from BTIG. Your line is open. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one on I was very impressed with the QR Payments reaching 40% of digital wallet TPV in Argentina. I'm curious on your thoughts on what's driven that rapid rate of adoption and if you think Brazil might follow a similar trajectory or is there something structural about the countries that might have a different adoption rate? And then just as a follow up, could you disclose what the Payments revenue in the quarter was? Thank you. Yes, let me start with a, start and let the financial question to Pedro. And we are very excited with our [indiscernible] of QR code payments in Argentina. We have been able to bring in many large merchants such as McDonald's, Burger King, the major gas stations and coffee shops in the country and they have been a huge drive to adopt QR code payments and that has been a huge driver of growth for monthly active payers. And I'd say that the 40% after all from top up is one of the most popular use cases in the countries.
Now I think we are still in the early days. Integrations are a little more complex in Brazil because you need to integrate with the ERP with point-of-sale using machine and that's why it will take us a little bit longer to bring in the larger merchants. We have started with Shell with the major gas stations, but it's still very early days and we cannot comment on numbers. So we expect to have more information in the coming quarters. Thank you. Our next question comes from Richard Cathcart from Bradesco. Your line is open. Hi. Good evening. Just a quick question on the on the proprietary shipping in Brazil. I think you mentioned that 17% of GMV was going for in Brazil and I think a pretty big increase from where we were previously. So a couple of questions on that, first of all kind of are you beginning to see kind of better buy in from the sellers, are they more enthusiastic about the advantages of working through the proprietary shipping solution? And then the second question just on cost, given that you're now a 17% is beginning to scale are you beginning to see some improvements in unit costs of products that are being shipped through the propriety solutions? Thanks. Okay. So let me start with the second piece which is the one around unit economics. The first thing is that, I think we've always said that our primary focus is on building out the logistics network first and ensuring that we have a network that allows us to deliver best-in-class delivery time or at least competitive with what anyone else might build because that's really the competitive advantage that we need to make sure that we don't hand over to someone else, and then eventually over time with scale and as the network gets more complex driving down unit costs would be something we could be able to do.
So having said that, what we see now is from an overall network perspective, items that are fulfilled by us obviously do have a lower cost because they eliminate first mile altogether. Our cross-docking efforts don't necessarily lower costs. They do allow for a better service on many routes and give us greater control over the screen experience. Remember that when you look at our dropship network and Piraeus [ph] they are by far the largest player in Brazil and therefore are cost competitive given their scale and size. So yes, fulfillment is cheaper, cross docking is not. We are fairly confident that over time once we're able to build out the full network with its scale and ability to determine who we send volume to driving down unit costs will be something that we'll be able to achieve.
And then in terms of sellers, I would say it's still early. Obviously conversions are better when we fulfill the items because we give it preference in search ranking orders and we drive greater volume to those listings because they have a better user experience, but I think before we can give you feedback on overall sort of what seller feedback is on that we need more data and more time. Net Promoter Scores on items that go through more [indiscernible] and that are fulfilled are better than those that don't and that's something that over time should continue to improve. Thanks very much. Thank you. Our next question comes from Kunal Madhukar from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Hi thanks for taking my question. With regard to a certain multi-national e-commerce provider that just about stepped up investment in Brazil, how much of the… Can you try to speak a little bit louder, we can barely hear you? I'm sorry, is this better. Yes. Better. Okay great. With regard to the certain multinational e-commerce that just entered Brazil or just stepped up investment in Brazil, in terms their focus markets, the markets that they're targeting with like and what have you, how much of your GMV is in those markets, the upper income demographic kind of lives in those areas? Sorry, we're having a little bit of trouble getting, it somewhat cut off. Can you run that by us again? Sure. So for the e-commerce provider that just stepped up investment in Brazil, in terms of the footprint that they're targeting, the active footprint that they're targeting, how much of the GMV or retail sales in Brazil is in those areas, and how much has been the upper income demographic, what proportion of Brazil's upper income demographic lives in those areas? So I don't want to comment on potentially what competitors are targeting, because I might misspeak regarding their strategy. I think one of the attractive things about Brazil and e-commerce and one of the reasons we think it's such a relevant market going forward is that it's a market where we've seen more than in any of the other markets in the region, e-commerce permeate beyond the higher income demographic portions of the population. Consequently Brazil does have the highest penetration of e-commerce as a percentage of overall retail.
So I think the winning proposition in Brazil is not if you try to focus only on high income individuals, it's a market where we should have much greater e-commerce penetration as smartphones grow significantly their installed base and most Brazilians will be in or already are being equipped with a combination of a smartphone and decent broadband connectivity. I think that's what we remain focused on and should give us tailwinds and growth from that secular trend for lots of quarters going forward. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Gustavo Oliveira from UBS. Your line is open. Hi Pedro. Thank you for taking my question. I want to understand at the beginning of the call you mentioned that GMV in Brazil decelerated perhaps by self-inflicted adjustments. You made an indent in the platform, but when you look forward, what do you think matters most? It seems to me that you're talking about the success you're having and the logistics build-out, you're getting efficiency and so on. Does it allowed you to remove some of your shipping subsidies to invest in other levers of your platform such as credit to consumers and to sellers or investments in the Official Stores. Well, I know there is no silver bullet, but how do you reallocate your resources in 2019-2020 versus from your allocation 2017-2018 which was primarily focused on shipping subsidies and logistics? Hi Gustavo. So a few from that. First of all, a lot of the reallocation is actually within the shipping subsidies. So I think we're moving from subsidizing very low ticket items that had challenging unit economics for us and they were right for that moment we were generating a vibrancy on the platform. Users were associating our brand with free or cheap shipping. But I think from a P&L perspective it was challenging because the cost of shipping an item obviously doesn't decrease linearly as the ASP goes down. So most of the capital reallocation is actually within the shipping program where we now are freeing up more subsidies for higher ticket items for routes that we had shut down like the north and northeast and we could more intelligently now start offering subsidies to start targeting those consumers as well.
We do look at our P&L as a whole, so insofar as we're freeing up some profit that might help us reinvest it across other business lines, but I would say in general we are in full out investment mode. When you look at our revenue number and our projected revenue number and the fact that we continue to target a profitable, but relatively low margin profile for 2019, I think that gives you a sense of how aggressively we're investing across the board. And we feel comfortable with that level of investment to help us carry out the strategic plan we have. So we're investing everywhere we think it makes sense to invest and we're optimizing how we allocate the shipping subsidies to just make it more intelligent. Very clear. Thank you. Thank you. And that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today's conference. I'd now like to turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks. Great. So thank you everyone for the questions. I think those were lots of questions and good questions. I hope we've given you a clear answer. I think the answer around Payments s revenue got lost along the way. We'll make sure to reach out to give you the number. Thank you and we look forward to updating you on Q1 which is the beginning of 2019 in a year where we have lots of things in store, so thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect.

Finally, I would like to remind you that during the course of this conference call we may discuss some non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures can be found in our first quarter 2019 earnings press release available on our Investor Relations website.
Now, let me turn the call over to Pedro. Thanks Fede [ph]. Let me kick off this earnings call by stating that we are encouraged by entering this New Year with continued momentum in our business and are seeing our strategy delivering on multiple fronts in a sustainable manner.
Case in point some of the key metrics for the quarter, net revenue that accelerated for the fourth consecutive quarter on an FX neutral basis to 93% growth year-on-year as our payments business continues to grow rapidly while we also have become more efficient in marketplace shipping spent.
Operating income that was positive once again a $10.1 million and positive net income after five quarters of loss giving us confidence in our ability to dial up or down the profit levels of our P&L as we see fit.
We continue to execute against the focus and strategic roadmap intended to capitalize on the secular trends of e-commerce and Fintech in the region that will allow us to extend our market leadership. We are transforming from a pure third-party marketplace building to building the leading e-commerce ecosystem and digital financial services platform in Latin America.
In the process we are redefining our relationship with our customers increasing our touch points with transactions to logistics and financial service offerings, strengthening technology platforms and in doing all this increasing our addressable market as we are able to serve our users in a more expansive manner than in the past.
So, let me begin our strategic progress report for the quarter with our Fintech business this time, a growing area of focus for organization. MercadoPago has kicked off 2019 on a very strong note.
During the first quarter of the year total payment volume reached $5.6 billion, a growth of 83% year-on-year on an FX neutral basis. As we increasingly focus our efforts on expanding our online and off-line payment solutions in the markets where we are currently in and expanding the financial services we offer our merchants away from MercadoLibre's marketplaces, off-marketplace total payment volume already explained a 95% of the incremental payment volume during the quarter.
Off-marketplace total payment volume reach $2.5 billion and continue to gain incremental share from total payment volume reaching 45% of total this quarter versus less than a third only a year ago. In line with that, in Argentina where we deploy our most complete payment ecosystem as of date off marketplace total payment volume represented more than half of TPB for the first time ever.
Also during the first quarter of 2019 total payment transactions in number not in volume of the off marketplace segment on a consolidated basis represented over 60% of all payment transactions growing for the sixth consecutive quarter about 100% year-on-year and accelerating to 251% year-over-year.
These aforementioned off marketplace data points that I have just called out give us increasing confidence that we are making meaningful inroads in growing and stealing her payments business well beyond our e-commerce marketplace and look to replicate the success we see in Argentina throughout other markets.
Within that off marketplace segment we continue to be very encouraged with the results of our mobile POS business. As it is increasingly becoming a key driver of incremental off marketplace payment volume, a strong topline generator and perhaps most importantly a key distribution tool for our others Fintech offerings.
The installed base of MPOS devices in our main countries keeps growing at a steady clip. A testament to this is the fact that payment transactions from MPOS devices alone already account for almost half of the off-platform payment transactions.
In terms of MPOS payment volume, it surpassed the $1 billion mark for the first time during the first quarter growing on a consolidated basis a solid 171% year-on-year on an FX neutral basis and an even stronger 260% year-on-year in U.S. dollars. This growth of our MPOS business delivery during the quarter was driven for the most part by solid performances in Brazil and Argentina.
The build out of our mobile wallet two-sided network also continues to scale and grow in size and frequency of use. During the quarter we’ve reached an important milestone as we crossed the 3 million active payer mark in a single quarter on our wallet, while active collectors accelerated to 420% year-on-year to over $0.5 million.
Additionally, wallet total payment volume continues to grow triple digits both on an FX neutral and in U.S. dollars. While it also continues to gain share from off-platform total payment volume reaching almost 20% on a consolidated basis, a gain of 400 basis points versus a year ago. Continuing mobile wallet initiatives Argentina was also highlight as we begin to observe the powerful synergies present in our O-to-O payments ecosystem.
During the quarter Argentina QR in-store payment share grew 40 percentage points versus last year coming to represent 43% of all wallet total payment volume. It's also important to highlight that QR in-store payments in Argentina are delivering meaningful customer satisfaction as when we measure net promoter scores, we observed a significant gap versus other existing offerings.
Additionally, we continue to see both the shift in funding from credit or debit cards to account money as add usage cases and ubiquity of use, as well as growth and invested amounts in our asset management products that already surpassed 50% of total available account money in Argentina.
We look forward to launching this full stack of O-to-O solutions in Brazil and Mexico during the second half of the year. Our merchant services business has also delivered encouraging results as this quarter was the second consecutive quarter of acceleration, growing 75% on an FX neutral basis across all sites.
We also pleased with the results on the credits front. In Brazil optimizations to collections and credit scoring capabilities have positively impacted merchant default rates and consequently have accelerated the pace of originations in number and nominal amount during the quarter.
In line with that, I am also pleased to report that in Mexico, merchant credit are tracking extremely well with positive adoption and the lowest default rates of any of the markets that we offer the product.
Finally, we also began offering our credit solution to our POS users in Mexico which we believe should strengthen our value proposition in that country given how underserved this merchant base is when it comes to access to credit.
It is also important to highlight that our consumer credit business in Argentina and Brazil continues to fire on all cylinders as originations are up Q-on-Q by a factor of almost 1.2 times.
Our vision is that access to innovative technology must be an engine of financial inclusion and opportunity throughout Latin America and we remain deeply committed to advancing on that goal.
The region is rapidly accelerating towards digital payments and we know that we have a huge opportunity ahead of us to make a real difference to the constituencies we serve across the region.
Let’s move on to some of the highlights in our logistics business, a key enabler of greater transactionality, engagement and conversion on our marketplaces. I'm pleased to report that we continue to improve and have greater control over user experience as we shift more volume to MercadoEnvios.
Penetration of our shipping solution on a consolidated basis grew 10 percentage points year-on-year to 81% of all items sold. In line with that, we are also making progress in shifting volume to our managed network.
On a consolidated basis cross-docking efforts reach 17 penetration versus 7% last year while drop shipping decreased to 76% and the managed network reached almost one-fourth of all items shipped.
During the quarter Argentina was a highlight as MercadoEnvios penetration grew by 19 percentage points year-on-year to 56% of items sold allowing for more widespread adoption of free shipping in that country that is driving strong marketplace growth there.
We are also enthused by the results of our Flex solution, but first let remind you what that is. Flex is a MELI proprietary technology that is ideally suited for local or intercity deliveries where our technology overlay enables existing logistic partners that currently work with our merchants to scan upload and deliver packages through our MercadoEnvios network.
Through this solution we are able to not only reduce our reliance on traditional carriers but also drive penetration of Envios higher while also taking care of last mile in a much more efficient fashion, which is generally the more complicated part of getting goods from a merchant to a buyer’s doorstep.
Since its launch in late 2018 MELI flex shipping solution has already reached 5% of all items shipped representing over 50% of the shipments within the city of [Indiscernible]. The shipments are not only meaningfully cheaper than drop shipping or cross-docking, but they also have better lead times with over 90% of deliveries occurring same day or next day which is resulting in more sales and better conversions for those merchants who adopt the product.
We look forward to continuing to deploy flex in several other large cities where we operate throughout the region during the remainder of this year. On the fulfillment by MercadoLibre front penetration continues to scale well in Mexico gaining five percentage points of adoption sequentially and reaching 20% of all items shipped.
While in Brazil scaling up has lag somewhat remaining flat quarter-on-quarter as we continue to build out products and processes to scale it. However, in Brazil cross-docking does continue to grow steadily as it reached 15% of items versus only 5% last year.
The operational metrics on our managed network are also encouraging. On a consolidated basis average lead times improved by 40% on a year-on-year basis and median lead times improved by almost 25% versus last year. Also shipments arriving in less than two days reached almost half of all MercadoEnvios deliveries on consolidated regional basis. We’ve also made advances in growing the size of our managed network as the build out of fulfillment capacity continues in full swing.
During the quarter, we opened one fulfillment center in Sao Paulo with 200,000 units storage capacity, a second fulfillment center in Sao Paulo with 350,000 units storage capacity and a cross-docking center also in the city of Sao Paulo with the processing capacity of 60,000 orders per day.
Now, let's move to some of the highlights in the marketplace business. Despite increasingly tougher comps and continued optimizations in our shipping subsidies, the marketplace business continues to show great resiliency.
Gross merchandise volume reached $3.1 billion on an FX neutral basis, consolidated GMV reaccelerated to 27% year-on-year growth driven by solid execution in Argentina and steady performance in Mexico.
Argentine GMV on an FX neutral basis accelerated to 70% year-on-year and Mexico maintain momentum at 48% year-on-year growth despite the toughest comp of the year where it grew 70% in Q1 of 2018.
The solid performances in Argentina and Mexico were partially offset on a GMV basis by Brazil which grew 18% on an FX neutral basis. However average two-year local currency growth for the first quarter in Brazil remained at around 44% indicating that part of the slowdown should be attributed to the very tough comps from the prior year.
Additionally, the deceleration in Brazil is also explained by the implementation of free listing caps resulting in a reduction of free GMV from 11% during the first quarter of 2018 to only 5% of GMV this quarter.
It is also important to note in Brazil that we exited the quarter at a higher growth rate than we entered in. We continue to focus on category expansion as a catalyst for growth of our marketplace businesses.
During the quarter we have expanded and improved our supermarket experience in Mexico with already more than 18,500 [ph] consumer packaged good SKUs available on our site.
Although still at an early stage we observed that basket size is also approximately 20% higher on orders that have supermarket items in Mexico, a clear indicator that the key vertical to increase purchase frequency on the site is trending in the right direction.
In line with that we’ve also improve the user experience in our apparel vertical by enhancing discovery engines further facilitating returns and strengthening our intellectual property program which has been instrumental in incorporating established brands that improve assortment and bring brand equity to our marketplaces.
As a consequence of apparel is the fastest growing category growing at 79% year-on-year on an FX neutral basis consolidated. Not only do we continue to expand categories but we also deepening product selection and assortment.
Listings available on the platform a measure of depth of inventory surpassed the 200 million mark for the first time. This quarter also marks the ninth consecutive quarter of growth in this important KPI at a rate higher than 50% over the prior year.
We also continue to make strides on our shift towards a mobile first platform. During the first quarter of the year mobile app, GMV represented almost 50% of gross merchandise volume, a 10 percentage point improvement versus a year ago while 81% of all new registered users were also coming from mobile devices.
If we consider wet mobile into this mix, GMV coming from mobile experiences is 63% of total gross merchandise volume. Finally, we made meaningful progress in offering more robust search and discovery experiences to our buyers through our catalog initiative.
During the quarter catalog gross merchandise volume reached 29%, 38%, 25% of GMV in Brazil and Argentina and Mexico respectively presenting an improvement in the mid to low teens year-on-year for these markets.
This is an important initiative since cataloging allows us to understand better the inventory we carry enables us to better understand what products to show our buyers and consequently allows us to highlight the second to none price and selection we offered to our users in the region.
As we grow the percentage of gross merchandise volume that is catalog, our buyers will be able to find the products they are looking for more quickly and this should result in higher conversion rates.
Before I move on to financials, let me give you an update on the recent secondary offering we perform during the first quarter 2019 where we finalize a successful raise of $2 billion from both financial investors as well as a strategic investor PayPal.
This capital rate gives us greater balance sheet flexibility over the long run and we expect to use the capital primarily to fund the growth of our payment initiatives build out our logistics capacity and drive the adoption of the services as well as for general corporate purposes.
As we move forward in the year we will outline in greater detail how our pace of investment will pick with specific callouts of areas where we are increasing spending levels. We maintain long-term opportunities such as payments and logistics as priorities with potential for margin contraction in the short term depending on the return windows of the investments that we carry out.
It's also important to highlight that we are very pleased that PayPal was a strategic investor in the transaction. The latter, we believe not only validates the joint vision we share in terms of business and purpose to digitalize the economy and leverage technology to generate financial inclusion, but also to offer compelling financial solutions to those who are unserved or underserved by traditional financial institutions.
The trust that has been built over the years with PayPal in the history we have been formally interacting gives us confidence that we will be able to find areas that will generate synergies with each other as we move forward into the future.
In this regard, our teams are working on determining commercial agreements that can be put in place that complements PayPal’s global merchant based data, products and technology with a little know-how and distribution capabilities.
Let me now move on to financials. During the quarter we continue taking the necessary steps to recalibrate our P&L and rebalance our financial model to deliver sustainable growth.
From a topline perspective gross billings ascended to $549 million, the 20th consecutive quarter of gross billings growth about 60% on an FX neutral basis driven by improved monetization on our marketplaces and continued successful execution on our payments business particularly on our financing business and off-platform revenue streams through merchant services and POS.
On an FX neutral basis our main countries also delivered solid performance from a gross billings perspective on an FX neutral basis. Mexico maintained momentum growing a 113.5%, Argentine accelerated to a 108.2%, and Brazil sustained solid percentage growth of 50% reaching 50.9 year-on-year.
Consolidated net revenue came in strong as well, reaching $473.8 million and accelerating to 93% year-on-year in FX neutral basis as we optimize shipping and loyalty program subsidies.
Gross profit ascended to $237 million during the quarter representing 50% of net revenues versus 50.7% last year. Shipping carrier and operating cost explain most part of the gross margin compression over the prior year.
We've included a detailed breakdown of these and also other OpEx margin evolution in the cover slide that accompany this presentation, as reported operating expenses grew to $226.9 million or 47.9% of revenues versus 59.9% during the first quarter 2018.
Main drivers of OpEx leverage this quarter were attributed to scaling, marketing given increasing in efficiencies on buyer protection payouts lower loan loss provisions from our client portfolio, as well as leverage in salaries and wages.
As a result operating profit for the first quarter of 2019 ascended to $10.1 million, an increase of $11 million versus last quarter. The low operating income we saw $15.6 million in financial expenses attributed for the most part to financial interest related to the convertible notes due in 2028.
Interest income increased by 166% year-on-year to $24.4 million mainly attributable to a higher flow in Argentina and Brazil, as well as the proceeds from the convertible note issued in August of last year.
Our ForEx line was negative $3.7 million mainly do to the U.S. dollar revaluation over Argentine peso net position in Argentina. As a result of all this, net income ascended to $11.9 million, an increase of $14.2 million versus last quarter resulting in basic net income per share of $0.13.
That wraps up our strategic report. We started the first quarter of 2019 on firm footing and although we are very encouraged by the performance of our business and the opportunities that lie ahead of us, we still have plenty of work to do in order to deliver on our product roadmap and consolidate our leadership position.
We have accelerated our revenue growth and earnings growth with positive cash flow while we continue building superior experiences for our users. The sustain momentum we see in the business gives us confidence to continue investing behind high potential areas such as Fintech and Logistics. We are very pleased with our progress and look forward to keeping you updated next quarter as we continue to democratize commerce and money throughout America.
With that let me turn it back to the operator for your questions. Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan from Barclays Hi. Congrats on the great quarter. This is Mario Lu on for Deepak. from the queue simply press the pound key again if you have a question or comment at this time please press star then one or your telephone keypad. Our first question or comment comes from the line of Deepak methadone from Barclays. Your line is open. Congrats on a great quarter. This is Mario is on for Deepak. So we noticed that you currently started charging low value items shipping surcharges in Argentina similar to the program you have in Brazil. So should we expect to see meaningful revenue benefits from this? Are lower ASP items, our large portion of free shipping in Argentina? Thanks. Hi. The mix of low ASP and high ASP is fairly consistent. What you need to bear in mind is that the actual amount we are charging on low ASP items in Argentina is materially lower than Brazil. So from the point of view of how many items this will impact and therefore both the revenue increase, but the slowdown in units we expect it to be less impactful than Brazil was. Got it. It’s Helpful. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Ford from Bank of America. Your line is open. Hey. Thank you and good evening everybody and congrats on the quarter as well. I was very impressed with the increase in the contribution margin in Brazil, why is it more than doubled? And then I was wondering if you could maybe break it down in terms of the contributors there, please? Okay. So just to make sure we're looking at the same thing. The improved contribution margin in Brazil is the question, right? Yes, Pedro. It’s close to 26% and about 11% last year. Sorry. I'm not looking at Brazil, I’m looking at it at the wrong line. But there's -- nevertheless there's a big improvement. Now I was just wondering what the factors were behind that? So we just want to make sure because some of us here thought it was a decrease, so if you would add to that. So, definitely there are optimizations in shipping costs both at the contra rev level, but also at the actual cost level. There are slightly about 400 basis points of improvement sequentially and about a 1000 year-on-year in more efficient marketing spending. Those are really the two biggest drivers. Now there's a big numbers. And then Pedro, could you touch a little bit on maybe some of the wallet functionality across your major markets. You've mentioned that you will launch a full stack of O-to-O solutions in the second half. But I was wondering if you could tell us a little bit of what you have now in the major economies and how you see that which you need I guess in terms of central bank approvals and functionality to go life? Yes. Great question. Thanks. So I would say that Argentina is really the country where the O-to-O efforts have been rolled out in a set of both actual life product functionalities, but equally important enough business development and onboarding of the merchant side of the network whether that be what we call single player cases, so utility payments, transportation agreements. So large agreements with anchor use cases and also a multiplicity of smaller merchants that start accepting the QR code, so Argentina that's a fairly robust although still early stage ecosystem and hence we're seeing the results we're seeing in Argentina.
Brazil although most of the functionalities are like product wise, there are still improvements to be made in terms of the ability to fund wallets and more importantly we are not as far along in the business development and rollout of the merchant side of that network Yes. So we're going to begin to aggressively start pursuing the commercial efforts in Brazil during the ongoing quarter, in terms of building the merchant side of the network. And Mexico I would say is the third phase where there are still features to be rolled out and we're not yet -- have not yet begun to aggressively roll out merchant adoption and that also starts to pick up during this quarter. That's very helpful. Thank you and again congratulations. Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Ravi Jain from HSBC. Your line is open. I have a couple of quick questions. So, first on the Brazil GMV, are you happy with the 18% growth in this quarter. Of course we understand that the comp was tough, but on the quarter over quarter it has slowed down. And we also see the shipping subsidy has come down. So is there space to increase the shipping subsidy and reactivate that business in Brazil. What are your thoughts on the Brazil GMV?
And the second question is on the payments business. We of course have seen a lot of aggressive most by competitors in the MPOS business. If the prepayment revenues come down materially over time how does that change your investment plan. I mean do you start using more cash on the balance sheet instead to invest in the payments business? Thanks. Great. So, I think the prepared remarks tried to convey clearly that we think that the headline Brazilian GMV growth number was probably the low point of the quarter, certainly not something that we are content with. As you mentioned, part of that is a consequence of the optimization around shipping. Bear in mind also that January and February of last year were the two highest growth months in a multi-year cycle. So there still is an element of very very tough comps. And then as March rolled around and especially the back end of March the comps get easier. And so we already exited the quarter at a better growth rate than that.
As we've revamped our shipping capabilities, I think there is now the intelligence in place to invest equal amounts in shipping but in a more efficient manner. And so that hopefully will be an incremental way to try to reignite growth in Brazil. And then obviously the flip side of the slowdown in the business was the positive contribution in Brazil. We just walked through Bob's question on marketing spend. So I think a combination of simply more efficient investing. Additionally, easier comps and potentially more investments on an absolute basis are the three levers with which we will try to reignite growth in Brazil. Regarding the Payments question, I’d say that we continue to have an aggressive growth plan for Brazil and middle markets going forward. I would say that over the last few weeks some of our competitors have started to win specific actions that even though have been more aggressive. When we look into the situation we don't feel that the segment of Michael merchant where we mostly operate. We don’t just see just a – we don’t anticipate a significant impact there and therefore we did not modify our prices.
Bear in mind that we settle our taxes in most cases in three plus zero. So if you [Indiscernible] merchants already very, very good and so far we haven’t notice the reduction in volume. Having said that, we will continue to monitor what our players do and we’ll look on pricing in order to remain competitive, if necessary. Thank you. That’s helpful. Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Marcelo Santos from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Hello. Thanks for taking the question. I wonder if you could discuss a little bit more on the opportunities on MercadoCredito, so that you start reaccelerating, already appeared in the balance sheet. So what are the main changes made and potential you see for the coming quarters, for the coming year in the various markets that you’re in? Okay, Marcelo. So, I think that in the last few quarters we have seen two changes. On the one hand we have the introduced consumer credit in Brazil which was before only available in Argentina and it has been growing very very nicely. And second on the merchant grade from what happened last year was that we had a peak in the first quarter and that was due to above rollout out in the first quarter and last year were the first time we offered a holder of the loan to get a second loan. And therefore we had a huge increase or a large increase in the number of credit.
As most credit are for 12 month, we have a second peak now in this first quarter and that is related to those first -- second loans expiring and being renewed. I think those are the two main drivers behind in Greek volumes in terms of credit. Great. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of James Friedman from Susquehanna. Your line is open. Hi. Thank you. It's Jamie it's as we had. Congratulations on the great numbers guys. Can you hear me okay? We can hear you. Yes. So I just want to ask a couple of things mostly on the payment side. So Pedro in terms of going at or approaching or above now in Argentina and across the company, the 50% threshold payments coming off platform, is that more of like mythical level or is there something really strategic about that that we should contemplate? That's sort of the first question. I'll discuss the second one. With regard to PayPal have you used the same language that they use which is commercialization. I was wondering is it too early to ask for some use cases of how you guys might work together or if that's too specific like is it is it fair to assume that it's going to be more on the merchant as opposed to the consumer side that you described in your need to commercialize the merchant side of Brazil with internalization or with QR codes? Anyway a couple of used cases on the PayPal side would be helpful? So the first one, there is no scientific relevance to the 50% threshold. I think it's just a notion that the off-platform business which is by far the largest Tam continues to grow faster than on Marketplace. But that's all there is to it. The only thing I would add on Pedro's comment is that, is more on more we are targeting off-line transactions. And since e-commerce it's only 5% return in Latin America the total addressable market for the offline is really very large significantly larger than online, but we expect them to continue. And then in terms of PayPal I think we need to continue to hold off until the actual agreements are hammered out. They do not imply a focus on merchants versus consumers. I think we're looking at areas where we can be synergistic to each other and drive win-win business combinations and those could be either on the consumer side or the merchant side. But I think we'll be able to address those in detail once we actually get them signed. Okay. If I could just sneak in one more, I won't probably on the early settlement or the prepayment. Maybe this one, so you were calling out some differences between Argentina and Brazil market on the payment side. If MercadoPago could like invent the payments world, the future payments world of Latam, would you prefer to be carded or not carded? And how does that play to your strategic strengths? Look, so let me answer that with two slightly different takes. First of all is we need to be where the consumer is and where the merchant is. So if merchants want credit cards we offer [technical difficulty]. So we were saying Merchant and consumer choice is important to us. Now having said that, we believe that non-carded, so the QR network we’re trying to build through IT technology, internet protocols and mobile devices can offer much greater disruption to final services in terms of lower cost more efficient distribution and more massive distribution than proprietary networks that are owned by Visa or MasterCard. So we will follow where consumer and merchant choice is, but if we have our say, we believe you can deliver a better experience and a more cost efficient experience in a non-carded world and that’s what we’re trying to construct. Got it. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Okay. Thank you. Pedro or Marcos if you want way in here also from a strategic perspective and particularly for Brazil you are walking away from dealing with what looks like economically a rational transactions. So if they’re rational for you than chances are there probably a rational for your competitors as well. So do you e-commerce growth in the country has entered a period of structurally slower growth? Or are you seeing some of your competitors willing to underwrite the volume that from a economic perspective maybe a rational.
And I think – also in your prepared remarks you call that consumer credit origination in Brazil and Argentina are up by a factor of 1.2. So that’s speak where I’m guessing of where your rapid pace off-platform versus on-platform loan. So what are some of the friction headwinds you guys saw for recently that is driving this? Thanks. Sorry, apologizes. We have a line in a backup line in for whatever reason they don’t all that different moment, so apologizes for that. I don’t know if we still folks on the line. I’ll answer Stephen question and we’ll see the other questions we have. So I would say that if you look at the evolution of the free shipping program in Brazil we were probably the company that was most aggressive last year and was most willing to subsidize unit economic in the short term, didn’t make sense and an attempt to generate volume on certain routes or by investing longer life time values.
With the cost changes last year even those longer life time value stop making sense for us. But I don’t think that our rationalization of our program to a more intelligent and more rational player necessarily implies changes from other players. So, I think you just need to look at the way we’re trying to invest less in shipping for same amounts on percentage wise but in a more intelligent way, and I don’t think there’s a read through to what other players are doing. Okay. Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Edward Yruma from KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open. Hi. Thanks for taking questions. This Matt on for Ed. So you’ve done a good job improving search and discovery. Wondering if you could elaborate a bit about your catalog initiate, how exactly is the data being cataloged and I assume its been carry out by your seller and how do you incent them to do this? And finally, how does improving search and discovery flow through to conversion rate? Thanks. Yes. Great question on catalog, high-level answer. Yes, sellers have to share information with us. We have try to build the data architecture in a way that we can with the least amount of data requested try to fill in gaps, but it does require some work from seller. The efforts have been a combination of gammafication, so if you look at our seller central it very explicit and the improvements that you can get from complete datasets that allow us to place your product on the catalog efficiently and then also improvements in conversion either through better search and sort algorithm and eventually hopefully sometime this year actually view item pages that concentrate much more volume on catalog items. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Marvin Fong from BTIG. Your line is open. Mr. Fong you may need to unmute your phone. Hi. Sorry about that. I was on mute. Just two questions if I could. First one on Envios Flex. If you could just give us an idea about just the cost advantage of Flex versus some of the other last mile solutions that you guys currently use. It would be very interesting and then also in terms of the other cities, major cities you’re thinking about entering, give us a sense of how much those areas represent in terms of GMV? And then secondly on merchant services, the reacceleration in growth, if you could just add some color on what exactly is driving that, is it just general improvement in online activity by the sites or is there something you guys specific going to improve the PTV growth in that channel? Thank you. Okay. So first all, the current version of Flex is not a significant driver of improved cost. It is a significant driver of improved delivery time. Flex is what enables same day delivery for example, and so that’s really focus – and its also in many market specially for large concentrated urban areas are very quick way to onboard merchants because they continually use their same delivery infrastructure but now powered by our technology and our capacity to delivery.
In terms of what we’re trying to accomplished with coverage of Flex we’re going to start rolling it out in the large urban areas in different countries. I don’t think we have the data right here what percentage of our sales, Sao Paulo, Rio Minas will represent in Brazil. But remember that that doesn't mean that you get 100% of the volume in those countries. So I think if we look at Buenos Aires [ph] that is probably at high single digits, mid single digits of total GMV and one large city. I think you can assume that even as we roll out other large areas the initial phases are single digits of our GMV if that and then over time we hope to be able to increase that adoption. Flex is one part of a multiple series of services. Fulfillment is another one cross-docking, is another one, and I think all of those combined is really what we're trying to grow in detriment of the drop ship model which is the one where we have the lowest service levels and the least control over quality. And going onto the merchant services question I would say that that's key. But just in terms we look at guarantee and we have 108% year-on-year and we show acceleration in all of three markets; Argentina, Brazil and Mexico, so I think we have been really [Indiscernible] what generated most of the growth is one extra factor and year ago Brazil, we had lost significant merchant and that lower growth [Indiscernible] So if you look at Brazil we have had four quarters in accelerating growth. Q3 will grew more than Q4 – sorry, Q3 will grew more than Q2, Q4 more than Q3 and now significantly more than Q4. Okay. Thank you, guys. Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Irma Sgarz from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Yes. Thank you for taking my questions. Congrats on the quarter. Regarding the marketing spend where you drove quite a lot of leverage this quarter specifically in Brazil. When we sort of think about that line going forward from here, how do you think about sort of the cadence for this going forward not just for the rest of this year but also for subsequent years. I would imagine that the building I'll see to why it cited payment system and the building of the Pago brand, specifically in Brazil will require a little bit of marketing spend. Is that something that you'd expect to show up in that line or not really, and the same also for the deployment of the complete to suit of the Fintech solutions should that be something that impact your R&D line or your development line or again nothing too relevant to expect in terms of cadence of investments here in this line? Okay. So as you know Irma, we try to not get into too much forward looking guidance but I think they're both great questions so I'll comment high level on both. I’ll start with the R&D one. I think we continue to be very aggressive in trying to grow out the engineering pool and the number of engineers we hire. But I think even if we accomplish our hiring targets there's a natural scale to the business and so I don't think you should seek too much margin compression from R&D spend. This is more about just focusing on reallocating engineers more and more to the new Fintech initiatives and of the incremental engineers more and more will get assigned to Fintech initiatives.
The marketing question is a great question. I think probably the best way to answer is your assumptions are correct. I think as we move into the remainder of the year and we begin to -- as I outlined begin to launch our commercial efforts in Brazil and Mexico to build out the two sided network that will mean incremental marketing spend. I think we're willing to acquire consumers for the wallet looking at longer term return profiles. So that could also generate greater marketing as a percentage of revenue investments.
And then in general the first quarter is one where we had very very limited investments in brand advertising. If you continue to take a long term view which we do I think brand advertising is an important complement to performance marketing and programmatic marketing. And we also have a second brand that we want to start building now which is the payment brand. So that also means incremental investments. So I would assume that probably marketing is at a fairly high point in terms of efficiency and that there should be increased investment moving forward. That's great. Thanks. Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Tom Champion from Cowen. Your line is open. Hi. Good afternoon. I'm curious if you could talk about the revenue profile of off platform PTV relative to on platform. That's the first question. Also it seemed like shipping time improved a lot again. Could you just talk about the key drivers there? Sounds like Flex was a contributor, but anything else that might have contributed there would be would be great to hear. Thank you. Sorry. As we try to gather some data points for the first question can you walk us through the second one again please. Sure. If I have it correct shipping times improved quite a bit relative to that to the fourth quarter and it sounds like from your comments that Flex might have had something to do with that. I'm just curious if there were any other drivers there? Sure. So Flex is still fairly small. Flex Like I said in mid single digits of the Argentine GMV. So that's not really what's driving most of the improvements in time. I think most of the improvements in time are actually driven by improvements in the network both our managed network as we have better more percentage going through fulfillment, better delivery times in our cross-docking network, but also and this is important our transportation partners on the dropship network have also improved significantly their delivery times.
So sequentially Q1 was the best quarter in terms of consolidated delivery times in the last five quarters, but it was fairly slightly better than Q3 and somewhat better than Q4. The dramatic improvement was over a year ago where Q1 of last year delivery times have really improved very much over the last four quarters as we built out the manage network. Okay. Yes. Going to the first question regarding Sao Paulo’s off-platform that is off-platform, you mentioned [Indiscernible] pretty similar. There’s on versus off-platform. In terms of revenue it's tricky because on-platform we don't charge [Indiscernible]. Accordingly one difference there is that we usually see no useful plan and more product and revenues. The on platform and in MPOS unless so the online merchant, so there is one difference there. Another difference is that we look at frequency of use at wallet is a one where we see the case where consumers are and [Indiscernible] lot of volume specifically we try in those resource [ph] versus vertical. Got it. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Kunal Madhukar from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Couple if I would. With regard to the payment launch on the more complete build out of the payments off in Brazil and in Mexico. Sorry, can you speak up a little bit louder, we’re having trouble hearing you. Okay. Sorry. Thanks for taking the questions. Actually couple if I could. With regard to the new offerings that you’re planning to launch within payment and logistics and in Brazil and Mexico, how does the comparative landscape kind of look in those countries for those services? Okay. So let me start out with logistics very quickly. I think Mexico is a very competitive market in terms of the quality of the networks of some of the larger online retailers. Fortunately it's also by far our most efficient logistics network and so that allows us to be very competitive. But it is the market with the highest I think consumer expectation given what ourselves and other competitors are delivering.
I think Brazil, both because of geographical complexity and distribution, but also the quality of existing networks, consumer expectations are probably a step behind as is the quality of service of our competitors still. And so, maybe one way to characterize it is if we continue to deliver on our roadmap in Brazil, we think it puts us in a very competitive position as a leader in terms of quality of network in Mexico. I think we need to deliver on our roadmap to continue to be among the companies with the best time, but it is a competitive scenario. Thanks. And on the payment side? The payment side I’d say, we are still in general is the most competitive markets in Latin America. So I said so, I think is the one that [Indiscernible] we have grown with the most that usually an MPOS also is where we are growing out full bundle of flows [ph] to rolling out payments. We launch already those consumer merchant pays in last quarters and launched a functionality into asset management when we pay consumer the balance we had. But I think we’ll have a great complete offering. We are competing there with many players, but most of them are more of a niche approach where you get more focused on either acquiring or on the wallet side we believe that we have a more comprehensive approach.
But Mexico I would say is less competitive than Brazil, but we also at an earlier stage and we're only now starting to invest more. We had growth on MPOS and we have rollout. And we have not yet rolled out the asset management solution which we will rollout in a coming quarters. Thanks. And one other question if I could. You've done a great job kind of getting most of the different countries back into profitability. What's happening with Mexico? Why do we have lingering losses, of contribution losses from Mexico? Two reasons. One of them I think you alluded to in your initial question. It's a more competitive market, where other competitors are also losing significant amounts of money. It's also a smaller market so it doesn't have all the scale advantages Brazil or Argentina for example. And so we've been fairly committed to continue to invest in that market because the size of the opportunity is very large it's the second largest economy in the region. And additionally, we're fairly confident that at larger scale that business can have a healthy P&L as we see in other markets. And so it's a matter of continue to invest behind it, to make sure that we reach that scale as quickly as possible and hopefully faster and at more scale than competitors. Thank you so much. Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Pedro [indiscernible] Bradesco BBI. Your line is open. Take comfort in knowing that its Latin American general that has communication problems not just start. Mr. [indiscernible] please go ahead with your question. Hello, can you guys hear me? Yes we can hear you now. Okay, just wanted to come back to the comment you made on fulfilment in Brazil having lagged in the quarter. Just hoping you could maybe elaborate a little bit as to why that was. I mean are you seeing any kind of resistance from sellers? Is there any kind of friction or maybe specific capability you guys are still building out at this point?
And second question on the Brazil GMV. You guys mentioned apparel. Is there any specific focus from you guys at this point regarding specific categories to the extent you try to tap into these the second wave of growth for e-commerce. Thank you. Yes. So I think that let's dig into numbers a little bit. Our fulfilment efforts in Brazil in terms of penetration and adoption by sellers were flat sequentially. That's not good. It's not that it's down. And I think information yes, there still are friction points that we need to continue to solve for our merchants. In terms of onboarding inventory with us and that's what we're working on.
And additionally, we also did pull back on the subsidies we were offering to fulfil through us. And that also had some impact on flat. When we looked at the cross stocking network to packages that still work on our own network, but that are initially at the merchant location and we do both first mile and then cross dock and long haul and last mile that continues to trend positively and gained a few percentage points in terms of adoption last quarter.
So I think to unlock once again the growth of fulfilment. It's a combination first and foremost the technology solutions to unlock the friction, and we could analyse and will be probably investing again in some incentives to get sellers to trial the fulfilment solution.
In terms of categories, I think we called out a few of the categories that we are focusing on building out, compelling user experiences to try to capture. Apparel was one of these and we called out is one of the fastest growing categories and I think we're performing very well there. But there's still room for more growth. It's a very large category, and we continue to work on consumer packaged goods, which is a very large category and a very high frequency category. We're still in much earlier stages there, but it's probably the next big one that we're focused on. Good stride there in Mexico in terms of selection, Brazil is the next market we begin to focus on. Great. Thank you very much. Thank you. I'm showing no additional questions in the queue at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks. Great. We apologize for the mess up on the communication and we look forward to next quarter when we continue to give you updates on how the business is going. Thanks everyone and hope to talk soon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect everyone have a wonderful day.","the MercadoLibre earnings conference call for the quarter ended march 31, 2019 is being recorded . the conference call is being broadcast over the internet . it is also available through the Investor Relations section of our website .",1.0

Now let me turn the call over to Pedro. Great, thank you.
So let's dive straight in and let me kick off this quarter's call by saying that we are pleased and optimistic about how this year is playing out. We've delivered another very strong quarter from a gross billings perspective as we continue to grow and gain scale on our leading e-commerce and fintech ecosystems across Latin America.
Let's first take a look at how we closed a great second quarter that carries us into the third quarter of 2019 with solid momentum. The following KPIs place consolidated quarterly results within context. Gross merchandise volume accelerated to 33% year-on-year on an FX-neutral basis reaching $3.4 billion.
Total payment volume also accelerated versus the prior quarter to 90% year-on-year on an FX-neutral basis to $6.5 billion. While total payment transactions grew in triple digits at 112.5% year-over-year and reached 182 million payments processed. Gross billings grew 73% year-on-year on an FX-neutral basis ascending to $606 million.
We are encouraged to observe these robust rates of growth in key performance indicators all of which are pointing to increasing consumer validation of the innovative product and service offerings we have built around e-commerce and fintech.
As a result of this and given the size of the opportunity, we continue to garner confidence in our cycle of investing aggressively to add more users at the expense of near-term profitability.
Let me now walk you through our fintech progress report. During the quarter, total payment volume, accelerated both in dollars and on an FX-neutral basis, driven for the most part by off-platform TPV growth.
The latter not only explained the majority of total TPV growth during the quarter, but reached an important milestone during June, as that was the first month that TPV from off-platform surpassed on-platform TPV in our history.
In line with that, consolidated total payment transactions also grew triple digits, driven by strong growth in off-platform transactions, as a result of the performance in the growth of transactions across our product portfolio of merchant services, MPOS and wallet initiatives.
Off-marketplace, in other words, off-platform, total payment transactions grew 233% year-on-year, the second consecutive quarter of total transactions in number from off-platform growing above 200%. We also continue to execute well on our MPOS business. Device sales grew again during the second quarter in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, while at the same time, the size of the active installed base of MPOS devices continues to grow.
On a consolidated basis, we have more than doubled the number of quarterly active devices versus the second quarter of last year, while MPOS TPV both in dollars and on an FX-neutral basis grew triple digits in all of the countries where we offer the device.
Also, and as a result of the solid execution MPOS devices that processed at least one transaction over the last 12 months on a consolidated basis, almost reached 3 million.
Our Merchant Services business, where we process payments of other online businesses had an exceptional quarter, both in terms of merchant net new adds and TPV growth. On an FX-neutral basis, Merchant Services total payment volume accelerated to 130% year-on-year, reaching $1 billion for the first time ever in a single quarter.
Additionally, and a result of the aforementioned TPV growth of this business, Merchant Services revenues accelerated for the third consecutive quarter to 113% year-on-year on an FX-neutral basis. On our wallet initiative, we observe that the shift to a mobile first digital payments ecosystem continues to resonate with our users. As such, we are fortunate to benefit from increasing secular tailwinds as cash digitalizes and more aspects of the lives of our users become mobile.
Consequently, during the quarter, wallet total payment volume accelerated both in US dollars and on an FX-neutral basis to 251% year-on-year and 419% year-on-year respectively, driven mainly by successful execution in Argentina, the first market where wallet initiatives were launched.
Complementing this solid growth and also helping us scale out the build-out of our network of digital, mobile wallet, during the second quarter, we have more than doubled the issuance of prepaid cards tied to wallet account balances versus the first quarter of 2019.
Additionally, we are encouraged to see TPV coming from these prepaid cards continue to grow in triple digits both in dollars and on an FX-neutral basis. Still on our wallet initiative, during the month of June, we reached the 3 million monthly active payer mark on our mobile wallet in a single month for the first time on a consolidated basis.
We are also making inroads building and distributing innovative and inclusive asset management products for our users, as adoption of our asset management solution continues to grow. During the quarter, in Argentina and Brazil, the countries where the product is available, already over half of MercadoPago balances in both countries were invested in these asset management products.
Lastly, on fintech, let me give you an update from our merchant and consumer credit business. During the quarter, MercadoCredito delivered healthy metrics. Loan portfolio grew 75% year-on-year and 44% quarter-on-quarter in US dollars, driven by the successful roll-out of consumer credit and MPOS credit products in Brazil and by retraining of our behavioral credit scoring models that have enabled us to roll out the product to new users with improved credit terms and conditions.
We're also pleased to report that Argentina also contributed to the loan portfolio growth as we have begun offering loans to consumers to purchase away from our marketplace. This is the first country and we look forward to replicating this consumer credit business line in other markets as it is the largest addressable market in terms of size and the potential source of very relevant profit stream for us going forward.
With that, let's now move on to Marketplace and Logistics. On a consolidated basis Marketplace GMV on an FX-neutral basis accelerated versus the prior year quarter, growing 6 percentage points faster. Unique buyers as well as new buyers delivered robust rates of growth as well, with unique buyers accelerating to 21% year-over-year, while new buyers accelerated 14% growth respectively.
Supply is also growing nicely, as live listings grew for the 10th consecutive quarter above 50% year-on-year, reaching 224.1 million live listings. On a market-by-market basis, let's start with Brazil. FX-neutral GMV accelerated almost 10 percentage points versus the first quarter of 2019 to 27.1% year-on-year.
This sequential acceleration was driven in part by easier comps as we had the truckers strike and the World Cup during the same quarter last year, as well as greater investments targeted to generate traffic and improve conversion rates.
Mexico continues to maintain momentum, growing almost in line with the first quarter of 2019. On an FX-neutral basis, GMV grew 45% year-on-year as assortment quality continues to grow. Mexico is the country with the highest official store penetration and almost 18% of GMV. Another positive readout for the hypercompetitive Mexican market is that our net promoter scores are also ticking higher signifying growing user promotion of our platform.
Moving south to Argentina, despite the implementation of an ARS10 flat fee during April, our marketplace continues to show resilience, growing FX-neutral gross merchandise volume meaningfully above the rate of inflation, while also accelerating traffic. On an FX-neutral basis, GMV grew 63% year-on-year on the back of solid 57% year-on-year growth during the same period last year. Growth in apparel and home and garden verticals were highlights during the quarter.
On the mobile front, mobile app GMV surpassed 50% of total GMV during the month of June, for the first time, while our e-commerce app ranked number one on Android Play Store in Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. Also, registrations through mobile devices grew over 10 percentage points year-on-year to 80% of all registrations as we successfully transitioned users from desktop to mobile.
Let's now move on to the build-out of our warehousing and logistics managed network, another strategic building block and critical enabler of our enhanced marketplace. We continue adding more product features and tools for our merchants into our proprietary logistics and warehousing management technologies, while also improving productivity in those distribution centers. The latter initiatives should also enable us to add more verticals to our logistics network and consequently help us drive higher penetration as we head into the coming quarters.
On a consolidated basis, managed network penetration continued to gain share from drop shipping, as it gained 16 percentage points year-on-year, reaching 26% of items shipped. These gains were driven mainly by execution in Argentina and Mexico.
In Argentina, MercadoEnvios penetration reached an all-time high of 62% of items shipped versus 42% last year, driven by the successful adoption of MELI Flex shipping platform, which reached 8% of items shipped. It's important to highlight here that MELI Flex adoption is positively impacting the efficiency of MercadoEnvios in Argentina as almost 60% of Flex shipments are same day.
Additionally, we also continue to optimize lead times through addition of more zone skipping routes in Argentina and improved service levels on existing ones, also contributing to higher Envios penetration we delivered in the second quarter.
On the fulfillment front, not only did we successfully initiate operations of our 65,000 square meter fulfillment center in Buenos Aires, with adoption numbers that give us confidence that we can continue scaling the solution as we enter into the back half of 2019, but also our fulfillment operations in Mexico exceeded expectations, growing 27 percentage points year-on-year, reaching 29% of items shipped.
Additionally, and as part of our efforts to expand our managed network during the months of May and June, we also successfully launched our MELI Logistics platforms in Brazil and Mexico. Along with Flex, MELI Logistics is another innovative proprietary logistics platform that we have built from the ground up to prop up the scale and reach of our managed networks. It combines in-house technology and existing physical distribution capacity to reduce dependency on traditional carriers, shorten lead times, cost and perhaps more importantly to significantly enhance the end-to-end shipping experience for our buyers.
Lastly, on logistics, the Brazilian managed network penetration increased 13 percentage points versus last year driven for the most part by our cross-docking centers and initiatives. As of the second quarter, 20% of all items shipped went through our own managed logistics network of cross-docking and fulfillment. Although penetration of fulfillment solution was flat versus last quarter in Brazil, we have continued iterating to improve processes, productivity and also improve our warehousing management technology and algorithms.
As a result, we have observed a re-acceleration of adoption of our fulfillment solution in the back end of the quarter, generating expectations on our end that we have positioned ourselves to drive higher merchant adoption of fulfillment during the second half of 2019.
Now that I've covered the main highlights and KPIs for the quarter, let's move on to financials where we began to accelerate the pace of investment in our growth initiatives as we move into the back half of 2019. During the second quarter, gross billings ascended to $606 million and grew 73% year-on-year on an FX-neutral basis.
The latter, I remind you, marks the 21 consecutive quarter of gross billing growth above 60% driven by continued monetization on our marketplaces as well as successful execution on our fintech initiatives. In particular, our financing business merchant and consumer credit and off-platform payments processing through our merchant services and MPOS businesses have been strong drivers of this growth.
Gross billings in our main countries on an FX-neutral basis was robust across the board, Mexico delivered a sixth consecutive quarter of growth above 50% while Brazil and Argentina maintained momentum, growing 55% and 117% year-on-year respectively.
Consolidated net revenues grew faster than gross billing on an FX-neutral basis accelerating to a 102% year-on-year and reaching $545 million as we continued calibrating and optimizing shipping and loyalty program subsidies and implemented flat fee initiatives in Argentina for the full quarter.
Gross profit ascended to $272 million representing 50% of revenues during the quarter versus 48% a year ago. The 233 basis points of scale year-on-year was driven for the most part through collection fees and sales taxes, which were partially offset by shipping subsidies and warehousing costs as our managed logistics network expands. We've included a detailed breakdown of these and also other OpEx margin evolution in the slides that accompany this presentation.
Consequently, as reported, operating expenses ascended to $285 million were 50% of revenues versus 56% over the second quarter of 2018. On a sequential basis, however, operating expenses increased almost 26%, explained for the most part by increases in marketing expenses as we begin to invest more aggressively in customer acquisition for our multiple product lines as well as new head count, we've added to our engineering product development teams, which increased by over 50% versus the same period last year.
Operating losses decreased to negative $12.5 million as a result of the aforementioned investments. We saw $14.7 million in financial expenses attributed for the most part to interest accrual on our convertible notes due 2028. Interest income increased by 240% year-on-year to $33.7 million attributable to the proceeds from the convertible note and the follow-on offering proceeds from earlier this year.
Our ForEx line was $0.8 million, mainly as a result of the strengthening of the Brazilian Real over the U.S. dollar net liability position in Brazil during the second quarter of 2019. We delivered an income tax gain of $8.9 million attributed for the most part to tax loss carry-forwards in Mexico, which were partially offset by income tax expenses in Argentina and Brazil.
Net income ascended to $16.2 million for the second quarter of 2019, resulting in a basic net income per share of $0.31.
In summation, we feel we've delivered another great quarter, which leaves us on a strong footing to pursue our strategic objectives in the second half of 2019 and beyond. Our focus will be on disciplined execution against our priorities as we aspire to be a leading platform for mobile digital commerce and fintech throughout all of Latin America.
We have already built out a well-diversified product portfolio across multiple countries and are confident that the strength of these business lines, the flexibility of our balance sheet offers us and still nascent digital opportunity in Latin America, we will continue to enable us to deliver long-term value to all our stakeholders as we move into the rest of 2019 and beyond.
And with that, we can now take your questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. So Pedro, so I'm thinking through the mobile point-of-sale opportunity. It seems like the per merchant utilization rate seems to be a fraction of where some of your competitors are probably right now. So given that the size of the merchants that you have may be smaller, but can you talk about what you may be able to do to drive faster per device TPV?
And secondarily, I don't think we've ever seen a sequential dollar pickup in sales and marketing spend from Q1 to Q2. I heard the level that you showed on the support. So can you talk about where the main focus of that incremental spend may be and whether it's consumers et cetera facing. Okay, thank you. [Technical Difficulty] Ladies and gentlemen, please continue to hold, your call will resume momentarily. Can you hear us? Hi, Stephen. Sorry about -- I can hear you. [Technical Difficulty] Let me start again. We have some technical problems. So Stephen, part of what you see in terms of per merchant utilization rate, if you want, by the time, when we started our MPOS business we first addressed the very low end of the long tail of the market and that is where we have been gaining lot of traction. And so it is to be expected that the number of transactions per devices is more than better some of our competitors.
Having said that, during last quarter, we started to move up market. We launched a new device towards the end of last quarter, where we are starting to this small businesses - small businesses, but not the low end of the long tail as we are addressing before. So as this strategy moves forward, we believe we will be addressing this market segment that we have not addressed in the past. And the second question very quickly. Stephen, I think the second quarter many times is somewhat heavy on marketing spend, is when the hot sale occurs in Mexico. So there's always increased investment there. Having said that, I think this year, what you see is the growing number of product lines we have particularly in fintech that we begin to invest more aggressively behind in terms of marketing, and also a renewed focus on brand building and brand marketing investments. Part of that is to start generating the MercadoPago brand and sub-brands around MPOS, credits, merchant services, but some of that is also to strengthen the marketplace brand equity positioning. If you look at it on a country basis, you'll realize that pretty much spread evenly across the significant margins, the pickup in marketing spend. Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Ford from BOA. Please go ahead. Congratulations on the quarter and thanks for taking my question. Osvaldo, can you discuss wallet funding frictions across the major marketplaces and how you're addressing those please? So I would say that this is just on a country-by-country basis, we made a lot of progress with the last few weeks in Argentina and we are in the process of making that same progress in Brazil. First, in Argentina, in the last few weeks, we were able to bank from - transfers from any bank account through [indiscernible]. So, we are able to receive transactions or transfer from any bank account and that is way easier than what it used to be in the past.
And in the case of Brazil, we are integrating right now with [indiscernible] and we expect that also to make the funding significantly easier than what it has been so far. Now that's helpful. And can you talk a little bit more specifically on the growth of the mobile wallet two-sided network in Brazil in terms of the number of payers, collectors and the frequency and then maybe can you share with us what you're doing there to make the wallet stickier, it seems that you've had several successful strategies in Argentina and I was wondering how difficult it is to replicate that in Brazil? Let me - we have not disclosed numbers of specific payments in wallet in Brazil. So let me give you qualitative approach, as we've said in the past, we are probably one year behind than what we were in Argentina, we are later to launch. But we are starting to see traction both in terms of some large merchants where we are adding and also in terms of consumers who are starting to use the platform and we're starting to see monthly growth rate that are very interesting.
As we mentioned in the past, we know this market will take longer to develop than the one in Argentina, since we required maintenance integrations with software houses, but we are encouraged by the results we've seen. Our next question comes from Edward Yruma from KeyBanc Capital. Please go ahead. Thanks for taking my question. I guess first on Brazil, I know you seem to remediate some of the issues that you encountered there but maybe digging in a little bit deeper, what do you think has kind of the flat penetration to 1Q? And then I guess second obviously some big competitors moving markets like Mexico, any change you think in the competitive environment that you're observing thus far? Thank you. Can you just clarify which penetration you're looking at, if it's fulfillment by MercadoLibre or which adoption of which metrics? Yes. The fulfillment by MercadoLibre. Yes, so just to put that in context, I think what we said in the earnings is that we saw quarter that exited on actually a much more positive note than it started. So a lot of the initiatives in terms of investments and technology behind making it easier for sellers to adopt our fulfillment solution and also incentives for them to adopt our fulfillment solution are beginning to gain traction. That's encouraging.
I think also, very importantly, when you look at the end game here, the end game is to improve the cost and the quality of deliveries in the country and I think the other side of the coin for Brazil in fulfillment is the cross-docking efforts, which are evolving extremely well and consequently Brazil already has one-fifth of all volume going away from the dropship market, which is not that far behind where Mexico is.
So, all in all, I would say overall shipping strategy in Brazil continues to perform very well driven primarily by cross-docking but also when we look at the end of the quarter, adoption of fulfillment was beginning to ramp up. Let's see how that evolves over the next few quarters if it becomes a trend, which we hope that is the case. And then on competitive environment in Mexico -- In terms of the competitive dynamic in Mexico on retailing business, I don't think there have been any significant changes over prior quarters, I think Mexico continues to be hyper competitive, we continue to see very strong performance from our business and I think we're pleased with the GMV growth we continue to deliver there and obviously the financials have begun to improve considerably from a top line perspective as we get more efficient and rationalize more and more our free shipping spend. Our next question comes from Deepak Mathivanan from Barclays. Please go ahead. It's Trevor on for Deepak. First question. Can you elaborate a bit on the GMV growth in Brazil? The 27% was faster than overall e-com growth but the comp was a lot easier and you have strong momentum on various categories. Is there anything specifically that you can highlight that maybe it's going to offset some of these tailwinds. I know you guys don't give guidance, but is this sort of the run rate we should expect going forward?
Second question, on the fintech side, can you talk about the frequency increase on some of the new use cases that you're launching? What should we expect to edge along the lines of new use cases and merchant categories? Thank you. So let me take the Brazil number first. Osvaldo can take the payments question. I think like we've said, going forward with Brazil, we've done a lot of innovative work around improving shipping, not just the quality, but also the pricing around that. And so, hopefully that continue to generate positive momentum going forward.
Additionally, from a comp perspective I think the tougher comps are behind us. So we know how much we'll grow, we'll give that out once we report future numbers. I think in general terms, we continue to have an ambition to gain market share and to continue to grow faster than the market is growing. And if we remain focused on the innovation that we've been delivering on the marketplace front, that should play out favorably. And regarding the second question regarding FinTech, we are seeing an increase in frequency and probably the one thing where we see the most is in Argentina with the wallet where over the last year what we have seen is the number of transactions per user is increasing and also the number of users who do, let's say, 2, 3, 4 or over 5 transactions per month is also increasing.
And when we look at that and try to understand why that is happening, we see that those users who adopt multiple flows of payments are accelerating - are accelerating the growth and by that I mean users who are doing those not just that one kind of transactions such as paying with a QR code or topping up a mobile phone from utility and when we get users to do more than one or two of these flows in every month we get them to significantly increase the frequency of use. So we are in the process of ramping that up in Argentina and trying to replicate it in Brazil and Mexico. Our next question comes from Ravi Jain from HSBC. Please go ahead. I have two quick questions. Starting with Pago first, the credit business is scaling up nicely, so could you give us some color on, what is the real key initiatives that you are focusing on for now and how you want to manage risk around the credit business? And second thing on the e-commerce coming back following up on the Brazil question, is - how is the competitive environment in Brazil you're seeing, is it getting - is it getting more competitive? Is it neutral? I mean, how are you seeing, like the new product categories that you're focusing on which is maybe apparel and the basic items? Thank you. So in terms of the credit business, as you said, we are - we have been able to scale during this year. Part of the things that have been going very well are the consumer credit business, which we launched in Brazil last year and in Argentina - we're in the process of launching in Mexico and Argentina, we have gone beyond just pay to buyers to include personal loans.
So we're already offering credit in Argentina where people can take the money and not been on our platform and just take into the bank account and withdraw it and then pay us back. And all of these initiatives have shown lots of traction, and those are what are driving the consumer business this year, in terms of merchants, as we said in the script, what we have been doing is we have been able to improve our models, and as we improve our models, we have more comfort level reaching out to more merchants and offering them the larger loans. In terms of Brazil competitive scenario, again, I think no significant shift from the last few quarters. Brazil has been a very competitive market with multiple players. I think we've seen some nice share gains this quarter when we look at consolidated market numbers. From a category perspective, I think apparel continues to perform well for us.
Consumer packaged goods, which was your other question, I think is more of an opportunity going forward, perhaps the back half of this year, beginning of this year, beginning of next year. And when we break down market share gain opportunities on a category-by-category basis, there clearly are categories that we still haven't fully explored and that we hope to tackle moving forward.
So, I think there is still room for us to sustain our leadership and even gain in terms of share, as we focus on these categories. And just in general on continuing to improve the user experience that we offer in that market. Our next question comes from Irma Sgarz from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Thanks for taking my question. Two quick questions. Firstly, on the TPV, you obviously reached a milestone this quarter with off-platform TPV in June surpassing the on-platform TPV and I think you've in the past sort of consistently said that you're - you see room for having the off-platform TPV growing to multiple times the volume of the on-platform TPV. Now I was wondering, as you sort of think about the road map going forward, do you still think that it makes sense to run this business directly? Or would there at some point also be an opportunity to potentially to partly separate your payment or fintech opportunities from the e-commerce in a more formal way? I hope you sort of understand where I'm going with this question.
And then the second question on customer acquisition, I think, very much in line with the messages that you passed on the past quarter that you're investing more on the marketing side and driving further customer acquisition. I was just curious if you could shed a little bit more detail on where you may be seeing the biggest opportunities in terms of driving, it is through cohorts of customers into your basin, is that maybe mostly on the e-commerce side or is it mostly on the cargo side on sort of the consumer-facing side? And are there any specific regions or demographics that you're going after in this push? Thank you. Sure. So the first question, your investment banker question. I think quite the contrary, when we look at the road map for the next few years, what we still see a significant opportunity for cross-selling across the different pieces of our ecosystem, very closely tied to each other. So, when we look at adoption of many of our fintech products, for example, among our marketplace users, both merchants and consumers, there is still significant adoption opportunities there, and those are obviously the lower - lowest customer acquisition costs we have.
So as we roll out our loyalty program and as we try to get better at cross-selling across platforms, the synergies of having these businesses together, I think is potentially the biggest competitive advantage and differentiator we have against many of the competitors that we face, both on the fintech side and the retail side. So we still see these businesses as very, very intrinsically United and as a critical component of our competitive advantage.
In terms of where new user cohorts in customer acquisition can come from, like I said before, the investments have applied to both the payments businesses and the marketplace. I think just the nature of the addressable market that we have in front of us in payments, probably means that if we look at a 3-year to 5-year view, payments should be an area of greater user acquisition as we aspire to become a digital wallet for mass market.
But that doesn't mean that there is still aren't opportunities to increase the number of users on the marketplace, we've seen a pickup this last quarter as we noted in terms of new users for the marketplace as a consequence of this investment. And I think that's very positive news as well.
So again, customer acquisition investments for both marketplace and payments, obviously payments as we roll out QR in MPOS across multiple countries will probably be source of new users. And then as we cross-sell, hopefully, some of those users also become marketplace users.
Regionally, I think the strategy is typically, we would like to eventually have coverage of all countries, the MPOS and the QR strategy sometimes do start with a certain regional focus and then expand, but at the end of the day, our aspiration is to become a payment standard across entire markets. Our next question comes from Kunal Madhukar from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Thanks for taking the question. You talked about new users. Can you talk about the geographies from which the new users are coming from? And as you roll out the newer fintech products, how many users do you have that are on both platforms, both the e-commerce platform and are also using fintech products on a regular basis? So, if you look at the ramp-up in investment, marketing, as I said before, it's not focused on any specific geo. Marketing spend as a percentage of revenue has increased sequentially in most markets and certainly in the three largest markets, and so we're looking to drive acceleration in new user acquisition, both marketplace and certainly for payments as we build out the ecosystem across different markets. We will probably see the heaviest estimates in Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina which are three markets where we're most focused on right now in terms of building out the part of the ecosystem. [Technical Difficulty] And a follow-up on the investment side. So you talked about investment especially in marketing. Now that you have much more capital and you also have probably more extensive discussions with PayPal with regard to how you're going to invest the investment that they had made, how you are thinking in terms of investment in over the next few quarters in terms of like the amount of investments and the direction that those investments could take? Yes. So I think, a lot of investments will be behind the rollout of the fintech platform. So, that's a combination of online marketing, brand marketing, subsidy of MPOS and commercial agreements trying to increase the number of large scale [indiscernible]. There are investments in our logistics efforts for the marketplace as we rollout a growing number of warehouses, sortation centers and distribution centers, those are the focus terms of or mental spend going forward. Consumer and merchant acquisition and on Fintech brand and marketing efforts and continued investment in the rollout of logistics. Our next question comes from Gustavo Oliveira from UBS. Please go ahead. Hi Pedro, thank you for taking my question. I have two questions, the first one is, if you could give us the rationale for the – flat fee implementation in Argentina and when and if you think about removing the flat fee in Brazil. And I would like to understand what are your thoughts on GMV impact if that was the case. And then the second question would be about your agreement we PayPal, if there is anything you can comment about it or on whether you expect to finalize in general lines what would be the thinking behind? Let me start the second one, very quickly. So we continue to work through implementation details with PayPal, more and more working now on the nuts and bolts process and technology. I think we'll disclose where we come out what the appropriate time. This is a long-term relationship. So whatever we've launched now is the initial and then we'll see where it goes from there. But I think it makes more sense to disclose it when we actually launch the different efforts.
The rationalize for the flat fee in Argentina I think we learned a lot from the launch of the flat fee in Brazil and if you look at the way we launched flat fee in Argentina, you'll realize it's a much smaller amount. I think it's positive in terms of eliminating from the site items that potentially don't really rotate well, because there is a fixed cost for a very small cost items that aren't that relevant. But the way we manage it in Argentina has been, that's detrimental to units sold it in Brazil.
I think in terms of Brazil, whether we would remove it. I think it's something that we will always leave ourselves open to analysis either removing it or lowering it, but there is nothing that we've announced to our sellers or that have in the cards that we can disclose right now. Thank you. Our next question comes from Pedro Fagundes from BBI. Please go ahead. Thank you for taking my question. Just one quick follow-up on the customer acquisition question, in Brazil specifically now that you're investing more heavily in fulfillment adoption and probably also investing more heavily Pedro yourself, you mentioned maybe MPOS subject even things like that. Does it make sense to assume that we should assume relatively weaker margins going into the back half of the year in Brazil specifically? Thanks that's my question. So, we don't give forward guidance for P&L. I think we've been answering is that we see as enormous mid to long-term opportunity. A lot of it's in the Fintech space obviously, I think we've raised capital, so that we can make sure that we capture that opportunity over the long run and not try to opt for any specific result over the short-term.
So your incremental investment behind building out our logistics capabilities, building out the Fintech network across multiple geographies. I think we'll try to remain disciplined in how we deploy capital and make sure that it makes sense for the long term, but not focusing on short-term results. Our next question comes from Jamie Friedman from Susquehanna. Please go ahead. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask Pedro, Osvaldo with regard to the merchant services growth that was very impressive this quarter, what is the use cases and online merchant using their merchant service solution. What I mean is that typically a larger market or a smaller merchant is there any profile of who is using the MercadoPago solutions in commercial services? So this is Osvaldo so mostly we have been focused I would say in the mid market. These are not the larger merchants we usually or [indiscernible] that the big market to whom we provide a very good solution, both in terms of, it's a full stack. In terms of fraud prevention of integration, customer and so on and what we have been doing lately is start to focus more also in the long-term, which was not really out in the past. And so, we continue to drive growth most through medium merchants, but we are more focused on the long-term and because it has to slow growth over the last year. Okay I mean there is, I don't know this I should, but in terms of the QR code and MPOS overlap does the QR code just go to the merchants that do not take their mobile point of sale or is there a use case where they would have both if someone wanted the call it a non-party transaction or a party transaction, our fleet to thinking about like the rollout of the QR versus the MPOS? [Technical Difficulty] Our next question comes from Marvin Fong from BTIG. Thank you for taking my question. That's the first one, I guess could you just update us on your goals in terms of how much you were running over year managed network. Have your goal changed I think you had a plan for the next two to three years. I was just curious, based on how you guys have been performing if you updated those goals at all and that? Thank you. Hello can you repeat the beginning of the question. Yes, I was just I think from talking to the – before that there were some goals that you had set out in terms of how much the deliveries that you wanted – going over to the managed network. I was just curious if you helping out what those, if you could just remind me what those goals are you've got more aggressive with your outlook on how much you want running over the managed network in the past few quarters as you're thinking change. I think we've said that we strive over a multiple year view to deliver delivery times and costs that are best in market and as a consequence of that we would need to run in excess probably of 60% of all units shipped through a network that isn’t the old dropship network that we had. So when we look at the evolution versus that long-term goal. Mexico is at roughly a third I think of our shipments already not running on dropship.
Brazil is slightly above 20, Argentina is higher than both of those and we're seeing consistent improvements in terms of lead times and also overall cost. So I think we remain optimistic with the rollout of our logistics capabilities. Obviously, if we are a third and a fifth in Brazil and Mexico, there is still a lot of work to be done over the next multiple quarters to get to that mid-term goal.
But I think we see very good traction in that direction and I would say, equally important, we see our lead times as being very competitive in all of the markets where we operate. So things are planning out. I think very much in line with what we had set out to accomplish on the logistics front. Thank you. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for attending today's conference, this concludes our Q&A session. You may all disconnect.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Federico Sandler. Please go ahead, sir. Hello, everyone and welcome to the MercadoLibre earnings conference call for the quarter ended September 30, 2019. I am Federico Sandler, Investor Relations Officer for MercadoLibre. Our senior manager presenting today is Pedro Arnt, Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, Osvaldo Gimenez, CEO of Mercado Pago, will be available during today’s Q&A session. This conference call is also being broadcasted over the Internet, and is available through the Investor Relations section of our website.
I remind you that management may make forward-looking statements relating to such matters as continued growth prospects for the company, industry trends and product and technology initiatives. These statements are based on currently available information and on our current assumptions, expectations and projections about future events. While we do believe that our assumptions, expectations and projections are reasonable in view of the currently available information, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in this call for a variety of reasons, including those described in the forward-looking statements and Risk Factors section of our 10-K and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on our Investor Relations website.
Finally, I would like to remind you that during the course of this conference call, we may discuss some non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures can be found in our third quarter 2019 earnings press release available in our Investor Relations website.
Now, let me turn the call over to Pedro. Thank you, Federico. Hi, everyone and thanks for joining our third quarter 2019 earnings call. I want to kick off by saying that we delivered another quarter of robust results. We have made significant progress in executing against our strategic roadmap to not only deliver innovative technology solutions to our customers but also to continue democratizing e-commerce and digital financial services.
With that said, let me start with our FinTech progress report. During the quarter, we reached an important historical milestone as for the first time ever total payment volume away from MercadoLibre’s marketplaces surpassed TPV on-marketplaces during the full quarter, and did so, not only on a consolidated basis but also in our largest market, Brazil. As of this third quarter, 2 of our main countries are processing more payment volume away from our e-commerce platforms than on them, as Argentina and Brazil TPV off-marketplaces reached 63% and 52% of total TPV, respectively. Consequently and driven by the successful execution of all of our off-platform initiatives, TPV off-platform U.S. dollar growth accelerated to 140% year-on-year for the quarter. On a service-by-service level, starting with our merchant services business, the business continues to maintain momentum. During the quarter, merchant services once again surpassed $1 billion at TPV on a consolidated basis. Argentina and Brazil were highlights during the quarter as our Gateway solution scales as well as we execute on market-fit solutions for both larger merchants and long-tail merchants.
Moving on to our MPOS service, the largest of our payments businesses off-platform in terms of TPV, we’re pleased to report that it continues to grow strongly, with quarterly active merchants already surpassing the 2 million mark on a consolidated basis. Additionally, transactions per unique active device continue to increase as usage grows in both Brazil, Argentina as well as in Mexico. In Brazil, for MPOSs, we also launched our Point Pro device during the quarter, which has been gaining traction driven by our recent branding campaigns as we begin to observe meaningful improvements in top-of-mind and instantaneous awareness and surveys we have recently performed post campaign. Our Point Pro device will enable us to pursue slightly larger merchants while in parallel, we have also launched a third device, the Point Mini, which will allow us to better serve the needs of our micro merchant segment of users. In Mexico, our MPOS business is also gaining traction as we scale out branding and communication campaigns. Devices sold in Mexico grew by 58.5% versus last quarter and almost 200% versus last year, while active collectors during the quarter continued to grow north of 300% year-on-year.
Moving on to our wallet services, I am pleased to report that we have also reached an important milestone during the quarter. For the first time since launch, wallet TPV almost reached $1 billion on a consolidated basis. On an FX-neutral basis, TPV grew by a factor of over 4x versus last year. Additionally, consolidated quarterly active payers on the wallet grew a robust 35% versus last quarter, reaching 6.1 million active payers. Argentina was a highlight during the quarter for our wallet business as we see positive results across most key KPIs. One of these is frequency of payment per unique payer. This metric reached almost 11 payments per unique payer during the quarter, driven by successful execution in the rollout of our in-store QR network. A testament to this is that in spite of the FX headwinds that occurred during the quarter in the country, spend per unique payers per quarter continues to rise in U.S. dollars, even reaching $200 per quarter. A significant part of this wallet success is driven, as I just mentioned, by in-store QR payments. During the quarter, we doubled the amount of QR payers and QR collectors versus the prior quarter, reaching 2 million and almost 1 million, respectively.
Additionally, in-store QR payments in Argentina already represent over 50% of total wallet TPV for the quarter. As we advance with our payment strategy, we aspire to replicate the success we are seeing in Argentina across other markets in the region that have launched at a later date. Still on FinTech, I want to take a moment to update you on our credit business, Mercado Credito. Overall, the merchant credit business continues to grow at a healthy clip in terms of originations and is contributing to diversifying our revenue streams while generating more value-added services to our merchant base. We continue making inroads in growing our merchant credit business in Brazil and in Mexico during the quarter, as originations grew 118% year-on-year and 216% year-on-year, respectively. Additionally in Mexico, as we strengthen our scoring algorithms and have more data on our merchants, we have increased long terms while still maintaining very low levels of uncollectibility. In Argentina and as a consequence of our strong FX headwinds and the increasing local benchmark interest rates that followed during the quarter, our overall merchant loan portfolio is down on a sequential basis when measured both in U.S. dollars as well as in terms of credit originations.
On the consumer credit side, on-platform consumer credits in Argentina continue to show resilience, giving us confidence that our scoring models continue to strengthen, as we do not observe increases in nonperforming loans despite the deteriorating macro conditions and higher benchmark rates. In Brazil however, we are still observing higher levels of bad debt as models continued to improve and older vintages start to seek repeat loans. Additionally, I am pleased to report that during the quarter, we launched our consumer credit business in Mexico, which should help us to further improve our value proposition to buyers in that country. We have also hit strides in funding sources for Mercado Credito as we continue advancing in lowering funding costs and driving scale. In Argentina, we issued a public market securitization under the SME figure, which has allowed us to lower funding costs. While in Brazil, we launched our first consumer credit trust, also generating savings and funding that we will be able to pass through our buyers and sellers in the form of lower interest rates.
Before we delve into the rest of the prepared remarks, I would like to first make a few comments in regards to the increase in bad debt stemming from our credit business. During the quarter, bad debt increased by $13.3 million, an increase of 86% versus last quarter. This increase is explained for the most part by two of our more recently launched products in Brazil: consumer credits and MPOS merchant credits. Given that we are at such an early stage in both of these products, the higher level of loan losses are within our expectations. It’s important to highlight that both in consumer credit and MPOS credits in Brazil we are taking the appropriate measures to improve these loan losses going forward. We have adjusted pricing, taking advantage of incremental information we collect on nonperforming payers to strengthen our churn and behavioral credit scoring algorithms and have refocused on performing payers.
That wraps up the FinTech progress report. We still have much to execute in the back half of the year and beyond. It is imperative that we continually innovate and deepen our customer engagement in order to maintain and try to further widen the distance between our value proposition and that of our competitors. And in keeping with that focus, the third quarter saw significant progress in consumer and merchant engagement on the Mercado Pago platform.
Let’s now move on to some of the high points from our marketplace business. Consolidated GMV accelerated for the third consecutive quarter to 37% year-on-year on an FX-neutral basis, driven by solid execution in Argentina, Mexico, Colombia and Chile. Despite macro headwinds, Argentina delivered the best quarter since Q2 ‘15 on an FX-neutral basis, and continues to grow meaningfully above inflation. During the quarter, Argentina accelerated GMV on an FX-neutral basis to 80.2% year-on-year.
Moving on to Mexico, it continues to be one of our fastest growing markets, accelerating GMV growth on an FX-neutral basis to 47% year-on-year, continuing to gain market share and growing well above market growth rates. Additionally, we continue to see higher Net Promoter Scores as we improve our user experience and bring down delivery times and costs year-over-year as our managed logistics network expands. Colombia FX-neutral GMV grew at the fastest pace over the last 28 quarters, accelerating to 50%, while Chile also accelerated to deliver the best quarter since the beginning of 2018, delivering FX-neutral GMV growth of 32% year-on-year. Incremental marketing investments, greater traffic and improving conversion rates explain the results delivered in the latter countries.
Lastly, a recap of Brazil during the quarter where results were uneven, FX-neutral GMV growth came in at 24% year-on-year. The deceleration was driven in part due to a Correios strike, which created approximately 200 basis points of quarterly headwind during the month of September. Additionally, initiatives to cap free GMV to 2% of GMV versus 5% last year also had a negative impact on growth. Despite the deceleration, incremental GMV added during Q3 ‘19 when compared to GMV of the prior year during the same quarter was still a robust $378.6 million, among the highest in recent quarters. In line with that, we are also encouraged to see unique buyers accelerating for the second consecutive quarter in Brazil to 25% growth year-on-year, while new buyers delivered the fastest pace of growth in over a year. Additionally, in Brazil, selection continues to deepen, as we reached 120.4 million listings during the quarter, another indicator that we continue to execute well on key KPIs.
Demand metrics for other countries continue to trend well, as unique buyers reached 26% year-on-year growth on a consolidated basis, while Argentina, Mexico, Chile and Colombia all accelerated sequentially year-on-year to 22%, 50%, 38% and 53% growth, respectively. Also, new buyers are accelerating in all geographies as we begin to invest more aggressively in marketing. On a consolidated basis, new buyers grew a robust 10 percentage points versus last quarter. On the supply side, we also continue to focus on deepening selection available to our buyers through our cross-border initiatives, as cross border trade seller base and pipeline continues to grow and we integrate our international sellers into our logistics platforms. Fulfillment by MELI for cross-border is operational in Mexico, and we continue to strengthen partnerships with international carriers. Additionally, we are starting to deploy our international seller supply into Brazil with early positive results.
Moving on to another key strategic priority for us and enabler of our enhanced marketplace vision, logistics, our own logistics network continued to grow during the quarter on a consolidated basis, reaching one-third of all items shipped and gaining almost 20 percentage points of adoption versus last year and 7 percentage points versus last quarter. In Brazil, reliance on DropShipping network continues to come down, reaching 71% of items shipped versus 90% last year, a clear reflection that our own network continues to grow and gain share of items shipped. As of Q3 ‘19, this managed network reached almost 30% of items shipped while fulfillment penetration grew to 7%, up from last quarter.
In Mexico, fulfillment penetration continues to move along full steam. During the quarter, it reached 35% of items shipped, growing penetration 6 percentage points versus the prior quarter and almost 30 percentage points versus Q3 ‘18. The successful execution is also allowing to increase by 2 percentage points the amount of shipments in 2 days or less in Mexico versus last year. Argentina is making progress as well on the logistics front. Mercado Envios penetration reached almost 70% of items shipped, while fulfillment reached 5% of items within the quarter of launching the service. Another positive data point from Argentina is that our Flex logistics platform continues to fire on all cylinders and reached 10% of items shipped during the quarter, meaningfully contributing to increase by 23 percentage points the amount of shipments in 2 days or less in the country versus last year.
Now that I have covered the main highlights and business KPIs for the quarter, let’s move on to financials, where we have continued accelerating the pace of investment in our growth initiatives mainly in marketing as we move into the second half of 2019. During the third quarter, gross billings continued to maintain strong momentum, growing on an FX-neutral basis above 60% for the third consecutive quarter, while also accelerating in U.S. dollars to 45.4% year-on-year despite FX headwinds in some of our main countries. On a by country basis, gross billings delivered excellent performance, as well on an FX-neutral basis, Brazil growing at 43.5% year-on-year, Argentina at 118.1% and Mexico at 104.4% year-on-year.
Consolidated net revenues grew faster than gross billings, both on an FX-neutral basis and U.S. dollar basis, growing to 91% year-on-year and 70%, respectively, and reaching $603 million as we continue investing behind free shipping, loyalty and optimized subsidies which have minimized contra revenues. Argentina was a highlight as net revenues accelerated sequentially over the 20 percentage points in dollars to 38.8% year-on-year during the quarter despite a devaluation of 13% in the Argentine peso versus the prior quarter. On an FX-neutral basis, revenue accelerated again to 118.9% year-on-year, demonstrating the resiliency of our business in that country. Net revenues in Brazil and Mexico also continue to grow at a very good clip, both in U.S. dollars and on an FX-neutral basis. Net revenues in Brazil accelerated to 76.6% in dollars, while on an FX-neutral basis, it grew 77.3%. Mexican net revenues grew triple digits in U.S. dollars for the fourth consecutive quarter to 146.4% year-on-year and equally impressive, 152.5% on an FX-neutral basis.
Gross profit was $284.3 million, representing 47.2% of revenues during the quarter and relatively flat versus 47.8% a year ago. This 62 basis point margin compression was driven for the most part by shipping subsidies and warehousing costs of our managed network, which was partially offset by collection fees, sales taxes and hosting fees. On a sequential basis, gross profit was $284.3 million, representing 47.2% of revenues during the quarter versus 50% during Q2 of 2019. This 281 basis point margin compression is explained for the most part by incremental inventory costs from the robust sales of MPOS devices during the quarter and increased shipping subsidies to promote adoption of our logistics network.
We have included the detailed breakdown as we do every quarter of these and also the OpEx margin evolution I am about to cover in the slides that accompany this presentation. As reported, operating expenses ascended to $366.3 million or 60.7% of revenues versus 50.9% during the third quarter of 2018. On a sequential basis, operating expenses increased $81.4 million, which resulted in sequential margin compression of 840 basis points, mostly attributed to incremental marketing expenses and bad debt, as I previously discussed. From these 848 basis points of sequential margin compression in OpEx, 689 basis points are explained by the incremental marketing expense while 194 basis points are explained by growth mainly in bad debt from our credit business in Brazil, both of these partially offset by 110 basis points of scale in salaries and wages in G&A given that a significant portion of our G&A headcount is in Argentina. The step up in marketing is explained almost entirely, 90% of it to the launch of our branding campaigns in our main countries as we continue to strengthen our e-commerce brand but perhaps more importantly, as we begin to build the Mercado Pago brand and begin to communicate the benefits of our payments ecosystem to our users through more traditional marketing channels. It’s important to highlight that although the volume and revenue returns on these branding initiatives will play out more in the midterm, we’ve already began to see increases in unaided brand awareness of MELI in the most recent brand tracking surveys that we’ve conducted.
If we breakdown that $51.3 million of incremental marketing spend Q-on-Q during this quarter, the vast majority, $46.2 million, were deployed to branding initiatives, 60% of those for the marketplace and 40% of those for payments. As a result of these incremental investments I had walked you through, operating losses ascended to $81.9 million. The 848-basis-point contraction that I just explained plus the 281-basis-point gross margin contraction covered earlier in COGS, explain the sequential decline and also the difference between positive EBIT and negative EBIT.
Moving down the P&L, we saw $14.5 million in financial expenses attributed for the most part to interest accrual on our convertible note due 2028 and financial guarantees in Argentina. Interest income increased by $229.5 million year-on-year to $28.5 million mainly attributable to the proceeds from the convertible note issued in August 2018 on our follow-on offering earlier this year, which both generated more invested volume and interest gain and also due to higher float in Brazil and Argentina from our Payments business. ForEx gain was $987,000, primarily as a result of strengthening the U.S. dollar over our Argentine peso net liability position in Argentina. We recognized a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in Mexico and Colombia, which accounted for $91.5 million and $7.2 million, respectively. We still anticipate the possibility of eventually being able to use these tax credits in the future. Should we be able to use the valuation allowances, they will be recorded as P&L gains in future periods. As a consequence of all this, net loss for the quarter ascended to $146.1 million, explained for the most part by the incremental investments in marketing and the aforementioned tax valuation allowances. On a per share basis, all this resulted in a basic net loss per share of $2.96.
Free cash flow, defined as cash from operating activities less payment for the acquisition of property, equipment and intangible assets net of cash acquired, was $124.1 million versus $74.4 million in the same period last year. Cash, short-term investments and long-term investments totaled $3.1 billion. Reflecting on the first three quarters of 2019, we remain very encouraged by the performance of our business overall and remain excited about the opportunities that lay ahead of us. We believe we are building superior experiences and products for our consumers and merchants and the sustained momentum we see in the business gives us confidence to continue investing. We look forward to keeping you updated on our progress next quarter.
And for now we can take your questions. Thank you. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Okay, thanks. So Pedro, there is a ton of stuff to focus on given you guys are marching in multiple different directions, I’ll just pick one. So the Pro mobile point-of-sale device that you guys just introduced, can you talk about whether the merchants that you’re targeting there are existing MercadoLibre merchants or are these a completely different set of new merchants? I was wondering what the acquisition cost for these merchants might be and on a go-forward basis? And when you release, I guess, the mini version also, I guess, this is probably the version that’s more appropriate for the merchant that would otherwise be on the marketplace? Thanks. Hi, Stephen, this is Osvaldo and thanks for the question. And with regard to Point Pro, addressing is really small businesses. In the past with our mini device, we were targeting mostly the end of the long-tail, which were mostly individuals. Now we are reaching to slightly larger businesses. And here, even though we are promoting it in our platform, I would say most of the new users aren’t necessarily already in the MercadoLibre platform. So we are using a sales force and we’re reaching out through to marketing to the specific merchants. We have not and are not disclosing the acquisition cost but we are very comfortable that the pricing is very appropriate and the payout period is reasonable. And we also introduced a Point Mini chip, which is a device that is targeted on the smaller merchants but that already has a telephone tip in it so that it does not need to be paired with a telephone. And we also introduced that during the last quarter. And these are addressing two different segments of the market as I was saying before the smaller individuals and then slightly larger merchants. Thank you. Our next question comes from Deepak Mathivanan with Barclays. Your line is now open. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Pedro, can you talk about some of the initiatives that’s driving used case and frequency growth on the wallet perhaps in terms of the merchant type on the in-store side? And without going into specifics, how are you planning to attack this aggressively in 2020 and beyond? And then the in-store QR wallet payments is growing really fast, particularly in Argentina, how do you think about the monetization plan for this long-term, what are the primary merchants that’s seeing the usage right now? Thank you. Hi, Deepak, this is Osvaldo. Let me take the first part of the question. With regards to use cases and increasing the frequency of users, I think the main drivers have been, on the one hand, adding use cases in each of the countries where we operate and the other one is adding popularity for the QR Code networks, those have been growing in all of Argentina, Brazil and Mexico and so the things we try to do is encourage users to do more transactions but also to use more than one different flow. We find that retention rates are higher when users engage in more than one of the use cases. Towards the latter part of the question and you asked about monetization plans, we have already made public to our users in Argentina that we will start charging 0.6% for stored balance transactions and for their card transactions starting during Q3, 0.6%. If I can just follow-up on that, what is the size of that business right now roughly and can you provide on kind of growth characteristics of that? Great. So I think what we disclosed in the script was that, that business was approaching $1 billion during the quarter. It’s growing at a very robust rate, so it’s growing over 4x. Okay. Thanks, Pedro. Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Ford with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Hey, good evening and thanks for taking my questions. Osvaldo, can you talk a little bit about how rapidly your lending algorithms are evolving for consumers and MPOS clients in Brazil and how you think about the growth of the credit book in Brazil as a whole? Great. So you have the disclosures around originations, we’ll get you the number in a second. Let me just address the evolution of the algorithms. So whenever we launch something new, obviously there is a little time that it takes for the algorithms to improve. We began to see strong improvements in the third quarter and hopefully, we see them reflected as we move forward in the year. So we are seeing – and we are comfortable with how the algorithms are performing. In terms of originations, when we look at Brazil, originations have been fairly stable, overall originations, Q-on-Q, slightly down. And the same applies for the consumer book. So in terms of incremental originations, it’s been similar size Q2, Q3 in the range of incremental $30 million, Brazil. And Pedro, you dictate that, right? This is not a demand issue. You are determining how quickly you grow those originations, correct? We do. And if you look at our history, we have been very disciplined. So either if macro conditions change or if we think the algorithms still need to get more robust we can slow down origination rhythms and we have done that in different quarters. This last quarter, for example, in Argentina, you will see a strong slowdown for obvious reasons. So we continue to take a long-term view on this. We continue to be very I think cautious in making sure we are being efficient and we entirely determine how much we open the spigot or close the spigot in terms of the origination volume. Understood. And then I think Wish is one of the fastest growing sites in Brazil, how are you thinking about the cross-border business there and how are you balancing user experience with assortment growth and then GMV growth? Yes. So I think on CBT really what we have been more focused on recently is how do we offer a CBT offering that’s differentiated from some of the other global players, and a lot of that is focused on the user experience, both for sellers and buyers. So we are working on how do we really streamline the whole process in terms of shipping, customs, trying to figure out if there are ways to get an inventory into country faster and therefore, to your doorstep, faster once you have ordered. I think that’s been one of the reasons why growth there hasn’t been explosive because we have really tried to focus on building out the right user experience. And we have made consistent and solid strides on that, and I think, hopefully, when we look back in a few years, that will have become a sizable business with a user experience and net promoter scores that clearly differentiate it from some of the faster growing Wishes or other players that focus more just on getting demand from China to Brazil and not so much on the user experience on the way. Very helpful. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Hey, good afternoon. I know you don’t provide specific go-forward guidance but Q3 was a fairly dramatic change in operating loss. So just wondering how do you think about kind of the near to medium-term operating loss. So to correlate your loss run-rate kind of be more like Q2 or more like Q3 or somewhere in between? And would you say the company is still focused on profitable growth that you described before? And if so, what kind of timeline can take it back towards that? So we need to make sure that we balance, is a sustainable business, with making sure that we’re also capturing opportunities that exist in front of us and that we are aware of what the competitive dynamics are. I think if you look at the quarterly disclosures, you will see that we’ve tried to give a lot indication on Q3 on where the incremental margin compression comes from. You’ll see a lot of that is either increased investment in customer acquisition and marketing or the entire wallet and payment strategy across multiple geos, which is something that we do want to invest in because we see an enormous TAM and a very, very large opportunity. In some cases, with longer payback times on merchants we acquire or in the case of wallet, an enormous opportunity with a very good proof of concept in Argentina but still in a market launch monetization model. And then on the marketplace, I think we have identified an opportunity to increment our brand awareness and our brand equity, so you will see in the disclosures that there has been almost the entirety of the incremental spend sequentially is on marketing. Marketing is something that’s very easy for us to control and that we also think scales well going forward if we sustain these levels of revenue growth while still being a material marketing budget to continue to consolidate our leadership. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Marcelo Santos with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking the question. The first question I would like to make is could you please give some description of the more or less ballpark number on profitability levels for the different businesses you have like general terms, I think you did this in the past just wanted an update now? And the second question is regarding the MPOS, do you plan or do you offer a raise sort of softer together with payments, is that something that’s on the pipeline to help the merchants together with the payments? These are the two questions. So, very quickly relative profitability by the different businesses, we don’t disclose. I think at times, we have given overall indication, but given how competitive the situation is getting, I think you have very good disclosures per segment, not by business line. And obviously, these businesses are in very different stages of growth and development. So I would argue that the steady state current – sorry that the current P&Ls and what they look like is by no means an indication of what those businesses could deliver in terms of margins and P&L at scale. Again, just to reiterate, right, if you look at many of the FinTech initiatives, right now it’s more about growth in TPV and customer acquisition and making sure that customer engagement and customer user metrics are going in the right direction, and then when we hit a certain level of scale, we start introducing the monetization model. And if you look at Argentina, as Osvaldo just mentioned, we’re going to be doing that this quarter. And I think that reiterates our commitment to monetizing the wallet and the FinTech initiatives when the time is right, but that right time could be in the relatively short-term as what we are doing in Argentina. Thank you. Our next question comes from Ravi Jain with HSBC. Your line is now open. Hi, couple of quick questions. So, the first one on Brazil, on the GMV growth, do you think that is there room to kind of accelerate that in 2020 in terms of especially given the competitive landscape is getting intense, right, local deals are raising money and international players are trying to also expand that offering, how do you see MELI is positioning and your strategy, do you think you want to accelerate your logistics build-out, do you think that’s going to be the key thing or you want to just continue investing in branding and that’s how you plan to go attack the competition? And the second question is, do you see some synergy or the potential for bringing the two businesses together are the users of the wallet becoming more and more buyers on your e-commerce platform or should we think that the e-commerce buyers are your first adopters of the wallet? How do you think about cross-selling between the two businesses? Thank you. Okay. Sorry, just one thing, I got cut off before finishing the answer to the previous one. So very quickly, in terms of the software for the MPOSs, when you look at the MPOS devices that we distribute and the merchant base and the multiplicity of services and products that we are pursuing, currently, we don’t have as a high priority software or ERP-like solutions. We’re much more focused on the multiple other financial services that we’re offering and not the ERP business. We do look to integrate with existing EFPs like the Linx partnership we announced last quarter, but in general, it’s not a focus of us to build our own core ERP. Brazil, I don’t think it’s an either or question. We’re very focused on the rollout of our logistics platform. We’re actually extremely pleased with the results we’re seeing there in terms of migrating more and more volume onto our own network and also the sophistication and the results we’re seeing on that network. So that will be a poor component of our differentiation in our value prop in Brazil and that drives a lot of OpEx through the P&L. I think because we’re seeing incremental improvements in Net Promoter Scores and engagement metrics, that also gives us greater encouragement to also invest more in marketing to communicate some of those new services and new brand attributes but just in general, to attract more visitors and buyers to the category. So I think we’re being more aggressive on the marketing front, incrementally and sequentially, and it’s not in detriment of investments that we are making in user experience or technology or fulfillment. And again, we don’t give forward guidance on growth rates but I do think that we hope that all these investments could lead to a better user experience, and hopefully, that leads to more incremental growth.
In terms of ecosystem and platform, now obviously we believe that, that’s one of, if not the biggest differentiator that we have and we need to focus on. I think when you look at it today, there’s probably more that we have leveraged the existing user base of e-commerce to drive wallet and FinTech usage. However, I think it’s roughly split 50-50, 50% of monthly active payers have some sort of activity on the marketplace and 50% are just net new FinTech users that hopefully over time we are able to bring on to the marketplace. As we launch our revamped Mercado Puntos loyalty program over the next few quarters, that should be instrumental in driving more and more cross usage and cross-selling of our entire ecosystem. Thank you. That’s helpful. Thank you. Our next question comes from Gustavo Oliveira with UBS. Your line is now open. Hello, Pedro. Thank you for taking the questions. I wanted to understand still the Brazil GMV growth. You’ve been reducing your shipping subsidies as you grew more comfortable with your algorithm. Is – do you have any intention on increasing, again, the subsidies or you think you already found the optimal level that you want to work with going forward and whether you prefer to invest more of that re-sourcing in the brand investment? Yes. So look obviously we are always innovating and always thinking of ways to drive better user experience, more volume. So, I think MELI is always about potentially changing things. Right now, I think we have reduced versus prior years the level of subsidies as a percentage of revenue, but we also feel that the subsidies we offer now are a lot more intelligent and a lot more targeted. If you look at it sequentially there was actually a slight increase in subsidies, not so much on transportation, but subsidies aimed at getting merchants to send more inventory to our fulfillment centers, and that’s had very positive results in terms of growth of the managed network, and fulfillment in Brazil has begun to grow again as you saw in the numbers. Again, I want to stress. I don’t think this is a trade-off between marketing or shipping. I think a lot of the marketing spend has been incremental, and that’s what’s driven the change in the P&L profile and we are confident that, that’s the right thing to do for this phase of the business where we need to invest in growth of FinTech and user acquisition, and where we see an improving user experience on the marketplace and we want to invest behind that. That’s I think the way we are looking at the incremental marketing investment that was in the P&L in Q3 going forward at least for this phase. Thank you, Pedro. Thank you. Our next question comes from Irma Sgarz with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my questions. So regarding the managed network where you made a lot of progress on a quarter-over-quarter basis as you look further into the future and you continue to sort of keep in your footprint, there is two questions here. Firstly, what do you think in terms of like what you need in terms of footprint? Is it more a question of like us getting additional distribution center space or maybe increasing more hubs and increasing potentially even the level of automation in your network? And then secondly, as you sort of think again further out and look through your merchant base, do you have any plans for also offering additional services where you help your merchants directly target their local client through sort of click and collect initiative within their stores where you could just offer the sort of interface on the marketplace and connect – to connect buyers and sellers and then also a solution on the logistics but where it doesn’t really go through your fulfillment or cross stocking but offer basically local transportation solution? Thank you. Okay. So I think most of the elements you included in your question at the beginning in terms of what other additions to the managed network we believe we will continue to see in terms of incremental warehouses, incremental service centers and hubs and increased automation, I think the answer is yes. Remember that in our model, warehouses and incremental service centers, that those are OpEx, they are not CapEx, incremental automation, depending on what it is, is CapEx that, that’s a very manageable number. And so all of those are part of our network plans for all the countries where we’re building out the managed network. In terms of click and collect, Irma, so the functionality does exist. So we can work with select retailers on click and collect. Having said that however, I think our focus, not being a bricks and mortar retailer who has some cost into building, is much more on building out the fastest and most efficient network to get packages to your doorstep but potentially the overlay, and we began to do some of this in Brazil, of drop-off points and eventually pickup points but not so much storefronts of our merchants but rather nodes within our network where drop-off and pickup can occur. So our focus, I think, is more of a pure native e-commerce player for now, it isn’t trying to leverage existing physical stores and more on building out the efficiency and the speed of our own network. We can work with select retailers who want to on offering click and collect on what they sell on the platform but that hasn’t been a focus. Great. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Marvin Fong with BTIG. Your line is now open. Hi, thank you for taking my question. My first question is just on the marketing spend, I am looking at the slide in your presentation, which is very helpful just breaking it down between branding, performance and promotion. And I was a little surprised perhaps that so much is – about 50% looks like is on branding. The majority of that on the marketplace given you are such a well-known brand already, just talk about the decision behind your marketing allocation, and do you find that like in terms of trying to draw first-time users onto the digital wallet, that promotions and performance marketing aren’t good ways to do that? Thanks. Yes. So a couple of things. First of all, these include both commerce and FinTech branding investments. Bear in mind that when you should look at the branding investment probably on an annualized basis to have a better sense of overall percentage of revenues, we have concentrated a lot of the investments in Q3 and a little of that in Q4, that doesn’t necessarily signal that, that is an ongoing quarterly amount. Although we have a very strong brand, as e-commerce becomes more and more mainstream, we still see opportunities to drive more user and more top-of-mind behind the MercadoLibre brand. And like I said earlier, part of what we are communicating there are also some of the newer attributes we have. So the speed of our delivery network, the prevalence of free shipping and other newer benefits of the marketplace as it’s really improved its service. And then on the FinTech piece, if you were to look, we do have to build out the Mercado Pago brand. If you look at some of these markets, MercadoLibre is incredibly well known. Mercado Pago is a brand, which is historically on-marketplace. And so there is room to start building the standalone knowledge behind Mercado Pago. It’s the first time we have ever done any brand building for Mercado Pago. It’s always been known and used primarily on the marketplace. We do agree with you that for customer engagement and customer acquisition, promotional and targeted discounts are very effective, and that’s really where most of the promotional budget comes in is for the FinTech piece. But because we have never generated any awareness around the brand, and there are our competitors that have invested brand marketing behind their brands, I think there is room to do that as well. And we are pleased with both the quality of the campaigns and some of the initial results we are seeing in terms of incremental brand awareness and top of mind. Great. And as a follow-up, my follow-up question, just on the decision to start charging a transaction fee on the digital wallet in Argentina, I believe you said. But could you just help us with that thought process? Like, why do it now when you’re still at an early stage of adoption? Do you feel like you can start charging the transaction fee and it won’t slow growth or is there more that you’ve decided to sort of increase or sort of drive more profitability and slow down growth a little, if you could just comment on that? That would be great. Hi, Marvin, this is Osvaldo. So I think it’s two things. On the one hand, we believe we are offering an unbelievable good value proposition. We continue to believe that after this price increase, this will be a hell of a good value proposition. We will continue to be the cheapest electronic payment method in the market. We will charge 0.6% for both stored balance and debit cards, and this is cheaper than the going rate everybody pays for debit cards in Argentina, which is 0.9%. So we see really it’s a huge value proposition, and we also think that it was worth doing it as a proof of concept and to test the market and see how they start are okay with starting to pay transaction fees for these, for QR Code payments. Yes. And just complementing that and I think it is important is we are committed to investing behind the business if we know that there is actually an attractive business behind that. And so we felt that in Argentina, we had enough traction with the free product that it was time to start monetizing and also to make sure that we start building out a business that’s sustainable in profit over the long term. And I think that’s a reflection of how we’ve always approached our businesses and that hasn’t changed. What’s changed, I think, is just our desire to use the scale we have and the capital we have to invest aggressively to really gain users and then to, as rapidly as we can without hurting that long-term growth, beginning to monetize and actually build out a sustainable business. So that’s what we do in credit. It’s what we are beginning to do in QR. It’s what we do in MPOS. It’s what we have always done in merchant services. Great. Thank you, guys. Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom Champion with Cowen. Your line is now open. Hi, good afternoon guys. Thanks. Thanks for taking the question. Just to ask can you comment on any marketplace buyer changes in Brazil since the launch of Prime in mid-September. And also what’s the status of the courier strike? Has that been resolved or does it remain ongoing or did it flow into 4Q? And then on the payment side, the QR network appears to be a real important frequency lever with the wallet in Argentina. I am just curious if it’s available at this point in Brazil? Thank you. Look, I think we haven’t seen any changes in our business attributable to anything that’s happened on the Prime front. It’s very, very early stage. I would say we compete with them very aggressively and head-on in Mexico. I think we like what we are seeing from how our business continues to perform there. Brazil, I would say there is a very, very big difference between the business we have and the business they are running. And so I don’t think we attribute anything to whatever was launched by a competitor during the quarter. Correios strike is over. Obviously, it had an impact on our business. I think we said in the ballpark of 2% of GMV growth in the quarter. It was only a few days, so obviously the impact in the month of September was larger than that. I think the silver lining to this is unlike the last time Correios had a strike, our managed network, we were able to move volume away from Correios towards the managed network. That’s one of the reasons why we saw the strong improvement in managed network adoption in Brazil during the quarter. And increasingly going forward, every time this happens again, I think we will be better and better prepared to simply move volume away from whoever has an operational complication to other carriers. We can already do that in Argentina and Mexico quite well. In Brazil, there is still significant reliance on Correios but that’s waning at a very consistent pace month-on-month. In regards to QR Code network, as you mentioned, Tom, definitely, it has been a frequency lever in Argentina and we have seen that across the Mercado Pago ecosystem but those users who use QR Codes do more transactions every month. In Brazil, what has happened so far is, remember, we actually launched during the second quarter. In the third quarter, they’re very excited with the acceleration transactions on of monthly active payers and monthly active sellers we have seen. So we are very excited about that acceleration. But most of that acceleration has been driven by new users and new sellers joining the network followed by an increase in frequency. If it involves as it is in Argentina, the first thing that needs to happen is for the popularity to increase for there to be more payment options available and then we should see increase in frequency. Got it. Thank you, guys. Thank you. Our next question comes from John Coffey with Susquehanna. Your line is now open. Hi, thank you getting me in. As I remember from previous calls and maybe I am forgetting something that your cross-border transactions were fairly minimal. I thought I recall there were some transactions between countries like Brazil and maybe China, I know you have called it out a little bit more in these call. I was wondering if you could just walk me through a few basic use cases of some cross-border transactions you would have today or are planning in the near future. And the last question, just also a pretty short one as far as your marketing spend in Q3, should we figure this as a little bit more bursty or could this be a new trajectory that we might see going ahead in the next few quarters? Thanks. So just one clarification, when we refer to cross-border here, the focus is really on cross-border commerce. So, it’s more on our retail business. What we are trying to do there is to offer a cross-border solution that unlike the more prevalent ones, really focus on companies that have global merchant bases and then push product globally in how we can leverage our existing marketplace and the benefits of that marketplace locally to bring in inventory, not so much intra-Latin America but primarily from Asian merchants and North American merchants but deeply integrated into some of the assets that we have built on the marketplace. So when I mentioned earlier, I think Bob’s question around tying cross-border trade to the user experience it’s how can we leverage the assets we build in logistics to get those cross-border items to your doorstep a lot faster than you would if you were buying on some of the other global platforms. How can we use local teams we have to really facilitate and expedite tariffs and customs processes so it’s less of a hassle for people purchasing on the platform. And the idea then is to get global inventory to the doorsteps of Latin American consumers. It’s not so much focused on payments. Look, marketing, again we don’t guide, I think we’ve given you guys a thought process on why we think the timing is right to pick up the pace of marketing investments. Very obvious on the FinTech space, we’re attacking many different fronts simultaneously. QR network, MPOS, cards, merchant services, and we see tremendous opportunity here and we want to make sure that we invest behind it and we need to build out the brand. And then on the marketplace, because of all the improvements we’ve made, we think it makes sense to strengthen some of the brand attributes, communicate some of the new brand attributes. Going forward, I think a lot will depend on the performance and what we see in the data around these investments. Brand investments are not performance-like that you can see immediate impact. We will be tracking key numerical KPIs through surveys, through direct site organic traffic and other ways, but we need to give it a little bit more time to see what the residual impact of those brand investments are. And I think based on that, we will have a clearer sense of how we continue to invest going forward. So I think you guys should focus every quarter on what we did during the quarter rather than forward-looking. Thank you. Our next question comes from Richard Cathcart with Bradesco. Your line is now open. Hi, guys. Good evening. I wanted to ask about the managed network in Brazil and specifically kind of what behavior you are seeing from consumers that are receiving their products via the managed network. Clearly, I think they are getting a better service than via Correios, and so I think what I’m trying to get at is if you are seeing any kind of improvement in frequency or conversion as they continue to increasingly receive products from the managed network? Yes. So look, we are beginning to see some of the numerical flow-through of the benefits of the managed network in Brazil. So lead times are becoming cheaper than – faster than the rest of the other alternatives, transportation costs are coming down. So it’s becoming cheaper to deliver packages across the network, although it’s still far from full capacity. And perhaps most importantly to your question, Net Promoter Scores are now higher on the managed network than away from it. At this point, roughly 6 points higher and tracking to widening that spread. Conversions are a little bit more difficult to measure because there is a lot of other stuff that impacts conversion so the tests haven’t been as conclusive there. But again, I think we are increasing the convinced on both the immediate and also long-term benefits of the managed network versus the old DropShip network. Thanks very much. And if I may just a quick follow-up for Osvaldo, I think, I wanted to ask about the promotions, the discounts that you’ve been offering to consumers to use the Mercado Pago wallet. Can you just give us a little bit of color about kind of what you are learning from those discounts and promotions and kind of how that is impacting users’ behavior? Thank you. Sure, Richard. Let me tell you about our experience in Argentina, which probably is what we are using as a base for what we are doing now in Brazil and Mexico. When we started in Argentina, we started with always on promotions so every time you went to get in a store you would get a promotion. Then we switched off to every time – these stores or payers would go lighthouses with other larger merchants, we are giving you a discount the first time you paid in each of those. And we are at that stage now in Brazil. And eventually in Argentina we were able to diminish the amount of promotion we did. The first month we did this stop doing promotions, there was a little bit of a slowdown but a month after that, we were growing at the same rate as we were before, we’re at very similar rate. So we are following that playbook in Brazil early on which had won to add as many sellers and as many buyers as possible, payers as possible and eventually, we will focus on improving and making more efficient the discounts. Okay. Thanks very much, guys. Thank you. Our final question comes from Rodrigo Nistor with Itau. Your line is now open. Hi, thank you for taking my questions. Regarding the shipping in Brazil, if you can give us more color on the steps you are taking to increase the consumer penetration and which are the main obstacles you are facing there? Thank you. Okay, great. So I think like we said the level of fulfillment penetration really began to pickup again from a low base but nearly doubled sequentially this quarter. I think it’s been a combination of solving some of the friction around sending inventory to us, building better tools for sellers, building more efficient pickup routes, more frequent pickup routes and then combined with economic incentives that we did offer. So I think we were kind of stuck for two quarters there without too many improvements in adoption. We begin to see that pickup again and I think our level of confidence right now that we will continue to scale out our fulfillment network and also our cross-docking network is pretty good. Thank you. This concludes today’s question-and-answer session. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating.

Now, let me turn the call over to Pedro. Hello everyone. And thank you for joining our fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call. We´ve wrapped up another successful year with a strong fourth quarter. Our business continues to deliver solid growth across both the commerce and fintech divisions, with good execution across multiple regions, solidifying our position as a regional leader in the digital landscape. These results have been achieved in a context of social volatility, increasing competition, and mixed macroeconomic performance throughout our markets.
All this highlights the immense opportunity still present as e-commerce and digital financial services continue to penetrate the economies of Latin American countries. As we have said over the years, we are still in the early stages of a long journey, and are as convinced as ever in the value creating potential of Mercado Libre in the years to come.
With that brief intro, let’s begin with our fintech progress report for the quarter. On a consolidated basis, FX neutral total payment volume continued accelerating during the quarter to 98.5% year-on-year growth, while it also accelerated in all our main geographies. This was mostly driven by off-platform services, which accounted for 78% of total TPV growth.
On-platform total payment volume in Argentina and Mexico also accelerated on a sequential basis, reaching 107.6% and 53.4% year-on-year growth on an FX neutral basis, respectively, leading to total on platform payment volume growth of 46% on an FX neutral basis.
Off-marketplace total payment volume represented 54.7% of total TPV during the fourth quarter, and continued to grow triple digits on a consolidated basis, reaching FX neutral growth of 175.8% year-on-year.
Let’s now break this growth story down by initiative, starting with our mPOS side of the business. The mPos business continues to make strides, as FX neutral TPV grew at 126% year-on-year on a consolidated basis during the quarter. Additionally, for the full year 2019 we had 3.8 million active merchants processing payments through our Mercado Point devices on a consolidated basis.
Our mPOS business in Brazil continues to accelerate in number of transactions reaching 61.3 million during the quarter, translating into a growth of 127.7% year-over-year. The performance of our Point Pro device was a highlight, reaching peak in sales during the month of November, where we have seen a strong migration from Point Mini devices to the more sophisticated type of devices, the Point Pro.
During the fourth quarter, Point Pro sales grew at 44% quarter-on-quarter as it gained awareness and continues to expand our sales efforts geared at targeting larger merchants still within the long tail segment.
On a consolidated basis, we reached 88.5 million transactions processed by our mPos devices during the fourth quarter, representing a growth of 160% year-over-year and 36% sequentially Q-on-Q.
Moving on to the wallet initiatives, it achieved an important milestone during the fourth quarter with TPV surpassing the $1 billion mark, reaching $1.3 billion, and gaining share of volume in the off-platform segment to 26% of total TPV on a consolidated basis.
The buildout of both collectors and payers using our wallet services continues to fire on all cylinders. During the quarter we reached almost 8 million active payers and 2.4 million active collectors, representing a growth in users of 29.4% in the payers metric Q-on-Q and 51.6% in the collectors metric also Q-on-Q on a consolidated basis.
Another highlight during the quarter was improved user frequency in all geographies, reaching 7.7 payments per quarter, with Argentina still leading at 12 payments per unique payer during Q4. Additionally, we are beginning to see both in Argentina and Brazil an increment in users carrying out multiple payment flows throughout the quarter.
Still on mobile wallet in Argentina, during the fourth quarter, we have begun to monetize wallet payments in that country, with a 60 basis points merchant discount rate. We are not observing significant churn neither across merchants nor payers as such cost is still more competitive than funding payments with either debit or credit cards. This is a positive initial validation of the potential our wallet as a long-term sustainable business model.
Within wallet, we are also encouraged by the execution and buildout of our QR network, as it reached almost $0.5 billion in TPV during the quarter and represented 18 million transactions. We are also proud to announce on this front that our QR network has already surpassed the 2 million active payers mark in Argentina and the 1 million active payers mark in Brazil.
Growth in QR payers was also strongly driven by our ongoing efforts to onboard merchants accepting Mercado Pago QR codes and hence expand payment usage cases within the QR functionality.
During the fourth quarter we had 1,6 million active QR merchants on a consolidated basis, representing a quarterly increase of 67.2%, roughly evenly split between Brazil and Argentina, our two main geographies at this point.
Growth in active collectors was also strong as we onboarded high quality merchants during the quarter such as Starbucks in Argentina, 7-Eleven in Mexico, as well as good performance from existing merchants such as McDonalds, Burger King, Cinemark and other lighthouse clients in Brazil.
During 2019, as part of our wallet initiative, we have ramped up distribution of prepaid cards to our users. These cards are linked to wallet account balances. This card business is still in an early stage, but beginning to ramp as we place greater resources behind the initiative.
Since inception, we have issued almost 4.5 million prepaid cards. On a consolidated basis, versus the same quarter last year, we have almost doubled the TPV processed on prepaid cards and also the amount of cards distributed and expect sustained strong levels of growth going forward.
Moving on to merchant services. The business continues to grow at a healthy pace both in number of transactions, as well as in total payment volume, delivering 95% year-on-year FX Neutral TPV growth, as well as 95% year-on-year growth in the total number of payments.
We have continued adding active merchants to our online payments offering outside of the MELI marketplace being able to deliver over 350,000 net new adds for this business versus the previous quarter.
Continuing, a quick update on the credit business, Mercado Credito. Overall, the credit business has continued on a steady pace of originations during the quarter as we continued strengthening our value proposition for both online and offline merchants, as well as for our buyers. Consequently, our credits portfolio grew 92% year-on-year in U.S. dollars to $212.6 million on a consolidated basis.
Additionally, we have reversed negative bad debt ratios from prior Qs in Brazil, reducing by half our default rates quarter-on-quarter. The improvement in bad debt was a consequence of strengthening our risk models on new cohorts, while at the same time intensifying and improving our collection efforts.
We continue moving forward with our credit product rollout throughout the region. In Argentina we launched personal loans, where users can solicit a credit line from Mercado Libre not associated with a specific product purchase. In Mexico, we launched consumer credits with encouraging results as the product already accounted for 32% of originations in that country.
We have also continued expanding funding sources for our credits business during the quarter. In order to be able to further scale these businesses without using our own balance sheet, in Argentina, we have securitized our first consumer credit trust, while in Mexico we launched our first trust with Goldman Sachs to fund our merchant credit loans.
We feel enthusiastic about our credit business in Mexico, given the combination of low bankarization rates and the high demand we see for credit products like the ones we offer both to merchants and consumers.
We have also made meaningful inroads on the customer retention and loyalty front during the quarter. More specifically, we have started integrating Mercado Pago wallet uses and products into our loyalty program, Mercado Puntos.
We have expanded loyalty rewards to QR payments and other usage cases with Mercado Pago, where historically discounts and points were exclusively geared towards free shipping and other benefits only for marketplaces. This should help increase our engagement and retention within our ecosystems, as well as enhance our couponing and cross selling capabilities.
Still on the engagement and retention front, we have also launched our discount central product, which offers our user base both merchant funded discounts on items on our marketplaces, as well as discounts for our buyers purchases through our mobile wallet both online and offline, differentiated by loyalty level.
During 2020 we aspire to progressively add more benefits to our program to enhance the value proposition to our users and also leverage the data we are generating so that we can not only personalize the customer experience even further, but also enable us to create targeted marketing campaigns to increase our bonds with our users.
Finally on fintech, during the fourth quarter we have reached a commercial agreement with PayPal that builds upon their investment on MercadoLibre announced on March 12th of last year.
We are beginning to explore together how to unlock more payment options for millions of Brazilian and Mexican PayPal buyers, as well as boosting our reach and international scale by expanding payment options for our own users abroad leveraging the scale and merchant depth of PayPal. We are pleased with the comprehensive nature of our partnership and look forward to continued collaboration with PayPal.
Let’s now move on to some of the high points from our marketplace business. Starting with Net Promoter scores, as they improved significantly during the quarter as we continue the improvements to our logistics network that are resulting in faster delivery times, and consequently higher customer satisfaction. Versus last year, Net Promoter Scores increased by 13.3 percentage points, and 3.3 percentage points versus the third quarter of 2019.
Consolidated GMV accelerated to 40% growth year-on-year on an FX neutral basis driven by performance in Argentina and Mexico. At $3.9 billion, it was the strongest quarter ever, highlighting the still nascent stage of e-commerce penetration in the region and continued run rate for long-term growth of our business.
Brazilian growth this quarter was sequentially flat, at 23.4% on an FX neutral basis year-on-year. This slightly above market growth was impacted by weak Black Friday/Seasonal Campaign performance in November and December stemming primarily from our decision to prioritize ROI and not invest as aggressively as we did in Q3 around those campaigns and a slowdown in our consumer electronics and auto parts categories.
Despite this, we also saw multiple positive signs. Sold items growth accelerated to 25% year-on-year up from 18.5% during the prior quarter. We have also begun to see acceleration in categories where we see opportunity to gain penetration, since they under index our consolidated market share, such as cellphone, televisions, among others. And the number of unique buyers also continues to show improvement, accelerating sequentially to 25% year-on-year during the fourth quarter.
We remain focused on driving growth through user experience improvements, incremental logistics capabilities, expansion of selection and price competitiveness. We trust that our business in Brazil still has enormous growth potential going forward as we improve on those key drivers for long-term success.
Moving on to Mexico, growth in that market was very strong during the quarter. GMV accelerated to 53% year-on-year on an FX neutral basis. Successful execution was attributable to three main initiatives; fulfillment operations that continue to scale and deliver improved delivery times; marketing investments that in contrast to Brazil did accompany an aggressive seasonal promotional campaigns; and continued improvements in product assortment, as live listings grew almost 80% year-on-year reaching 48 million.
Argentine GMV continued to accelerate for the second consecutive quarter on an FX neutral basis reaching 109.4% year-over-year and 31% year-on-year in U.S. dollar. Excellent performance during promotional seasonal dates, improvements in marketing campaigns efficiency and the inflationary pass-through effects to item cost when measured on a local currency basis explain the solid GMV growth we delivered this quarter in that country.
Frequency of items sold continues to improve in all geographies, with Mexico leading the way with a frequency of purchase of 6.13 purchases per unique buyer, representing a 11.2% improvement quarter on quarter, mostly driven by a higher penetration of our consumer packaged goods category and a general increase in items of lower value due to the relaunch of our shopping cart feature. CPG initiative continues delivering 2x the growth of the marketplace.
Consolidated unique buyers continued to deliver a healthy clip of growth, accelerating in all major geographies. Assortment also continues to deepen, surpassing 270 million live listings during the quarter. In this respect, it is important to highlight that Brazil re-accelerated it’s live listings growth after more than three quarters of deceleration.
During the fourth quarter, Official stores represented almost 15% of total GMV. We are feeling increasingly confident about becoming a key partner to traditional brick-and-mortar retailers and consumer brands on their omnichannel strategies.
Official stores are contributing in the transformation of our platform to become an increasingly more attractive shopping destination with deeper branded assortment. In Brazil we onboarded 60 new official stores during the fourth quarter including Apple, Michelin, Under Armor, Carrefour, among others. In other regions we also added some relevant new official stores such as Electrolux in Chile and Xiaomi in Colombia.
Moving on to one of the critical flywheel of our enhanced marketplace, logistics. We continue to have a wide free shipping offering in our marketplace with 62% of volume purchased and roughly 50% of units being delivered at no shipping cost to consumers.
Mercado Envios managed network penetration reached 43% on a consolidated basis. We have also opened nine additional service centers in Mexico and nine in Brazil, allowing us to have faster delivery times and lower costs of transportation. Additionally, during the fourth quarter we opened 335 drop off points in Brazil for our merchant base.
These drop off points make it easier to on board merchants to our Managed Network as they eliminate the need for pick up at a merchant location, thereby helping us to continue to decrease our reliance on more expensive and less reliable dropship solutions.
Geographically, our Brazilian Fulfillment operation almost doubled its penetration versus the prior quarter reaching an average quarterly penetration of 12%. Argentina doubled its fulfillment penetration reaching 10% of total shipped volume, while Mexico also continued scaling this service reaching 42% penetration.
Another key point in Brazil is that we were able to continue to diminish our dependancy to a single carrier. In fact, during the quarter we lowered our exposure to our largest carrier by 12 percentage points versus the third quarter in 2019.
Our Flex solution, where we leverage the logistics capabilities of our existing merchants is now available in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Chile, and we look forward to rolling out this service during the first quarter of 2020 in Uruguay as well.
Flex in Argentina were at first launched, reached already 12% of items shipped for the entire country, with almost 60% of those deliveries being done same day and 40% next day. The success of this service in Argentina is encouraging us to further leverage in this type of shipping solution in our other regions in order to lower delivery times and costs even more.
On a consolidated basis Mercado Envios continued improving logistics KPI’s. During the fourth quarter, we reached an important milestone, as we are now delivering over half of our volume though Mercado Envios in less than 48 hours, mainly driven by improvements in Brazil 5 percentage points quarter-on-quarter and Argentina 9 percentage points quarter-on-quarter, and have lowered total delivery times by nearly 20% year-over-year.
In relation to average cost per order, we have also continued to improve unit cost, lowering it by 14% quarter-on-quarter driven by a broader penetration of smaller 3PL partners, where re-negotiated contracts to reflect our increased volume and also performed enhancements to our network design.
In Brazil alone we reduced on average $1 per order as a consequence of the implementation of these operational improvements.
Before moving on to a review of our P&L for the quarter, I’d like to take a minute to speak about the progress we have made around our branding investments that meaningfully increased during H2 of 2019.
Having started the branding journey during the second half of last year and recognizing that building a brand is a long-term initiative, we are already starting to see a positive evolution in the brand equity of Mercado Libre, with positive growth in the overall brand power indexes in Mexico, Brazil and Chile, while maintaining a high-value gap versus the competition in Argentina and Uruguay. Additionally, branding initiatives have impacted significantly certain relevant brand attribute perceptions such as quality, trust and time of delivery in our major geographies.
Now that I have covered the main highlights and business KPI’s for the quarter, let’s move on to our financial results. Following our capital raise in 2019, we have continued to invest in our growth initiatives, which includes sales and marketing.
During the fourth quarter, gross billings continued to maintain strong momentum growing on an FX neutral basis 59.1%, while 36.4% in U.S. dollars. Consolidated net revenues grew faster than gross billings both on an FX neutral basis and the U.S. dollar basis, growing to 84.4% year-on-year and 57.5%, respectively, and reaching $674.3 million as we continue to optimize shipping subsidies and costs, minimize contra revenues from free shipping programs. As you will recall, our growing logistics operations is a core part of our long-term strategy.
Gross profit was $308.3 million, representing 45.7% of revenues during the quarter down from 47.8% a year ago. This 211 basis points margin compression was driven for the most part by warehousing costs from our fulfillment operations and the incremental inventory costs from the robust sales of mPos devices, which were partially offset by collection fee improvements, sales taxes and hosting fee efficiencies.
On a sequential basis, the 142 basis points margin compression is explained for the most part, by incremental shipping subsidies to promote adoption of our logistics network during the fourth quarter. We have included a detailed breakdown as we do every quarter of these and also the OpEx margin evolution I am about to cover in the slides that accompany this presentation.
Operating expenses ascended to $377 million or 56% of revenues versus 48% during the fourth quarter of 2018. On a sequential basis, operating expenses increased by only $11 million, which resulted in sequential margin improvement of 479 basis points, mostly attributed to efficiencies in marketing expenses and improvements in bad debt ratios.
Operating losses declined to $68.9 million. The 479 basis points improvement that I just explained plus the 142 basis points gross margin contraction covered earlier in COGS lead to a sequential improvement of 337 basis points in EBIT margin.
Moving down the P&L, we saw $21.2 million in financial expenses mainly attributable to secured financial loans and interest expenses from our trusts related to our factoring in Argentina. Interest income increased by 88.4% year-on-year to $26.9 million as a result of equity offering during 2019, which generated more invested volume and interest gain and a higher float in Argentina as well.
Net loss for the quarter ascended to $54 million. On a per share basis, all this resulted in a basic net loss per share of $1.11.
Reflecting on our 2019, we remain very encouraged by the performance of our businesses overall and remain excited about the opportunities that lie ahead of us. Our company continued to hold its position as the largest regional e-commerce and payments platform, hitting multiple milestones during the year.
GMV of $14 billion growing at 34% on a FX neutral basis, TPV of $28.4 billion growing at 92% on a FX neutral basis, revenues of $2.3 billion growing at 92% on a FX neutral basis, achieving 44.2 million unique buyers, 11.2 million unique sellers, 71.1 million unique payers, 15 million unique collectors, and delivering Net Promoter Scores that improved by 3 percentage points year-on-year in commerce and by 7.3 in payments.
In delivering these results, we have sought to maintain a manageable and sustainable balance between growth and investments, which for the full year led to a net loss of $172 million.
We believe we are investing appropriately behind the right growth initiatives, building superior experiences and products for our consumers and merchants, while staying focused on our long-term goal of democratizing commerce and money throughout Latin America.
The sustained momentum we see gives us the confidence to move on to a phase where we continue to prioritize growth, but with a greater focus on driving cost efficiencies and scale benefits through our P&Ls and the P&L of the larger and more consolidated countries we operate. This will be one of main objectives for 2020.
Before wrapping up the earnings call, I’d like to add one more comment. We are very proud to communicate that this year will be the first in which we will release our sustainability report simultaneously with our annual report.
Our commitment to sustainability has a strong connection with how we envision our business serving all our stakeholders and also reflects that we take sustainability matters seriously. The report includes our sustainability metrics on key initiatives that include diversity, social inclusion, labor practices, energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions and waste management amongst others.
We feel we have delivered another great year and our 2019 results leave us on a strong footing to pursue our strategic objectives in 2020 and beyond. We remained focused on disciplined execution against our priorities and moving our business forward.
As 2020 begins, we find ourselves operating in a macroenvironment characterized by greater variability. In that respect, we see that we have a well-diversified portfolio of products and markets in which we operate, which should leave us on firmer footing should economic conditions change.
We remain committed to our long-term financial and operational objectives and are confident that the strength of our business, flexibility of our balance sheet and operational discipline will allow us to continue delivering value to our shareholders.
We look forward as always to keeping you updated on our progress next quarter, and we would like to take your questions now [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan of Barclays. Your line is open. Hey guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Two questions from us. So, first, can you elaborate on the competitive landscape in Brazil, you have talked about lower ROIs in November and December. Is that due to seasonal promotions or a more sustained kind of competitive actively, maybe talk about elite trends in Jan in that context? And then is the growth rates that you are seeing currently in Brazil, a reasonable proxy for how we should expect due to manage the business going forward? Thank you. Hi Deepak. So, let me take it in reverse order the first part. When we referred to the decision to invest less aggressively around seasonal campaigns because of ROI, that is in part a consequence of how aggressively traditional retailers invest around Q4 seasonal campaigns both for their online businesses and their offline businesses, which does change the ROI profile of investing at those points. So, I don’t think it’s one or the other. The ROI around the seasonal movements is very much driven by the level of investments of others.
On general comparative trends, I think, like we have always said, I think to look at this as a zero-sum game is probably missing the bigger picture. This is still early stage. I think what we need to remain focused on are the initiatives we have put in place since the third quarter to see if we can reaccelerate growth in Brazil.
I think we said last quarter and we reiterated in the tone of the remarks this quarter that although we are still growing above the market, we aspire to be able to trigger and find catalysts to grow at a faster clip than low 20s and that’s a lot of the stuff we are working on continue to focus on our logistics efforts, which are showing phenomenal results, although not necessarily flowing through the GMV, certainly flowing through to units cost, time of delivery and NPS.
And then other areas we have been working on the launch of our one piece sales, private label, improvements and Net Promoter Scores as a consequence of a lot of the things we are doing. And then where GMV numbers and if and when they begin to react going forward we will have to cover that as we give you guys quarterly updates throughout the year.
I think right now, we are confident with a lot of the initiatives, but clearly as you can see from the numbers and they are what they are they aren’t yet impacting in any acceleration versus prior quarter of Brazilian GMV. Okay. Thanks Pedro. Very helpful. Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Olson of Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Hey. Good afternoon. Just one question for me, you mentioned it briefly, but could you talk about how you are thinking about weighing the balance between growth and profitability just across the Board in the coming quarters. Specifically, I guess, is there potential to drive leverage and maybe the marketplace business as you continue to invest in payments or how are you thinking about the mix there and then maybe more directly, should we expect the company to return to breakeven or operating profitability sometime in the next few quarters or four quarter to six quarters, or how would you think about that? Thanks. Okay. With the usual clarification about us not guiding, let me walk you through some of our thought process and thanks for asking the question in terms of a matrix of decisions, because we look at the business first of all in different geographies, and obviously, our geographies are in different stages of development and have different level of scale.
So larger geographies and more mature markets as you can see from how we try to manage the P&L in the fourth quarter. We are more focused on always prioritizing growth but greater focus also on sustainable P&Ls and you see that in Brazil, where the equilibrium between growth and profitability perhaps weighs more than other markets towards the bottomline.
And then on top of that, there’s a second layer to the matrix which is our payments business and our retail business that are at very different stages of development, and obviously, we are seeing incredible results in many of our fintech initiatives and want to make sure that we continue to invest behind those. So it really is a geo-by-geo and product-by-product decision.
I think in general terms as some of the larger markets and especially on the marketplace gain scale and gain a certain level of maturity. They begin to get a greater focus on bottomline management as well. I think if you look at some of the remarks towards the end that’s the phase we are in.
And if we think of ‘20 versus ‘19 still growth is the most important thing, we also have to make sure that we are nimble to react to competitive scenarios, but there is greater focus on trying to start to drive some operational leverage from the size that a lot of these businesses already have. Great. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Edward Yruma of KeyBanc. Your line is open. Hey. Good evening, and thanks for taking for the question. On the decision to start merchant discount rate, I guess what drove the decision in that market and how quickly do you think you can extend it to other markets. And as a follow up how does that change the profitability profile of the fintech’s product? Thank you. Excuse me, can you please repeat the question. Yeah. The question was in regards to charging discount rates in Argentina, I guess, how -- what drove the decision that you enter that market first, how quickly can you expand it and how does it changes the profitability of the fintech overall? Thank you. Great. So let me take a stab at that. So we have always… Sorry about that. Can you hear me now? …making sure that once some of these businesses reached enough traction that we introduce a monetization model to it. In Argentina, clearly, was the first market where we launched the wallet in the QR network. It’s gained significant traction as we disclosed some numbers in the prepared remarks.
And so we felt confident that it was the right time to launch a monetization model there. It’s important that that monetization model still make the wallet in the QR the most cost effective settlement for merchants so a lot of that pricing is driven in comparison to other payment networks but we felt it was time to start charging.
The results so far are positive. We continue to see strong traction despite the 60 bps of MDR and it’s a first step towards improving the profitability of that business. I don’t think you should read into this as fintech will become immediately profitable. There’s still investment behind wallet. But it does validate I think the direction of this as something that even with the monetization model overlaid onto it still continues to work very well.
And it also does guide our thinking in terms of other markets, so the expectation should be that as other markets reach a certain level of merchant acceptance and wallet user we will follow a similar path to Argentina and launch an initial level of monetization on top of that. Great. And one quick follow-up if I may, you had some nice improvement in trend on the Brazilian credit business. I know you had some issues in charge-offs last quarter. I guess what drove the improvement and have you changed your under writing standards in that market? Thank you. Hi. This is Osvaldo. So after having the -- after seeing an increase in the full rates in the prior quarter is what we did was remodeled and we used all of -- we did the new models on the one hand and that improved significantly the default rates in the new cohorts and also we made more efforts in -- more collection efforts. We strengthened the collections engines and collection team and both two things drove the increase in performance in grades in the fourth quarter. Okay. Thanks so much. Thank you our next question is comes from Andrew Ruben of Morgan Stanley. Your question please. Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So it seems like you guys have made a pretty big push forward with Brazil logistics also the brand marketing and making a lot of progress there. I am just wondering how you think about the timing for payback on these initiatives. I know maybe during the peak Black Friday promotion period maybe it gets lost, but any signs of an uplift and an impact from these initiatives after we get past that Black Friday period? Thank you. I think we need to separate both of those. The investments in logistics are certainly long-term investments and what I mean by long-term is not that we don’t see any lift. I think we are already beginning to see the different impact of everything we have done in logistics, cost per unit has been coming down, delivery lead times have been reducing and we do see flow through of all that in the Net Promoter Scores.
We didn’t necessarily see over the last two quarters the subsequent acceleration in GMV, but there are lots of data points that we think are a reflection of all the network logistics build-out that’s occurred. Even the reacceleration in units is partially driven by improved logistics capability of boxes and lower cost on logistics.
The marketing, I think, we said when we started the acceleration in spend that we were going to focus on creating brand marketing primarily for Pago, but also aggressively for the marketplace to communicate some of these new benefits and these new product features related to MELI.
You did see in Q4, a slight tilt towards more MercadoPago than in Q3. So although the overall numbers didn’t moved slightly down, when you look at between payments and end marketplace, there is actually an uptick in brand investments for payments, where you are going to see the impact of all that in payment volume and wallet, and in some of the metrics we shared.
And the marketing spend on market place primarily in Brazil was actually down quite a bit sequentially. It was up in Mexico, that’s usually one quarter behind in terms of sequencing and also in the earlier stage market.
So the impact from the marketing, I would say, we still need to hold off on that and see whether all those brand investments on marketplace eventually can be another factor to accelerate GMV or not something that we saw this quarter in the case of Brazil, the remnant from the previous quarter.
If you look at Mexican topline growth it was extremely strong. Again, how much of that attribute to logistics to marketing, not always that easy to isolate but Mexico did have very strong GMV in top line numbers. Very helpful. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. So, yeah, thank you. So can you talk about your efforts in the -- I guess the FMCG consumer packaged goods. I guess more that the everyday household goods categories. I recall there has been a push to do more in this segment a few years ago. But where are now in terms of this as a percentage of GMV at this point, and as a result, are you finding that this is helping you to have a more engaged buyer base with perhaps a faster purchase velocity. But also I think building on I guess your earlier comments about the logistics for it. You talk about the footprint expansion plans in 2020 in Brazil, and perhaps, the other regions particularly as you look down, or look to take down the dependency on the single carriers and ultimately where do you think that dependency could go to longer term? Thanks. Great. So the FMCG category or the CPG categories I think are beginning to show some interesting signs especially in Mexico. It’s basically growing at 2x year-on-year in terms of units in that category in Mexico. It’s still small-ish in the mid-single digits Argentina as well, but growing incredibly well and slowly beginning to become more and more relevant.
There’s still a lot of work we need to do there in terms of both the user experience, but also sourcing of products. We began in Mexico to mix marketplace inventory with 1p inventory in CPG as well, which makes us more competitive and gives us more control over the category.
So, I would say that still not as large as we aspire it to become and it is a high frequency category as you indicate, but definitely showing signs of life in Mexico where we started now in the process of replicating that to Argentina and Brazil that are, I would say, a phase behind where Mexico is.
On logistics footprint rollout, incremental warehouses in Brazil I think we have signaled in the past probably two more for the next quarters one in the north, one in the south. But there’s a myriad of last mile hubs and saltation centers that are getting rolled out both in Brazil and Mexico.
We gave an indication in the prepared remarks at the pace at which we are adding these last mile nodes to the network and we really are beginning to see positive signs in terms of cost coming down and lead times accelerating.
I think a secondary benefit of this which is the one you are alluding to is that it also gives us the ability to rely less and less on any single carrier because as we control the network and the nodes in the network, we can switch carriers on and off.
I think the end game solution here is not necessarily to not use any single carrier even when we think of the state run carrier for many, many routes they are very cost efficient. But really what’s important here is to not depend on any one single carrier.
So I think if we think long-term, we would like to -- we would aspire to be able to still use carriers that are cost efficient, but to be able to switch away from them if need to be, and I think, we continue to progress very positively in that direction. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Marcelo Santos of JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Two questions actually. On the monetization of the wall that is in Argentina. I was looking at the Brazilian website and it also shows that you are charging a fee, I think, is almost 1% for money coming from the wallet account and then there are different fees for their credit card. So could you talk a bit about the introduction of these fees in Brazil. Is this broad based or I was just looking because I answered maybe testing screeners you know and then not everybody’s been charged. And my feeling was that the Argentina wallet was way more advanced, so whatever your like rational will introduce this in Brazil and what to expect in this layout?
And the second question would be about potential China disruption, for sure you self-clearing the term or how your business till that time. But perhaps a lot of your sellers who sourced from China, so how do you expect to see any impact from China and how could you think about the potential size of your exposure with that? Those are two questions. Hi, Marcelo. This is Osvaldo. So, with regards to valet, yes, as you were saying in Argentina, we started to charge product money way later. The one difference when Brazil is in Brazil you were giving away for free credit card transactions too and those have a higher MDR.
So what we are doing now is we started to dodge the flat fee of 1% regardless of the payment method and we see that is similar to what our competitors are doing. So we are comfortable with that decision.
But it’s at a very early stage we are just starting to do it, and of course, when we have a large work done, who are doing a deal with us we can give them special conditions for a few months and we expect the 1% to be the standard rate in Brazil. Let me try to China that one. I think there’s two impacts from China. The first one is our cross-border trade business. So our actual efforts to directly source global merchants are a strong component of that is in China. We now have commercial offices in China.
That business is still small with a lot of potential. The market where it’s gained the most traction is Mexico where it represents about 5% of GMV that is done directly through our CBT product, a very large number of that from China.
So that probably will be affected, but small direct impact given that it’s still mid-single digits of GMV. I think the indirect impact you allude to, I don’t know the answer to that. I don’t think we have quantified or attempted to quantify what the potential impact could be. Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you. Our next question comes from Gustavo Oliveira of UBS. Your question please. Hi, Pedro. Thank you for taking my question. I was actually quite surprised to see that the reduction in free shipping surface costs of $56.8 million in the quarter that was particularly well below my expectations for Brazil. I think Mexico as a percentage of cross-billings is more or like stable. And you also mentioned in your prepared remarks that the gross margin was actually affected by incentives to foster adoption of our fulfillment centers. Could you please help to clarify, maybe there was some a shift in investments from deadline from free shipping costs to the COGS line and, and whether this is something that we should refer as going forward. And what the deadline on the free shipping itself was actually important, an important driver for Mexico in terms of GMV, and therefore, you could reverse that back to, to cost owners. So just to clarify that that how you are locating your investment in shipping? Okay. Perfect. Some good questions. First of all, just to give you a sense of the consumer side to all this, okay? So I will give you guys a sense of what percentage of GMV is still sold at no shipping cost to the consumer, okay?
So, in Brazil that number was at 55% versus 64% the prior year Q4. So that’s about 9 percentage points less of GMV coverage from fully free shipping that’s probably going to be discounted shipping now. That’s what accounts for a large part of the savings in the free shipping program.
If you look at that number for Mexico, it’s actually pretty stable year-over-year. So one element of the decrease in contra revenues from free shipping is simply the optimization of the amount of free shipping given out and we have done a lot of optimization over the prior four quarters.
The second element that you allude to is the other piece to this story, which is as more and more of shipping is done from our fulfillment centers, depending on the contractual relationship with the carriers. And I am -- it’s going to get a bit technical here, but we can take it off line if you want. And depending on whether the contract allows us to deem ourselves as a principal or an agent of the transportation some of those costs become COGS.
Hence part of the gross margin compression is from what used to be contra revenues and now become shipping costs. The bigger gross margin compression is simply the actual cost of operating the warehouses and the growth of our fulfillment network, but there is some of this that goes from contra revenue to COGS. Okay. That’s very clear. Perhaps I get more details with the IR team later on. But I have just another question in Mexico and in Argentina you actually had a much higher GMV growth in the quarter than in Brazil. And in your prepared remarks you actually mentioned that you were able to place the seasonality a bit, I don’t know if it’s a bit better than in Brazil or perhaps with a better ROI that you otherwise you would have played in Brazil for more aggressive.
What can you learn from the experience you are seeing in Argentina and Mexico, it’s -- those are the countries where you also have a higher 1p business, a larger 1p business that in Brazil as well or at the most if there is any other specific reason for your better performance in these country that could allow you to bring this best practice to Brazil to help you out there? Yeah. So, I don’t think it’s a matter of better practices or better execution. That’s always part of the story, but I think it’s something else. I think if you look at the flipside to the Mexico case for example is the margin structure.
So I think the way we looked at the Black Friday and the seasonal campaigns for Mexico is it’s a smaller market than Brazil at earlier stage of Internet penetration and so we are still willing to be extremely aggressive and chase perhaps lower ROIs because we are still trying to build out that market.
So what you have there is a ramp up in marketing spend, Q-on-Q as a percentage of revenue and a very strong acceleration in revenue. When you switch over to Brazil and alluding back to a comment I made earlier that’s a market where I think the balance between growth and bottomline is somewhat more balanced, sorry for the repetition.
So in a larger market like Brazil, I think, the expectation of the marketplace business is not so much focused on growth at any cost, but growth at reasonable cost and what you saw in Brazil is flattish GMV growth year-on-year, but an improvement in margin structure for the marketplace just because it’s a larger market and we expect to start driving operational leverage there. So I don’t think it’s so much a matter of learnings to apply from one to the other. It’s simply how we manage those businesses in different phases and at different sizes. Just final one on that one, does the 1P make a difference, I mean, I think, you mentioned the consumer electronics investments in 1P in Brazil, you already have that more developed in other countries I suppose. Yeah. So, sorry, I forgot that and I think that’s also a good point. So 1P gives whoever is retailing greater control over pricing and that is a very relevant factor during peak season or discounts or holiday moments.
So we try to offset that with certain discounts and tariffs reductions to sellers to try to incentivize them to be very aggressive on pricing. But certainly it’s just a carriage to try to influence our pricing versus markets where we have 1p capability where we can actually set price and just determine what to do on gross margin. So, yes, we would argue that as our 1p business grows, it will give us an incremental tool that we don’t have today to compete around peak holiday season campaigns. Thank you, Pedro. Thank you very much. Thank you. Our next question comes from Marvin Fong of BTIG. Your question please. Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Most have been asked, but just on the growth in collectors up 67% it look like, can you I just talk about the acquisition process for collectors, do you that it’s driven more by your branding efforts or field sales force and just talk about that. And do you have a sense of what the total number of collection sites possible in Brazil and Argentina is? Thanks. Hi. In regards to collectors efforts, we are driving it in three different ways. On one hand we are doing one-on-one deals with what we call lighthouses which are the very large companies such as McDonalds or Burger King or Starbucks or supermarket chains and so on. Those don’t add a lot in terms of number of collectors but they do add in terms of feasibility and number of sites.
Then we have -- if you want a more targeted strategy in specific neighborhoods in each of the cities we would target and then we have sales force which address these areas of the city and bring in lots of spots and usually we do those at the time as providing discounts to consumers in those regions.
And the third one is more marketing driven and it’s more if you want viral and it’s people who learn about MercadoPago and I am excited about it and start trying to collect on your own. Those provide them but the vast majority in terms of collection point and usually the lower amount of transactions. And I’d say, in terms of, I don’t want to give any idea what is the total number of collectors. It’s in the millions of -- tens of millions. But I think it’s too early to tell how viral this will be. Great. Thank you. And if I could just do one follow up if your Mercado Puntos loyalty program you mentioned back could you just elaborate a little more on how that might look and how that’s going to roll out, are you going to roll it out across all your three main geographies right away or phase that in one after the other. Could you help us understand the timing of that? Thank you very much. So the loyalty program we think is a very important component of what we need to build out over the next few years and so we are certainly not thinking yet for any specific geography. There’s always some sequencing that’s more a consequence of product development and coding than strategy. But the idea really is to be able to have the loyalty program at least in the big three markets being rolled out as close to each other as possible.
The first step on this is to make sure that we include payments and marketplace which is what we began to do under a single loyalty program and where the benefits are also cross-platform. So you can use discounts on the marketplace, you could also use discounts on coupons to pay on QR networks and that was the couponing central that we mentioned in the prepared remarks.
This is early stage, but we think that this is a key differentiating factor given that we probably have the most complete ecosystem in the region and even in any of the specific countries right now of both a very large retail business, but also a very large payments and fintech business. Terrific. Thank you. Thank you both. Thank you. Our next question comes from Irma Sgarz of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Yes. Thank you for taking my question. So just going back to the growth that you are seeing to an earlier question in terms of building on the collectors side, but looking at the active payers side in the wallet you obviously saw some tremendous growth there. Could you just speak a little bit about the acquisition channels there, is that just being driven sort of partly by merchant acceptance or your marketing campaigns and are there any acquisition channels that you are leaning into a little bit more and what do you generally see in terms of just the cost of maintaining that customer or that active payer within your environment. Because there is obviously quite a bit of competition in the early stage in the market, but just for us to understand a little bit of where you are in that investment cycle? Thank you. Hi, Irma. Yes. On the payers side, I would say, it’s a combination of factors on the one hand it is a growth in merchant acceptance mostly acceptance with these merchants with both lighthouses which provide lots of visibility.
And beyond that there are things we are doing is discounts to the consumers when the first time they do a given transaction or we have a discount center where we provide discounts immediately from merchants and we are able to geo locate the consumer and provide merchants are close to them and those are starting to be funded, initially there were 100% funded in MercadoLibre and now they are partially under my MercadoLibre and in some proportion by merchants.
And with regard to the evolution of the cost of a decision, I would say, in Argentina, where we are a year and a half into QR code payments. We have been able to drive down that cost as a percentage of TPV and I planned to continue doing so. And in the case of Brazil and Mexico, I’d say, we are earlier on and so far we have not yet focused on driving these guns down, but it’s something that we will do as we move forward. Yeah. One quick follow up if I may. When you -- we think about the monetization that you have started in Argentina now or starting off in Brazil. Should we still continue to think that most of that is just being put back to drive frequency and customer acquisition and loyalty or should we start already at this stage seeing that dropdown to the bottomline? Thank you. We are in our different… Go ahead, Pedro. No. I was going to build on those of all those previous answer. I think when we look at the level of discounting per map or the percentage of total transactions that required a discount or the average percentage discount on a transaction and when we look at that for Brazil and for Argentina, we are actually seeing improvements in efficiencies over the last few quarters. So we are getting smarter at discounting and we are also needing to discount less to generate transactionality which are both very positive trends.
The offset of that to your question going forward, should we see that drop to the bottomline is that we would like to see acceleration in maps and the growing base of total maps, so that even at more efficient numbers per maps, you could see the total number grow and that was our point about wallet and especially because we are seeing positive signs is something that I think we are very willing to continue to invest behind even as we introduce a monetization model to that. Very clear. Thanks. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Colantuoni of Jefferies. Your line is open. Thanks for taking my question. Turning to a recent commercial agreement with PayPal. Can you discuss how you hope the agreement plays into your new customer acquisition, increasing conversion and overall user engagement across MELI’s overall marketplace? Thanks. Hi, John. We are very excited about agreement with PayPal. We believe that it will enable our payers to buy at many sites where -- without needing to PayPal account likewise it will enable many PayPal users to buy MercadoLibre. So I think it will be complementary.
I think that how I see it though is I expect it to drive extra volume more than necessarily adding more consumers or payers. We are very excited and we believe that it can be a significant driver of cross-border transactions and where we see lots of unexplored potential. Thanks so much. Thank you. Our next question comes from Kunal Madhukar of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. A few if I may, some quick ones. One on the collector side, impressive numbers, everything in millions or billions generally. But when you think of like a common consumer, how much of their average daily spend or average monthly spend is around these collectors or wherever you have an agreement with? And then on the payer side, how much of your active buyers on MercadoLibre are active payers also? And then a quick one on China and not like on the cross-border trade, but like most of the products and all of them, the products in consumer electronics and what have you, are essentially made in China. If the volume, if the manufacturing volume itself decreases or if the shipping volume declines, how does that affect sales in general and how would you kind of look at like next couple of quarters, if there is there is a continued decline in either manufacturing or shipping volume? Thanks. So let me walk backward from the third one. Like I said before, I think, we haven’t really done any significant work around trying to quantify a potential slowdown in China or increased problems from either Coronavirus or whatever. I think you are accurate in saying that a lot of the consumer electronics that are sold globally have a Chinese manufacturing base that we just don’t know the answer to that question.
And in terms of the collectors, I think, just to be very straightforward. In terms of overall daily usage or share of family wallets and our product is still immaterial. I think it’s showing extremely strong target traction and we are pleased to see frequency growing in each one of the markets. But it’s still very, very early stage. So it’s not a significant portion of anyone’s overall behavior.
And in part because we still need to continue to build out the merchandise. Although, the merchant base is very solid like Osvaldo said in the millions already. It’s just not widespread enough, so that I could use my digital wallet to pay everywhere I go. We aspire to continue to build that interoperability or business development deals could accelerate that, but we are not there yet.
And in terms of cross-sell or overlays, I think, we actually see that as an opportunity, when you look at the payers of our marketplace that use the MercadoPago wallet, there’s still significant room to grow the cross-sell there, so just to give you directionally a notion of this.
But I don’t think we disclosed a number in the past, but, but there’s still a lot of room to still sell our wallet capabilities to marketplace users and we think the loyalty program could be a very strong catalyst for that. Thanks Pedro. A quick follow up if I may, when you think of like, Apple Pay and we have seen a lot of like, a lot of merchants starting to accept Apple Pay and Google Pay here in the U.S. using NFC. How prevalent do you think that is right now or how aggressive are Apple Pay and Google Pay in terms of in Latin America? Kunal, I will say that, at this stage, for sure in Argentina your copayment is significantly more popular than NFC. And I would say, in general, the large networks, Visa, Mastercard are only now introducing NFC to Latin America. So I think that our growth to have a very, a faster growth than what we see in NFC. So far we have not seen any traction from either Google Pay or Apple Pay in LatAM. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Ravi Jain of HSBC. Your line is open. Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one on Logistics you mentioned you have opened a lot of drop-off clients and you are also doing fulfillment. As you scaled your managed network, how do you think that as the mix between fulfillment and cross-docking, and which one would give you the bigger competitive advantage over time? And the second one is just a follow up on the loyalty program, you mentioned that you are integrating the Pago wallet into the program. Should we also expect this to help you manage your investments into the wallet a little better, should we expect them to future the P&L investment on wallet to kind of improve? Thank you. Let me take the fulfillment one. So when we look at the relative user experience and even the preferred I think fulfillment solution for us, certainly fulfillment is better than cross-docking, because it eliminates the first mile altogether and so that accelerates lead times, drives down cost, gives us greater control and even greater lock in of the merchant because he’s sending inventory to us.
So fulfillment is for most merchants and for most products the one we would like to push more aggressively and I think Mexico is a very good example of what we would like to be able to emulate everywhere. Mexico already north of 40% of all sales are done from fulfillment.
So long-term we would like to see that continue to grow and a higher percentage of fulfillment. We don’t necessarily control all that. Cross-docking has a role to play either in the inventory that we don’t want to hold, because it doesn’t turn fast enough or it has any specific complexity or for smaller merchants were maybe sending inventory to us doesn’t make sense.
What the end game makes is we don’t know. We would like to push fulfillment as much as possible and we have, we have seen very strong success in Mexico and some really good traction in Brazil over the last quarter or so. Brazil had been somewhat flat in single digits for a while and Brazil has really been accelerating and it’s already in double digits in the teens for the quarterly average of the last quarter. And with regard to loyalty, and that it will be able, enable us to improve our, our P&L wallet, I would say, yes, in two different ways. On the one hand, we will be able -- we will -- we are starting giving an incentive in point rather than cash for people to use the wallet, so it should be -- we should be able to maintain a user base, we had an incentive that is more efficient to us because people will use the QR code payment in order to gain more points.
And on the other hand and part of the loyalty program is the discount central product. Here what we are able to do is to start sharing cost of acquiring consumers with merchants. And we have started already in Argentina in the past we used to pay 100% of the discounts and now a percentage of the discounts has been paid by merchants. So as we roll that out to Brazil and Mexico as cash cost continues to grow in those countries, we will -- we hope we will be able to share efforts with merchants there too. That’s very helpful. One last one if I may. Could you give us an idea approximately how much of your GMV’s consumer electronics maybe in Brazil are consolidated just to get an idea? Sure. One second just so that we make sure we have the latest data. It’s consolidated high-30s, low-40s. If you look at CE widely defined as most electronics. Thank you so much. Thank you. Our next question comes from John Coffey of Susquehanna. Your line is open. Hi. Thank you for taking my call. When it comes to GMV, I saw that in Brazil they had -- there’s a very modest deceleration. Do you -- how do you feel about this accelerating in the future, is this possible and if so will be the vehicles which you would have accelerate? Great. So, I guess, it comes full circle on the questions. We continue to grow slightly above market. We would like to see Brazil going faster than what it grew and we think there are a series of levers that we have already been working on that potentially could serve as catalysts for this.
We are seeing improvements in Net Promoter Scores. We are focusing on categories where our market share typically under indexes our overall market share. We have had some good success with one of the ones we focused on Q3, which was television sets. So we are replicating a lot of that playbook to a growing number of categories.
As we mentioned in some of the earlier questions, as we grow out our 1p and private label offerings, those should also allow us to be more aggressive on the pricing front which could allow things to reaccelerate.
And then again this is a tech play, so at the end of the day we truly believe that the best user experience wins and it’s not a matter of who is spending more marketing dollars or who is deeply discounting products over longer periods of time.
So again the numbers have been what they have been for the last few quarters. We continue to focus on making sure that we are innovating on behalf of our consumers, and hopefully, we can see that accelerate in the future. Okay. Thank you. Thank you.

Now, let me turn the call over to Pedro. Thank you, Federico and hello everyone, and thank you for your interest in joining MercadoLibre's first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. So given the unique circumstances the world is facing due to the coronavirus outbreak, I'd like to first address recent trends and developments followed by our standard quarterly review.
Starting in March, towards the back end of a successful first quarter in 2020, we began to observe near-term headwinds generated by the coronavirus outbreak. Although less affected than others our business did register this impact particularly in Brazil and Argentina and primarily during the first weeks of the imposed lockdowns with a rebound throughout April.
From the onset, we have taken swift and decisive action to safeguard our employees and offer our platforms as solutions to the challenges being faced by our communities. We pride ourselves in being an agile and adaptable company, whose business people and community have played an role alongside many others in facing up to the COVID-19 crisis.
Consequently, our focus has mainly been on three fronts. The wellbeing of our teams, the uninterrupted operation of our commerce and FinTech solutions which are uniquely suited to help society face the current pandemic and the coordination of our efforts with authorities in the countries we operate in to guarantee timely and well allocated resource allocation.
As early as March 16, we determined that over 9,000 MercadoLibre employees in eight countries and across 20 offices which start working remotely to ensure and promote social distancing norms, while maintaining on-site only the operational staff that was required to continue providing our services without disruptions. Precautions were taken to safeguard the help and safety of those staff members on site, which are primarily members of our logistics network. Precautions were maximized to guarantee their health and safety.
For those who had moved to remote work overnight, all the technological training and emotional support that was necessary to guarantee efficiency, productivity and well-being was also made available. With our remote and secure on-site work plans in place, we activated our second area of focus, committing to support consumers and merchants through multiple initiatives which promote preventive actions and financially support their businesses or households.
To that effect, we've put forth 10 critical initiatives. We've leveraged our platform's broad reach to launch COVID-19 readiness campaign by temporarily changing our MercadoLibre and MercadoPago logos from an hand shake to an elbow-to-elbow logo.
We used this elbow-to-elbow campaign to amplify official recommendations from leading health organizations on how to prevent and minimize the spread of the corona virus.
Secondly, we launched our new branding campaign whose narrative is centered around stay-at-home, we are still delivering. We also deployed the necessary measures to ensure the continued operation of our logistics network and that our transportation partners for all product categories across all geographies could continue to operate.
We tweaked our user interfaces to facilitate discovery of products of greatest demand and most reliable delivery times. We eliminated commissions on roughly 1,000 SKUs of essential products for nearly 100,000 merchants, understanding that purchases of these items will be essential for our buyers over the next few months. We redo listing fees for new sellers to facilitate their transition from off-line to omnichannel, while stimulating depth of assortment on our marketplaces.
We extended a 30-day grace period to repay loans for more than 2 million consumers and eliminated late fees for more than 150,000 merchants to alleviate some of the financial burden our users are facing as they seek to stabilize their finances. We launched fundraising campaigns with the international Red Cross to deliver safety and hygiene kits to health workers and with regional NGOs to aid in the distribution of food to the most vulnerable. We launched a supermarket purchasing experience in Argentina and Brazil to facilitate access to consumer packaged goods purchasing in cost-effective cards and quantities.
And lastly, to facilitate trade and mitigate economic hardship during periods of quarantine, governments throughout Latin America declared e-commerce and essential activity exempted from the lockdowns. To achieve this, we engaged and coordinated with governments in the region, to keep our logistics operations functioning, helping to ease the negative impact of shelter in place lockdowns.
Our hearts go out to those individuals and families affected by COVID-19, and our gratitude and appreciation go out to all those brave individuals who are on the front lines working through this unprecedented global health crisis. At MercadoLibre, we will continue to leverage our platforms to support our communities during this important time, allowing continued access to commerce and financial services as our users try to get back on their feet.
Let me now take just a few minutes before getting into our traditional quarterly review to update you on recent key performers indicators of the initiatives that I've just outlined. Regionally, we saw variation in how imposed total or partial lockdowns impacted merchants businesses with important improvements as time elapsed.
Argentine merchants were initially more impacted than in Brazil, but they also rebounded more rapidly, whereas in Mexico, Colombia, Chile and Uruguay, merchants faced less disruption during March and nonetheless saw increased activity during April.
Marketplace key performance indicators hit a low point during the week of the 18th to the 24th of March. Year-on-year growth rate for items sold during that week troughed at 3.3%, with FX-neutral GMV declining by 1.4%. From then onwards, we have seen a strong rebound with growth rates accelerating in April to 76% year-on-year in items sold and 73% FX-neutral year-on-year in GMV for that full month.
More broadly, changes in demand trends have led to a mix shift in sales as consumers prioritize essential items, categories such as health, consumer packaged goods and toys and games showed strong volume growth, exceeding 100% year-on-year on an FX-neutral basis in some markets. Conversely, higher ticket, non-essential categories, such as auto parts and consumer electronics saw marked declines in growth rates.
Moving on to recent trends in the FinTech business. In mid-March, we also observed a deceleration in number and volume of payments processed. Primarily as a result of lower foot traffic in bricks-and-mortar retail that use our MPOS and QR solutions. This negative impact was partially offset by strength in areas such as online payment merchant services; online wallet used cases and convenience store merchants.
Just like in the commerce business, the magnitude of negative impact was greater in the initial weeks following government-mandated lockdowns with gradual improvements since then. Consolidated April growth rates are above pre-COVID levels, driven by Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Mexico, with Brazil still lagging somewhat. Consequently, off marketplace total payment volume growth during the second half of March was 95.4% year-on-year on an FX-neutral basis. And total payment in number was 87.3% year-on-year growth. And for April, these growth rates have been 155.6% and 119.8%, respectively.
So summing up where we stand, we've seen three phases: a strong start to the first quarter that got derailed during the back half of March and rebounded by April. Given these recent trends, we remain optimistic that despite everything that has been occurring, we will still be able to make progress towards our annual objectives without having to delay or materially modify our investments or strategic initiatives. We recognize that in these times, the services rendered by both our commerce and payment platforms are essential for many people across the region, and we will do our best to not let them down. We also remain attentive to any change in demand or supply patterns that might again modify our capital allocation strategy.
Now that I've covered COVID-19 key related trends and updates, let's move on to our progress report for the quarter, starting with the marketplace business. Consolidated marketplace GMV grew 34.2% year-on-year on an FX-neutral basis, reaching $3.4 billion, while items sold grew 27.6% year-on-year reaching $105.7 million, also on a consolidated basis.
On a country-by-country basis, during the first quarter of 2020, Argentina, Brazil and Mexico GMV grew at 81.5%, 15% and 54.5% year-on-year on an FX-neutral basis, respectively. Late quarter mix shift towards lower ASP categories and temporary demand pullback negatively affected these results. Items growth accelerated in Brazil and Mexico to 25.9% year-on-year and 66.5% year-on-year, respectively, showing the positive impact of mix shift.
In Argentina, items sold during the quarter decreased 2.4% from the same period last year as we transitioned through the implementation of flat fee pricing last year during the second quarter. Chile and Colombia delivered robust rates of growth during the quarter, accelerating to 57% and 44.8% year-on-year, respectively, on an FX-neutral basis.
In terms of supply, live listings offered on MercadoLibre's marketplaces reached $267.4 million during the quarter, registering a 29.8% year-on-year growth. This deceleration was mainly driven by Brazil and Argentina, where certain sellers were unable to operate under the current lockdown regimes.
On average, seller paused roughly one-third of listings during late March. Cross-border trade has also been negatively impacted by COVID-19 as Chinese merchants listed around 40% fewer products in January and 15% fewer products in March.
Moving on to logistics. Fulfillment penetration continued improving across the board, reaching 11.3% in Argentina, 14.1% in Brazil, and 43.1% in Mexico, yielding 19.9% fulfillment penetration on a consolidated basis.
Meanwhile, cross-docking reached 51.1% in Argentina and 28.1% in Brazil, getting us to 23.4% adoption on a consolidated basis. All-in, we are rapidly approaching having half of our shipments already running on our own logistics network, quite a feat given where we were only a few quarters ago.
These positive results are in large part a consequence of the continued expansion of our network. As we launched new hybrid cross-docking centers in Curitiba and Bell Horizonte in Brazil and added service center nodes and over 700 drop off points.
Additionally, we also launched our Flex logistics solution in Chile and Colombia to complement our existing drop shipping offerings, enabling us to reduce reliance on any single carrier.
Let me now take on a quarterly update for FinTech. Off-platform total payment volume decelerated during the quarter, growing 139.5% year-on-year on an FX-neutral basis, with Brazil growing 101.8%, Mexico 114.6%, and Argentina, 221.2%.
Total payments in number grew 102% year-on-year for the quarter on a consolidated basis. The deceleration in number and volume of payments processed, as already mentioned earlier, was primarily driven by lower foot traffic in physical retail during March, which had a direct impact on lower mobile point-of-sale and QR total payment volume growth, partially offset by the relative strength in our merchant services business, where we process online, away from our marketplaces.
Mobile point-of-sale business was still strong, driven by January and February momentum, growing total payment volume, 103.3% year-on-year on an FX-neutral basis for the full quarter. Brazil, Argentina and Mexico grew 82.7%, 173.6%, and 234.5% year-on-year on an FX-neutral basis, respectively.
The pace of mPOS sales remained solid with over 900,000 devices sold during the quarter. In addition, we are encouraged by the launch of our new plus device, which is geared towards catering larger merchants and will allow us to continue driving higher average revenue per user within this business line.
Our online payments, merchant services solutions grew 81.7% year-on-year on an FX-neutral basis. The greatest deceleration in this business was in Mexico, which grew at 62.4% year-on-year on an FX-neutral basis. This was partially offset by the growth in the other countries segment with 109.5% year-on-year growth, also on an FX-neutral basis.
The deceleration in Mexico can mostly be explained by higher exposure to cross-border businesses, specifically our merchants in China that began to see the impact of COVID-19 early on in the quarter.
During the first quarter, MercadoPago's mobile wallet delivered $1.3 billion in payment volume on a consolidated basis, growing 299% year-on-year on an FX-neutral basis.
The slowdown in in-store QR payments and wallet transportation payments were due to seasonality plus obviously, the total or partial lockdowns that occurred by mid-March as well as the rationalization in marketing expenditures on our part.
Monetization of QR payments in Brazil, where we started to charge 100 basis points merchant discount rate earlier in the year also slowed down growth. But perhaps, more importantly, lend increasing proof-of-concept to the QR network as we took this important step towards building a sustainable business model.
Unique wallet payers reached a milestone, as during the quarter, we surpassed the $8 million mark, growing over 155% year-on-year on a consolidated basis. Mexico led growth with 252.8% growth and surpassed the 1 million mark in payers for a quarter for the first time.
We're also pleased to announce that during the quarter, we launched Mercado Fondo in Mexico in partnership with Grupo Bursátil Mexicano, who has over 35 years of experience in the Mexican financial sector. The gradual rollout of asset management in Mexico began in mid-January and was finished by February 28. The first month of operations was in line with the results in Argentina and Brazil, in terms of user acquisition over a similar period of time since launch, capturing 5% of users with balances being transferred to asset management products.
Mercado Crédito's total outstanding credit portfolio reached $177.6 million during the first quarter decreasing by 16.5% Q-on-Q as a result of the devaluation of the region's currencies. In local currency, Argentina's portfolio grew by 15.4% and was flat in Brazil and grew in Mexico by 13.1%.
By the end of the quarter, the NPL ratios had not shown a deterioration due to the COVID-19 crisis. Nonetheless, to manage our exposure to merchant and consumer credits, amongst global pandemic, we slowed credit origination to both merchants and consumers significantly. As a consequence, as well as the devaluation impact of the country's currencies, we shrunk our merchant credit portfolio by 21.1%, our consumer credit portfolio by 5.2% and our mobile point-of-sale credit portfolio by 20.4% Q-on-Q in U.S. dollars.
These defensive measures led to non-performing loans that were 30 days past due that represented 10.8% of total loans during the first quarter of 2020. We also recorded an $8.7 million increase in bad debt provisions versus Q4. This increase is explained for the most part due to a change in U.S. GAAP accounting norms effective January 1, where we adopted the model of current expected credit losses to account for our allowances for loan losses.
Previously to the change, we accounted for loan losses using an incurred loss model, where we accounted for loan losses as we incurred them. Going forward, we will book loan loss provisions at the moment the credit is originated based on actuarial calculations and subsequently adjust those provisions as credits are repaid.
With that, let me now move on to our financials for the quarter. Consolidated net revenues for the first quarter were $652.1 million, a year-on-year increase of 37.6% in U.S. dollars and 70.5% on an FX-neutral basis as we continue to optimize shipping subsidies and costs that minimize contra revenues from free shipping programs.
Commerce now represents 58.4% of our total net revenues compared to 41.6% for FinTech. Gross profit was $312.8 million, with a margin of 48% compared to 50% in the first quarter of 2019. This 205 basis points margin compression was driven for the most part by warehousing costs from our fulfillment operations, partially offset by collection fee improvements and salary and wages leverage in our customer services operations.
On a sequential basis, 224 basis points of margin improvement are mostly explained by declining MPOS sales costs. In the slides accompanying the presentation, we've included, as every quarter, a detailed breakdown of these, as well as the OpEx margin evolution that I'll cover quickly now.
Operating expenses were $342.5 million, an increase of 51% year-on-year in U.S. dollars. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses were 52.5% compared to 47.9% during the first quarter of 2019. These 251 basis points of margin compression are attributable primarily to increases in sales force related costs, bad debt provisions I just covered and increased marketing spend. Sequentially, there was $34.7 million of Q-on-Q improvement in operating leverage that was mostly driven by a decrease of $60.2 million in marketing expenditures, partially offset by the same bad debt charges.
Loss from operations was $29.7 million compared to a loss of $68.9 million during the prior quarter. As a percentage of revenues, the loss from operations reached 4.6%, improving by 567 basis points sequentially.
Moving down the P&L, the company incurred $23.6 million in financial expenses this quarter, mainly attributable to secured financial loans and interest expenses related to our payments business in Argentina. Interest income was $36.8 million, a 50.5% increase year-on-year as a result of the equity offering during March 2019, which generated more invested volume and interest gain and also a higher float in Argentina. In delivering these results, we've sought to maintain a sustainable balance between growth and investments, which for the quarter led to a net loss of $21.1 million.
As I wrap up the prepared remarks, I don't want to loose sight of the extraordinary time we are living in. We thank everyone in our communities who are doing everything they can to get us through, whether it is by staying home to remain safe or by making it to work to keep our health systems and economies running. We remain committed to doing our part by empowering our merchants to continue operating, by securing deliveries of goods needed by households and by supporting the normal operation of payments and financial value chains.
MercadoLibre will emerge from this situation stronger and with an even greater sense of purpose. We trust the dedication and commitment being demonstrated by our entire organization will allow us to continue executing our strategy with no significant interruptions. And in doing so, play our part in contributing to making things less difficult during these trying times.
We look forward, as always, to keeping you updated on our progress next quarter, and we'd like to take your questions now. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Your question please. Okay. So, thank you. Hi, Pedro, I hope you and everybody else in management are doing well and staying safe through the crisis. So from a big picture perspective, the circumstances and reasons why acceleration is happening in April is tragic, but at the same time, this should catalyze a faster change in consumer behavior, both e-commerce and the payment side and all the regions where you operate.
So talk about like what you may be doing to retain as much of the momentum as you can. I would have to think, MercadoLibre has always under-indexed for certain product categories historically. So shouldn't the conversations with brands and sellers in those other categories be getting easier?
And second, the -- I think you disclosed the eight million users who are now using the mobile wallet. Should we think the tag [ph] on these users are effectively zero at this point? And are your existing MercadoLibre users whom you've -- are these existing MercadoLibre users whom you were able to convert? And I guess, consequently, is the diagram overlap still fairly large between your commerce and the FinTech platform? So are you starting to see a wider divergence in the user base? Thanks. Great. So thanks, Stephen. I think, fortunately, we're all doing very well on this end, and we wish the same to everyone on the line. So look, I think that there is the potential we still need to wait and see a few more months that to a certain degree, what's happening around us will generate some sort of fast-forward in a shift from physical to digital. And so, I think we're very focused primarily on three levers here to see if we can hold that momentum going forward.
And the first one is to deliver on the user experience and the promise. That's very closely tied to logistics, but it also means that we need to keep operating the entire machinery, which is being obviously strained, while continuing to deliver the service that's expected of us, because we don't want is to have new users or users onboard new categories and facing that negative user experience.
So, we're tremendously proud of the work that's been done by the logistics team. Our MercadoLibre's operation has continued to operate and to deliver within the standard service levels. We are seeing considerable mix shift, same story as for other players similar to us globally. And so we're trying to very quickly accelerate plans that we already have in place for certain categories within consumer packaged goods and other areas.
And related to that, and you did mention this also is, how do we continue to onboard more and more merchants, both for financial services and also for our commerce businesses because, obviously, there's increased desire to pursue digital channels, and we are a critical partner for any one trying to move into the digital world.
So there is a re-ramping up of sales forces to be able to engage and to deliver those incremental conversations. So I would say the biggest focus is to make sure that we can deliver on the incremental volume that we're seeing so that users have a good first experience.
In terms of TAC, just one comment. The $8 million was full quarter. We still had our marketing running during Q1, obviously, much more efficient than previous quarters, especially for wallet. We mentioned that in some of the prepared remarks, but we were still investing, and so those tax were not zero, but there is greater efficiency in the overall marketing spend behind driving those 8 million wallet users, which is a good sign.
I would say, April is where given the enormous organic demand that's existing marketing spend has been low, and so have come down. Marketing spend has not been zero, and we also need to see what happens as the world normalizes and off-line offerings once again emerged, and what happens to tax at those points.
But April, obviously, there's much less investment in marketing, just because there's so much organic demand, especially on the commerce side. And on the payment side, there's probably a lot less of an impetus to invest in a lot of the discounts because a big part of what it was in-store and foot traffic. Obviously, there isn't too much sense in investing behind that, but we have been to behind online used cases and other used cases that have picked up demand. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Edward Yruma from KeyBanc. Your question please. Edward your phone might be on beyond mute. Sorry about that. Again, my best thoughts for you and your teams, and their continued health. Interesting commentary on the pullback in credit, I guess, what proof points will you look for in terms of re-establishing accessibility to credit? And in the short-term, how do you expect this will impact the P&L? Hi, Edward. [Indiscernible]. So in terms of credit, we have already -- we're starting and giving credit. We have two large segments. On the one hand, we have merchants to which we are learning working capital. And there, what we did was first slowed down the origination of credit until we saw how these were reacting on the marketplace. Even though, in general, the marketplace has accelerated, not all merchants are the same. Some of them are growing significantly faster than before, because of what they are selling, and there's a slowdown in another one. So we wanted to make sure, we got that right before starting giving loans to them again, but we are already doing that on a country-by-country basis.
And then on the consumer side, what we never stopped originated loans. However, we did reduce the amount of loans we were given. What we did was maintaining -- offering new loans to people who already have paid us back. We wanted to try to avoid an adverse selection and having people who have problems with their current stock conditions, getting a loan from us and not being able to pay it back. But now as we gain more confident with the situation, we also plan to rescale it. Great. And one follow-up, if I may. It sounds like the Brazilian business is maybe reramping a little bit slower than your other businesses. Is that a macro issue? Or are there other factors at play? Thank you very much. So, I think if you look at the commerce business, the Brazilian business, even if you look at Q1 results, was growing somewhat slower than the other businesses and it began to accelerate in April. When we look at relative growth rates, April to pre-COVID, they look pretty good for Brazil. I'll let Osi give you some more color on payments, but I think for payments that's probably a fair assessment. Thank you, Pedro. I'll add to that, that in the case of Brazil, on the online payment side of the business we did have a few large clients who were either related to the tourism industry or to entertainment, or even to cross border trade. And for those, the volumes are obviously significantly down.
And then, in the mPOS business, I think on the case of Argentina, a larger proportion of those mPOS came from supermarkets and small mom and pop stores who sold food and these ones are thriving. However, in Brazil, this percentage is lower, and therefore, the recovery is taking a little bit longer than in the case of Argentina. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Ford from Bank of America. Your question, please. Thank you. Hi, Pedro, Federico, Osvaldo. Thanks for taking my question. Can you talk a little bit about your decision to pull forward the consumables launches? How that's scaling, how you're thinking about the value proposition in terms of price, assortment, service levels and geographic availability? And how did that decision to pull the consumables forward impact and as well as this wave in the take rates, how did that impact profitability in the quarter? Sure, Bob. So, first of all, just, I think, to set relative size. These categories, even in the most successful markets such as Mexico, where we were already a few steps ahead, are probably mid-single digits of GMV, and then the smaller countries are a bit behind that. So in terms of overall impact to profitability and whatnot, it's not that relevant.
The greater focus right now is ramping up the user interfaces. We launched the supermarket interface we had in Mexico to both Brazil and Argentina and to, as quickly as we can, improving SKU selection. There's a strong timing to how we're trying to do consumer packaged goods to our own logistics network. And that's a combination fulfilled by us, but also to a certain degree, 1p, so there's a ramp-up in purchase orders and the ramp-up in trying to go direct-to-consumer packaged good companies and get them to either sell to us or fulfill through us.
When we look at the value prop right now, clearly, there's still room for expansion in SKUs and selection. A lot of the very, very strong growth that we've seen in GMV is driven by the obvious high need products. And so, it's fairly easy to source that low number of SKUs quickly.
The challenge, if we want to remain relevant in this category as things normalize, is to make sure that we have the right work -- we've done the right work in terms of incremental assortment. So I think the answer to your question is, we've done a lot in terms of rolling out the front ends for the supermarket experience. We've been agile to be able to source the inventory that we know is in high demand now, and we're diligently working in the background to be able to have the future SKU count and selection that will be necessary once things normalize a little bit.
Impact on profitability is not something we're too concerned with right now, given that the volume is low. But we do trust that the more we do from our own fulfillment centers and the more volume we drive to those fulfillment centers, we're seeing unit costs come down in general. And so that should also apply to these consumer packaged growth categories. And so the final step will be just to make sure that we can increase average items per order, which is typically the other key driver between making these work. And Pedro, if I understand correctly, quarters placed in the morning in São Paulo fulfilled the same-day afternoon, next day, next day in Rio. How are you thinking about making that value proposition more broadly available in Brazil? Yes. So this doesn't apply just for consumer packaged goods. I think what you're highlighting is simply a reflection of the tremendous work that's being done by the logistics team in terms of being able to service large urban areas that are relatively close to our warehouses as we grow the footprint of our own network in what we consider to be best-in-class times. So it's certainly new. This is recent, and then really the improvements have been phenomenal. We're communicating it as we make sure that we can scale that efficiently. And we do think that will be a very strong part of the value prop, but not just for those categories, but rather across the board for all of our service offering. Understood. Thank you very much. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Ruben from Morgan Stanley. Your question please. Thanks for taking the question and very helpful call. So I was just hoping that you could talk through some of the drivers of TPV off marketplace. This seemed more resilient, really, particularly in April than we would have expected based on the physical exposure. So maybe just some puts and takes on MPOS and QR versus merchant services? And maybe color on the proportion of your MPOS base that's shuttered for the moment and would have went to zero, would be very helpful? Thank you. Sure, Andrew. So we definitely saw a picture where different businesses have been evolved in different ways throughout April -- end of March and April. Let's start with online payments. In online payments, as I already mentioned, there are a few verticals where volume is down, such as tourism and entertainment and cost water trade, but beyond that we have seen in general, an acceleration because many business are trying to migrate online. And so particularly we see this with -- towards the long tail there are lots of small businesses that for the first time need to sell online, and there many of those are adopting. So we are seeing positive trends particularly in Argentina, but we are also seeing a revolving in Brazil and Mexico and very, very strong countries have been Chile and Colombia. In all of those, we are seeing strong trends.
If we move towards MPOS, there the share by vertical various significantly from a country to country basis. If we work start with -- for us, Brazil is the largest market, and their volumes are still below roughly 25% below what they were before the start of the lockdown. And that is mostly because what we're seeing is many of the verticals, such as automobiles, closing outlets, transportation and so on have been significantly affected for us one of the larger proportions.
Retail used to be 16% of MPOS service providers, 11% restaurants, 11%. And all of those have been significantly affected. And on the other hand, supermarkets, which have not been affected, we're only 2% of TPV. And that's why in Brazil, we are still seeing volumes that have declined comparing with the for -- the start of the lockdown.
On the other hand, in Argentina supermarkets were very large already -- they already represented 38% of TPV and they have grown significantly and being shared, and they already had over 55% of TPV. And therefore, these were not only not affected, but growing very, very strongly. And so the net effect for Argentina is that volume is slightly -- basically flat. It's only 3% below what it was before COVID.
Mexico, the trend is I would say, even the decline has been steeper than Brazil, but coming from a very small base compared with Brazil and Argentina, volume is down 35%. Again, it's mostly because not many of those merchants sold any of the essentials that have been relevant over the last few weeks, and supermarkets only represented a 3.5% of total volume.
So in general, retail, particularly closing and services are significantly down. Supermarkets and essentials are up and in the one country where that was more relevant that it was Argentina, the volume has suffered less.
Moving on to wallet. In wallet, we have both things happened at the same time. We have, on the one hand TPV, and then we have both, utilities and then P2P payments. Clearly, offline is one that is separated most. In the case of QR payments, we have -- we can split that between long tail, which is doing okay. But on the other hand, we have this large merchants, which are mostly either in the fast food industry or gas stations.
And in general, fast food restaurants are closed so we are not seeing any volume there and gas stations are significantly down. On the other hand, when we move on to online users of the wallet, we have really spiked. For example, payments, utility payments or mobile top-ups are significantly high, mostly so in Argentina, but also in other markets. But mostly so in Argentina. And then we have revamped the P2P payment, and we are starting to see an acceleration in P2P payments. Thank you very much. That was very helpful Our next question comes from the line of Marcelo Santos from JPMorgan. Your question please. Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. I hope you're all doing well and remain doing well. The question would be on the cost side of the business. What are the main impacts that we should see in the coming months, given this change in the business, understanding lower marketing expenses, perhaps higher bad debt. Could you discuss a bit how the cost changes? Thank you. Yes. Hi, Marcelo, thank you. Everyone is safe on your side as well. So look, again, I think we always want to stress that this is a very dynamic and early situation. So we're able to get into greater detail on the quarter when we announced it.
I think in terms of trends and drivers, from a top line perspective, we are seeing primarily in commerce strength in volume. And even on the FinTech side, as Osvaldo just outlined, significant resilience in a relative basis to everything pretty around us. There has been an initial decrease in marketing spend and sales force related expenditures.
Obviously, we're not visiting people to sign people on. We've kept sales forces at home or we've stopped using third-party sales forces, and demand has been primarily organic. So that's beneficial so from the spend side.
We're seeing less discounting and couponing to drive usage, both on the FinTech, but to a lesser degree, also on the commerce side, but primarily on FinTech. And in general, you're seeing certain adjustments to expenses. This is offset, obviously, by -- to a certain degree, there will be COVID related costs to logistics.
There is a mix shift, and I think this was alluded to in one of the previous questions to certain categories where margins are potentially a little bit tighter. And I think we also need to see what happens at a macro level in terms of demand as we roll into May, June and then the rest of the year.
So when we look at April and the initial phase of this, obviously, marketing has been a big part of our spend, sales and marketing, that's down. Logistics costs on a per unit base are actually coming down compared to the drug ship network as we roll more and more volume over our network. So that's good for the long-term. Short-term, it doesn't mean that logistics costs as logistics has increased adoption are lower than dropship, where we didn't have to manage warehouses and whatnot, but they're kind of in line.
And so there is the increase in bad debt that you mentioned on the credit side, but that seems to be fairly controlled as well unless the performing loans spike. So short-term, I think there's been fairly solid top line and some pullback on expenses. We're not going to stay within a defensive position. I think we see an enormous opportunity here with this fast forward of the movement online. And now that we feel fairly comfortable about how the business is performing, you will see us begin to pick up spend somewhat, but not necessarily to the levels we were at before. Perfect. Thanks for this one. I have another one. Could you please comment, there were some news in the Brazilian media discussing the states potentially wanting the marketplaces to collect taxes. So there was some noise in the media. Could you discuss this if possible? Yes. So last I had checked, we had not received any formal notification. Obviously, we're aware both of the media coverage. And that in general and especially with potential macro conditions going forward. There are conversations from different states and in some cases, with different states regarding state taxes. I think the way we're approaching this is through the federations and the trade associations. I think this is fairly early on in the conversation to try to drive any conclusions as to how this might potentially play out.
Our understanding is that some of these initiatives won't be able to prosper. But again, following it closely, we haven't been officially notified, so that gives you an indication of how early on this is. And we'll have to see how all of this plays out. Great. Thank you very much. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan from Barclays. Your question, please. Great. Thanks for taking the question. Glad to know everybody is safe. Two questions from us. First, Pedro, can you help understand the impact of reduced commissions and listing fees for certain offline to online categories? And type of merchants in response to COVID-19 on the take rate side, we talked about it in the prepared remarks. Do these merchants represent a sizable portion of the volume at this time?
And then second question, a little bit bigger picture question. You had a lot of long-term priorities like loyalty integration and then also a good build-out of the first-party business in various geographies. Obviously, now there are a lot more urgent pressing situations that you have to prioritize, how do we think about some of these things as we go into the back half and some of the initial shocks from COVID-19 sort of mitigates? Thanks. Great. So, first of all, the discounts that we've been granting should not have a material impact on monetization. I think we've attempted to target limited number of us that we understand are the ones in most need and at highest and -- but we've also tried to be prudent around how we've done this.
So I think what we're trying to say is, we shouldn't assume that all of the GMV growth linearly flows through to incremental profit. But thanks for asking the question. These should not be material discounts across the board nor on a significant number of SKUs nor to a significant number of merchants and not necessarily sustained over time.
Second, I think, what we're trying to transmit to everyone, at least so far in this evolving situation, is that we feel that we really haven't had to derail too many of our strategic objectives. I think it's very -- we call it luck, call it, having seen it well. The fact that our logistics network was one of our priorities has really begun to pay off. But if anything, one of the areas that one would normally be doubling down on right now was already one of the key objectives for us this year, which was to continue to move more and more volume onto our own logistics network.
First-party, as I mentioned is also something that fits very well with the COVID necessities that are emerging. We had always said that 1B would be critical for the consumer packaged good development.
And so if anything, 1P is helping us as we accelerate CPG, granted a power is a category that's particularly hard hit. That also had a strong 1P component. But what we've done is, we've reprioritized within the 1P organization to different products and categories, which allows us to continue to build out simply by tweaking what kind of inventory we're focusing on.
And then loyalty is something that, I don't necessarily characterize as something that's been derailed. Potentially within the larger scheme of things, there might be some move away efforts away from that.
But by no means have we postponed any of our loyalty initiatives or developments or business development attempts. And we continue to think that building out our loyalty program will be critical for us. And so we remain pretty committed to continuing to roll out new loyalty benefits and features as the year events. That’s very helpful. Thanks Pedro. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Jain from HSBC. Your question please. Hi Pedro, thanks for taking the time and responding our questions. I have 2 quick questions. The first one more on -- just a follow-up on the product categories, are you thinking -- are there initiatives for you to maybe grow your market share in electronics appliances, especially in Brazil?
And on the consumer package goods, is there a plan in the future to maybe expand that to, I don't know, groceries and perishables? Is that kind of in plans to look at maybe partnerships, M&A, etcetera?
And the second question is, there has been, obviously, an improvement in fulfillment. But when I look at the managed network on a sequential basis and the same thing with digital -- with the wallet users on a sequential basis, the growth was relatively flat in overall managed network and overall wallet users. Is there an impact of COVID-19 there? And maybe that's why there's a little bit more flattish growth sequentially how should we think about that? Thank you so much. Okay. So let me take those in reverse order. So when you look at the managed network, the answer is yes and it's related to the category mix shift. When you look at some of these CPG categories, especially when COVID initially hit because those were not high priority categories, they were not necessarily on fulfillment by many or cross stocking. A lot of the gel, alcohol, face masks and whatnot were being sold and continue to be sold in large degree by merchants on drop ship network.
So in some markets, we actually even saw a bit of a decline in fulfillment as a percentage of volume as a consequence of COVID driven mix shift in categories. Now obviously, we're working quickly on the background as we identify those merchants to bring them on board to fulfillment because as we mentioned earlier, that's what really guarantees the quickest delivery times, the most reliable delivery times and going forward, the lowest cost. But so on the fulfillment side, sequentially, yes, that is driven by COVID related mix shift.
And wallet, I think, was also covered this, absolutely a big part of wallet volume and by strategic design were in-store purchases, a lot of that was in the restaurant category, which obviously is one of the most hit categories. So if we look at a lot of the high level business development deals we had with anchor clients, McDonald's, Burger King, Starbucks that I think exemplifies how imposed quarantine and shutdown of in-store traffic, obviously, affects the wallet business.
In terms of consumer packaged goods and CE, I think we addressed this earlier a little bit, CPG. I think this will accelerate our plans to move into this category. Obviously, we're starting from the kind of things that our current fulfillment centers can handle. So it doesn't include fresh, and it doesn't include certain chilled temperatures or frozen check temperatures.
I think we've began to do work in understanding the overall impact of that and how, if and when we should move into those spaces. But I wouldn't anticipate anything soon. I think the focus right now and there's plenty of us room for us to grow is on CPG that does not include groceries or chilled and frozen, that's probably a Phase II or a Phase III in the future. And then, consumer electronics, obviously, a category that demand has come down somewhat, although we're beginning to see signs of life again in April.
And that's, I think, a plan that we had from before, which is continue to expand our 1p for consumer electronics, hopefully, this will accelerate, onboarding of certain OEMs through flagship stores, as they look more-and-more for digital solution. So we are ramping up our commercial efforts there and trying to close deal with consumer electronics, OEMs and brands.
And then we continue to work on what we identified as the other area, which is how do we continue to improve pricing in consumer electronics, through our buy box, through discount central and rebates, and then obviously, category-specific pricing that we did roll out in Colombia. And that's worked well.
And so we're thinking about rolling out category-specific pricing potentially to other markets, which hopefully allows us to in a well-managed revenue transition, lower take rates in categories where merchants have smaller margins, increased categories where merchants have better margins all in, become more competitive in terms of pricing, in those lower margin categories, by having a lower take rate for merchants. So that's something that had started pre-COVID. And we're not really sidetracking any of those efforts, despite the slowdown in demand.
Q -
That's helpful. Thank you, Pedro. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Marvin Fong from BTIG. Your question, please. Great thank you and thanks for taking my questions. And glad everyone is good. Pretty much everything has been asked. I'll just have 1 left. I was just curious if you could comment on, all of these new users that you're adding? Are you observing any differences in terms of the cohort that you're adding during the pandemic be it mix of urban versus outside cities, perhaps age or even income?
Is it -- is there anything that you can say about the new users you're adding? And as a second follow-up, is this changing you're thought in terms of how much of, say, in Brazil, Argentina or Mexico, you think you can cover with your managed logistics network? Yes. So there's -- there are two drivers behind the incremental demand. One is the one you've identified, which is, incremental new users. I think when we look at the clip at which the commerce business is adding new users it is up, even from pre-COVID, so absolutely. But also, and I think equally importantly, is the engagement of our existing users is also up, obviously, as they purchase more and more.
There are differences in terms of category mix shift, but that's across the board. It's not that the newer cohorts are particularly more or less inclined to certain categories. I think that's happening across the board. And geographically, I'll have to get back to you. I don't know that one-off the top of my head. In terms of network design, look, the answer is our network design already is to be able to cover most of the geographies.
So I don't think this has changed anything in terms of network design. Priority, as we mentioned earlier, continues to be to drive to a best-in-class service in large urban areas where many of the pockets of demand are, but we also -- if you look at where we're laying our footprint of service centers and last mile centers, you'll see that it's very expensive.
We have service centers in Manaus, in the middle of the Amazon, in the Northeast of Brazil. So the idea really is as volume moves away from the drop ship network onto our network for us to be able to service all the states in some regions in the different markets as efficiently as the drop ship network did.
So from the goal, I think our ambition there was to be very efficient on a nationwide level, and that doesn't necessarily change, even when you look at where we're planning incremental warehouses, the two that we've already announced for Brazil. And in Mexico, they do have as one of their primary objectives, quicker and lower cost delivery to the south and the North of Brazil, whereas today, most of our warehouses are in São Paulo. Great. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rodrigo Nistor from Itau. Your question, please. Good evening. Thank you for taking my questions. So, during April, fulfillment penetration surge in Brazil and other markets. So, do you think that that acceleration could lead you to increase your managed penetration targets or maybe reduce the timeframe in which you were previously pretending to achieve those objectives?
And also, if you perceive a shift in the way merchants view a fulfillment proposal due to the current context? Thank you. I got stuck in, my apologies. I think the focus on fulfillment and the managed network has been with the increase in volume to make sure that's able to continue to take on that incremental demand and that incremental volume on short notice. And that's what we've been, I think, the most pleased with is that we have been able to manage that surge in demand without having to significantly erode our delivery promises or the quality of the delivery, not just for essential categories, but across the Board. And if you look at marketplaces globally, that hasn't necessarily been the case for everyone.
So, I don't think we're changing objectives or getting more aggressive quite yet. The focus right now is to make sure that we can continue to deliver satisfactory and hopefully, best-in-class or close to best-in-class user experiences as demand continues to surge. I think potentially once we get through the next few months and we have a better sense, we can reset and see whether we get more aggressive or not.
And then in terms of merchant adoption, I don't know if this is necessarily COVID-related. I think our plan all along was always to be able to show merchants that as our network gets cheaper and faster in terms of delivery that, that generates better conversion and more sales and so the ultimate sales pitch behind getting merchants to onboard fulfillment and the managed network is that.
Now, obviously, if this accelerates that, then better for us, but I don't see that as a departure in what the vision had been on the long as a consequence of what's happening.
So, the most important takeaway, and again, this is very dynamic and very fluid is we're extremely proud of how we've been able to take on the incremental volume across all product categories. And continue to offer service levels that are in line with what we had pre-COVID and in certain large metro areas, primarily in Brazil, actually improved delivery times and service levels. And we don't think that's a small at all. And that's what we're most focused on sustaining at least for the remainder of this quarter before we start resetting expectations going forward. Thank you so much. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Coffey from Susquehanna. Your question please. Great. Thank you very much for walking me in. From a macro point of view, is there any slowdown labor in the ports in your markets or any reduced import levels from Asia that could potentially put a bottleneck in supply of any of the verticals in the marketplace has strengthened?
And just one another and then I can hop off. How do you rate the likelihood of a pullback on the co-hail service due to COVID? Is that a realistic scenario? Thank you. Okay. We were going to get away without a question on supply chains and supply. So, thanks for asking. Look, we did some checks, I think we have seen, obviously, at the margins, certain merchants or certain product categories, where supply chains seem to have come under strain.
We also are seeing the opposite certain categories where inventory stock has increased. And there could be potential there for liquidation or people more interested in adding digital channels. We haven't seen any significant disruptions in large parts by domains or very relevant SKUs in terms of the supply chain as of yet. So, that's also been positive. It has happened, but it's happened either at the margin or in certain obvious products that everyone is sort of straining the supply chain. I don't know mask is one example.
Correios, I don't want to venture a guess here. I mean, the Brazilian situation in COVID right now is possibly the most fluid one. And so, we'll have to see. So far, I think we haven't seen any negative impact. And hopefully, that will continue to be the case. We had -- there were some drop off points in Correios at the beginning of COVID in certain states in Brazil that were either trading did not show up or whatnot. But I think that normalized relatively quickly. And so that, I think, gives a certain amount of comfort. MPOS supply, which is the third piece, I think, was all that can cover I think I was talking more about our own merchants. Yes. So far, we have had no problems. With MPOS supply going forward is that we are aware of the part of the supply of -- but the majority of MPOS we sell in Brazil are manufactured in a factory in Manaus, in the north of Brazil, which is an area with many COVID cases so far, we have no problems, but that is one area where there is a risk that we are trying to keep covered. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Colantuoni from Jefferies. Your question please. Thanks for squeezing me in. Can you talk about how you're going to be growth in April compares to other e-commerce players in your key markets? And second, have you started to develop a time line for when you'll start pulling back on the concessions you provided sellers during the pandemic? Thanks. Sure. So first of all, market share data for April is not something that we've seen a lot of. I think it's fair to say that this is not necessarily exclusive issue. Obviously, I think commerce, in general is accelerating. So, what we're seeing is a more rapid shift from offline to online. And so again, we always stress this. We don't see this as a zero-sum game for a very long time. I don't know specific market share data the competitors will have to look at it, but I do believe that there is plenty of room for everyone to grow. And we also think that there are certain elements of our value proposition. We've talked a lot about the logistics piece that are important differentiators going forward. The second question, I don't remember it. What was it? Just the -- have you started to develop a time line for to start pulling back on concession. Yes. Thank you. So we already have started to pull back on concessions, I think, gradually. So there's two things going on as we move into April. There are certain elements of pre final value fees in certain categories that we began to pull back on. And I think we're going to try to do this in a more targeted way, so rather than simply take an entire category to zero commissions, trying to identify merchants that are -- have deep inventory and that are fulfilling through us and whatnot and try to work this in a way that we can continue to guarantee the supply of low-cost essential products to our consumers, but in a both financially more intelligent way and also a more targeted way.
And the other thing is that to offset some of that, you're also going to begin to see us very gradually, very efficiently and very intelligently begin to once again open marketing spend in certain channels and in certain areas that had been closed during April. So, if in one extent, we might raise take rates again to our merchants back to normalcy. Hopefully, those incremental marketing spend also gives them a further boost in demand that offset some of that take rate compression. But that's already begun to happen. Great. Thank you, so much. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Irma Sgarz from Goldman Sachs. Your question please. Yes, hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. And thanks for the detail you've been providing on the prepared remarks. Just one question on comments that you made in the opening statement, where you mentioned that in Brazil and Argentina, you paused -- hotels caused about one-third of this uplifting due to operational limitations. What are you seeing as big sources of interruption there? And what can you do to mitigate the impact? And how quickly do you feel that portion of the listing or the sellers can recover from here? Thank you. Yes. Hi, Irma, thank you. So look clearly, the biggest disruption were the quarantines that were imposed in the case of Argentina, very stringent and nationwide. In the case of Brazil, somewhat more state by state, but also very stringent and so merchants who do not fulfill through us because we were never -- our fulfillment centers have never stopped operating. But merchants that did not fulfill through us and because of restrictions on movement were unable to make it to their stores, to prepare packages and to deliver packages either to our milk runs or on dropship networks were the ones that primarily at first were most affected.
We've worked fairly closely with regulators and authorities in the different countries to as March rolled into April, ensure that e-commerce activities were included within the exemptions for quarantine regimes. And so when we look at Argentina, for example, that's a big story that tells why there was a significant slowdown during two weeks in March, and then the business began to pick up again. So by this point, as we moved into May, our sense is that the overwhelming majority of those merchants that had face restrictions, and it had to limit inventory are up and running again, and that explains also the strength the business delivered during April. And that last comment was related to Argentina, specifically in terms of the business picking up? No. I think, again, with different levels, but I think the way we've tried to characterize this is almost there were three phases to this. There was an initial phase. Q1 was coming along fairly well. You can see that in the numbers. Very strong pullback, primarily in Argentina and Brazil during the back half of March, as we said. Mexico, Chile and Colombia, much less pronounced slowdown during March. And then overall, in most markets, a rebound in April. Now the rebound is, yes, stronger in Argentina, Mexico, Chile and Colombia, but it is pronounced in Brazil as well. Great. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Richard Cathcart from Bradesco. Your question please. Hi, guys. Good evening. Just a question on Brazil. So we've seen here that the number -- the penetration of fulfill are rising to, I think, around 14% for the quarter, 15% at the end of the quarter, and then I think you mentioned 20% in April. So my question about the April number there is, if you're seeing kind of a larger number of sellers moving into fulfillment, or if that's a result of some of the mix shift that we've seen as a result of the COVID-19? No. It is merchant migration and greater adoption of the product. If anything, I think I had mentioned is that the COVID-19 mix shift initially was detrimental to fulfillment adoption. The -- so this is -- I would characterize this as true sustainable increase in usage of our fulfillment solution in these markets. March was already strong. So it's not on that specific metric. Obviously, the number of shipments that are being handled by our fulfillment centers has increased dramatically as GMV has increased and units even more than GMV. But when we look at penetration levels, I would say that it was already trending positively towards Q1 and April has been in some markets like Brazil in line with March, slightly up and across the board, up a little bit more. But it's a metric that I think is a consequence of the work that we've been carrying out over the last few quarters and not something that's necessarily COVID explained. Okay. Great. Thanks very much. And just a follow-up, if I may. So you mentioned in the answer to Irma's question that Brazil is showing strong growth in April, but it is kind of lagging a little bit the other markets. GMV growth did show some slowdown quarter-on-quarter. What's your reading of those trends? Is it primarily just around COVID-19? Or are there some other things that perhaps are having an impact? No. I think Brazil, even if you look at Q4 numbers, there were certain things that we were trying to address in our Brazilian market. I think we covered some of those in the previous quarter, and they were very much driven by certain categories. There were some questions on consumer electronics, where we had seen a slowdown that was more marked in that category than others. We had also identified that certain categories that were fast growers within the online world were categories that we were coming into from a smaller overall base. And I think that continued to explain what was happening in the first quarter.
So I think the recipes to remedy that are the same ones we identified, which was accelerated category expansion, and move into first-party, and to a whole series of initiatives that we had for consumer electronics that I just covered a few questions ago to reignite the growth in that category. I think if anything, COVID has accelerated some of those and so that, to a certain degree, I think the better results in April are a consequence obviously, of incremental online demand. But also hopefully, are also the results of some of the initiatives that we have been working on since Q4 that are beginning to ideally impact and drive some of that acceleration. Perfect. Great. Thanks guys. Thanks very much for the -- Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program as well as the program. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Now, let me turn the call over to Pedro. Hello everyone and welcome to our second quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I want to take a moment to highlight that our thoughts and well wishes continue to go out to all the individuals and families affected by COVID-19, both at our company and everywhere. We particularly extend our immense gratitude for and appreciation and recognition to all those brave souls who continue to work on the frontlines through this unprecedented global health crisis. As you may have seen our latest branding campaign Elbow to Elbow which promotes social distancing is one of the ways we are contributing to awareness around prevention, raising funds for treatment efforts and paying tribute to healthcare professionals. I'll detail our other contributions in a moment. We also want to take this opportunity to thank all of MercadoLibre's employees who have shown endless amounts of resiliency, effort, sense of purpose and courage whether it be balancing the requirements of family, household and work responsibilities while conforming to social distancing norms and working from home or showing up to work at our warehouses and service centers every day enabling us to deliver the goods that our users need. We are all immensely proud of all the hard work our employees are doing during such trying times.
Before I dive into the quarterly performance overview, let me share with you some of the efforts we continue to undertake in response to this pandemic. We have kept remote work for all the teams except for our logistics personnel for which we have applied the strictest norms of prevention and hygiene in all our logistic centers. Added temporarily to our payroll employees from Le Pain Quotidien in Argentina, while in July we signed agreements with the master franchisees of brands such as McDonald's and Starbucks. In this manner, and together with the agreement that we have already implemented with LPQ, we will total 350 contracts under this collaborative labor initiative in Argentina. We are working towards extending this offer throughout Latin America. We have continued to manage the operation of our commerce, shipping and fintech solutions without significant interruptions throughout the quarter helping new and existing sellers to continue their operations as well as buyers to get their products on time. We have launched comprehensive support and training platforms for thousands of SMEs and entrepreneurs in the region, facilitating the onboarding of merchants that are starting to operate in the world of online commerce for the first time as well as generating alliances with some of the main e-commerce platforms that operate in this segment. We continue to strengthen our presence and our offering in the longtail and midtail segments by enabling merchants to process food aid cards in Argentina and Brazil. Already representing 10% of our MPOS TPV in Argentina and allowing for more than 40,000 new merchants to accept these emergency payments.
We have promoted our payments linked to avoid crowds of people at physical points of sale while also allowing small and medium sized businesses to continue to operate. We improved the private experience and enhanced the communication positioning the payment link as an excellent solution for distance sales in the current context without needing to have an e-commerce site. And finally, we continued with our donation campaigns helping NGOs and food banks in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Colombia, Peru and Uruguay through the Elbow to Elbow challenge and campaigns.
With that said, let's recap our performance during the quarter starting with our e-commerce business. E-commerce surged during the second quarter as we reached new milestones in penetration and experienced powerful tailwinds which drove solid performance and overall execution across the board. Traffic and buyers accelerated strongly versus the first quarter with an unprecedented increase in engagement rates. Sessions grew by 48% year-on-year, an acceleration of 28 percentage point versus last quarter's growth. We also improved our conversion rates with buyers on our marketplace surpassing the $30 million mark reaching $31.5 million during the quarter. Engagement rate in terms of frequency of purchase increased from 4.3 items per unique buyer last year to 5.7 items, representing more than a 30% improvement annually on a consolidated basis and new buyers attained a record growth of 75% year-on-year. Consolidated gross merchandise volume doubled over last year growing at 102% during the quarter with all countries accelerating sequentially on an FX neutral basis.
On a country level, all of our countries accelerated from the first quarter as we delivered FX neutral year-on-year growth rates of 230% for Argentina, 58% for Brazil and 122% for Mexico. Colombia and Chile's combined growth was almost 200% year-over-year. We've become more focused on these two Andean markets given their increasingly attractive growth profiles as the business accelerates in scale. Our other segment grew 69% year-on-year-on-year on an FX neutral basis. Furthermore, underlying the strength of the quarter, units sold growth exited the quarter growing above 100% year-on-year in all of Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Chile and Colombia. At the category level, consumer electronics, which was once one of the most affected verticals at the beginning of the year, started recovering during May and June to complement the sound growth rates in categories more directly related to COVID driven consumer behavior changes such as CPG and health, to name a few.
Regarding consumer electronics, in Brazil, where we have been doing significant work to improve price competitiveness, assortment amongst other initiatives. In this country, we exited the quarter with an almost 40% growth acceleration throughout the period indicating that many of our efforts are beginning to pay off. In consumer packaged goods, specifically, not only have we continued to see improvements in terms of adoption and growth but we are also continuing to verticalize the experience in this increasingly important category for us.
On the product side, during the month of April, we launched our supermarket navigation in Brazil and Argentina helping us accelerate conversions and growth in that category. In line with that, we also continued enhancing the navigation experience through our shopping cart as we enabled users to bundle items in a single order and be able to access free shipping benefits on this category as well.
We have also made solid progress on our cross-border trade initiatives to deepen assortment and selection during the quarter especially in Mexico. Our improved output was primarily driven by our Chinese sellers being able to recover from the initial impact of COVID-19 to their businesses. Additionally, during the second quarter, we launched pricing per category in Mexico and Chile. This had already been made available in Colombia since the first quarter where we lowered commissions for consumer electronics categories and increased them for higher margin merchant categories like fashion and apparel as well as furniture, among others. This initiative allowed us to better adapt pricing to our merchant's margin structures and be more competitive without compromising overall monetization and take rates.
I'll now turn to logistics. A growth area that continues to unlock powerful synergies with our marketplaces. Our managed network has been central to growing our e-commerce businesses and being able to handle the increased demand resulting from the pandemic. Validating the resources we have been allocating to the growth of our own logistics network over the previous years. We are delivering on time and cost efficiently across the region with our consolidated net promoter score continuing to improve. In fact, our managed network NPS reached an all-time high in Brazil with users highlighting speed of delivery and merchants' quality of our shipping services. We've also been able to maintain delivery speed while growing volume, particularly for deliveries arriving in less than 48 hours where year-over-year we improved by 10 percentage points, the consolidated share of these rapid deliveries especially in Brazil where that improvement was of 13 percentage points.
Same day deliveries also improved on a consolidated sequential basis with countries such as Brazil more than doubling from prior year quarter share mainly attributable to a higher penetration of our Flex service, which already accounts for 5% of the consolidated volume. Important milestones in Mercado Envios did not stop there. Our managed network penetration surpassed the 50% mark on a consolidated basis. Brazil and Argentina reached 51% and 79%, respectively. Fulfillment in Brazil reached 17% of total shipments exiting the quarter with a penetration of nearly 20% in June, the remaining 30 points of the Brazilian managed network coming from our rapidly expanding cross stocking operations. In Mexico, we maintained the pace of execution with fulfillment penetration stable on a sequential basis.
On the shipping product and technology front, we are pleased to report that MELI Logistics, our integration of micro carriers into our managed network gained penetration in Brazil and Mexico. We also launched technology for this product in Argentina during the quarter enabling us to more efficiently manage the pandemic-driven surge in demand we have faced. As a result of this integration and as our Flex logistics solution continues to gain share, we continue to generate efficiencies in our shipping costs with savings Q-on-Q of around 23% per unit shipped.
Given the success of our managed network, we've continued scaling this important initiative with the launch of our first fulfillment centers in Chile and Colombia as we doubled down on our efforts to maintain our leadership position in these countries. Additionally, we also continued with the expansion and rollout of our Flex logistics solution launching it in Uruguay and Chile during the quarter. The latter should not only help us drive greater penetration of Mercado Envios in the aforementioned countries, but also enable us to have more influence over the last mile delivery being able to generate efficiencies on the most cumbersome part of the shipping journey. Additionally, we continued expanding places, our drop-off point solution in Brazil. We now have over 1,300 places drop-off points throughout four states. During the pandemic given that some of our drop-offs weren't marked as non-essential activities and weren't able to open, we implemented an alternative places offering; MELI branded place trucks. This initiative was deployed in safe, high density locations in São Paulo providing an innovative experience to sellers at a reduced cost.
With that, now let's move on to the fintech side of the business, another critical building block of our ecosystemic strategy. Our off-platform payments business exceeded our expectations during the period due to the strong performance of our online payments business and the relative resiliency demonstrated by our physical in-store solutions, MPOS and QR. Consequently, Mercado Pago surpassed the 52 million payers mark during the quarter, growing 64% year-on-year accelerating sequentially by more than 21 percentage points. We've also seen better engagement rates with our payment solution achieving almost eight transactions per quarter per unique payer.
During the quarter, off-platform total payment volume accelerated sequentially to 175% year-on-year on an FX neutral basis with a stellar 339% year-on-year growth in Argentina, a strong performance in Mexico and in the other segments which are growing over 220%. Brazil, on the other hand, has a greater off-platform total payment volume contribution from mobile POS systems which rely on foot traffic, which, given the aforementioned lockdowns, was a more compromised segment than online payments. The impact of the pandemic on the MPOS business translated into a slower off-platform TPV growth pace in Brazil of 84% year-on-year.
During the second quarter, our online payments processing business, what we call merchant services, delivered one of the highest historical growth rates reaching 164% year-on-year on an FX neutral basis. The latest shift towards e-commerce consumption benefited us across all regions. Notably, we recorded year-on-year growth of 457% in Colombia and 258% in Argentina both on an FX neutral basis. Not only did our online services accelerate on both number and volume processed, but also on the onboarding of new merchants adopting our payments offerings. This has accelerated the migration of sellers to the online world, both large and longtail, leading to a record acquisition during the second quarter. Mobile wallet also had a strong quarter as it benefited from a consumer shift to contactless payments, although we did observe a deceleration in the in-store payment solutions like our QR and MPOS products. The latter too continued to be affected by lower foot traffic due to COVID-19 throughout the quarter. As a result, consolidated wallet TPV accelerated to 373% year-on-year on an FX neutral basis. Overall wallet adoption reached 9.5 million active payers during the quarter with almost 10 transactions per quarter per unique payer accelerating the frequency of purchase versus prior quarters.
Second quarter MPOS TPV grew on a consolidated FX neutral basis by 80% year-on-year. This performance was impacted more negatively during April with the year-on-year growth of 71%, but accelerated through May and June exiting the quarter at a growth rate of 89% year-on-year almost reaching pre-COVID levels. Additionally, in Argentina, we are happy to report that we launched our Point Plus device which should enable us to move up the merchant base and have a more complete value proposition that facilitates better cross-selling to marketplace merchants who also have physical stores. Although, as I just mentioned, the pandemic negatively impacted the physical retail footprint across the region, our active MPOS merchant base increased during the second quarter to 3 million, while on a consolidated basis device sales surpassed the previous quarter mark reaching almost 1 million devices sold. This strong momentum of device sales and user base growth is mostly due to the trend towards digital payments, cash shortages and an increased propensity towards local purchases in smaller convenience stores. We also implemented different initiatives to accelerate the transactional volume including but not limited to lowering fees, eliminating interest charges on credits, cross-selling the payments link and enabling the feature of acceptance of emergency aid as a means of payment.
Staying on Fintech, one quick update on our PayPal commercial agreement. We are very pleased to announce that PayPal is now available for cross-border transactions on MercadoLibre in Brazil and Mexico and also available as a payment option within Mercado Pago's online checkout for foreign shoppers. This is a first step that we hope will generate powerful synergies between both companies and boost even further our common objective to democratize payments throughout Latin America.
Moving on to Mercado Credito. During the quarter, we slowed our pace of originations in order to manage our exposure to merchant and consumer credit risk as the pandemic and lockdowns got stronger at the beginning of the quarter. We've been able to mitigate default rate impacts due to the swift preventive measures taken. Consequently, non-performing loans actually improved Q-on-Q on a consolidated basis. This was, in large part, explained by the slowdown in the pace of originations during April that I just mentioned as our teams shifted origination towards users with good historical credit behavior, while we also enhanced our collection mechanisms and processes. Along these lines, it's also important to highlight that as we entered into May and June and we had more data in our models, we gained a better, more confident understanding of users which enabled us to more accurately predict their behavior and also to ramp up originations again. When we analyzed the non-performing loans through the second quarter on a monthly basis, they have kept improving all the way through the end of June. The lower bad debt levels plus higher interest rates have resulted in an improvement in the profitability of our credits business during the second quarter.
Let me now move on to the review of our financial progress report for the quarter. The financial performance we delivered during the second quarter has been stellar. However, I do want to take a moment to highlight two things before I walk you through the actual results. First, I want to acknowledge an event that took place during the quarter which resulted in a bad debt charge of $27 million. Within Mercado Pago, we traditionally have agreements with multiple unaffiliated entities under which our users are able to deposit cash at the agencies of these entities for credit to their Mercado Pago accounts. These amounts are recognized on our balance sheet as receivables from these unaffiliated entities. During the month of June, we became aware that one of the unaffiliated entities we work with in Argentina that acted as a cash collection agent had accumulated a number of receivables that they did not settle to our bank accounts. Upon review, we realized that collection efforts for these balances had not been carried out and that the aging of these accounts receivables exceeded the allowed limits established by our internal controls.
As a result, we've booked the charge to our P&L to reflect that the collections are past due our ageing policies while we continue to work to recover the amount from the counterpart. We've also identified this event as an opportunity to improve our internal controls on this specific matter in order to avoid a similar situation occurring in the future. We've also revised all other accounts and have found no evidence of similar deficiencies in collections efforts with other entities that form part of our payments value chain.
Second, and to state the obvious, this has been a unique quarter. Changes in consumer demand brought about by the pandemic have accelerated adoption of digital platforms significantly throughout the region. We believe this has both the enduring impact of greater scale benefits in general to our financials as well as the short term benefit of allowing us to significantly decrease marketing spend while still benefiting from accelerating organic traffic. As we see it, that first trend is sustainable. The second one less so, as we plan to re-ramp up sales and marketing investments in our business to acquire and retain the growing number of users that have moved to online during the last few months.
With those two comments out of the way, let me start my review of our P&L with comment on consolidated net revenues. For the second quarter, they ascended to $878.4 million; a year-on-year increase of 61% in US currencies and 123% on an FX neutral basis. As we continue to optimize shipping subsidies and costs that minimize contra revenues from free shipping programs and benefit from the surge in demand throughout our platforms.
Gross profit for the second quarter was $427.2 million at a margin of 49% compared to 50% during the second quarter of 2019. The margin compression resulted primarily from an increase in shipping operating costs as a percentage of net revenues partially offset by a decrease in collection fees as a percentage of revenues. Sequentially, we've improved gross margins by 66 basis points mostly driven by better margins on the shipping warehousing front and efficiencies both in shipping carrier costs, MPOS purchase of devices and collection fees. In the slides accompanying this presentation, we've included, as we do every quarter, a detailed breakdown of these as well as the OpEx margin evolution that I'll cover quickly now.
Operating expenses increased to $227.7 million, an increase of 15% year-on-year in dollars. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses were 37% compared to 52% during the second quarter of 2019. The $43.1 million decrease is mainly due to marketing expenditure decreases that were made possible as a result of the extraordinary growth in organic demand brought about by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on consumer behavior. This was partially offset by $25.5 million increase in bad debt expenses explained by the recognition of a $27 million charge from the aforementioned accumulated accounts receivables from an unaffiliated entity in Argentina, an increase of $14.5 million in our buyer protection program expenses mainly in Mexico and Argentina, a $2.3 million increase in chargebacks from credit cards due to the increase in our Mercado Pago transaction volume, a $1.6 million increase in other sales expenses mainly related to marketing initiatives and a $1.5 million increase in salaries and wages.
Additionally, we had a one-time charge in the valuation methodology of how we account for our long term retention plan of $15.3 million. As a result, operating income was $99.4 million compared to a loss of $29.7 million during the prior quarter. As a percentage of revenues, operating income margin was 11.3% improving by 1,587 basis points on a sequential basis. Excluding the bad debt one-time charge, operating income would have been $126.1 million representing a margin of 14.4%.
Moving down our P&L, the company incurred $27 million in financial expenses for this quarter mainly attributable to financial loans entered into during the second quarter of 2020 mainly in Brazil and Argentina and interest expenses from our trusts related to our factoring business in Argentina and the 2028 convertible notes we have issued. Interest income was $18.8 million, a 44% decrease year-over-year as a result of lower interest rates in our investment as a consequence of the pandemic. As a result of this, net income for the second quarter ascended to $55.9 million.
Before wrapping up, I want to recognize this delicate moment in history, one that has taken a toll on all of us in health, wealth and spirit. At MercadoLibre, our stated business mission is to democratize commerce and payments. With so many businesses being hard hit, we have the unique opportunity to connect and empower millions of Latin American entrepreneurs while continuing to partner with governments across the region in our role as an essential service. Never has our mission been more relevant and never have we felt more determined to fulfill it. We will continue to do our part to help get the world back on its feet, and once we get there, we hope to celebrate that achievement with all of you Elbow to Elbow.
Thank you. everyone, as always for joining the conference call and we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress report next quarter. With that, we can take your questions. Our first question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Okay. Thank you. So, Pedro, can you talk about the changes to the fee structure that is now expanding out of Colombia. Presumably, this should result in greater listing selection and hopefully purchase velocity, but we wanted to confirm that you are indeed seeing this pick-up, although it might be difficult to disaggregate the impact versus the pandemic's impact. Also, when do you anticipate rolling out the fee structure changes to Brazil? Thank you. Hi, Stephen. Thanks. So, the fee structure aims, as you anticipate, to better match the fees we charge merchants with the economics of different categories, and therefore, should drive more merchants to want to list. We're trying to accomplish this in a way that is take rate neutral. So, we're not trying to raise take rates nor diminish them. And you are correct. Disaggregating impact from the overall context is extremely difficult. I think the one assertion we can make is that the balancing of take rate has worked well in the markets where we've done this, and obviously our marketplaces are on fire across the board. So, we anticipate and we are working on the rollout to Brazil. We haven't communicated specific date yet, I believe, but this is something that given the positive impact in the other countries, we are looking to roll it out to the other markets. Thank you. Our next question comes from Irma Sgarz with Goldman Sachs. Yes. Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. In the monetization of the e-commerce – the commerce revenue, the commerce GMV, you have some impressive results. I know there's a couple of different forces at play and you mentioned in your opening remarks the impact of reduced optimized free shipping subsidies and contra revenues. But could you just maybe touch up, maybe a little bit more color on what were the main drivers here and how you maybe see that progressing into? If there's anything sort of one-off (00:34:36) that we may not be seeing into the back half of the year? Thank you. Irma, sorry. I'm not sure I understood the first part of the question. It's about the monetization rate over the implied take rate of the commerce revenues over the GMV which improved year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter by an impressive amount. And I wanted to understand that you sort of separate the different impacts from I think there's probably also, to some extent, some accounting effects, some of the revenues or some of the shipping costs are shifting to different lines, but how should we think about this into the back half of the year in 2020 and 2021? So, I think what you're seeing now probably already begins to reflect a more stabilized level in terms of representation of where the revenues are presented. And in terms of free shipping, I think we're analyzing going forward where there are opportunities to increase free shipping. But given that there also have been significant improvements, as we called out, in cost of shipping and whatnot, we actually see pockets of opportunities to offer more free shipping without negatively affecting monetization. So, I think the quarter should be a reasonable indication of where the year could play out in terms of the monetization level on the marketplace. The other issue Irma that drives the deltas and monetization on a consolidated basis is if you look at the growth rates, we are seeing tremendous performance out of Colombia, Chile. Even Mexico continues to drive phenomenal growth. Brazil rebounded significantly but when you compare growth rates to these other markets, it's lower. So our mix shift is moving to some of these newer markets with big opportunity and they typically have lower monetization levels on the commerce side as they are earlier stage. Perfect. Thank you very much. Our next question comes from Bob Ford with Bank of America. Hey, good morning everybody and congratulations on the quarter. Pedro, I wanted to ask two questions if that's okay. Can you talk a little bit about adoption rates at QR-enabled point of sale with Cielo, Linx and your other Brazilian partners and how you expect that to ramp? And also, how are you thinking about remittances and the adoption of a digital solution given the very high cash orientation of the market today? And then you've made tremendous progress with respect to the managed network (00:37:51) in Brazil. Can you talk a little bit about the possible impact in the event of another Correios strike in Brazil and how you can mitigate that given the greater integration? Hi, Bob. This is Osvaldo. With regards to adoption of QR codes in Brazil, what we saw in general not only in Brazil but in general during the second quarter was that due to diminished foot traffic in the case of world, we saw an acceleration in those flows which do not require people to be in person. So, we saw acceleration in P2P payments, in top up of mobile phones and also in payment of utilities. In terms of QR code, given that there was a significant decrease in foot traffic and that some of the categories where we have been stronger are related to food or gas station, what we did was we reduced the number of incentives and discounts we were providing. With regard to your specific questions of how do we expect the ramp up with Cielo and Linx so far, we have seen some transactions there, but it's difficult to discern quite the effect given this reduction in overall foot traffic and lower use of in-store payments during the quarter. I'm not sure I got your second question Bob. Was it related to remittances, right? It was. And given the cash orientation of the market today, how do you plan to change that behavior pattern? I would expect that the – certainly the fees and the foreign exchange spreads have to be much more competitive with your value proposition? Yes. With regard to remittances, we have been doing more business development and partnering with other companies to become stronger here. As you know, part of the agreement we have with PayPal is that we will leverage their Xoom platform and we are already working on together managing remittances from the US into Mexico. They have a huge distribution of people who could fund those accounts in the US and they would be able to pay to our account holders in Mexico. Beyond that, we have also started working with Western Union and providing them with the ability also to both fund and disburse placement. It is not live yet but we have announced it already. You can already fund transactions using Mercado Pago but you will also be able to disburse transactions using Mercado Pago. Great. On the managed network just to quickly level set. So the managed network has been our build out of our own logistics network over the past few years where we control transportation, cross-docking and fulfillment. Within the managed network, there is an operation we call MELI Logistics which further has driven the success we've had in terms of managing the surge in demand over the past few months which is where we begin to rely less and less on large transportation companies and are able to rely on smaller middle mile, last mile and first mile operators. The consequence of all this is that our overall reliance on Correios has continued to diminish month on month and Q-on-Q. So, if you look at the rumblings of a Correios' potential strike, I think we anticipate it to not be very long or severe. We believe that Correios will try to maintain level of operation as well as possible. We are in constant communications with them, but most importantly, we are much more able today to shift volume away from Correios. We are not entirely un-reliant on them but we are incredibly better equipped than in all the previous strikes we've had to face as a consequence of everything that we've been building on the logistics front which is really, really one of the highlights of our execution over the past few months and quarters. Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Ruben with Morgan Stanley. Hi. Thanks very much for the question. So wondering if you could please talk some more about some of the assortment initiatives. First, you mentioned CPG and supermarket. Curious how meaningful these categories are now and how you're viewing the pace of rollout? And then, second, on the first party assortment, any similar color there on your targets for 1P within the mix? Thanks very much. Sure. So consumer practical goods of which supermarket is a sub-initiative is a category that has been obviously surging throughout the COVID period, but it still represents mid-single to high-single digits for us in the most successful markets with tremendous upside in opportunity, as we begin to focus more and more on it. Our first party initiatives are still smaller than that. They're probably in the lower single digits, but again also, a lot of building blocks that we have put in place over the last few quarters and we feel we are increasingly better equipped to be able to accelerate investments in execution behind 1P to complement inventory gaps or to drive greater price competitiveness of our 3P efforts. And I would say that the third element in terms of assortments that you don't mention but is important is the current crisis has also generated a significant pickup in inbound interest and in pipeline of brands and merchants working with us to onboard into our marketplace. So that has also been another area where, because of all the building blocks that we've put in place over the last few years, we feel we can be of assistance to many merchants, large brands, OEMs as well that weren't working with us in the past and can start working now or for merchants who are already working with us to be able to double down on their marketplace efforts. Great. That building block makes sense. Thank you. Our next question comes from Ravi Jain with HSBC. Hi, sir. Good morning. Couple of quick ones from my end. In terms of the investment priorities, what do you see as maybe more strengthened or accelerated for 2020 now and maybe what is something which has slightly delayed both maybe on the marketplace and the Fintech end?
And the second one is specifically on Fintech. I mean, you've announced a partnership with HBO recently. Should we expect in the future to have multiple streaming partners or services that you would kind of work with? And what other features could you kind of give us some color on that you're planning for the loyalty program? And do you expect that there will be a strong marketing campaign around the loyalty program at some point? Thank you. Great. Hi, Ravi. So, at the risk of being repetitive but I think this is important, our strategy and our investment cycle by and large remains unchanged. If we were scrambling now to try to react to the opportunities arising because of COVID, I don't think we could be as successful as we're being. This is a consequence of work in logistics, in category expansion in overall user experience that obviously we've been highly focused on over many years now. Fortune comes to those that are prepared. So, at the margins, I would say, we have accelerated even further the rollout of our own logistics network because that has been key throughout this period and it's been tremendously encouraging to see how well the logistics operation has been able to deploy an even greater number of nodes in our own networks at an accelerating pace successfully. Obviously, from a category perspective, we have redirected resources and focus potentially away from some slower categories over the next few quarters like apparel or auto parts to some of the faster growing ones like CPG, supermarket, health and beauty, and again, this is not a change in strategy. It's marginal reallocations of capital.
On the Fintech side, I would say, there is an increased focus on the overall digital account as we see greater digital adoption and a somewhat slower adoption of certain in-store to our categories primarily in restaurants and food. So, there's a bit of a shift there. We still see restaurants, foods and other in-store QR categories and MPOS as tremendous opportunities formed in midterm. So I would say this is more of a pause before we start reaccelerating and we've already began to see that when you look at our comments on MPOS in Brazil and other markets as we compare the exiting of the quarter to the beginning of the quarter. The final point, I would say, is we have also, as a consequence of this, seen and been able to work with governments in helping them distribute a lot of the aid that is being distributed throughout Latin America, particularly in Brazil that has generated a ramp up in users receiving account balances as a consequence of these aid services and fundings by governments. And so that's also driven the focus I mentioned previously on digital account.
On your second question, we do intend and the strategy is to be able to work with leading entertainment and content companies in ways that are accretive to their objectives of customer acquisition and billing and charging of those customers throughout Latin America given the capabilities that Mercado Pago has. While simultaneously being able to generate value for our users within the loyalty program from discounts and special benefits and promotions that we are able to negotiate with these partners. So the idea is to generate a sort of a subscription hub for our users with benefits, while at the same time, driving incremental customer acquisition of digitally-savvy and high frequency users and also help these partners with the challenges in billing, charging and credit that exists throughout the region that we've solved very efficiently with Mercado Pago. But content is only one of the prongs behind the loyalty program. Free shipping obviously was the initial one that's been incredibly successful, but our idea is to continue to overlay other benefits as we partner with more and more companies in the region that want access to our growing user base of loyal users and are willing to give benefits and discounts to those users in order to acquire them. That's helpful. Thank you, Pedro. Our next question comes from Gustavo Oliveira with UBS. Hello, Pedro. Hello, Federico. Good morning, everyone. I have two questions. The first one, Pedro, may be a bit repetitive but do you foresee any logistics bottleneck in your entire system with the acceleration of growth or are you very comfortable with the pace of the investment that you are making. And if you could highlight where you see more critical volumes and capacity to drive? And the second question, the question is related to the payment link. You mentioned in your opening remarks that you are promoting more of the payment link as a future to help like reduce in store agglomerations et cetera. But do you foresee a long term opportunity here of both engagement and monetization, if possible? Great. So, let me take the first one and Osvaldo can take the second one. We are extremely focused on continuing to generate incremental capacity in our logistics networks and we are investing significantly behind that. We have already communicated incremental warehouses for Brazil. We have recently launched a new warehouse in Chile. We will be doing so in Colombia, and very, very rapidly building out what I mentioned before which is MercadoLibre Logistics which allows us to access capacity from small companies' independent truck drivers and whatnot. So, our expectation is that we can continue to generate that incremental capacity as our volumes grow. So far so good. It's an ongoing process. It's challenging, but most importantly, we believe that it generates an enormous competitive advantage because what we are building is truly unique. And if you look at service levels of that logistics part of our overall network throughout the COVID crisis, they have been extremely good, while at the same time, driving down prices. So, this is a strong competitive advantage as we build that out. With regard to the payment link, it's a technology we have for many, many years but we have truly accelerated, as a consequence of COVID, that part of what has happened is many individuals and small businesses which in the past did not sell online, could always be able to collect in person were not able to do so. And so they had – they started to sell online and probably through very (00:53:17) sharing a payment link through WhatsApp or other social media or even deliveries where they're able to collect online and this has really a significant acceleration. We see this as an opportunity to engage those more merchants and have them move along, start doing more e-commerce in general. We see that the monetization is pretty healthy because usually these are merchants with a very long tail. So, we do not need to offer any discounts on our fees. So monetization is very good. With regards to the long term opportunity, we believe we saw it mostly as an entry point into e-commerce for the individual and some small merchants. Thank you. Our next question comes from Edward Yruma with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Two quick ones for me. First, thank you for the commentary on marketing. I guess at what point do you believe that you'll have to re-layer in marketing again? Will this occur in third quarter? And second, given some of the favorable quarter-on-quarter trends in Mercado Credito, are you expanding now at this stage a credit issuance? Thank you. Sure. So, very quickly without guiding which we don't, we have begun to once again invest behind customer acquisition and even more so brand building. This is a unique opportunity with tremendous fast forward in digital adoption by consumers throughout the region. And so, this is not a time to focus on marketing efficiencies. We believe the scale benefits from the business will still be there, but certainly, we want to be aggressive and to capture the opportunity. So we have already began to spend more on marketing. Q2 really was anomalous in that marketing spend. We cut back entirely as we try to understood what was going on and the organic demand was still there. We've now began to take the learnings from all that and to selectively deploy capital in both sales and marketing again. It should still be efficient, but yes, we are already spending. And Ed, with regard to Mercado Credito, initially in the second quarter, we were cautious because we wanted to see how each merchant and each consumer was doing, but as you're saying, we are expanding the offering, the credit issuance. In fact, our credit offering is already above pre-COVID levels. Great. Thank you. You Our next question comes from Deepak Mathivanan with Barclays. Great. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Pedro, I realized that you don't want to provide guidance but can you provide some additional color on what you're seeing in July and August on the e-commerce and Fintech business? Obviously, these are volatile times but it seems like e-commerce has stayed strong through July in many markets. But can you talk about what you're seeing?
And then, the second question on MPOS. You mentioned that it's close to pre-COVID levels already. What type of businesses are driving the recovery at this time and can you talk a little bit about how much of the margins that you had in 2019 are likely lost permanently in this business? Thank you. So I think very quickly, we mentioned in the prepared remarks that we exited the quarter and entered the July period across most markets in a stronger fashion than we did in the beginning of the quarter which was already quite strong as a consequence of consumers moving online, but I think there's still a lot that we need to wait and see what happens on a macro level. So, we will give you an update when we report the next quarter, but certainly, we have gone from strength-to-strength. With regards to MPOS, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we did see an acceleration in the number of active merchants. We have 3 million active merchants and at this, I would say, is related to two facts. On the one hand, as people prefer to stay away from cash, we have seen an increased demand of devices and for the first time we sold about 1 million devices in the quarter. What type of merchants? It's mostly small merchants. Nonetheless, we have been able to move up the merchant base. We're starting to move up the merchant base both in Argentina and Brazil we launched. In in the prior quarter, we have launched the MPOS Pro in Brazil and we launched an MPOS Plus in Argentina which are added to this higher merchant base and something that's worth mentioning. And I'd say it varies a little – category varies a little bit on a country-by-country basis. In Argentina, it's more – we're seeing more supermarkets and mom-and-pop stores using our MPOSs and in Brazil it's mostly smeller, individuals and merchants. And additionally, a driver behind increase in volumes in the quarter have been government aid both in Argentina, Brazil which is disbursed through to bank accounts or special cards. We have been able to launch the possibility to accept these cards both in Argentina and Brazil and this has driven daily card volume in both countries. Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna. Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I'll just ask the two upfront. So, it sounds like as we've seen elsewhere, the payments business is clearly benefiting from the e-commerce business, I was wondering if you would say the opposite is true as the e-commerce business also benefiting from the payments business; maybe you could reference some examples because it seemed like there was a big boost in Mercado Pago net new actives or accounts on file and their usage. So, that's the first question. And then let's see, oh, about this CPG mix, we recognize it's a great opportunity and it seems like you've monetized that opportunity, but where are we in that journey, when do you see it like being more material than just mid- to high-single digits? Thank you. So, let me take a stab at both and Osvaldo can complement. Clearly, we have a unique platform approach to our business where we combine commerce and payments in as synergistic a fashion as we can. So, all these users that are onboarding the digital wallet and coming into payments eventually through the loyalty programs, through cross-sell, but I would say the loyalty program is the big bet there. We should be able to convert those to commerce users as well. I would characterize that one as more opportunity than actually immediately happening because a lot of these users will first come on to the payments wallet, begin to use the systems and then we have to, with time, be able to cross-sell to them. On the CPG mix, I think, there is still a lot to come. We will continue to expand our CPG offering and our supermarket offering. We will continue to invest in the technology and the frontends to make purchases more verticalized within those categories. We will combine this with more and more 1P mix. So, I would say, this is in the very early innings. It's gotten to mid- to high-single digits faster than we thought because of COVID, but there is still a lot to grow. And when we look at share of wallet and overall consumer spend in the region, this is obviously one of the very big categories that we still under-index. So, I think the upside there is quite significant as we continue to build user experiences around that category. The only thing that I would add is that we have already seen, as you've mentioned, both Mercado Pago users grew transactions on MercadoLibre and vice versa. For the quarter, we had in total 52 million payers. And if we were to look at each of the verticals, 31 million were on platform, 30 million off platform. So there was a 9 million overlap during both on and off-platform transactions during the quarter. And what we are seeing is increased number of transactions in payments per quarter and we believe this extra visibility will result in an extra drive in both verticals. Thank you, Pedro. Thank you, Osvaldo. Our next question comes from Marvin Fong with BTIG. Great. Thank you very much for taking the time to answer my question. So, two – just one quick one on the new commission structure in certain countries, could you just help us understand if we should just assume that the overall take rate will stay consistent with prior history or would it move one way or the other up or down as a result of changes? And then the second one, perhaps for Osvaldo, the new PIX initiative that should be coming into play in Brazil starting November. Just curious what your thoughts on that are? Do you see it as a major catalyst for new user adoption of digital wallets in general? Thank you. So on the changes in take rates, again just to level set, we are rising take rates on categories where merchants typically have higher margins and we are lowering take rates in categories where merchants typically have lower margins and we are trying to accomplish this in a take rate neutral fashion. Consolidated take rate for MELI should continue to consistently grow as consumers and merchants adopt more and more of our services and we're able to better monetize our user base from this incremental adoption of services. But the specific marketplace pricing, we are trying to carry this out in a take rate neutral fashion. We've been successfully doing that in Colombia and so far in Mexico and Chile likewise, but it isn't a moving target. And with regard to PIX, we are very excited with the initiative. We believe we have lots of effects, but we want to speak about one in each of the online and offline. Online, we are excited mostly because up until now it was very difficult to accept debit cards in Brazil. So, most of the e-commerce was done only with credit card and we believe that PIX will enable millions and millions of users who did not have either a credit card or did not have available balance in the credit card to do more transactions online. And then, with regards to offline, we believe that it will drive acceleration of acceptance of QR codes in Brazil. And I think that there will be – we are preparing to work there in increasing the number of stores and our sales force to reach out to these stores. We believe that QR in PIX combined with the ability to process credit card transactions which we already had will also enable to accelerate the deployment of QR code payments in the country. So, we are working on that. Great. Thank you both very much. Appreciate it. Our next question comes from Marcelo Santos from JPMorgan. Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about your long term strategy for logistics especially in Brazil where we see some of your marketplace competitors operating some sort of omni-channel using their network of stores as advanced inventory locations. Do you think this could create a disadvantage in the long term? Do you think they would be able to provide quicker deliveries given that they will have the inventory close to the consumer and what's your view on that? Let's see. First of all, I think we have always said that we believe that long term as consumers get more demanding as they do in developed markets, home delivery beats pickups. So our approach is to build out the number of FCs we have to get inventory closer to consumers but continue to deliver to your doorstep, not have you have to drive to the retail location to get the product which at the end of the day is the same thing as an offline purchase. To your doorstep also allows us to get things to you quicker. Having said that, we also have initiatives that look to replicate some of those elements of having a physical store footprint. So we are rapidly growing our pick up and drop off points throughout most of our network to be able to have greater nodes for merchants to drop things off which would be the equivalent of what some competitors could try to do with the stores. But clearly, our network design does not try to turn a physical store which we don't have into a highly optimized e-commerce fulfillment center or cross stocking or service center but rather we focus entirely on building out capabilities to get things to your doorstep faster and cheaper than anyone else. Okay. Thank you very much. Our next question comes from Kunal Madhukar with Deutsche Bank. Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to understand the competitive landscape not only within online but also with offline in terms of, you just mentioned competitors using their stores as fulfillment centers or as part of the logistics network. So what do you see in terms of them kind of going more and more online in Brazil as well as in Mexico? Thank you. So, look, I think we really continue to focus on our users and building out our capabilities. If we do that, I think history has shown that we are in a unique position because of the platform we have, the capabilities we have, the brand we have to continue to gain share over long periods of time and to be the market leader in this rapidly expanding space. So, really, our focus is how do we continue to execute the way we have been executing, continue to launch innovative products, get into more categories and that is how we believe we will build competitive advantages and continue to be successful in the competitive scenario. Obviously, the region is competitive. Competitors also have their initiatives, but we stay focused on ourselves and our consumers. We trust that we will continue to lead and gain share as this market expands. Thank you. Our next question comes from John Colantuoni with Jefferies. Thanks taking my question. Sounds like you made a lot of progress in supermarket and CPG during the quarter. Can you discuss what initiatives you have in place to help retain CPG's sellers once the pandemic is over? Also could you talk about any key changes in purchasing frequency and retention that you've observed in other categories that you directly attribute to the expansion of your CPG offerings? Thank you. Thanks. Great questions. So, there is a lot of work on frontend and product initiatives. We've launched our supermarket navigation in more markets now. We've continued to try to optimize pricing for CPG, eliminating flat fees and offering more free shipping even on lower ASP items in some countries. So, that should move volume and merchants will go and remain where volume has moved for you. We've also begun to complement with 1P purchasing which deepens our relationship with a lot of the CPG brands because we are now both buying from them and also helping them with marketplace. We have began to build deeper advertising relationships with the CPG companies where there is co-marketing and co-spending occurring. So, we offer them consumer insights, consumer data and ability to also market their CPG lines on the marketplace in addition to it being highly transactional and they can even go direct to consumer. And we are seeing interesting evidence that consumers who purchase in CPG are more engaged across other categories. Again, the CPG category is still small and we need to see how well this data holds up, but the initial data is very encouraging in terms of CPG purchasing cohorts showing very good behavior across other categories posterior to having purchased CPG. So, that's also encouraging for us. Great. Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the Q&A portion of today's conference. I'd like to turn the call back over to our host. Great. Thanks, everyone. We are incredibly encouraged by the last four months. We are incredibly proud of the work of our teams in a difficult time, but we still have a lot of work to do. So we will get back to that and look forward to reporting again to you in a few months' time. Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.","MercadoLibre, Inc. is preparing its second quarter 2020 earnings conference call . a reconciliation of GAAP measures can be found in our press release available on our Investor Relations website . the conference call is based on current information and current assumptions .",0.0

I am Federico Sandler, Investor Relations Officer for MercadoLibre. Our senior manager presenting today is Pedro Arnt, Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, Osvaldo Giménez, CEO of Mercado Pago will be available during today's Q&A session.
I remind you that management may make forward-looking statements relating to such matters as continued growth prospects for the company, industry trends and product and technology initiatives. These statements are based on currently available information and our current assumptions, expectations and projections about future events. While we believe that our assumptions, expectations and projections are reasonable in view of the currently available information, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.
Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in this call for a variety of reasons, including those described in the forward-looking statements and Risk Factors sections of our 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, Item 1A Risk Factors in Part II of our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2020, among any of MercadoLibre Inc.'s other applicable filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission which are available in our Investor Relations website.
Finally, I would like to remind you that during the course of this conference call, we may discuss some non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures can be found on our third quarter 2020 earnings press release available on our Investor Relations website.
Now let me turn the call over to Pedro. Hi, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Before we begin, I'd like to express our continued thoughts and well wishes to those affected by COVID-19, both at our company and everywhere. We particularly extend our immense gratitude, appreciation and recognition to those who continue to help us combat this unprecedented global health crisis.
Getting to our results. MercadoLibre recorded another strong quarter, driven by high demand for e-commerce and fintech services. Brazil, Chile and Colombia delivered very strong results in both e-commerce and fintech, while our Mexican operation is still experiencing robust growth, despite slight deceleration.
Let me dive deeper, starting with the third quarter e-commerce progress report. Increased demand continued during the third quarter, despite the gradual reopening of physical retail throughout the region. We attribute this to improved service levels and the incremental depth of assortment with which we served millions of buyers during the quarter.
In this particular regard, during the quarter we surpassed the 300 million milestone in live listings, reaching 304 million. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we've observed that buyers have diversified their purchases across a wider range of verticals on our platform. This in turn activates and engages them in a greater number of services and increases overall purchase frequency. The step-up in online purchasing has been stable across all sites in the region.
MercadoLibre's consolidated gross merchandise volume growth accelerated to 117% year-on-year on an FX-neutral basis. At the regional level, Brazil and Argentina accelerated to 74% and 242% year-on-year on an FX-neutral basis respectively.
Mexico's performance is notable given how COVID-19 impacted the region, delivering yet another quarter of GMV growth above 100% year-on-year, also on an FX-neutral basis. The growth of our Mexican business has been remarkable over the past few quarters.
In fact, if we were to adjust our GMV growth for the blue-chip exchange rate in Argentina, rather than the official exchange rate, our Mexican business is already at a size comparable to that of Argentina. This is a clear indicator of not only the phenomenal execution we've delivered, but the large opportunity that still lies ahead for us in Mexico.
Brazil's excellent performance can be explained by our ability to identify and act on opportunities for improvement in overall execution, product development and commercial initiatives that involve the selection and value proposition on subcategories where we had lower market share.
During the quarter, these initiatives resulted in the launch of pricing per category, renewed focus on underrepresented subcategories, growth in official store mix, improved rebate programs for merchants, increases in payment approval rates and post-sale service enhancements for sellers and buyers.
Fundamentally, we also continue to drive penetration on our managed network, which is the key pillar to generate better customer satisfaction and stickiness. Consequently, these initiatives have translated into market share gains across Brazilian e-commerce, as well as gains across key consumer electronics categories.
Additionally, we also improved our Net Promoter Score by offering buyers some of the fastest delivery times in Brazil, when items are shipped from our fulfillment centers. Countries in the Andean region continued to outperform well above year-opening expectations, particularly Chile, but also the case for Colombia.
During the quarter, we launched a few important product initiatives that we believe will help us scale faster, while improving the end-to-end shopping experience in those countries. And on the logistics front, we continued expanding our services. Our Flex app is now available in Chile and Colombia, while we continue to scale our fulfillment services in parallel. These are important initiatives within our ecosystem that we believe will help bridge the gap in terms of delivery times and position MercadoLibre extremely well in those markets.
Looking ahead, we will continue deploying our ecosystemic solutions in the Andean region, in line with the offerings already available in other main countries as we move into Q4 and 2021.
On the commerce demand side, unique buyers reached an all-time high of 35 million during the third quarter of 2020. This growth year-on-year in unique buyers was achieved not only by being able to successfully retain existing users, but also by maintaining momentum in the growth of new buyers.
During the quarter, we added two million unique buyers in Brazil. Retention of early cohorts, also continues to improve. On a category basis, looking at consumer's electronics a key vertical for us. We observed acceleration to approximately 100% year-on-year growth on a consolidated basis during the third quarter. Specifically in Brazil, the performance improvement in this vertical can be explained in part by greater corporate focus and execution, the rollout of dynamic pricing structure and greater investment in performance marketing to reposition our platform as a go-to destination for this specific vertical.
Another key vertical for us, consumer packaged goods grew at a robust 181% year-on-year on a consolidated basis during the third quarter of 2020. For all our top geos, within the CPG vertical, product launches, product enhancements and partnerships were a key theme during the quarter.
In our Brazilian supermarket vertical within CPG, we implemented navigation improvements, such as a progress bar to reach free shipping thresholds, along with new commercial promotional dates the re-launch of the Supermercado, and specials in some categories and also continued working to deepen assortment.
In Mexico, the third quarter, we've entered into agreements with JBP, Diageo and Grupo Modelo ABI in order to further develop these categories within our platform, while also promoting responsible consumption. Additionally, to promote this category, beginning in the fourth quarter, we've waived flat fees for our sellers and brands for products that are delivered, from our fulfillment centers.
Staying on e-commerce, but turning now to marketing. During the third quarter, we reignited marketing spend, after an atypical second quarter, doubling the size of our marketing investments in our marketplace on an absolute basis compared to the prior quarter. With that said, we are still investing at a lower rate than our original pre-COVID plan, due to the pandemic's continued impact in driving consumers online and because we are still generating robust organic traffic growth.
In the Andean region, we've accelerated the pace of marketing investments versus prior quarters, both in absolute values and as a percentage of GMV. This increase was particularly notable in Chile and Colombia, where we reinforced branding campaigns and invested in special dates and performance marketing campaigns, with solid results. Most notably, our Chilean operations now lead the top-of-mind measurements that we carry out in that country for the first time.
Let me now turn over to logistics, a key enabler of growth for our commerce business. Our logistics operations have been instrumental in helping us navigate through these trying times. And its powerful synergies with our e-commerce business have unlocked meaningful value, not only has helped us drive higher Net Promoter Scores, and customer satisfaction, but it is increasingly becoming a competitive advantage in multiple countries.
Our Mercado Envios managed network continued gaining penetration during the third quarter reaching 64% on a consolidated basis, exiting the quarter at 74% overall adoption. Brazil, Mexico and Argentina reached 68%, 56% and 84% respectively.
Fulfillment in Brazil reached 22% of total shipments, while in Mexico it has already surpassed 55% share of shipments. As a result, we've been able to deliver faster and more efficiently. In Brazil, we managed to improve delivery times and lower costs despite the Correios strike, which lasted for approximately six weeks this year. However since we successfully migrated significant shipping volumes on to our managed network, we've been able to not only almost double the amount of items, we've delivered versus last year but also significantly enhanced service levels recording a 20 percentage point improvement in shipments being delivered in less than 48 hours.
The growth of our MELI logistics proprietary technology within the managed network combined with the addition of Flex in the Greater São Paulo area helped scale our manage network resulting in lower shipping costs and delivery times improvements versus last quarter.
Another development in Brazil was the reduction of our free shipping threshold to BRL99 during the quarter. This had two key benefits. First, it broadened what was an already comprehensive free shipping program in Brazil. Second, it enabled us to cover a greater share of our marketplace GMV within the free shipping program.
In Mexico, the incorporation of cross-stocking to our Mexican managed network is part of our expansion plan in order to reduce our dependence on commercial carriers enabling us to find more capacity to accompany our increasing volumes and growth in that country.
And finally on logistics, we are happy to report that Colombia and Chile continue to gain penetration of our managed network, ramping at a very fast clip reaching 14% and 15% respectively, an almost 10 percentage point improvement versus last quarter.
Execution and logistics has been stellar across multiple geos.
During the quarter, as I've just called out we simultaneously shifted volume into our own managed network while continuing to invest and expand the buildout of our logistics infrastructure, despite trying circumstances. We are confident that the increased pace of execution in this expansion will enable us to be amongst the best-in-class in terms of service levels and continue to gain efficiencies in shipping costs going forward.
With that let's now move on to FinTech side of the business another central building block of our ecosystem strategy and value proposition. Mercado Pago reached almost 60 million unique payers during the quarter adding 7.5 million payers mainly attributable to Brazil. FX-neutral consolidated total TPV grew by 161% year-over-year during the quarter.
Our off-platform payments business accelerated sequentially to 197% year-on-year on an FX-neutral basis not only with a robust performance of online payments, but also an improvement in our in-store payment solution, particularly mobile point-of-sale devices.
We have observed that some segments that had not been heavily impacted during the quarantine regimes have now began to recover. The transportation segment, we serve is one example of hard-hit segments that are now beginning to recover. Off-platform unique payers reached 36 million with Brazil reaching almost 20 million. Specifically in Brazil, we reached an all-time high of unique payers added, adding almost 4.2 million over the prior quarter.
On the collectors' front we reached almost 11 million active collectors with Brazil leading on the merchant acquisition front. Starting with online payments, consolidated TPV accelerated to 204% year-on-year on an FX-neutral basis during the quarter with growth having been led by performances in Argentina and Brazil.
For Brazil, we saw solid online payments growth especially in the long tail and social seller segments setting new records for seller acquisition more than tripling the number of active sellers. The growth in Brazil's online merchant base is the result of a series of actions, we took focused on the acquisition of sellers especially those that started selling online for the first time.
In line with that, we also re-launched marketing campaigns with healthy seller acquisition costs and shorter payback periods. We also expanded our cross-sell actions with other Mercado Pago verticals especially with Point and QR. Additionally we launched incentive programs in conjunction with the main e-commerce platforms to facilitate the onboarding of new sellers to the online world.
And in Argentina, the other strong performer online payments accelerated sequentially mainly attributable to promotional dates, social sellers and an improved checkout. Social sellers' monthly acquisition reached an average of 113,000 in September versus the historical average of 33,000 where our main focus was to generate better cross-sell capabilities and optimization of marketing initiatives.
Our MPOS business has delivered solid execution as governments begin to ease quarantine measures. In Brazil TPV accelerated 14 percentage points versus last quarter almost reaching pre-COVID levels of growth. The pace at which we are selling devices was also a positive surprise with more than 1.3 million devices sold across LatAm during the quarter. And staying on Brazil MPOS, third quarter TPV cohorts are incorporating more TPV compared to January cohorts which shows a robust acceleration in the cadence of MPOS growth. This is in line with the sales levels of devices which also grew at a faster pace if we compare September to January.
In Brazil, we launched Point Smart, our top-of-the-line device focused on businesses that require a simple, fast and modern terminal. This device should enable better cross-sell for marketplace merchants who have physical stores and now are able to cater to their in-store payment needs given the new device we are offering. And in the case of Argentina, during the quarter, we grew 129% year-on-year on an FX-neutral basis. One important highlight from our MPOS business there is that as we evolved to multi-product with the launch of our Point Plus device, such rollout has been very well received.
Moving on to our mobile wallet, another key factor in our ecosystem. Our wallet TPV growth continued to accelerate on a consolidated and FX-neutral basis to 381% year-over-year. The share of payments once again skewed towards P2P transactions, utilities payments and cell phone top-ups as a consequence of COVID-19. For our last call, the second quarter represented an important milestone in terms of product migration and adoption of payment flows from the physical world to the digital world. And during the third quarter, we've been able to maintain the payment volume reached in the prior quarter and continue growing.
We focused on minimizing churn in order to retain digitized users gained and acquired during the pandemic. P2P payments continue to gain share of payments within the wallet. This trend was evident across the region. The large pickup in peer-to-peer during the quarter was not only driven by quarantines and shift to digital, but also by the launch of a new product experience and new free pricing for all transfers made with account money and debit card when P2P transactions.
Finally, on wallet, during the third quarter, we were able to grow the active payers to almost 14 million on a consolidated basis. In Brazil, we added a record high number of unique payers for a single quarter. We also have made inroads on the opposite end of the wallet as our collector network continues to grow at a healthy pace reaching 5.5 million active wallet collectors on a consolidated basis an all-time high on this front, more than doubling versus the prior quarter.
Let me now move on to our credit business. Mercado Crédito had a record third quarter with an all-time high in terms of originations growing 157% Q-on-Q. While our loan portfolio also reached an all-time high of $284 million as we've been able to originate more loans with lower NPLs. During the quarter, we had increased the APRs as we calibrated for higher delinquency rates. However, as the quarter progressed, we observed that defaults were in fact improving resulting in better profitability profiles.
In Brazil, we extended terms for online merchants up to 18 months and increased caps while also improving lifetime values. On consumer credit and express money users, we made our policies more flexible by lowering caps. Additionally, we've been able to enhance adoption of our credit products by leveraging artificial intelligence methods that enable us to do a credit offer at a point in the user journey where there is a greater tendency for adoption.
Originations on consumer credits accelerated 140% versus last quarter. Within our credit products, MPOS in-store merchant originations almost doubled while our express money credit product more than tripled its volume versus last quarter. Originations to merchants on our marketplace grew a solid 172% versus last quarter. Additionally, we launched our micro credits offering now representing about 15% of consumer credits in terms of originations.
With that, let's now move on to our financial progress report for the quarter. Let's start with the review of our P&L with comments on consolidated net revenues. For the third quarter, they reached $1.116 billion surpassing the $1 billion mark for the first time in the quarter and representing a year-on-year increase of 85% in U.S. dollars and 149% on an FX-neutral basis, mainly attributable to commerce net revenues that continued accelerating and reached their highest historical growth rate.
Gross profit for the third quarter was $480 million with a margin of 43% compared to 47% during the third quarter of 2019. The decrease in gross profit margin resulted primarily from an increase in shipping operation costs as a percentage of net revenues.
In the slides accompanying this presentation we've included as we always do a detailed breakdown of these as well as the OpEx margin evolutions that I'll cover quickly now. Operating expenses were $397 million, an increase of 8.4% year-on-year in dollars.
As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses were 35.6%, compared to 60.7% during the third quarter of 2019. The increase is primarily a consequence of marketing expenditure efficiencies, representing over 1500 basis points improvement that we achieved as a result of the growth in organic demand brought about by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on consumer behavior.
Moving down the P&L, the company incurred $24.5 million in financing expenses this quarter, mainly attributable to financial loans entered into during the third quarter of 2020, primarily in Brazil and Argentina and interest expenses from our trusts related to the factoring of our credit card receivables in Argentina.
During the quarter, we also had a foreign exchange loss of $30.4 million, mainly related to the difference of the Argentine official exchange rate and the blue-chip swap rate at which we effectively carry out stock repurchases in Argentine pesos.
We also believe this operation presents an added benefit of generating greater transparency around FX rate distortions that arise as a consequence of Argentina's multiple exchange rates. Interest income was $24.6 million, a 13.7% decrease year-over-year as a result of lower interest rates in our investments as a consequence of the pandemic mainly offset by higher interest income in Argentina as our float grows. As a result of this, net income for the third quarter was $15 million.
Wrapping up today's call, we want to reinforce our commitment to the democratization of commerce and money. The opportunity ahead of us remains sizable and we feel increasingly confident that we can capitalize on it.
Thanks everyone as always for joining the conference call and we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress report next quarter. With that, we can now take your questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Thank you. So Pedro in your prepared remarks you talked about consumer electronics growing at I think 100% year-over-year. I know, it's probably hard to tell given the circumstances, but do you think that is a supply-led acceleration due to the change in the commission rate? Or is there like a price elasticity factor there as well as merchants adjust to the new rates?
And also in regards to the CPG effort, you talked about I guess a deeper assortment there also. Is that mostly through third-party sellers that you're getting the deeper assortment right now? Or have you started to form, I guess larger and deeper relationships with the brands directly? Thank you. Great, Stephen. So on consumer electronics what we highlighted was that we've really focused on some of these categories that we had identified as categories where we were lagging in fair share, compared to our overall expectations for market share. And we've really began to execute better on those categories.
So it's a combination of product improvements, new pricing, very strong execution on the commercial front to source better deals with OEMs that are coming across and then a more aggressive pricing and rebate policy also on price points, at which we sell. So to get that kind of a turnaround it really takes I think concerted execution across the board.
On consumer practical goods, we continue to have a growing 1P presence, but that business is still primarily 3P. And again we're just sourcing well from existing marketplace vendors. And really that's one of the areas where if you look at the user experience over the last few months, we've been perhaps more innovative than in many other places in terms of supermarket navigation and really improving the purchase of consumer packaged goods. And then, obviously, assisted by the overall pandemic and a very strong shift of demand online in those categories probably growing more than any other throughout the pandemic. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from Andrew Ruben of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Great. Thanks for the question. So we've seen a big pickup in your managed network penetration again this quarter. So I'm just curious for the quarter itself, how the Correios strike impacted the figures and your short-term strategy? And then thinking longer-term any update on where the managed network penetration could reach over time? Thank you. Yes. So counter intuitively, I think the strikes that we face end up being at an incredible positive for us long run because: a, they reinforce our commitment to moving volume on to our own managed marketplace at an accelerated pace, but it also gives our merchants a very strong incentive to migrate volume on to the managed marketplace. So not only is Brazil driving that increase in managed marketplace volume shift. That's happening in other key markets as well with very positive results in terms of delivery times and delivery costs. But yes, the strike in Brazil accelerates that move.
And we see this as a one-way door. So once merchants have moved on to our fulfillment cross-docking and places operations they tend to stay. And we make all the efforts for them to stay on the managed network. And so our aspirations are to continue moving volume on to the managed marketplace because we see the significant positive impact it has on delivery time cost and Net Promoter Scores. I don't think we give specific near-term or long-term objectives. Suffice to say that the more we move to the managed network the better it is for our consumers and for our merchants. Yeah. That make sense. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from Irma Sgarz of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. In your opening remarks in the press release you made a comment about that you're starting to strive for the highest segments of the merchant pyramid. Can you just expand a little bit on any disciplinary measures that you're taking that you'd call out for Fintech and e-commerce on that front? Thank you. So I'll quickly start with commerce since I've already mentioned some of it. We clearly are seeing incremental traction in our efforts to complement the historic core base of SMEs that sell on our marketplace with a growing number of flagship store and official stores across multiple categories. And so this is somewhat driven by rapid consumer demand online that is forcing many of these brands and OEMs to engage more constructively with online channels like our marketplace, but also as we improve our product and we improve our ability to sell into enterprises we are able to onboard a growing number of companies that sell direct through us.
We mentioned some of them in the CPG category in the prepared remarks. And there are others across consumer electronics. Samsung is rapidly becoming one of the largest marketplace sellers in many countries and a slew of others. Irma with regards to Fintech, on the POS front as you know in the past, we consider mostly on individuals. A few quarters ago we launched our Point Pro, which is a device with a printer on it. And what you saw was that the average volume of sales per device was over twice what we had on the MPOS segment. And now more recently we launched Smart POS. And again, we are seeing a step-up with TPV which is roughly 12% higher than the one we already had with Point Pro. So we continued to see increased volumes per device and we are starting to be able to penetrate SMBs which is a tad were out of our scope. Great. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Ford of Bank of America. Your line is now open. Thank you. Good evening everybody and congratulations on the quarter. Pedro, can you talk a little bit about your use of air cargo? There seems to be a lot going on besides the dedicated aircraft in Brazil. And I'm curious in terms of what the implications of excess passenger capacity means for freighter availability and your costs now whether or not this has implications for network design and your build-out priorities. And how should we think about other markets when it comes to air cargo? So the overriding objective is how can we increase the number of parcels delivered in less than two days and then eventually continue to shorten that time. And for that especially in the larger geos like Brazil and Mexico air is a critical piece of this. We started with air as you mentioned using excess capacity on commercial carriers. And as we understood that part of the business better and the volume began to ramp up, we've continued to sort of integrate in that value chain and we now start having freight-only 3PLs that provide exclusive routes and exclusive planes for us, hence the news yesterday of the yellow-liveried MercadoLibre Air airplanes. And that will be a growing part of our network design as we strive to go faster.
Importantly, there's no CapEx involved in that. These are third-party logistics air providers and when we look at unit costs, we're trying to be selective in terms of routes where we have enough scale where the overall negative impact on unit cost is manageable yet the acceleration in delivery times is impactful. And no it's not just a Brazil thing, it already happens in Mexico. And I assume that as the networks grow in other markets, we will also look into it. Makes perfect sense. And just one other question if I may. Can you talk a little bit about app usage year-on-year in terms of engagement conversion rates, improved navigation, impacts for client acquisition costs? And then is there a reason to maintain separate Mercado and Pago apps? Or is there an opportunity that we should be considering longer term? So, we continue to see traffic and volume migrate increasingly obviously to mobile. I think we're already above 80% of volume is mobile and two-thirds is already app volume. And obviously that's a consequence of a combination of consumer demand shift, but also our continued focus on improving those app experiences.
In terms of number of downloads not always an ideal metric because our cadence of investment in downloads may vary Q-on-Q, but we continue to grow that base. And we believe that our installed base of both MELI apps and MFA apps continue to be one of our strongest competitive advantages across the region. Great. Thank you very much. Thank you. And our next question comes from Gustavo Oliveira of UBS. Your line is now open. Hi Pedro, good afternoon. I have two questions. The first one is I would like to understand a little bit better the impact of the -- on gross margins and perhaps on overall operating profit margin coming from the elevated penetration of 1P in the business. I think in one of the charts, you show here there is a 210 bps impact coming from cost of sales of goods. I wonder whether this is already coming from the increase in 1P penetration. So, if you could explore that a little bit.
And the second question is with respect to the growth of off-platform unique payers in Brazil, the 4.2 million new unique payers that you had in this quarter what are the drivers of this growth? Is this related to kind of any of your efforts associated with peaks and making sure that that's probably helping your growing unique payers base? Or there are other drivers behind that? Gustavo let me start with the second question the one regarding the acceleration of platform payers in -- mostly in Brazil. And I would say peaks did not yet have an effect on that. But what was a significant catalyst for that was Auxílio Emergencial emergency payments made in Brazil.
We saw a significant ramp-up in the number of people connecting their cash account with the Mercado Pago account to be able to access those funds and to make payments afterwards using Mercado Pago. And so we saw a spike in terms of downloads and of accounts being funded and then of payments made in Brazil driven by Auxílio Emergencial. Okay. Yes. And then on the 1P business Gustavo, this is a business that we are investing behind. We think that it has a key role to play going forward in terms of being able to step in with 1P offerings where there are inventory breakage or inventory gaps from our marketplace. It allows us to be very competitive versus other 1P competitors in terms of promotional calendar and pricing. And so this is an important part of our strategy going forward.
In the early years, it's a business that has less scale than what it will have in the future. And so when you look at current pure product margins and the overall P&L it does compress gross margins. I think the important thing here is to understand that we're investing into it because we trust that as it scales and grows there will be leverage on PPM on down. And that business longer term isn't necessarily going to be as much of a drag on gross margins as it is in the very early phases. Currently, Pedro, what's the penetration of 1P in your total GMV? Hello? Hello, Pedro. I think we can't hear you. Yeah. I'm not sure, if we got cut off. I think the last part of the answer was that we don't – Yeah, Pedro. I think – Yeah. Sorry. So we were saying that, we don't disclose what the percentage of 1P is, but it's growing nicely and it's still relatively small in the single digits. Okay. Okay. I could hear. Thank you, Pedro. Thank you. And our next question comes from Ravi Jain of HSBC. Your line is now open. Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. So the first one is given that your electronics GMV is growing nicely, is there a change in the way you think about like the big holiday sales like Black Friday et cetera, in terms of promotions and things like that? And the second one, was more on the Andean region. That has obviously been growing nicely. And when you look at the revenue split, it's still under-indexed quite a bit. So maybe some color around, what exactly do you want to focus on in Chile, Colombia in terms of whether it's going to be CPG electronics? Is it going to be logistics that's going to drive a lot of – or is it going to be the payments and the loyalty together? So some color on what exactly are your main focus for the Andean region? That will be helpful. So let me start with the Andean region answer. I think, this goes to show the enormous opportunity that exists in those markets, once we begin to have enough resources to continue to aggressively invest in Brazil and Mexico, but also start investing more aggressively in those markets. And by investing aggressively, I don't necessarily mean spend. Those markets were actually profitable, during the quarter. But I do mean having greater and greater human capital, primarily engineering resources to be able to take the user experience and the technology in those markets to the level that Brazil and Mexico are at. And so there is no different strategy for those markets. It's all of the things you mentioned that have allowed us to be successful in the other markets.
Yes, logistics is already a big piece of the acceleration. We have as you know, warehouse in Chile operational, one in Colombia on the way, and the growing managed network in those markets. We have a strong CPG business. So in a way they – as we have more and more resources we can focus on those markets. And they have the benefit of being able to leapfrog some things, because they can benefit from a lot of the innovation that's occurring in Brazil and Mexico that maybe wasn't present in those markets, when they had the size that Colombia, Mexico – sorry, Colombia, Chile now have. So, similar strategy, greater ability to invest behind them, the demand and the market opportunity we believe was always there, and we're now beginning to capture that. And going forward, we continue to expect solid growth from those markets. That's helpful, Pedro. And on the holiday events like Black Friday, do you see any change in your thought process? I think in previous years, we have been quite willing to stay on the sidelines in some of these year-end promotions that typically were dominated by 1P retailers. As we improve, both our 1P capabilities, but in our general sourcing and execution, across some of these key categories, I think we believe we can invest somewhat more aggressively, because the user experience and the price competitiveness is there on our marketplace. And so you will see us, I think be less on the sideline during the Q4 critical promotional period. That's helpful, Pedro. Thank you so much. Thank you. And our next question comes from Edward Yruma of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Hey, guys. Good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, first on Mexico, I know, you kind of highlighted the share opportunity there. I guess, as you think in the medium term what kind of investments are necessary to kind of continue to propel growth in Mexico? And then second on Brazil credit, nice to see you leaning into that. I know it was maybe about a year, a-year-and-a-half ago that you ran into some issues in Brazil. What are you doing this time around to ensure that delinquencies and charge-offs don't tick up, knowing that I think you mentioned using AI more as a tool? Thank you. Okay. So, I think, recapitulating on our Mexico story, if we look back over the last four years, where, as you know, we've invested very aggressively, certainly, that was the right strategy. We look at Mexico and the growth it's had, the competitive position we continue to maintain in that market and the incredible advances we've made in terms of the user experience we're able to offer.
This is exactly how we want to manage our business, which is to take a long-term view and invest behind the kind of things that we know generate long-term value. And obviously, the logistics network there is the first one that comes to mind, but there are other things we've been doing. So that will continue to be the case in Mexico. We're not going to take a short-term view on that market. We continue to take a long-term view in a very competitive market.
Having said that, as you all know there are scale benefits to our business. And so, if you look at the level of losses and the margin structure, despite us continue to be extremely aggressive in absolute dollar terms, that's also continued -- has improved consistently over time. And so, I think, Mexico has been playing out very positively and we will continue to pursue the long game, investing, but also understanding that scale benefits will come to our P&L as we continue to grow that business. And it's a business that continues to double year-on-year. With regards to operations -- with regards to price in Brazil, I would say, in the second quarter, we took a cautious approach as the pandemic was just starting. We were not sure how both our merchant and consumers would react to that. Nonetheless, the industry, as it stands, will continue improving our model, collecting more data and improving our collection efforts.
So we felt very comfortable during the third quarter and we were able both, on the consumer and merchant side, to triple the number of loans we offer and that's where you see an increase in more hand on the size of the portfolio and at the same time a decrease in nonperforming loans. Great. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from Thiago Macruz of Itaú. Your line is now open. Thank you. Thank you for taking my question. Pedro, we've seen several players endeavoring into fresh goods and foodservice categories, especially here in Brazil, in an attempt to generate traffic and decrease customer acquisition costs. Do you think you guys will play a part in those two categories as well?
I would like to understand what are the pros and cons of doing that. And regarding peaks, there is clearly an impact here in the money in and out of digital wallets in the country. I'm curious to hear what other opportunities you believe can come from the launching of this payment to in Brazil this month. Thank you, guys. Yes. Look, I think, we aim to be able to supply whatever our consumers want from us and where demand pockets are. We don't comment on future category developments or where we might be going, but we are -- we look to be the stop and the online solution that our consumers go to for all the things that it makes sense for us to sell.
So, clearly, category expansion is a part of our growth story, as we continue to aim to gain share of wallet of consumers, but we'd rather comment on specific category expansion, once we launch something rather than in advance. Thiago, with regard to peaks, it's still very early, but we are excited by the initial result. So now, I would say, the last time central bank published data, we were second in the number of big [Technical Difficulty]. And yesterday started also the top launch and at least are [Technical Difficulty] this payment. So far our debts are going on track according to our plan.
The ramp-up will be in the next couple of weeks on November 15, surgically all loans have to be lived for all clients. And we believe this will have an impact. It [Technical Difficulty] started out with the possibility that [Technical Difficulty] will provide.
And the one hand we believe that it will have an impact in terms of transfers of loan and debt transfers for P2P and then also for P to merchant. In that case, nonetheless, we believe that the fact that Ps does not support the installment probably will make it less than what we thought it would be. Now definitely we are developing features and of [Technical Difficulty] to allow big segments in [Technical Difficulty] of our flows. All right. Thank you very much, guys. Thank you. And our next question comes from Deepak Mathivanan of Barclays. Your line is now open. Hi. It’s Trevor on for Deepak. On the commerce side can you talk about how cohort level trends over the last three months have evolved? Are you seeing active buyers that came to the platform in April and May still continue to exhibit similar frequency and spend? And how about on the new customer trends are cohort sizes still similar? And lastly, any commentary on active buyer growth coming from like truly new customers versus existing customers that were dormant kind of reactivating? Thank you. Yes. So cohort performance has continued to be very strong and improved sequentially across most key metrics. If we look at the quarterly evolution of new buyers acquired during the growth of online demand because of COVID. So users who we acquired over the last few months at a very rapid pace have continued to remain engaged and the overall cohort performance has actually improved sequentially quarter-after-quarter.
In terms of the new cohorts, I would say, the last quarter was in line with the previous pandemic cohort perhaps slightly below in terms of their initial performance but still historically strong compared to any other prior quarter we could have. Great. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from Marcelo Santos of JPMorgan. Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. The first question is in the post – regarding the post office strike. So was there a negative impact in the end in terms of growth? And could you help to like for us to have a feeling or the migration to manage logistics in the end help to offset completely that?
And the second question is about EBITDA margin, EBIT margin. So profitability also came quite strong again this quarter. Are you reaching a point, where you should kind of keep a more positive profitability at the more mature businesses like generated results, as you mentioned last year like the more mature ones should build more results? Or should we still ramp up more investments and end up doing more the trade-off in terms of – in growth? These are the two questions. Yes. So Correios like I tried to transmit, we believe long-term is something – or the Correios strike, sorry is something that ends up being very beneficial to us, we migrated thousands of incremental large merchants away from the drop ship model onto our managed network as a consequence of the strike. Short term, it's still a headwind. So I think we calculated anywhere between mid- to high single-digits of growth that we lost because during the strike delivery promises were longer, conversion rates dropped, parcels took longer to arrive in doorsteps.
So again, it's short term, it's negative. Mid to long-term it's positive because it gives us incremental arguments with merchants to move them onto the managed network. And we saw that significant increase in sellers now fulfilling through us or using our network for pickup and then injection into our logistics network.
In terms of profitability profile, as you know we don't guide. But I think conceptually the way you've laid out the question is accurate. Our more mature businesses and the larger more mature geos have strong natural scale in them. And so they should continue to be able to drive some operational leverage.
Now don't forget that this is a highly competitive market. And again, we will continue to take the long road. So if we need to err on the side of remaining aggressive on our investments and driving growth and market share that continues to be our number one priority.
If we're able to accomplish that and also take advantage of economies of scale, fantastic. And then there are newer business units and newer initiatives that we've launched, CPG, 1P, insurtech that could be very, very large opportunities and that we will invest behind. Perfect. Thank you very much for the answers. Thank you. And our next question comes from Jamie Friedman of Susquehanna. Your line is now open. Pedro, do you have any view about the impact of the corona vouchers, the stimulus program? Any way to detect how much that may have helped your TPV? I would say they basically had an impact in numbers of payers during the quarter on those accounts. In terms of TPV, I don't think there's a number we can specifically point to because there were many you can use, especially paid to the corona vouchers that we had impact us in a number of ways. Okay. Thanks for that as well. And then, do you happen to have any update on the PayPal operating agreement? What are you guys doing together? What do you have operationalized in the market at this point? And what are your future plans? So, Jamie, what we have already launched for the ability for PayPal payers to pay cross-border in MercadoLibre in Brazil and Mexico and also for PayPal payers to pay in the merchant side at the customers at São Paulo in these two countries, and now we're working on the other parts.
One of them is for MercadoLibre payers to be able to pay on global PayPal merchant. And the third one is to focus on remittances from the U.S. into Mexico driven by someone on the PayPal side and by our distribution network in Mexico. But those two we are working on them and have not yet been launched. Great. Thank you Osvaldo. Thank you. And our next question comes from John Colantuoni of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Hey, thanks for the question. Can you talk about how efforts across the Brazil retail landscape to spread out sales events this holiday season could impact overall promotional spending this year? And related to that dynamic, I'm curious whether you're seeing any signs that competitors with large physical store footprints are putting even more effort into driving sales to their e-commerce offerings given the impact the pandemic may have on consumers' desire to shop in-store? Thanks. Yeah. I think I feel more comfortable recapping how Q4 plays out once we've actually gone through the quarter and anticipate how competitors might play and what might happen.
Like I said, I think, we're focused on our own Q4 execution. You should see us see less on the sidelines than in previous years. We feel that we are better equipped to participate aggressively in those promotional activities and let's see how it plays out.
And then in terms of where consumer affinity for online versus for physical store purchases, I think as we've seen gradual reopening of retail, we are seeing more traffic rising that we see primarily in the gradual rebound of our MPOS business and our in-store to our businesses in FinTech. So I do think that slowly consumers are beginning to return to physical stores. Thank you. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Kunal Madhukar of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Hi. Thanks. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple if I could. One with regard to the recent Amazon Prime Day and the awareness that we could have generated for e-commerce in general. Typically what we see in the U.S. is a lot of other retailers competitors to Amazon kind of report like higher growth, higher trading volumes around those days. Curious what you saw?
And then again picking up on what Amazon is doing in the U.S. in terms of Amazon Flex where they've actually helped finance trucks and trailers and what-have-you advance for last-mile delivery. Is that something which is -- which would be an option for you guys in Brazil as a way to kind of get around the couriers' bottleneck? So let me attempt an answer. I think first of all Prime Day was -- we had some initiatives that we think blunted the value proposition. We increased our free shipping offering during those weeks and we saw good results on our end during those weeks. And then in terms of network design and what they're doing, I think my only thought is we've historically always tried to understand very well what's happening in the global e-commerce landscape. And if there are things that are applicable, or things that are worth emulating, I think we've always been very adept at doing so and adapting it to whatever the local reality is. And our network is a case in point in that.
We firmly believe that we are building out the most efficient network in the region across multiple geographies not just in Brazil or just Mexico. And that obviously requires hiring the right people, investing aggressively, but also learning what others are doing globally and replicating where apt. Thank you guys. Thank you Kunal. Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our question-and-answer session. Thank you for participating on today's conference call and you may now disconnect.","MercadoLibre recorded another strong quarter, driven by high demand for e-commerce and fintech services . a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures can be found on our third quarter 2020 earnings press release .",1.0

I’m Federico Sandler, Investor Relations Officer for MercadoLibre. Our Senior Manager presenting today is Pedro Arnt, Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, Osvaldo Giménez, CEO of Mercado Pago will be available during today’s Q&A session.
I remind you that management may make forward-looking statements relating to such matters as continued growth prospects for the company, industry trends and product and technology initiatives. These statements are based on currently available information and our current assumptions, expectations and projections about future events. While we believe that our assumptions, expectations and projections are reasonable in view of the currently available information, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.
Our actual results may differ materially from those included in this conference call, for a variety of reasons, including those described in the forward-looking statements and risk factor sections of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, and any of MercadoLibre, Inc.’s other applicable filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on our Investor Relations website.
Now, let me turn the call over to Pedro. Hello everyone. And welcome to our fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Our strong performance during the quarter further established our leadership position throughout Latin America, which is the world's fastest growing region for e-commerce, according to e-Marketer. These positive market dynamics, combined with our strong execution and focus, are reflected in our quarterly performance, where growth continued accelerating despite the gradual reopening of physical retail during the period.
I'll begin by addressing our commerce business where items sold grew by triple-digits in all major markets while transactions per buyer also hit record levels in major countries. During the fourth quarter, consolidated gross merchandise volume grew 110% year-over-year on an FX neutral basis.
At the country level, Brazil was one of the highlights during the quarter with FX neutral gross merchandise volume growth accelerating to 84% year-over-year, while items sold doubled annually. Additionally, other geographies experienced robust triple-digit growth rates. While we encountered slight sequential deceleration in growth rates as retailers began reopening, this was less pronounced than expected. We had particularly strong performance in Mexico, whose contribution in units sold surpassed Argentina, becoming our second largest geography in terms of sold items, a sign that we are consolidating market share in that country. Moreover, for the first time in our history, Mexico surpassed the $1 billion mark in quarterly gross merchandise volume.
Consumer trends towards online consumption remain favorable, signaling positive prospects for future growth. The number of buyers during the quarter reached a record high, resulting in almost 37 million unique buyers during the quarter and surpassing 60 million unique buyers for full year 2020.
The product breadth and increased convenience continues to attract new buyers at an accelerated pace when compared to pre-pandemic levels. In line with this, we’ve continued broadening our assortment, resulting in over 275 million live listings this quarter, and we remain a partner of choice for local and foreign merchants throughout Latin America. Our first party offering continues to grow, reaching almost $200 million of total gross merchandise volume on a consolidated basis and representing high single-digits of penetration during certain special promotional dates throughout the quarter.
Let me now provide some additional detail on Brazil’s performance on an FX neutral basis, which resulted in sequential GMV acceleration of 10 percentage points and was a highlight for us during the quarter. Categories such as consumer electronics, where we lagged at the beginning of 2020, grew north of 15 percentage points sequentially quarter-on-quarter, driven by a renewed commercial and technological focus.
During 2020, our more deliberate focus on Black Friday sales generated impressive top line results. We made a concentrated effort to increase both investments and collaboration across our business units to maximize this peak promotional season. This included rebates and marketing campaigns, which leveraged our unique ecosystem of solutions within advertising, credits, Mercado Shops and Mercado Envios. Unlike other years, we also increased our volume of promotional deals, marked by the launch of our new user interface called Promotion Central, while expanding or improving our return flows capacity. As a result, we doubled Black Friday sales year-over-year, both in terms of share as well as sessions, resulting in our highest fourth quarter market share on record.
As we continue strengthening our Brazilian ecosystem, we are also attracting more global brands across multiple verticals. Relating to consumer products, we’ve partnered with Heineken, Kimberly-Cark, Nestle, PepsiCo and Heinz. In electronics, we’ve partnered with brands such as Samsung, and in regards to home improvement, we are working with Black & Decker and K’archer. Significant progress in this regard yields important brand equity for MercadoLibre and deepens our product breadth, advancing our goal of becoming a one-stop destination for e-commerce across a growing number of product categories.
Let's now turn our focus to Mercado Envios, which continues to be a key value driver as we enhance our cross-regional logistics capabilities. Our managed network reached a penetration of almost 80%, with Argentina, Brazil and Mexico at 88%, 79% and 76% respectively. On a consolidated basis, fulfillment reached a penetration of over a third of all items bought on our platform, led by Mexico at 60%, while in Brazil over a quarter of all items are being fulfilled by MercadoLibre already.
During the quarter, we shipped 214 million items, a growth of 131% year-on-year, and totaled almost 650 million deliveries for the full year. We also significantly improved our average lead times per shipment, reducing fourth quarter average lead times by 30% sequentially versus the prior quarter. Consequently, deliveries in less than 48 hours improved by 12 percentage points quarter-over-quarter and by 20 percentage points year-over-year. Within that, we meaningfully improved the share of same-day and next day deliveries as well.
These results are material in the context of significant volume growth during the peak quarterly period of late November and early December, where lockdowns were still in place due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Not only were we able to handle the excess volume without interruption, but we worked faster and more efficiently under extraordinary circumstances.
As you can see, the Mercado Envios team has been operating at an outstanding level of pace and effectiveness, and we have continued developing logistics capabilities at a quick pace. During the quarter, we continued to open multiple cross docking stations and service centers, while doubling our Places' drop off point footprint and successfully launched Meli Air with a fleet of seven dedicated aircraft covering eight routes across Mexico and Brazil to complement the use of our commercial airline capacity to continue driving down our delivery times. We look forward to continuing to unlock value from this important and growing part of our business as we move into 2021 and beyond.
With that, now let’s move on to the Fintech side of the business. Another critical building block of our value proposition in our journey to democratizing money. Consolidated Mercado Pago total payment volume reached almost $16 billion, growing 134% year-over-year on an FX neutral basis, and totaling 659 million transactions in the fourth quarter, representing a growth of 131% year-over-year. Our off-platform payments businesses reached $9.2 billion, growing at a robust 150% year-over-year on an FX neutral basis.
Additionally, during the quarter, off-platform total payments in number represented over 75% of all Mercado Pago transactions. The trends towards digitization of money continued through the quarter, and our purely offline mobile point-of-sale offering point began showing signs of recovery throughout the period.
Online Payments grew 143% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis and continued expanding its merchant base. Within that growth, we saw sequential deceleration due to higher impact on long tail sellers amidst the easing of the COVID-19 restrictions. In Brazil, Mercado Pago was among the first players in the market to launch PIX as a means of payment. Our PIX offering is now available for sellers running Checkout Pro or any related products such as Payment Links or other branded checkout plug-ins. Our speed and adaptation reflects the agility with which we acclimate to market development.
MPLS continued its recovery towards pre-COVID levels of growth, reaching almost 90% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis, with record activation rates and device sales leading to an increase in active devices. Additionally, the scale benefits of this sustained growth are improving unit economics across the region. Devices sold once again surpassed 1 million on a consolidated basis, reaching over 6 million active merchants in the last 12 months. Our mobile wallet, the cornerstone of our digital account approach to FinTech, reached $3.3 billion in total payment volume, representing a 247% year-over-year growth on an FX-neutral basis. We've successfully focused on increasing engagement of wallet usage with positive results in frequency of usage and number of users who engage in multiple wallet use case.
We continued building our two sided network during the quarter, resulting in over 14 million active payers and 6 million active collectors. In-store QR payments started to again gain share over total wallet usage, representing 20 percentage points of wallet TPV. The majority of wallet TPV primarily resulted from utilities and peer to peer transactions.
We've continued to enhance our wallet value proposition by continuing to distribute cards tied to Mercado Pago wallet balances and credit lines for consumers and merchants to fund their wallets across Latin America. This is in addition to our ongoing overlay of savings tech and asset management products through MercadoFundo, through which approximately 50 million users have invested funds in their wallet accounts.
In Brazil, we've launched our own debit card, issuing over 3.8 million proprietary cards, replacing all of our previously issued third-party cards. Additionally, we launched a new overlay of Mercado Pago's insure tech products, theft and damage insurance. This is our first insurance product and is integrated into our digital account as a new financial services feature, covering theft or damage of cell phones and Point Mini users.
Before moving on to our financials, I'll provide a quick update on Mercado Credito's quarterly performance. The portfolio, which grew to $479 million more than doubled compared to the same period last year. Originations during the quarter almost quadrupled versus the fourth quarter of 2019, surpassing $500 million for the first time. Not only did we drive accelerated growth of the business unit during the period, but we also maintained healthy NPL profiles, resulting in better profitability from our newer cohorts and lower APRs.
With those business comments, let me now move on to our financial progress report for the fourth quarter. Starting with a review of our P&L. Fourth quarter consolidated net revenues of $1.3 billion increased year-over-year by 97% in U.S. dollars and 149% on an FX-neutral basis, driven by record acceleration in commerce net revenues. At the country level, Brazil and Mexico revenues continue to accelerate, reaching 120% and 155% year-over-year growth on an FX-neutral basis. For the third consecutive quarter, Argentina revenue grew by over 200% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis. Countries such as Chile and Colombia grew by almost 300% and 150% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis.
Notably, as we have previously shared, we have made significant recent investments in Mexico. The fourth quarter marked the first time that this segment surpassed Argentina while using an adjusted blue-chip swap rate in terms of the percentage of our overall revenue that Mexico represents. We believe this to be a milestone achievement.
Gross profit for the quarter was $489 million, with a margin of 37%, down from 46% during the fourth quarter of 2019. The decrease in gross profit margin resulted from an increase in cost of goods sold from our 1P business with aggressive holiday season pure product margins, and from shipping operation costs as we invested in excess capacity to ensure best-in-class service levels on our managed network during the peak shopping season.
Operating expenses on the other hand increased by only 36% year-over-year in U.S. dollars to $514 million. Despite the increase, this generated operational leverage with OpEx as a percentage of revenues improving by 17 percentage points year-over-year from 56% to 39% this year. Our Q4 P&L management aimed to strike a balance between continuing to deliver margin improvements from one year to the next while also igniting investment in both short and long-term growth within the context of the gradual normalization of physical commerce and a competitive peak holiday season. In the slides accompanying this presentation, we've included the more detailed breakdown of both of these items as we do every quarter.
Moving down the P&L, we incurred $31.6 million in financial expenses this quarter mainly attributable to financial loans entered into 2020 primarily in Brazil and Argentina. We also incurred interest expenses from our trusts related to the factoring of our credit card receivables in Argentina. During the quarter, we also had a foreign exchange loss of $9.9 million, mainly related to the difference of the Argentine official exchange rate and the blue-chip swap rate at which we effectively exchanged retained earnings from our Argentine subsidiary. Interest income was $22.6 million, a 16% decrease year-over-year as a result of lower interest rates in our investments as a consequence of the pandemic, mainly offset by higher interest income in Argentina as our float grows. As a result of this, net loss for the quarter was $50.6 million.
Building on the precedent we established in 2020, we are very proud to announce that we will release in tandem with our annual report, our second consecutive annual sustainability report. Our commitment to sustainability has a strong connection with how we envision our business serving all our stakeholders. The report includes our sustainability metrics on key initiatives that include diversity, social inclusion, labor practices, energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions and waste management among other items.
Wrapping up the fourth quarter of 2020 was another great quarter where the MELI team really put their heart and soul into executing for the benefit of our whole community of users. I'd like to reinforce on behalf of MercadoLibre our immense gratitude and appreciation towards all our employees and collaborators for their enormous effort to keep us safe during such a challenging year. We are incredibly proud of what the team has achieved and the programs it has launched during the quarter. We believe these accomplishments underscore our compelling long-term growth outlook. We are steadfast in our conviction that we are making investments which will unlock our full potential over the years to come.
The milestones we achieved in 2020 in the face of adversity demonstrate our ability to execute on multiple fronts and an indisputable commitment to growing commerce and FinTech throughout Latin America. Elbow to elbow with our users and the broader community, we will continue to build our path towards financial inclusion and democratization of commerce in the continent.
Thanks everyone, as always, for joining the quarterly conference call and we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress next quarter. And we can now start tabling questions. Thank you. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Irma Sgarz with Goldman Sachs. Your question please. Yes, hi. Thank you very much for taking my question. Pedro, as you think about the rest of the year and you think about how you're coming up against tougher comps obviously inevitably at some point after the fantastic year you've had in 2020, what are some of the KPIs that you're most focused on in that journey that you had where GMB and TPV to a lesser extent of course may take a toll from the tougher comps and where do you encourage for us to look?
And then secondly, on the digital wallet, as you mentioned you're focused on the increase in use cases to drive relevance and stickiness with wallet customers. Yet at the same time you I think you also mentioned that peer to peer utilities payments are still a very relevant portion of the transactions within the wallet. What are some of the examples of what you launched more recently in terms of use cases that you're most excited about? Thank you. Hi, Irma. Thanks for the questions. So I don't believe you should alter the KPIs set you look at to follow our business. I think we continue to focus on units sold, on merchandise volume, on total payment volume and the strategy remains unchanged regardless of what happens with the comps. There is a strong focus on continuing to deliver more free shipping with faster delivery and more reliable delivery.
And then in terms of year-on-year comps, albeit it's true that obviously the comps become more difficult, I think also we've been looking at sequential growth and that to a certain degree helps us understand what potentially happens once the year-over-year data changes. We've been sequentially I think continue to show good week on week evolution and that is a way to look at something without the impact of pre and post-COVID results. So continue to track the same KPIs we've always tracked, the strategy remains unchanged. And in terms of Pago, I'll leave that to Osvaldo. Hi, Irma. So I'll say we did add some use cases, for example transportation, probably transportation in some of the cities where we operate or tolls in Buenos Aires for example, the highway tolls that is. But mostly I would say, the increased use we have seen is more related to user using different flows are doing them more frequently. So when you look at an engagement, for example, over the last year in Q4 last year, used to have on average eight transactions per quarter per user and now we are at 14. So we have seen a significant increase in the number of transactions, this is what we have to do, not because we have added a lot of payments in the menu, but just because we have been better at cross-selling them. That's right. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Ford with Merrill Lynch, your question please. Hey good evening everybody. Congratulations on the quarter and thank you for taking my question. Pedro, what's the split between new and reactivation and you're unique active user growth? And given all the improvements you've made in the marketplace across the region, how are you thinking about reactivating your buyers? And when it comes to the mobile wallet, the growth rates you posted are fantastic. But relative to the size of the ecosystem they still seem small. How are you thinking about activating new mobile wallets? Hi, Bob, let me start with the wallet part. So some of the metrics in terms of, you mentioned the size of the ecosystem. So one of the metrics we track is how it does a number of downloads for MercadoLibre and Mercado Pago compare the installed base for MercadoLibre and Mercado Pago compare. And so what we have seen recently is that for example, in Argentina, those are evening out. If you remember a couple of years ago probably the ratio was close 20 to 1, and in the fourth quarter the number of downloads of MercadoLibre and Mercado Pago in Argentina were roughly the same.
We're still in close to 2-to-1 in Brazil and 2.5-1 in Mexico. But in all of the cases we see that we are increasing the number, the installed base of Mercado Pago faster than the installed base of MercadoLibre. But I think that to see what we can do, but we have been getting better and making sure that most of our users use both of our platforms. That's helpful. Thank you. Bob, I think we don't typically disclose the breakout between reactivated buyers and new buyers or existing buyers. I think what we see in the fourth quarter is it was the record quarter historically a number of buyers on the marketplace. So obviously the installed base is very large. But we've also continued to add and reactivate buyers at a good pace and never before have we had as many buyers during a quarter as we did in the fourth quarter of 2020. So MercadoLibre continues to increasingly be more and more ubiquitous and almost 37 million unique buyers in the quarter. That's great. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question is from Marcelo Santos with JP Morgan. Your question, please. Hello. Thanks for taking the question. I have two. One is, if you could comment any potential initiative you could be probably doing on the food e-commerce. So we saw some news in Brazil and just wanted to know what you're thinking on that. And the second, on the credit product I see you are advancing very quickly now. Could you say something about new products in credit? There are also some news regarding automotive credit, regarding insurance. So maybe you would be – you would start offering other types of insurance, the news are not very clear. You would be the underwriter or not. So I think if you could throw some light on what in each initiatives you have on credit would be great as well. Great. So for now the focus is still on consumer packaged goods, not involved in fresh or chilled or perishables. I do think we've said that we see that category as an important category in terms of frequency and it's a category that we're doing a lot of work with. We think our combination of logistics capability plus top of mind and share of wallet potentially allows us to be an important player there. So I would say stay tuned and eventually if we launch something obviously we'll communicate it, but for now the focus in CPG continues to be around dry and that business is performing quite well and is a good stepping stone for any other forays we might choose to make in the general supermarket area. And with regards to credit, I would say, let me start with what we have already done and then what we are starting to do now. But we have already done and we're – which shows us a go faster last year was related to offering credit, not only on the MercadoLibre platform but on the Mercado Pago platform. For example, the ability to pay utilities using a small loan or to take personal loans. Those have been probably two of the large drivers behind that – the new products we launch.
And in terms of what's coming, we are already in a pilot to offer a credit card in Brazil. So it's small pilot now, but we plan to scale that during this year. And in terms of insurance what we started offering is theft and damage insurance. Now here we are not the underwriter, we work with underwriters. So we are the channel, but we will do – we have the channel to sell and also we will help users and our clients. Perfect, thank you very much. Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse, your question, please. Okay, thank you so much. Pedro, can you talk about the set of circumstances that got Mexico to 60% pro forma penetration, and hence what more work needs to be done in Brazil and other regions to get from 25% to 30% fulfillment to theoretically 60% to 70%. And then, Osvaldo, a follow up question on the wallet, if I may. So can you talk about the users and the growth rate there? It doesn't seem like you grew users sequentially from the third quarter, which I believe was also at 14 million or so. So is this a matter of expanding the use cases like you talked about just now and then subsequently going out there to drive awareness? Thanks. Sure. So I think first of all, Stephen, just to put that in context. The overriding objective is to deliver fast predictable and hopefully as much free shipping as possible and we can accomplish that as we do more and more deliveries on our own managed network. Within that network, fulfillment obviously has a series of benefits. But even when we look at our cross-docking initiatives, which in Brazil have made tremendous advances over the past year, the speed at which we've migrated the overwhelming majority of volume to our own managed network and away from drop ship I think is one of the highlights of 2020. And we feel extremely well positioned in terms of our logistics capabilities there with the combination of cross-docking plus fulfillment.
And now moving sellers from cross docking towards fulfillment, we believe is a matter of time. And just as the sellers mature and grow more accustomed with our services, move them from cross docking where we're doing pickups at their locations to getting them to send us more inventory upfront. So I think that's something that should continue to evolve as we open more and more distribution centers closer to more merchants that should also help. And we believe that with time, we will get there. And, Stephen, let me address the – part of your question. I would say that when you look at the numbers sequentially, and it's true there was a growth but not as steep as you have seen in the past. I would say you have a huge acceleration between the second and third quarter driven in some part by Auxilio Emergencial in Brazil and now that that was fading out in the fourth quarter, we maintain numbers in Brazil, but we didn't continue to accelerate. Nonetheless, when you look at year-on-year numbers, we were last year at 8 million maps in or quarterly payers in Q4 and we had 14 million payers in Q4 this year. So it's significant growth, but it's correct to point, it was 13.7 in Q3, and 14.2 in Q4. The main reason for that is Auxilio Emergencial. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Ravi Jain with HSBC. Your question, please. Hi, thank you for taking my question. So, Pedro, on the e-commerce, and could you give us an update on your thoughts around the first party business? You mentioned it was $200 million for the fourth quarter, how do you see that in the near or medium-term, any thoughts on that? And also on the marketing spend for the year 2021 as things reopen. And Osvaldo, on FinTech, you've clearly shown a meaningful acceleration in the credit business. Maybe give us some color on what is driving your confidence in turning the taps on and how do you plan to manage the credit risk as you grow this portfolio even higher than this? Thank you. So the 1P business continues to be a business that we see as a tactical way to help when there is certain inventory breakage within our marketplace seller base when we think that there are certain banker products that we can sell more efficiently than merchants. And if you look at our Q4 market share results and the relative strength we had in Black Friday when compared to our own performance in other years, it goes to show how 1P can be very useful for these peak promotional seasons. So I think that business should continue to grow share and volume. It's also very helpful when we're launching new categories to get us up and running very fast. So it's also instrumental in growing CPG, which has been a success story so far for ourselves. So it's not the core, it continues to be tactical, but should grow and help us across those key tactical areas I just mentioned.
Marketing spend, I think what we've said is as physical retail has begun to reopen as competitors have begun to spend again in marketing, obviously there has been a ramp up in spend when compared to the second quarter and the third quarter, which were sort of anomalies in that you had significant demand surge with very little spending. And so we're once again investing in acquiring new customers and bringing customers onto our platform as we see improved net promoter scores and improved performance.
I also think that over time, we also aim to drive a certain amount of operational leverage from marketing spend. Our marketing budgets in absolute terms are very large given the pace that revenues have grown, and so it will be about finding that right equilibrium between continue to invest in growth and at the same time making sure that we are also beginning to manage those investments efficiently from a bottom line perspective. And, Ravi, regarding credit, I'd say that the reason we decided to be more aggressive on the origination front it's a combination of two things. On the one hand, I think we got more confidence on our scoring models and experience after the last quarters already we'd call it around and we were able to originate with healthy spreads. And then also, we have been working a lot on improving and automating our collection tools. So I think that that also has us being more aggressive originating because we know we are better off at collecting. Thank you. That's helpful. Thank you. Our next question comes from Gustavo Oliveira with UBS, your question, please. Hello everyone, thank you for taking my question. Still, I would like to follow up on the 1P impact on your business, Pedro. We see the 6.3% impact on margins, but obviously we don't know the magnitude of the margin and the level that the margin is running now. Do you think you are already running at an optimal level and what are the lessons learned from the profitability standpoint that you're seeing in the 1P business? I know you're using it tactically, but if as you said, it will also grow and will become more sustainable in some of the categories. So if you could share some of your thoughts on the profitability of that business going forward.
The second question is also on the gross margin, when you talk about the excess capacity you have invested in logistics for the managed network, is there an expectation that you could see some cost dilution going forward or more pressure in the very short-term on that excess capacity? And one last question if I may, on your Mercado credit business as you accelerate growth, what are the implications for your funding strategy? Anything that needs to be adjusted there? Great thanks, Gustavo. So I would say that we are definitely not yet at what we think the long-term steady state margin structure for 1P can be. We are still building out scale, we are – there is a category mix that is tilted to some lower margin categories like CPG. As we build out more 1P capabilities in higher margin categories, that will also help. But even if you look at our PPMs, our product margins, they are still we believe lower than they will be as we gain more purchasing scale, we optimize processes, et cetera.
So this is a business that we're investing in to build it out, and like most businesses in the early stages we invest aggressively because we trust going forward we will be able to optimize the economics around that. So certainly the longer-term story for 1P should be of margin improvements versus where it is today at a relatively low scale still.
On shipping, very quickly. I think what we intended to mean by excess capacity is leading into the peak holiday season, I think we tend to err on the side of making sure that we are – we have enough excess capacity so that people don't receive their holiday purchases after Christmas. And I think that drives up the unit cost per shipping a little bit when we overshoot perhaps more than ideally, once things normalize back in Q1 and Q2 and also as the business gets more and more efficient at both predicting volumes, but also more flexible in being able to upsize and downsize capacity utilization, we should be able to better manage that going forward. And I think we're already beginning to see improvements there. Okay. And with regards to credit as we continue to increase our accelerations. What we have been doing is within the funding available on banks we work with to upload part of those loans today, roughly we keep on our books 70% of those loans and we offload the 30% and probably medium-term we'll plan to go more towards the 50%, so that's – in that way that shouldn't require a lots of additional funding on our balance sheet. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Our next question comes from Edward Yruma with KeyBanc Capital, your question, please. Hey, good evening. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess first, good to see you guys close some of the pricing gaps in places like Brazil, particularly in consumer electronics. Is this just a move to be more price-competitive during the holiday season, or do you think that you're going to continue to keep the pricing gaps tight? And then as a follow-up, interesting commentary on the growth in Mexico. It seems like other retailers are making big moves there as well. Do you expect to be able to maintain or grow share in that market, given what looks like an increasingly competitive environment? Thank you Great. So part of the 1P business when we talk about tactical and I talked about banker product is the ability to, especially for the banker product, be able to be more price-competitive and that's very relevant in categories like consumer electronics. So this isn't exclusively a fourth quarter strategy, I think going forward we intend to use the 1P business in part to be able to continue to close some of those pricing gaps and that's a part of our ongoing strategy.
We also need to find the right equilibrium between 1P rebates and coupons and managing the overall P&L. But no, this is not just a Q4 initiative. I think part of our ability to reignite growth in Brazil when we look at the three quarters of 2020 has been driven by our ability to identify those pricing gaps and close them and so this is something that we intend to continue to do going forward because it's been a part of our growth story.
Look, our Mexico business continues to perform incredibly well. That business has sustained very, very high levels of growth now over multiple quarters. And if you look at year-on-year evolution of bottom line and margin structure, although we continue to lose money in Mexico, I think we're carrying out the stated plan of as we gain scale improving those margins. And eventually through more scale and sustained growth have that business be profitable as our other businesses are. So, so far, Mexico I think has been an extremely positive part of our story, and we're very pleased with the way that business has continued to grow top line and the share it's been able to hold in Mexico. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Ruben with Morgan Stanley, your question please. Hi, thanks very much for the question. Have a couple of questions on take rate. First on the category level pricing, is there any update here? Should we be thinking about this as an ongoing initiative or was that more of a one-time adjustment. And then second on some incremental drivers, any update you could provide on how you're thinking about monetizing either the advertising offering or fulfillment fees. Thank you. So category pricing was I think, a structural rejigging of how we price. We used to have single prices for all categories, and now we determine fees and take rates on a per category basis and even a sub-category basis. So in general, that gives us greater flexibility going forward to be – to extract more or less monetization from different product categories over time.
I don't think we're going to be tinkering with take rates on a constant basis. You want to give sellers predictability over time, but certainly it's a system that now has been rolled out to a growing number of markets and gives us greater flexibility and also aligns our pricing much better with the economics of merchants. And we've been able to carry that out in most geos, which was the intention in either a take rate neutral or even slightly a creative fashion. So we've pulled that off so far successfully.
In terms of incremental drivers of monetization of the two, you mentioned, advertising certainly is one that we think is a more immediate driver of increased overall take rate. There's a lot of innovation going on there and I think we're investing more in terms of technology on the advertising platform. On the fulfillment front, we do have fees to incentivize merchants to send us the right type of inventory and to rotate inventory in an efficient manner.
I don't think we're at a stage yet where monetizing fulfillment is an overriding objective. It's still more about onboarding more and more inventory and continue to just have the fastest and most widely available free or cheap shipping for our consumers. So monetization of fulfillment is probably something that's not on the cards anytime over the next few quarters, advertising should drive incremental take rate. Very helpful. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question is from Kunal Madhukar with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Hi. Thanks for taking the question. A couple if I could, one on the 37 million unique buyers you mentioned during the quarter. When you look across the serviceable opportunity for all households within the key geographies, what percentage of those households do you think you reach during the fourth quarter? And then on the advertising side, in terms of like the scope for like take rate improvement and what have you. To what extent, do you think would that be more like promoted listings? Or would that be maybe getting CPGs and the brands to kind of come in and advertise along with the product. Thank you. Yes. The first question, I don't know the answer off the top of my head, percentage of households that we've reached. As we continue to grow number of unique buyers. Obviously, that number continues to expand. And I think equally importantly, we still think this is a region that is in the early stages of e-commerce not only because there are still significantly more users that we can bring onto the platform, but much more importantly, when you look at the average frequency and the average recency of our consumer base, we think that there is still significant room for growth there.
So e-commerce as a whole in the region continues to be in the single digits of retail, even post-pandemic. And overall frequency of usage measured by cohorts or items per buyer continues to improve consistently Q-on-Q, fourth quarter cohorts were once again, better than Q3 across a lot of the frequency metrics and return metrics and equally important when compared to more developed e-commerce markets or even some of the key Asian markets, there's ample room to get our consumers to buy more from us and to use more and more of our services. And that should drive significant growth going forward.
In terms of advertising, it's a bit of both things. There's still room for us to drive more investments in our promoted listings or our Mercado Clicks platform from the existing merchant base. So pay for placement or pay for conversion, which has a very good fit with mid tail and long tail merchants. But also a lot of the investments we're making is in working closer with not just CPG, but brands and branded retailers in general, for them to be able to advertise more on our platforms, obviously categories like CPG, as we get stronger there, begins to allow for advertising partnerships with some of the largest advertisers globally. And that's one of the reasons that we're optimistic about the growth possibilities for the ad business, but it's across both types of products, advertising, and also product placements and conversion – advertising products on the platform. Does that answer your question, Kunal? Yes. Thank you so much. Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna. Your question, please. Hi. Congratulations on the great results. Let me just ask a couple up front. So Pedro, when you said that Mexico is now second biggest ahead of Argentina. Were you referring to the e-commerce business or the payments business or both? That's one question, I know it's not that easy to break them out, but that's the first question. The second question is any update on the PayPal agreement and how you're thinking about the framework for product rollout in 2021.
And then the last one is Tatsuro and some others are moving around between moving like up-market, mid-market, SMB market, out of the long tail. I'm just wondering for you guys, is the long tail still the focus as well though, or is there any adjustment to how you define the market? So those are three questions, Mexico, and then PayPal, and then SMB. Thank you. Yes. So just Mexico, clear answer there, I think we were referring to in terms of units sold. So that's clearly a commerce metric, and then also looking at sales volumes on an FX adjusted basis using the blue chip swap rate in Argentina. So it was a comment on the commerce business, I think on payments, and I'll use that to transition over to Osvaldo. Mexico has a significant opportunity, but it is certainly still smaller than Argentina. And with regards to the two questions, first one was regarding the PayPal agreement, and what are we doing next? And remember there were three tracks we are working on, track one or two are live. There's still work to do that, but they are live already, and those are paper merchants received payments from Mercado Pago payers and vice versa. Mercado Pago merchants or MercadoLibre itself receive payments from PayPal users, social lag. And the third one we're working on is remittances would some from the U.S. into Mexico. And that is what we're working on right now.
And then with regards to SMBs, I would say, it depends a lot on the vertical, probably the one area where we're working more towards SMBs is in MPOS. In the MPOS business, we started with a long tail, and now we are addressing this market. Significantly in Argentina, already 50% of the PPV we're receiving for SMB. So we are very excited with that number. And that is driven by the two new products we have launched in recent quarters, such as our point plus and smart MPOS, both of them.
And that's on the point front. And then on the online payment, I'd say, there, our core has been SMBs, and we are starting to work now more with small merchants and in individuals that so far, our core has been SMB. Got it. Thank you both so much. Our next question comes from Marvin Fong with BTIG. Your question, please. Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Just two for me. First, if you could just – you referenced PIX a little bit in the prepared statements. I was just wondering if there was any significant impact that PIX had on your TPV in Brazil in the fourth quarter? And if so, if you could give us some way to quantify that? But also, if you could just talk about any trends you're seeing in the market and so far in the first quarter?
And then my second question, you guys obviously made tremendous going forward improvement in your managed network. Just wondering if you could give us an idea of improvement in demand that you see when a product is available, in two days shipping or less versus a longer time period, that might be helpful for us to know. Thank you. Marvin, let me start with PIX. I would say that so far, we have seen a significant shift in transfers toward PIX, but these are mostly DOC and TED transfers and also some boletos, which are good. It's good that it's happening because those PIX transactions are online real time, and they work 24/7. So it makes it easier for us on the marketplace to structure shipping because we receive payments throughout the weekend.
And before with boleto, it was only working during weekdays. And also, these transactions are faster and cheaper. Now, when it comes to – those are transfers mostly. When it comes to payments, so far, the impact has been marginal. We've only seen some of our users paying in PIX merchants and vice versa, third parties paying on our network. But so far, those have been marginal. Great. Look, on shipping, we don't disclose lift on improved times. We continue to have as one of our most important objectives to increase the percentage of shipments we do next day, to increase the percentage of shipments we do same day even as we push more and more same day. So clearly, we believe that that helps conversions.
It helps stickiness, and it's one of the most important drivers of incremental volume. But we don't disclose any specific elasticities around improvements in delivery time and lift in GMV. But it is one of our important objectives, and we've continued to consistently, over the last few quarters, increase both the percentage of items delivered next day and also same day. That's very helpful. Thanks Pedro and Osvaldo. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Gabriel Simoes with Itau BBA. Your question, please. Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. So a couple of months ago, you disclosed a few initiatives you believe could unlock significant value here for Brazil, such as the take rate verticalization, the 1P, the Buybox, optimizing the installment policy, and lowering the cost of shipping. So could you provide details on the status of these initiatives here and which you believe have contributed the most to the acceleration we've seen this year in the Brazilian operation?
Then the second, I know we've gone over several questions on your 1P operation, but it would be interesting to understand, if you could provide some detail on how the $200 million from this strong were spread out between the countries in which you operate. And do you think that this operation is more strategic in any of the regions? And if so, if you could provide some color on why, that would be interesting as well. Great. So look, let me take the first one first. Our e-commerce platform obviously is the more the overall experience improves, the more people buy, the more people return. It's not always easy to parse out these different initiatives quantitatively to measure the specific impact of each one.
I think if you look at the rate Brazil was growing in the first quarter and you look at the rate Brazil is growing and even if you adjust for the pandemic by looking at market share within Brazil, we've made significant strides over 2020. And we exit 2020, I would say, in a very strong position with very, very strong market share. And we had started the year, I think, in a position of relative weakness. So very pleased with Brazilian results.
We believe shipping has been a very, very important part of that story, both the ability to manage the surge in demand that occurred without sacrificing service levels but actually improving service levels over the year and also a free shipping program that is increasingly more and more widespread and obviously resonates well with consumers. 1P has contributed. I would say there are other geographies where 1P is ahead of Brazil. So it's a part of the story but it's not a key part of the story.
And then category take rate obviously has allowed us to improve supply and to bring more and more branded merchants on to the platform, which has been very helpful in categories like consumer electronics, which is one of the focus areas in terms of acceleration of growth in Brazil. The one that maybe we haven't made as many advances is on the optimization of the credit and promotional credit on the platform. Not to say that the credit books and the availability of credit haven't increased significantly, but we haven't rolled out too many initiatives to have greater intelligence and greater targeted credit offerings. That's something that we still have in the books.
But I would say shipping probably first and then Buybox, category-specific take rate, and 1P. Difficult to parse those out, but those have also been helpful. And then we don't disclose the 1P business yet by geography. It's a business that we're executing across most geos and should continue to grow and perform well there across many different markets. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from John Colantuoni with Jefferies. Your question, please. Thanks for taking my questions. MercadoLibre continues to generate impressive growth outside of the three largest geographies. Maybe you can help us better understand how nascent the opportunity is in those markets through the lens of how they compare to your largest markets in terms of strategic priorities, stage of building out capabilities like logistics, and any notable competitive dynamics we should be aware of. And then my second question is on the credit business. Can you help disaggregate how much of the growth in your portfolio during Q4 was driven by expanding within existing users versus loaning to new users? Thank you. Great. So both Chile and Colombia have been highlights of the year. Chile right now is, by far, the fastest-growing market, and Colombia is second in terms of rate of growth. And despite the fact that we still don't have the full platforms rolled out in those markets in terms of the offering of our fulfillment centers, penetration of Envios in general and the same goes for Pago and many of the Pago offerings, both on platform but more importantly, off-platform.
So as we continue to roll out more and more of the features that are already existent in the big three markets, we believe that those solid growth rates, we potentially could maintain those, and those should be incremental contributors to our overall metrics going forward. When you look at the relative size of the Chilean or the Colombian economies, we as a company have typically under-indexed that somewhat. And I think with these rapid growth rates, these countries, in a way, are beginning to grow more into fair share. So it's been good to see Chile and Colombia accelerate the way they have accelerated over the past few quarters. And, John, we don't usually – we don't disclose how many of the exact credit loans were to new users versus old users doing more credit. I think what we usually provide is the growth in number of users who originated the credit, and those grew by 118% year-on-year. We originated 4.2 million credits during the quarter – 4.2 million users were granted at least one credit during the quarter. Thank you. Thank you. And our last question is from Trevor Young with Barclays. Your question, please. Hi. Thanks for letting me sneak some in here. Just touching on Mexico again. Can you like rank order, help us understand what's really helping you consolidate share, and whether you can apply those learnings to some of the other regions? Is it the strong fulfillment mix that's driving like better and faster delivery for consumers? And then the second one, just on that insurance product that you mentioned, covering like theft and damage for phones and other electronics, how have attach rates been? And do customers get offered that product at checkout when buying certain electronics? And is this just table stakes, or is that a differentiator for you? Thanks. Sorry, can you repeat the second question? We didn't quite catch it fully. Sure. Just on the insurance product for electronics, how have the attach rates been? And do customers get offered that at checkout? Great. So look, obviously, we port learnings across our different geographies, and the things that have worked for us in Mexico, we've already been deploying in other markets. Mexico was the first market where we saw the power of fast and free shipping. It's led the way in terms of fulfillment adoption.
And all those on the logistics network are things that we have already been replicating to the other markets for quite some time now. And Brazil, I would say, in 2020, has been a market where we made tremendous advances in terms of our network capabilities. Mexico is one of the largest markets in terms of cross-border trade, and that's something that we're beginning to focus on rolling out to Brazil as well and how we can make that work more effectively in Brazil. So that's another Mexican learning that's been ported over.
But in general, I would say our strategies are similar across markets, and we try to cross-pollinate whatever is working in one market into other markets, and I think that's part of the reason. It's been more about do we have the resources to be able to deploy what we've learned in one market across others. And going back a little bit to Chile and Colombia, part of what's happening as a consequence of our scale is that also we have more and more engineers and we're able to have more resources available not only for some of the smaller business units like advertising but also for some of the newer geographies to be able to put them on equal footing over time with the platforms that we have in Brazil and Mexico. With regards to insurance, up until recently, the only product we used to offer were external guarantees, and those were only offered on the MercadoLibre app at the time of the checkout. Now, we launched theft and damage, and we offer those too on the Mercado Pago app. And those can be done at any point and not only during the checkout but afterwards. And also, as opposed to extended warranty, these are subscriptions-based.
So once we get a user to buy them, we keep charging them as long as they want to continue having the protection. We have not disclosed, so far, attachment rates. But I think that – we believe that we have plenty of opportunity to increase those. Great. Thank you. Thank you. And, sir, I'm not showing any further questions in the queue. You may continue with your final remarks. Great. So thank you, everyone, for your interest. Thanks for the questions. We get back to work, plenty to build, plenty to continue to deploy, and we will look forward to giving you updates on Q1 in a few months. Thank you very much. And with that, ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for your participation in today's program.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
It is now my pleasure to introduce Investor Relations Officer, Lissa Schreurs. Hello everyone, and welcome to the MercadoLibre earnings conference call for the quarter ended March 31, 2021. I am Lissa Schreurs, Investor Relations Officer for MercadoLibre. Our Chief Financial Officer, Pedro Arnt, will be leading today’s prepared remarks. Joining him on the line is Chief Executive Officer of MercadoPago, Osvaldo Giménez, who will be available during today’s Q&A session.

Now, let me turn the call over to Pedro. Hi everyone, and welcome to our first quarter 2021 earnings call. Our financial results were once again marked by accelerating growth due to strong demand for ecommerce and FinTech services within an improving but still challenging environment. While some key markets began to gradually open physical retail, in others lockdowns were enforced in major cities towards the end of the quarter. Online consumption throughout remained strong and we experienced favorable consumer trends as digital services share of wallet continue to grow. Our solid quarterly performance illustrates our commitment to executing our long-term strategic priorities as we remain focused on our purpose of democratizing access to commerce and money in Latin America, recognizing the important economic role we play in the countries where we operate.
Let me start us off with the results for our Commerce business in Q1. We generated triple digit growth in items sold and maintained record levels of transactions per buyer quarter-on-quarter. This constituted a formidable level of engagement given seasonal differences between Q4 and Q1. Volume wise, consolidated gross merchandise volume grew 114% year-over-year on an FX neutral basis. Across our geographies, all countries either maintained or posted higher growth rates compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.
In Brazil, our largest market, we doubled items sold and nearly doubled GMV versus the prior year. In Mexico, we continue to accelerate our sequential growth in items sold and GMV. All other geographies showed positive trends in GMV growth, as well, with Chile in particular increasing its share in our business substantially. Product diversification is becoming an increasingly important driver of growth to overlay on to our ever improving delivery service levels and highly competitive pricing.
To achieve this, we are focusing on both category and merchant type expansion. For example, during Q1 we made significant strides in amplifying our experience in consumer packaged goods. We established initial partnerships with traditional large food retailers in Mexico and Brazil and reached new record levels of inventory depth across categories. User experience in CPG is also benefiting from our logistics footprint. In Brazil, over half of CPG items are already being shipped from our own fulfillment centers, helping us improve user experience and deliver consumer expectations.
On the merchant front, as you know, our marketplace is composed of a mix of small sellers and big brands, and we have been attracting more global and local household name brands across multiple verticals as we continue to strengthen our commerce ecosystem. In consumer electronics, for example, we have added partnerships with Panasonic, Asus and Intelbras, while our CPG portfolio now includes stores by JMacedo and Mondelez.
As a result, approximately 20% of our marketplace sales are already from Official Stores, an increase of 7 percentage points over the same quarter last year. Overall, product depth also continues to improve, as live listings have reached almost 300 million listings this quarter, increasing versus the fourth quarter in all major geographies. Part of this increase was driven by the growth of unique sellers in our marketplace, with almost 1 million total sellers with successful sales during the quarter. We will continue to grow our already ample seller base, adding almost 200,000 new sellers to our marketplace this quarter.
Before moving on to logistics, let me briefly address our growing loyalty program. We continue to expand our content offering while delivering great value in terms of new subscribers for our initial content partners, Disney+, Deezer and HBO. More importantly, we are seeing strong signs of incremental engagement from user cohorts that purchase content through our loyalty program. Building on this initial success will be a growing focus for us.
Let’s now move to developments relating to Mercado Envios, a primary contributor to our Commerce business. During Q1, our logistics capabilities were a focal point of our operating strategy, reaching new company records in terms of reach, speed, scale and cost. Our managed network reached a penetration of 80% on a consolidated basis, with Argentina, Brazil and Mexico at 87%, 83%, and 79% respectively. Our expansion in Brazil was particularly notable, and we are also pleased with our progress in Colombia and Chile, which demonstrate our speed in execution.
We have now reached 63% and 53% penetration of items shipped through our managed network in those markets, respectively. We view this as a remarkable progress considering we began implementing our managed network operation in Colombia and Chile only a little over a year ago, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. Regarding our fulfillment operations, on a consolidated basis, we now have over 32% of all items sold on our platform originating in our fulfillment centers. This is driven mainly by expansions in Brazil, Argentina and other counties in the Andean region. While Mexico maintains the leading position, with 60% of items being fulfilled by MercadoLibre, but stable in penetration sequentially.
During Q1, we shipped over 208 million items and for the third consecutive quarter registered a year-over-year growth above 130% in shipments. Our lead times per shipment set a new record for speed. We significantly improved the share of same day and next day deliveries in every single country, even while sustaining high levels of growth in total items shipped. Overall, 74% of all volume was delivered in less than 48 hours, a notable 21 percentage point improvement versus a year ago.
These results were driven by the sustained expansion of our logistics network. We recently started operating two new fulfillment centers, one in Santa Catarina, Brazil and another near Monterrey in Mexico. New service centers were also added to our network in Brazil. Simultaneously, our same day logistics solution gained greater participation in Brazil, Colombia and Chile. This advances our objective of increasing fast deliveries within major urban centers, and we are now operating deliveries during weekends, as well. As you can see, the Mercado Envios team is operating at an outstanding pace while unlocking greater levels of efficiency within our network.
Additionally, recognizing that free shipping is an attractive value proposition for our customers, in March we reduced our free shipping threshold to R$79 in Brazil. This delivers several benefits. First, we now have an even more comprehensive free shipping program for buyers in the region, a key differentiating factor for MercadoLibre. Second, we expect to cover a greater portion of our GMV and items that ship for free.
We strongly believe that these developments within our logistics services will be drivers of sustained improvements in customer satisfaction and experience. Finally, on a related matter, we are also proud of our ecological conservation initiative, Regenera America, following the issuance of our sustainability bond earlier this year. Integrating sustainable practices that complement our logistics operations and get us closer to carbon neutrality, is a growing part of our strategy to positively contribute towards stopping climate change over time.
With that, I’ll now address the FinTech side of the business, a critical lever within our ecosystem to democratize money and access to financial services. For the first quarter, Mercado Pago total payment volume reached $14.7 billion on a consolidated basis, growing almost 130 year-over-year on an FX neutral basis. This represented a total of 630 million transactions for Q1 at a growth rate of 117% compared to the same quarter last year.
On Platform payments volume grew by 119% on a consolidated basis, largely driven by the strong performance of the commerce business in Brazil. For our Off Platform payments, TPV grew by 136% compared to Q1 2020. We are continuing to successfully build our network of active collectors and payers. On the collector’s side, we have over 11 million off platform merchants on a consolidated basis, with almost 7 million in Brazil alone. Additionally, during Q1 we reached almost 35 million off-platform unique payers during the quarter.
I’ll now detail the various segments of our Off Platform payments business, starting with Point, our point of sale offering. Point was resilient throughout the lockdown. Despite reduced physical retail volume, Point payment volume grew 90% on an FX-neutral basis, setting new volume records in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. New device sales reached almost 1 million units, with strong growth in Mexico. POS sales in Mexico benefited from the launch of our top-of-the-line device geared towards larger merchants, where we improved our value proposition by distributing debit cards to Point device holders, as well. On the flip side, POS sales in Brazil were challenged by increased restrictions on mobility, as well as seasonality, resulting in 650,000 new merchant POS sales this quarter, a very solid number, but down from previous quarters, despite the record high volume processed through POS in Brazil.
Online payments grew 139% year-over-year on an FX neutral basis. Underlying this growth are two opposing trends. On one hand, we continue expanding our services to online merchants and SMEs, establishing ourselves as a payment solution of choice for many new online businesses. During the quarter we maintained our small, mid and larger sized merchant acquisition productivity with no indication of volatility in seller churn. On the other hand, long tail sellers that boosted activity during the peak of lockdowns in the region have decreased in volume as economies open, and also driven by seasonality.
To complete the review of our portfolio of financial services, let me address the growing number of financial solutions for payers offered through our digital wallet. Total payment volume associated with the wallet, on a consolidated basis, was $2.9 billion. This represents a deceleration to 192% year-over-year on an FX neutral basis. The slowdown was driven by Brazil and Argentina; where diminished government financial aid this quarter negatively impacted growth in total payers on the wallet, while less marketing spend as a percentage of wallet TPV reduced user growth but improved profitability.
Although we are pleased to see nearly 3X FX neutral growth in wallet payments volume, our ultimate goal is more ambitious than primarily payments. Our strategy is to transition from being primarily a digital payments platform to a principal financial services provider. To accomplish this, we are beginning to better balance the investments required for growing the number of payers in our ecosystem, with investments in driving higher levels of adoption of our multiple financial services; thus setting the foundation for product diversification towards a more balanced and sustainable revenue and profit mix between payment, credit, insurance, and savings tech offerings.
To advance this objective of broadening our service offerings within the wallet, we made important product development steps during Q1. On the insurance front, we saw consistent acceleration in our extended warranty product in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico, with solid multi-quarter sequential improvements in sales attach rates. We also expanded the roll out of theft and damage insurance in Brazil for cell phones, a service that we can cross sell within our marketplace.
Regarding our proprietary cards, we issued 3.8 million more cards this quarter, 2.6 million being in Brazil. The advantage of these recently rolled-out cards is that they can be enabled as hybrid debit and credit cards, and they will be our platform to grow our revolving credit product in the coming months. Our asset management services within the wallet are another example of growth in added financial services, having added over 770,000 new users with invested funds in their wallet accounts during Q1, for a total of over 15 million investment accounts with positive balances.
Finally, incoming deposits into our digital account have increased such that payers with account money have doubled compared to Q1 of last year, potentially confirming the increased intention to engage with the financial services provided in our wallet beyond mainly payments. Consequently, we reached 14 million active wallet users during Q1; similar in number to Q4, while seeing growth in per user engagement, as payers are increasing the frequency and value of transactions consistently over time, as well as solid growth in adoption of incremental financial services in the wallet as I have just described, service by service. We are still in the early days of our journey of becoming a principal provider of financial services through the wallet, and the initial results are encouraging.
Finally, I’ll provide a performance update from Mercado Credito. In Q1, our portfolio surpassed $575 million, more than doubling our volume versus the same quarter the previous year. During the quarter, we originated over $582 million, and our consumer credit portfolio continues to drive growth in all geographies. This growth has come with increases in NPLs. Specifically we've seen NPLs increase among a particular segment of users who have found it difficult to service small loans once government financial aid subsidies were removed. Upon observing this at the beginning of the year, we incorporated these new conditions into our credit scoring models in a timely manner, thus exiting the quarter with improving performance on NPLs. Consequently, notwithstanding this quarterly increase in bad debt in the Brazilian consumer credit books, we remain confident that we will be able to continue growing credit originations with sustained profitability going forward.
Let's now move on to a review of our financial progress for the first quarter. I’ll begin with consolidated net revenues. We began 2021 booking the highest net revenue growth rate over the last five quarters. Having reached almost $1.4 billion in revenue, we grew 111% in U.S. dollars and 158% on an FX neutral basis. At the country level, on an FX neutral basis, Argentina once again grew above the 200% mark, Mexico nearly grew 150%. We were encouraged by our Q1 net revenue growth in Brazil of 139%, surpassing the growth rates of previous quarters.
Gross profit in Q1 was $591 million at a margin of 43%, decreased from the 48% recorded in Q1 of 2020, but increasing 6 percentage points sequentially. This trend is explained by our growth and expansion of investments which support our long-term strategy. Over the past 12 months, we’ve expanded our 1P business, booking product costs in our COGS line. In addition, as we continue to roll out our own shipping network and have built more fulfillment centers, shipping operating costs have increased as a proportion of costs over net revenues.
For greater detail, and as we do every quarter, we’ve included a detailed breakdown of these margin effects in the slides accompanying this presentation, along with the OpEx margin evolution, as well. We see efficiencies and scale reflected in our operating expenses compared to last year. Operating expenses were $500 million in Q1 and we have sustained improved operating leverage. OpEx as a percentage of revenues improved 17 percentage points year-over-year, decreasing from 53% to 36% this year. Between our new sustained net revenue growth and continued investments in developing our brand, user base and logistics capabilities, we reached Q1 of 2021 with positive EBIT dollars compared to a loss in Q1 of last year.
Moving down the P&L, the company incurred $91 million in financial expenses this quarter, turning a very strong EBIT quarter into the red. However, the main driver of this is non-recurring. We recorded a $49 million charge related to our convertible debt repurchase transaction. We also increased year-over-year tax payments from increased earnings in multiple geographies. This quarter we also have a foreign exchange loss of a little above $15 million, primarily from share repurchases carried forward in Argentina at the blue chip swap rate.
Interest income was $25 million, a 32% decrease year-over-year resulting from lower interest rates on investments versus the first quarter of 2020. Ultimately, Q1 closed with a net loss of $34 million after tax, yet with an improved net income margin of almost 1 percentage point compared to last year, and more importantly, a return to profitability if excluding one off charges.
To wrap up, I’ll note that we’ve gotten off to a great start to 2021. Our top line growth is very solid and we have successfully executed our plans to drive incremental EBIT through our financial model. We are still facing trying times in Latin America as the COVID-19 pandemic remains present. We remain immensely grateful to our almost 19,000 employees and collaborators for their continuous commitment to provide financial inclusion and democratization of commerce, while keeping us safe and thriving. As has been the case over the past 12 months, we will keep building towards our goals, elbow to elbow with our community of users throughout Latin America.
Thanks everyone for joining this quarterly conference call and we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress in a few months. With that, we can now take your questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Ruben with Morgan Stanley. Hi. Thanks very much for taking the question and congratulations on the results. So my question is on a wallet. So the color is very helpful and the strategy is clear. And it seems like some less focus on TPV and active payers as the markers of progress. So my question is what metrics are you looking at internally? And what would you suggest investors look at to judge the success and traction of the wallet initiatives more broadly? Hi, Andrew. How are you? Thanks for that questions. And we continue to look at TPV and active payers. It's a metric we take a close look at, what has happened I would say in the last two quarters is on the one hand. Govantes, which have been – last year a step function in growth slowed down or disappeared mostly in both Brazil and Argentina on one hand. And then on the other hand, we also saw that there were lockdowns in the countries where we operate. And we decided to invest less aggressively on the marketing side to acquire new users. We decided to save those marketing dollars for late during the year, where we hope that these countries will be open.
On the other hand, I would say, more and more we are looking beyond just wallet and towards becoming a more comprehensive financial services platform. And so we have been also focusing more on, for example, debit cards in Brazil and now we have just launched credit cards in Brazil, so that to have a more significant share in total marketing – total financial spend of our users and that has been the focus recently. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bob Ford with Bank of America. Thank you and again congratulations on the quarter. Just a couple of questions. How are you thinking about your dual app structure these days? And would combining that two help to drive greater wallet activation, frequency, and more efficient wallet funding? Or is the cost and speed and size too higher price to pay given the technology base that the consumer has? And then, I recall you're beginning to accept Bitcoin some time ago in the marketplace and now the treasury move and facilitating real estate transactions in Bitcoin. Can you buy Bitcoin with ARS? And how are you thinking about the use of Bitcoin both in general terms and as possibly a store of value for your wallet users? Hi, Bob. Thanks. So, first of all, on the app structure, I think, going back to the previous question and to the increased focus on widespread financial services distribution, if you think about that as the ultimate goal and how do we move towards principality in financial services for our users implied in that is that a lot of the payments functionality should expand. I think there is a lot in the pipeline in terms of incremental financial services, features and products. So trying to cram all that in into a single UX is not the direction we're going. Having said that if you look at the numbers, we have around 60 million users on the commerce side that we increasingly cross sell and try to get them to also download the financial services Pago app. So their barebone payments functionalities in the yellow commerce app and increasingly we will try to drive those users over to the financial services app through cross linkages through promotions.
And that's where we are aggressively focused on expanding the amount of financial services that they use from us. At the end of the day, if you look at long-term, the real potential in FinTech goes way beyond payments and into the distribution of the other forms of financial services, credit, insurance, asset management, savings, all the products we have and we're now focused on growing. The crypto question is an interesting one. The crypto positions that our treasury has been purchasing are not usage of ours. This is U.S. dollars that we are purchasing crypto with. I think this has multiple objectives. One of them is we've always been long-term thinkers and we believe this is a good use of long-term store value for our treasury at the right amounts and at the prudent amounts.
But it's also us making sure that we are quickly moving up the learning curve in terms of understanding crypto and making sure that opportunities that we are sure will arise. We are able to move into them and have good understanding of what's going on, but this is not a way to purchase or store value of Argentine currency. That's not what we're doing here. And I think as a company, we are excited with opportunities that probably will emerge in the FinTech world around crypto. And we want to make sure that we are learning and well-versed or as much as we can. And that's, I think, one of the reasons we're doing this from treasury and also other parts of the company. Great. Thank you very much. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Irma Sgarz with Goldman Sachs. Yes. Hi, good evening. In your marketing expense line, you had an increase after a couple of quarters of sort of having a relatively flat line expenses given the environment. What campaigns, channels and geographies would you just call out? And was it more commerce so than – than FinTech, it sounded like it from your prepared remarks, but just wanted to follow up and get a little bit more details. And connected to that in the product and development technology expense side, you've been – obviously altogether we're seeing a lot of leverage in expenses, but that expense line was also up quite strongly in the first quarter and to a lesser extent now. When you think about the breakdown of your product and technology development expenses now for 2021 compared to, let's say, 2018, 2019, where has the main shifts taking place? Thank you. Great, Irma. So, on sales and marketing, if you look at the sequential evolution, it was actually seasonally up Q4 to Q3, and then it's up Q1 to Q4 again. That increase is not driven by actual customer acquisition, brand programmatic couponing, but it's driven by two other elements within that. One of them is the buyer protection program. So as TPV grows and also as we have more and more fulfillment blueprint items fulfilled by us, we have a larger coverage and guarantee promise, and those numbers are up about – that's the biggest driver of the sequential increase. And then the other one as is disclosed in the financial statements in greater detail is incremental bad debt on the credit book, but that's also because revenues and originations are growing extremely well. So there is a matching revenue growth from that increased in bad debt, which are the loan loss provisions on the credit book. The actual underlying branding and customer acquisition costs are down sequentially as one would expect from seasonality.
Product development, I think continues to be an area of strong investments for us in absolute dollars. It continues to scale year-over-year from a margin perspective and the single biggest line item there obviously is headcount. We have a lot of development and a lot of product features on our roadmap. And so, we're aggressively trying to ramp up our engineering team. We're looking to almost more than double actually our engineering teams over last year. We're convinced that that's the right place to be investing long-term. And so, I think, the combination of significant growth in absolute terms, but still scaling from a margin perspective is a good combination for a tech company. We can continue to invest aggressively in growing the engineering talent pool, but still deliver a margin expansion. Great, thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ravi Jain with HSBC. Good afternoon. Just quick two questions. First, I think, on e-commerce. Pedro give maybe some color around purchase frequency and retention rates, particularly about the cohort that came onto the platform the last two, three quarters. I mean, I'm trying to figure out how do we look at normalization of growth once we started comping the tougher ones in the next few quarters?
And the second one is probably a little bit more on the FinTech just following up on a couple of previous questions, right. You mentioned that you have lowered the marketing spend and the incremental financial services is what is going to drive. So maybe some color on what are the important features that you think will drive incremental adoption from here? What we'll take it from 14 million users to a number let's take a couple of folds from there? We've seen recent salary portability. Is it bad? Is it credit? Some color on what you think would drive adoption would be super helpful. Thank you. Okay, great. So let me start with the first one. I think on the cohort number, I don't have it off the top of my head. Obviously, there's a seasonal adaptation if we look at Q4 to Q1 cohorts, but nothing worrying in the cohort analysis. I think if anything when we look at the growth of our businesses, once we started comping with the COVID last year quarter over the last few weeks, we obviously will see a deceleration in the headline growth rate, but sequential evolution continues to be pretty solid across most markets. And so, we need to continue to closely monitor this.
I think as we rolled into May and June in some markets the comps get progressively more difficult, but so far when we look at the sequential evolution of growth week on week and month on month, there certainly seems to be a good amount of purchases that have moved online throughout the pandemic, and that are staying online. Now, bear in mind also that a lot of our geographies have gone back into lockdown. And so that also, I think, affects demand patterns and so we might have to look at this over a longer period into Q2 and Q3. But so far I would say encouraging results in terms of how much online purchasing has remained online. Going to the FinTech question, Ravi, I'd say that there are several features that we have been building or we are building to increase engagement with our wallet. Some of them are how users can use MercadoPago to pay in new ways. For example, we launched a couple of quarters ago, our debit card and the easiest thing about the debit card is that any MercadoPago user in Brazil has a virtual debit card. So whenever they have funds at MercadoPago, they are able to generate a credit card number and use that to pay online anywhere. And if they want, they can ask for a plastic, but they cannot pay it online.
Also, we will continue to increase the amount of credit lines we offer those users for them to have an extra reason to choose us to drive the credit use. And combining those two things we just launched our credit card in Brazil. So, the cards we had launched previously are debit ones are hybrid cards, and we can add credit functionality on top of those and we have started to do that in April. And so, whenever we get out users, who have both a debit card already with them and also a good score with us, we will be able to offer them a credit line on the same plastic. Then we are working on expanding our savings and investment products. So far, the only product we offer is a money market in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico and the plan for this year is to expand the investment offerings that we have in Brazil.
Then we will continue to grow our insurance products, so far extended warranty and theft and damage are the two products we have available, the second one only in Brazil and we are finding new ways to increase the adoption of both products. And so, there are few other things that are coming that we have not yet disclosed, but basically the idea here is to increase the cross-sell among products and to increase the engagement. You mentioned the salary portability and WhatsApp integration, those are two things that we have rolled out recently, still too early to have results of those, but what we want to achieve is to build principality in the use of the MercadoPago account. Thank you so much. That's helpful. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Marcelo Santos with J.P. Morgan. Hi, hello. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two, the first is on margins. I want to touch a bit on the question that Irma did. I wanted to understand a little bit better. You saw a big improvement in margin year-over-year because of lower marketing. And you also mentioned that you saved a bit on marketing dollars in the FinTech because there was a lockdown, so we didn't want to spend the money now. So we saw this very high margin. Is this margin that is kind of a little bit boosted because [indiscernible] marketing? And we should see a normalization of this marketing, or does this could be seen as a normal level that you were having? Just – that's the first question. And the second question, my perception was that their revenue was very strong like the monetization was very strong. Could you please comment if there was anything positively impacting monetization either on FinTech or on the e-commerce. Thank you. Great. So look, I think, the margin improvements sequentially are driven by more factors than only marketing, but marketing is a significant one. Marketing tends to have somewhat of a seasonal outlay. So, obviously, towards the end of the year shopping season, the margin compresses somewhat in Q1, I think, this year, as we said, was one of marketing pullback. So I don't think you should expect this kind of margin leverage, but I don't think you should assume number similar to Q4 of last year either. I think we do look to drive a year-on-year leverage off of the marketing expenses and given how fast our revenue base is growing. We can do that while at the same time being extremely competitive in the absolute number of dollars that we're deploying versus the prior year. There were also improvements and this is bleeding over to your second question.
There were a lot of operational efficiencies on shipping costs. Some of those are COGS, but also some of those are more efficient contra revenues. I remind you that we – some of our transportation costs are contra revs. And as that got more efficient into Q1, that's helped revenue growth. When we look at cost per shipment, those have been coming down sequentially across the board in almost all geographies. And that's also, I think, a consequence of good operational efficiency from the logistics team and also the benefits of scale. And then we've also seen a return to more mixed shift on payments of credit card over debit, debit was very prevalent throughout a lot of the government aid usage and credit has better monetization than debit. So that's reverted back to levels closer to where we're prior to Q3. And that's also helped to improve take rate. Perfect. Thank you. Thanks a lot. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. All right. Thank you. So, Pedro, thank you. You've been looking to add CPG as a more meaningful part of the consumer offering for some time now. So, is there anything you can add there in terms of what the increase in this percentage has done for, hopefully, greater velocity of purchase and hence as an output maybe customer lifetime value? And second, I think, you've been looking to onboard some lower ASP items from sellers in Asia, perhaps with a faster delivery and service offering versus the competition. So, can you give us an update on how that initiative is going? Thank you. Great. So CPG there is some initial data that points to better engagement and performance across non-CPG categories from users that purchase CPG. So we are beginning to see data that proves out, I think the thesis of getting involved in high-frequency CPG categories, that it does help lifetime values across other categories. Now, bear in mind that, and especially in the early years of the rollout of the CPG product that obviously does come at a cost, right? So even though lifetime values are improving, the incremental CPG sales are done at a much lower margin than other categories until that business reaches scale and becomes a much better margin business.
But I think we continue to focus on growing that and expanding that. And you will see a lot of innovation on our CPG and supermarket front like you have over the past few quarters. We've already announced a couple of high profile deals with very large retailers across the region to help them move more sales through our CPG channels supermarkets. And so this is obviously a very large TAM category with very high frequency. And one that the data we are seeing I think is leading us in the direction of continuing to build this out going forward.
CBT, solid growth very consistent. We continue to build out more and more sourcing capabilities in Asia. We now have feet in the ground there. We're seeing very strong impact of that in Mexico, for example, where it's relevant. We're also beginning to now focus on sourcing more and more North American merchants, because we're seeing good results as we improved products and features and users are better able to find cross-border listings and offerings on our site. So again, I think that's another part of our long-term vision is to turn global supply local for our consumers across Latin America. And we will do that by continuing to expand our sourcing efforts, both in Asia, but also in North America. Thank you. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Thiago Macruz with Itau. Hi guys. Well, we continue to see our massive active user growth [indiscernible] even above competition, even though you're the market leader by a mile. So I was wondering if you should have to list another importance, the top three in volume factor, they're supporting you as well. What would you list? What would you say? Thank you. Sorry. We just want to make sure we got your question? It cut-off a little bit. Can you repeat the back-end of the question please? Absolutely. Yes. I was just wondering you had to list the most important factors that are supporting your active user growth in Brazil in [indiscernible], what would it be? Sure. So, first of all I think clearly on the commerce side, there has been significant uplift in consumers purchasing online and engaging with our platform initially driven by the pandemic. I think for MELI the fact that so many users were driven to our platform in the early days of the pandemic and realize that the logistics capabilities we have built-out over the previous year's really were incredibly efficient, both in terms of the expensiveness of free shipping, but also service levels were fantastic for us.
I think had this happened two or three years earlier where our logistics build out had not been where it was. We would have had a very different capability to retain a lot of these new cohorts of users. So I think clearly pandemic driven, initial trial or users who had lapsed and then return to the platform and realize that the overall user experience was dramatically different from either what they anticipated or what they had experienced in the past has been a very, very important driver of growth.
And we see that also with the evolution of net promoter scores and the fact that despite the huge surge in volume, our delivery times have consistently improved sequentially quarter-on-quarter and the amount of free shipping has expanded. You might have realized in Q1, we lowered the threshold for free shipping in Brazil to 79 Reais. So really MELI has by far the most expensive free shipping program I think of online retailers in Brazil. And then on the FinTech side of the business, I would say that, that must have been a little bit different in each of the verticals. Basically if you want online payments have been sort of in sync with the marketplace, where the shift towards e-commerce has benefited the merchant services business. Then somehow [indiscernible] have been MPOS, but we saw a little bit of a slow down when there was less traffic to stores. Nonetheless I will say that our shift of market enables us to accelerate growth in the last couple of quarters. And that has been significant in terms of CPV. And I think we have already discussed the wallet. Thanks guys. Thank you very much. Thank you. And our next question from the line of Soomit Datta with New Street Research. Hi, guys. Two quick questions please. One on commerce and one on FinTech. Just on the commerce side, do you mind giving us please an update on what you're seeing specifically on the competitive side from [indiscernible] there's been quite a bit of noise about their presence in the Brazilian market potential to expand into Mexico. And I just wondered, I mean, that kind of seemed to coincide with the drop-in free shipping to 79 Reais. I wonder was that a response to the competition or was that just part of the ongoing business kind of thinking?
And then next, please, just on FinTech, sorry to go back to the wallet again. I just wanted to double check my sort of sense always get usability on the wallet and use the wallet to them layer on financial services. Should we now be thinking actually that's the models shifted slightly and actually, yes, we'll look to sell financial services, but maybe it will be more focused outside of the wallet going forward? Thank you. Great. So we don't comment on specific competitors. I think as a whole, given the size of the opportunity of commerce and FinTech in Latin America, the fastest growing e-commerce region in the world right now, obviously there will be competitors. We've always tried to observe and learn from our competitors. And if things that they are doing better, we can replicate – we will replicate, but no, we didn't lower free shipping as a response to a specific competitor. We've done that across the board in different geographies.
We've been doing that consistently over time. And the vision has always been that as we gain efficiencies from scale and from operational efficiency, we will allow some of those improvements to drop to the bottom line and we will return some of those to our consumers in the form of more free shipping, which generates a tremendous flywheel. And I think the combination of logistics efficiency and free shipping that we have today across the region is really unrivaled at the regional level.
Continuing to add wallet users is a very important part of the strategy. We're not trying to say that that's not the case and the wallet continues to be a fundamental distribution channel as our payments to attract users, to then cross sell other financial services. I think what we're trying to say here that massively acquiring wallet users, if then you are not also investing and focusing in cross selling other financial services is not really the long-term strategic blueprint that we've set for ourselves. So we need to increasingly find the balance between yes, acquiring as many users as we can, as fast as we can, but also making sure that those users we are acquiring are interested and we are able to cross sell other services to us.
So I think Andrew's question at the beginning in a way encapsulates the way we're managing the business, which is number of payer's as KPI is probably still very important. If we can also deliver on number of users of asset management, number of users of credit, number of users of InsurTech and the other products that are obviously the higher margin products and the more interesting from the long run. So wallet users is still core to our strategy, but increasingly more balanced with also consistent cross selling into that user base of the other better margin financial product. That's very clear. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan with Wolfe Research. Hey guys, thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple of quick ones, sorry, if they were asked already, being jumping around a couple of calls. So Pedro, can you talk about how big the first party business was on e-commerce during 1Q? And then what do you expected to reach for the rest of the year? Is the margin profile of 1P kind of at a place where you wanted to be, or is there opportunities to improve that as well?
And then the second question, can you provide some color on April trends on e-commerce, obviously the COVID situation at LATAM is very volatiles; but what are you seeing in terms of kind of relative consumer behavior, maybe in countries where vaccination rates are over-indexing with respect to the average? Thank you. Hi, Deepak. Thanks. Look so we've improved disclosure on 1P and you now have 1P revenues broken out in the P&L as a revenue line. It was slightly below $150 million, but you have that now consistently as the rule requires. Margin wise there is ample room for margin improvement in the 1P business going forward. This is still a relatively small business where there are improvements in pure product margins as we drive more purchasing scale and also significant improvements as we become more efficient in the operation overall. So I would say that we are investing in this business now and that the margin structure the way it looks today is not at all where we envision and are confident we can get it to look into next year and beyond.
Very quickly I touched upon this already, but I think in general we still need to be cautious in a way the comps get progressively more difficult in some markets into May and June, but so far in general I think the trends we've seen for most markets are encouraging. We continue to see sequential growth in our business, in line with what we had been seeing at the beginning of the year. So even if the year-on-year growth rates decline, the sequential increases, which is really what you should be looking at have not indicated in any way that consumers are massively moving back offline as soon as they can. I think we've offered enough of a compelling value proposition that a lot of that demand seems to be sticking. And like I said before, also bear in mind that lockdowns have been extended or reinstated in many of our markets, so that also is still impacting demand patterns. Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks, Pedro. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna. Hi Pedro, Osvaldo. Pedro in your prepared remarks, you – I thought you had said something to the effect that you had seen a slowdown in some volumes in the long-tail sellers as economies reopened. I may have misheard you. But if that's the case, could you elaborate on that one?
And then I'll just ask the other one upfront in a previous answer, Pedro, you mentioned sourcing more North American merchants, and I'm just wondering is that where PayPal comes in, or am I thinking about that the wrong way? Hi Jamie. With regards to the long-tail, what we have seen last year was that many lock downs, many small retailers, they were using payment links, mostly related to deliveries. And there was a greater opening of the economy in Latin America some of that volume slowed down, but beyond that, we continue to see very strong growth in long-tail in MPOS. So it was mostly in the online payments business related primarily because of [indiscernible]. My remarks on sourcing North American merchants is not related to PayPal. We have seen better results, and good product development and user experience in our cross-border efforts. Those efforts so far had primarily focused on sourcing product from Asian merchants. We believe that there is significant inventory in North America that's attractive to users throughout Latin America and not necessarily available. And so we're moving into that second pocket of global inventory that we think is interesting for our user base throughout Latin America, by sourcing directly ourselves and having feet on the street in the U.S. and Canada. But no, this doesn't refer to any specific initiative with PayPal. Got it. Thank you. I'll jump back in the queue. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Marvin Fong with BTIG. Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two quick ones on FinTech. I just wanted to follow-up on the 11 million collector number. I was just reviewing the notes from last quarter and, I think, you guys said it was six million in the fourth quarter, so just want to check to see if that was correct. And if so, what explains the pretty dramatic increase in collectors? But just potentially in general, could you just comment on how your trends are going in terms of adding collectors to the ecosystem?
And then my next question, just on the credit portfolio, the amount outstanding didn't seem to increase as much at quarter end, as we saw last quarter, even though originations was actually greater, still above $500 million. So, the question is, are we seeing any change in sort of the dynamics with borrowers paying back? Anything to call out there that would be great to provide some insight there. Thank you. Great. So, on collectors, let me just briefly recap the sequencing for you, 11 million is the number of collectors off the MELI marketplace, right. So, we exclude MELI merchants to give you a number of users that are merchants receiving payments through us or P2P, people receiving payments. That number is up about 77% year-over-year. But if we look at Q4, which is seasonally very strong, it was actually higher than 11 million, it was closer, slightly below 12 million. So again, nearly 80% growth year-over-year, but sequentially as expected due to seasonality down. So, I'm not sure what the six million number could be. Maybe it's another data point. Then with regard to the credit portfolio, I caught the question why it was the relation between the growth in terms of origination and in terms of growth in overall credit portfolio. Originations grew in the quarter 10% sequentially quarter-on-quarter, they were $527 million in the last quarter and $582 million this quarter. And then credit portfolio grew, 16% from $452 million to $526 million. But in general, the duration of our portfolio is pretty short, mostly because a big part of that is consumer loans, which typically are for four months. So, the growth of a quarter-on-quarter of origination is pretty much in line with the growth in the overall credit portfolio. Great. Thank you for clarifying that. Well said, I appreciate it. Hmm. Thank you. This concludes today's earnings call. Thank you for participating.

I will now turn the call over to Pedro. Welcome everyone. And thanks for joining our second quarter 2021 earnings call. I'm pleased to announce that the team here at MercadoLibre delivered another quarter of strong growth in our commerce and fintech businesses in Q2 2021, achieving record levels in both volume and revenues. This strong performance builds on the solid first quarter we have this year. We believe that our business is showing tremendous momentum, despite immense volatility in our key markets due to the frequent closing of physical retail across Latin America.
I'm proud to see the consistent execution of our plans, while prioritizing innovation, speed of execution, and user experience, all elements that are at the core of our corporate DNA. As hopefully the region and the world prepare for a return to a post pandemic reality, we see Latin America with enormous potential for continued growth in digital services. The last 18 months have generated a step function increase in digitalization of commerce and finance, setting the stage for sustained long-term growth throughout the region.
In its latest 2021 report, eMarketer has pointed to Latin America as the leading region in the world for e-commerce sales growth, with almost 10 percentage points higher projections than the worldwide average. Additionally, three of our top markets Brazil, Argentina and Mexico were listed among the top five growth markets globally. To deliver on that opportunity, we maintain our focus on executing our strategic plan, as we have until now.
Taking a more short-term look, as the region reopens, our businesses are scheduled to face tougher comparable growth rates as we fully lap 2020’s search. The data so far is encouraging, as it seems to point to consumer behavior shifts towards online purchasing having staying power. This preliminary optimism can be quantified in the two-year growth stacks for total payment volume on a consolidated FX neutral basis, which have accelerated from around mid-140% in Q1 ’21 pre pandemic, to nearly 200% this past quarter as economies reopen. We will continue to observe these trends for the second half of the year as more re-openings occur across Latin America.
With those opening remarks, let me now begin the quarterly review with an update of our Commerce business during the second quarter. For the quarter, the first that compares against the prior year fully affected by a surge in demand for e-commerce driven by lockdowns, consolidated gross merchandise volume grew 46% year over year on an FX neutral basis, reaching over $7 billion. This represents an increase of almost $1 billion sequentially.
We sold almost 245 million items in Q2, a growth of 37% year over year. We also saw improvements in the level of transactions per buyer compared to historic marks, a sign that we are sequentially driving increased engagement by our users. This quarter, we reached a record of 37.8 million unique buyers on our commerce platform alone. At the segment level, we experienced strong growth in our key geographies. Brazil grew over 40% on an FX neutral basis versus the prior year in GMV, with over 125 million items sold during the quarter.
Argentina continues to post strong GMV growth, reaching over 60% year over year on an FX neutral basis and with an all-time high number of unique buyers. We are also pleased to see Mexico who had eased out of lockdown restrictions during Q2, having maintained the number of buyers that we attracted the previous quarter. This led to increasing the items sold year over year by 30% and growing 29% in GMV on an FX neutral basis during Q2. Finally, in Chile, where we have called out accelerated growth rates over the last two quarters, we are proud to have reached a growth of over 230% year over year on an FX neutral basis.
We continue to invest in product breath and shopping convenience as drivers to attract and retain buyers. As a result of our commercial efforts to increase assortment with our current and newer sellers across key categories, we once again grew total live listing this quarter, posting another record in selection availability. Beyond strengthening categories where we historically have a strong GMV, such as auto parts, home and industries, and consumer electronics, part of the surge in product depth comes from our continued expansion into consumer-packaged goods and our supermarket experience.
As an example, our recent partnerships with local physical food retailers, such as g Grupo Pão de Açucar in Brazil are off to a strong start. Buyer demand has surpassed our expectations and we began accelerating fulfillment operations to strengthen our category experience as we look forward to adding more partners for the category. These warehouses will also help our first party inventory, which also plays an important role in complementing the product assortment from partners in this category.
We are also enthused about initiatives that will expand our assortment in Fashion and Apparel. We have dedicated product development teams working on recently implemented improvements to search and navigation aspects of our site to facilitate discovery of items in these categories. Along those lines, apparel is a key category to be featured in our upcoming live streaming platform which we have already began testing over the last few months.
With the additions of loved fashion brands and retailers such as Grupo Restoque, Asics, Nike and the most recent announcement of our partnership with Grupo Arezzo, we believe we continue making important strides in this category. As markets gradually continue to reopen, we are directing our investments towards initiatives that will spur continued growth, as well as user engagement and retention. So far this year, marketing investments have been geared towards stronger promotional events, and increasing our coverage of orders with free shipping.
We have also been driving branding campaigns to reinforce our brands connection with our users and merchants. We believe these investments solidify our brand’s trust as a marketplace for frequent purchases, and expect to continue ramping up investment levels during the second half of the year. On the retention front, we are encouraged by the positive trends we have observed so far in terms of engagement to our loyalty program.
The users on our loyalty programs premium levels continue to grow as our user base engages in a growing number of additional MELI services. For example, we see a consistent increase in users in video and audio content subscriptions that are offered at a discount for our loyal users. Along with these efforts in category development, we believe that these marketing and loyalty initiatives are crystallizing the online shopping habit formation within our marketplace.
Let me now turn it over to Mercado Envios, where we have been consistently delivering transformative change. This is another key area of investment that we believe to be driving a distinctive experience for buyers and sellers and underlying our sustained growth. This quarter, we shipped over 230 million items, reaching increasingly faster speeds and reduce unit shipping costs on a consolidated basis. We took another step towards boosting our managed network in Q2, reaching a penetration of 83% on a consolidated basis advancing in all geographies where we operate with our logistics solutions.
Fast delivery at an efficient cost is a key priority for us. To keep pushing our boundaries on this front, during the second quarter we launched Same Day shipping deliveries from our fulfillment centers in Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, and Chile. In Brazil, with our current footprint, the same-day solution can reach almost 20% of national postal codes. Beyond our own fulfillment operations, fast delivery is also made possible through our expanding cross docking network and our flex solution. Cross docking represented over 40% of shipments in Q2, leveraging our extensive network of pickup and drop off points throughout the region.
Our Flex service, where we leverage the logistics capabilities of our existing merchants for same day deliveries is currently available in five major cities throughout Latin America, and has a penetration of over 9% on our managed network. With all these adoptive logistics solutions, we saw sequential improvements in delivery times in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico this quarter, and on an aggregate level considering all shipping modalities and geographies, our average delivery time is less than a day and a half.
All these Envios initiatives led to the first quarter ever where over half of all purchases on MELI were delivered the same or next day. We believe this to be a remarkable achievement. We are excited about the great advances in shipping we achieved over the last year, and there is still more to come as we take our logistics expertise to more geographies, and cast a wider net in terms of free and same day deliveries. Let's now review our performance for FinTech.
During Q2, MercadoPago surpassed $17.5 billion in total payment volume on a consolidated basis, growing 72% on an FX neutral basis year over year. This represented a total of almost 730 million transactions for the quarter, almost 100 million more compared to the first quarter of ’21 and growing 80% year over year. Off platform, TPV grew 94% compared to Q2 ’20 reaching $10.3 billion. We were very pleased to see TPV rising both in B2B and B2C payment solutions.
Starting with the merchant solutions, we are particularly glad to see strong levels of total payment volume for online payments during the quarter. TPV for this online payment segment grew 67% year on year on an FX neutral basis, with strong advances in Brazil, Argentina and Chile. We are expanding structurally into SME and longtail sellers through partnerships with other e-commerce platforms for which we are the standard checkout option. In addition, the cross selling of online payment services into our mobile point of sale seller base has also been an important channel for adding merchants.
For Point, our point-of-sale offering, we accelerated TPV growth in the second quarter, delivering 94% growth year over year on a consolidated FX neutral basis. This is the highest total payment volume growth rate booked for Point since the onset of the pandemic in 2020, even in the context of continued lockdowns throughout part of the region. Device sales are still booming, having reached a total of 1.1 million devices sold this quarter, and with a more premium device mix compared to prior periods. While Brazil continues to drive most of the growth for Point, we begin to see consistent traction in Argentina and a rapidly scaling business in Mexico.
Turning now to our B2C solutions, our Wallet business booked a total payment volume growth rate of 107% on a consolidated FX neutral basis. Our Wallet, as one of the features within our digital account, is showing multiple signs of improved engagement levels from users growing 43% in amounts of payers per user, as well as showing sustained growth in average transaction value. In addition, more Wallet users are keen on investing their savings in their MercadoPago Digital account.
For the second quarter, we reached slightly above 19 million investment accounts active, up from 11.4 million in the second quarter of 2020 and 15.7 million in the first quarter of 2021. Overall, our payments ecosystem has added an engaged more users in Q2, both payers and collectors compared to previous quarter. We reached over 39 million payers off platform, with over 15 million payers just from the Wallet this quarter. On the collector side, in Q2, we reached 13.6 million total off platform sellers, a record for us, and up from 6.9 million during the same period last year.
Over this wide and growing base of users, we are confident that we can continue to overlay financial services through the digital wallet such as insurance, debit cards, and more immediately access to credit loans, which I will now review in more detail. Our Credit business grew significantly in Q2. We originated another record over $700 million in credit this quarter. This compares to $133 million in the same period last year. As such, we closed Q2 with our largest portfolio so far, reaching over $800 million.
We see strong and consistent growth from all three of our credit books, consumer, merchants online and merchants offline. Credits to consumers in particular, are driving the most accelerated growth rates and now represent over 50% of our current total portfolio. As an important channel for consumer credit, our Buy Now, Pay Later feature for payments within our Wallet has already reached double digit penetration rates in Brazil and Mexico. On the country level, we had the most significant uptick in originations coming from Mexico this quarter, and Brazil and Argentina continue to expand an impressive triple digit growth rates.
We have reached approximately 27 million consumers with approved credit lines in the region by this point, almost 9 times more than Q2 last year. After the temporary increase in NPLs we had experienced at the beginning of Q1, stemming primarily from government financial aid user cohorts, we have returned to overall healthy NPL profiles for our credit book in Q2, and feel confident to keep expanding our credit offering while managing healthy margins after loss provisions.
We also expanded the rollout of the MercadoPago proprietary hybrid NFC enabled card during Q2, issuing an additional 4.2 million cards, almost 3 million of which are in Brazil. Particularly in the month of June, we began to accelerate the credit card distribution and activation on certain user cohorts, with many more yet to activate in the coming quarters. The early responses to our new credit card users are encouraging, as they tend to have higher customer satisfaction with MercadoPago services overall, and have been consistently increasing their credit card use frequency over these initial trial periods.
We believe that the Credit business is foundational in our efforts to democratize access to money in Latin America. In a region with high indexes of unbanked and underbanked populations, demand for loans of all sizes and circumstances is rampant. Our extended marketplace from the commerce and the payments verticals gives us the infrastructure, expertise, and data to properly score, distribute and manage loans to a variety of profiles. With that, let's now turn to our review of financial results for the second quarter.
I'll start with the P&L. We’re following a strong first quarter in terms of revenues, we maintained strong traction in revenue growth in Q2 and reached $1.7 billion in net revenues on a consolidated basis, growing 94% in U.S. dollars, and 103% on an FX neutral basis. At the country level, on an FX neutral basis, Argentina grew 112% and Mexico 76%. In Brazil, on an FX neutral basis, we surpassed 100% growth in net revenues this quarter. In all key geographies, there were significant contribution to revenue growth from both commerce and FinTech.
For the quarter, gross profit was $754 million at a margin of 44.3%, decreasing from 48.6% in Q2 of 2020, but improving compared to the three prior quarters. Margin dilution year over year is largely a consequence of our expansion of the first party commerce sales and rollout of logistics fulfillment center operations. Sequentially, over the last year, we have been leveraging margin expansion in our payment collection fees and since the fourth quarter of 2020 have captured efficiencies in our shipping unit costs.
As we do every quarter, we've included a detailed breakdown of these margin effects in the slides accompanying this presentation, as well as the OpEx margin evolution. Following the trend from the first quarter, during the second quarter, we continue to see scale and efficiency effect in our operating expenses year over year. Operating expenses were $588 million, which represents 34.5% of net revenues, sustaining and slightly improving the operating leverage from prior quarters while maintaining consistent investment levels in product development and sales and marketing spent.
During the second quarter, we reached strong triple digit top line growth on an FX neutral basis, while delivering an improvement in EBIT profitability levels. We believe that we are investing towards sustainable growth and starting to reap some of the scale advantages that flow through our P&L.
Wrapping up our performance highlights for today, a final reflection. For many countries in Latin America, physical retail is only beginning to reopen, and there is still much uncertainty in the region surrounding the pandemic.
Given this backdrop, our role is to keep expanding our ecosystem by staying committed to improving our service levels, and our reach with our merchant and user basis. In addition, we will continue committed to investing in both user acquisition as well as improving and investing behind more features, and a better user experience that improved customer retention and engagement, key factors of sustaining preference for the digital commerce and financial services that we can offer.
Finally, I'd like to thank our now 20,000 employees in our extended community of partners for another quarter of outstanding execution. We are grateful to everyone who has joined our quarterly conference call, and I look forward to sharing our progress next quarter with you. We're now happy to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] And our first question coming from the line of Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Okay, thank you so much. So, Pedro, I wanted to follow up on the same day delivery expansion in Brazil. How quickly do you think you can get to full coverage of the country with same day? And can you quantify how much of the customer’s order velocity picks up as the service level is improving? And I guess secondarily, the eternal optimist in me wants to believe that as you and your peers take steps to increase selection and delivery service, e-commerce adoption should hopefully accelerate. So, do you think you're starting to see that steeper part of the S curve of adoption as of yet? Or is it still too difficult to disaggregate relative to what is happening with the pandemic? Thank you. Hi, Stephen. Thanks. So, first of all, the evolution of our rapid shipping solutions so same and next day, certainly is one of the strongest pillars of our value proposition today. Taking Brazil, for example, I think we're already at about 2000 cities, where our packages can be delivered same or next day, which when you look back just a few years, really is a phenomenal, phenomenal improvement in the value proposition.
And I think that's one of the things that's driving the sustained growth in our business and share, parsing out exactly how much lift comes from that is not something that we've disclosed. But I think it's sufficient to say and we've seen this globally, that as you shorten times and you improve predictability, and you overlay that with the fact that our free shipping program has done nothing but become more and more widespread, you have a very potent cocktail of improving user experience.
And we will continue to focus on expanding as much as we can that. Same day, which is your specific question, in a way is really determined by the number of FCs where we can locate inventory within same day delivery. That's an ever-expanding footprint, I think in a well-managed and cautious way from a CapEx perspective because most of these are OpEx, we don't own or build the FCs and we will continue to grow out that footprint to get closer to our consumers.
On the S curve, look, I think the last five quarters have seen tremendous acceleration in the rate of adoption of digital services. Obviously, somewhat pandemic driven, are very pandemic driven. But that I think has gotten us closer to the more inclined portion of the S curve. And where we're seeing that so far. And I want to remain somewhat cautious until we get through H2 is that, like we said in the prepared remarks, the two years stacks actually look better coming out of the pandemic than they did going into the pandemic, which means that a lot of this demand that has moved online probably stays online, which is one way to define the steeper portion of the S curve. Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Andrew Ruben with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Hi, thanks very much for the question. I'm curious thinking about the investment stance into the second half. It was another quarter here where versus our expectations and meaningful upside on margin so, can you talk about what you're thinking about spending directionally for the back half? And specifically, where that's going to perhaps a bit more color on the marketing, on the loyalty and related initiatives where you could see that incremental back flowing to? Thanks very much. Yeah, great. So, I think it is important to note that we typically look at our efforts to deliver conservative but consistent operational leverage on the business on annual cycles. So, the way money gets invested across the year sometimes isn't necessarily very linear across quarters. The back half of the year has the more heavy promotional activity around Black Friday in Q4. There are certain brand efforts that get staged more in the second half than the first half.
I think we've continued to tweak and you've seen the thresholds around free shipping to make the free shipping program more available and even more widespread. There is a lot that we're doing and is showing very encouraging signs in loyalty, and content distribution related to loyalty. So, these are some of the main areas of potential incremental investment for the back half of the year. So, don't assume that H1 necessarily is a readout of what the entire year can look like.
I think you need to look at four-year chunks to understand how we're leveraging the P&L sequentially from one year to the next. And I think it's fair to say that, given the results we're seeing, we could decide to be more aggressive in the second half around specific initiatives that I've just outlined. That's very helpful. Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Bob Ford with Bank of America. Your line is open. Thank you very much and congratulations on the quarter. And thank you for taking my questions. Pedro, in the quarter you seem to be doing some gamification testing in Brazil, how should we think about your use of gamification elements going forward? And you also seem to be growing more comfortable in your comments with respect to the loyalty stack that you've put together so far. Does it need any further refinement prior to you really hitting the accelerator?
And then Osvaldo, I believe you were recently quoted in the press exploring crypto as a store of value for Wallet users, in which countries could you legally offer crypto and how much development work needs to be done to enable that? And then lastly, Pedro you mentioned you're doing great in Chile, and it's been going well for some time now. Is the new Colina distribution center or the regional infrastructure that you built out playing a role yet, I know it had a soft open in the quarter, but it seems a bit early. But I wasn't sure. Thank you. Hi, Bob. Thanks for the questions. So, on gamification, I think, interesting initial trials. One characteristic of ours, and you've seen this as we've always, I think, not only tried to innovate and see what works, but also learn from what's going on globally. I think gamification is one area that we hadn't made too many advances on. And we are tinkering and toying with it. And we'll see what comes out, but I think not too much else to note there.
I think we've seen players globally, leverage gamification efforts efficiently for e-commerce. And so hopefully it's another driver we find to drive engagement. Loyalty, like said in the previous question, we are encouraged by everything we're seeing. I think our content distribution play continues to add more content providers. It continues to grow the number of users that are signing up for those content partners through MercadoLibra and MercadoPago as part of the loyalty program, but certainly there are years of never-ending refinements and improvements ahead for the loyalty program.
We do think that the value proposition continues to get better and better. And as a consequence of that, I think you'll see us get more aggressive around communicating it and pushing it and other potential ways to get more users up into higher loyalty levels. But there's still significant innovation and new benefits that we will look to overlay into the loyalty program. And Bob, with regards to crypto, we don't have anything to announce yet. And basically, the code you saw in the press, the specific question was, whether we were keeping track of what was happening in the U.S. with several large wallets, allowing people to buy, hold and sell crypto. And that was pretty much it. And we are just understanding, looking into that understand the market and understanding restrictions. That's helpful, thank you. And then lastly on Chile. Did the is the growth that you're experiencing now, in any way related to the new distribution center at Colina that increases your holding capacity, my understanding is by four times. I think the causality there maybe can't entirely be attributed to that. Chile has been the success story of the past 18 months. I think it's a market that a few years back was one of our, I guess, more challenging markets, and it has become in terms of growth and market share gains, and user feedback. A very, very strong market for us. Demand has grown the most of any market over the last 15 months, and continues to deliver as you've seen this quarter very, very solid results.
And that will demand more fulfillment capacity, more distribution capacity. So, we will certainly double down in our fulfillment and logistics efforts in Chile, given that consumers are increasingly relying on us for day-to-day shopping needs, et cetera. So it's part, I think of a virtuous cycle. But I don't think we can we can attribute too much causality to the distribution center. I think pandemic, what's being done with distribution of pension funds, and just overall fantastic execution by the team in Chile. That's very helpful. Thank you very much. And our next question coming from the line of Marcelo Santos with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Hi, thanks for allowing me to make the questions. The first question is regarding the same day delivery, you mentioned that 20% of postal codes can get same day delivery. What will be an estimate on how much of GDP is covered by these postal codes, so just to get a better sense of purchasing power? And the second question is about the live stream initiative you mentioned in the prepared remarks. Could you give a little bit more detail on what this initiative is about? What are the plans for that? Thank you. So, let's see. Logically, those postal codes, where it makes sense to aim for same day delivery are the ones where we will have fulfillment centers, and they are determined by where most of the demand lies. I don't know off the top of my head exactly what GDP those 20% represents. But clearly, it will be the lion's share of the largest metropolitan areas. Today, roughly 50% of our gross merchandise volume is probably being delivered within a 24-hour window. So, as we continue to roll out more FC's, that number should only continue to move north.
Live streaming, if you look at live streaming, first of all is an incremental discovery opportunity for our user base obviously with very, very strong traction in some Asian e-commerce markets. So, it has an initial vision, which is how do we generate better discovery on MELI, which has historically been very much search driven. But if we think bigger picture and longer term, it also ties in well with a lot of the things we're doing around content distribution for partners, as this starts a kernel of our own content and complimentary content that we can distribute.
So, another example of something that's very initial. In the early stages, it's more about driving more engagement, more eyeballs and better conversions to products. And then we see if it's working, and we take it from there. Perfect. Thank you very much for the answers. Our next question coming from the line of Craig Maurer with Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Yeah, sorry, thanks for taking the questions. The first is about the competitive dynamic in Brazil, this is the number one question we're getting from investors. And you made some impressive comments regarding your fulfillment capability in Brazil. So, I was wondering if you could perhaps try to talk about or define how many years behind you think the competition is in terms of their fulfillment ability in Brazil, perhaps focusing on new entrants like Shopee.
Second, you talked about increasing sales of more sophisticated point of sale payment devices. And I was trying to understand, when do you think the larger merchants that you're selling these to will begin to start contributing to acceleration in off platform TPV growth? Thanks. Look, on the competitive front, I think we always say the market has been competitive, it's a huge opportunity, it will continue to be competitive. And rather than looking at how many years of a head start do we have, it's how can we move consistently faster and accelerate our own pace of rollout of our network to try to continue to drive up same and next day delivery, continue to expand free shipping.
So, I think the playbook so far, we've been very successful. And we just need to make sure that we don't get complacent. And we continue to do everything in our power to drive down cost, return a part of that improved cost back to consumers in the form of more free shipping, and continue to roll out the network efficiently so that we can get faster and faster. And I think it's an ongoing race, and we don't want to measure how far ahead we are, because that could breed complacency. Craig, with regards to our POS business, we are already seeing the effects of wind-up market mostly in Argentina. And it's starting to happen in Brazil, too. In Mexico, we are just getting started there. But bear in mind that these mentioned largest segments is really our SMEs basically, in the past we're addressing mostly individuals, and these devices are targeted towards SMEs. But there's already an effect we're seeing in Argentina. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question coming from the line of Irma Sgarz with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Yes, thanks for taking my question. It sounds like you had some strong progress, again, in terms of user engagement on the platforms. And that remains something that you continue to call out on your comments. So, I was just curious to what extent you're working on bringing on in more personalization into the user experience, whether it's in the interface and search, discovery, maybe leveraging sort of the cross fertilization across Pago into e-commerce to drive product discovery on a more personalized level?
And then second question, switching just to merchant -- the online merchant service segment where you called out that you're seeing good growth. So, I was just curious if you think that you're taking market share there, and whether there is any pressure on the MDRs or whether you're maintaining the same level of profitability there? Thank you. Hi Irma. Thanks for the questions. I think more of the focus and the heavy lifting on user interface is still around removing friction. There's work being done around discovery. There are the gamification efforts. I think incremental personalization in the UI and how you interface with the platform probably would be overplaying where our product priorities are right now.
So, I guess the answer is, look, there's always an attempt to make the experience, more and more catered to each user. But it's not really one of the big product pushes right now that are probably more focused on expanding services. There's a lot of product innovation going on, both in the fintech world, and the loyalty programs and even on commerce, discovery, gamification, not an enormous focus at this point in time, in increased personalization of the user interface. Irma, with regards to online merchants and merchant services, we do seem to be growing faster than the market both in Brazil and Chile and Argentina. So, I would say we are going into those markets. And with regard to MDR, we have not yet seen a lot of pressure in terms of MDR. What we have seen is in particular in Brazil -- sorry, yes, in Brazil, mix growing faster, growing very well. And that necessarily have lower MDR than the rest of the of the card market. So, if you were to look at the average, there might be some MDR compression, but it's only because of the part that is coming from mix. Very helpful. Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Deepak Mathivanan with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Great. Hey, guys, thanks for taking the questions. So first, can you talk about how Wallet use cases wall during the second quarter? Also, realized you don't provide any guidance, but as you count the impact of government relief payout in second half from last year, how should we think about the impact on those on the year-on-year growth rates?
And then second question, GMV growth was pretty strong, even as you started lapping some of the benefits from last year. Can you talk about the underlying customer cohorts, maybe in terms of category adoption, frequency? Also, if you can provide some color on July trends. That'd be great. Thank you so much. So, with regards to the Wallet, I'll say that was mostly, typically the payers we count in those 15 million people who paid with Wallet in the quarter are mostly coming from six use cases. And those are mobile [ph] broadcast transportation, paying utilities, if you have payments B2B, it transfers. And those are mainly it. Now, if we were to look also at people who are paying making experiments on transfers with a Wallet, that would add another 3 million payers more to the quarter.
And so, we are excited that we are seeing increased engagement in all three countries, and that people who are using the Wallet are also using it more often. The second question you asked is what about to the coming quarters? As you mentioned, we do not provide guidance. But as you also know, we have seen an increase step function with the increase in Wallet use in Brazil a year ago. And that happened mostly during the second and third quarter.
So, those are the two quarters that will be more challenging, then as we expect to continue to grow in the Wallet, and the comparisons will become easier. Sorry, in terms of GMV strength category mix is a part of the story. I think we're seeing growth -- continued sustained growth in apparel. CPG is especially in units gaining traction and becoming more relevant and that's a high frequency category. I don't think the cohorts have dramatically changed. I think really what we see in the deceleration is just primarily the math of the tougher comps. So, that's why we've pointed to looking at two year growth rates, which have remained quite solid despite rapid reopening in Mexico and gradual reopening across other markets. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to the speakers for any closing remarks. Great, thank you everyone. We continue to hope that everyone remains safe, back to work for us. Still many, many things to do, and we look forward to being able to update you as always in a quarter’s time. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation.

Welcome to MercadoLibre Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Lisa Schreurs, Investor Relations Officer. Hello, everyone, and welcome to the MercadoLibre Earnings Conference Call for the quarter ended September 30, 2021. I am Lisa Schreurs, Investor Relations Officer for MercadoLibre. Our Chief Financial Officer, Pedro Arnt, will be leading today's prepared remarks. Joining him on the line is Chief Executive Officer of MercadoPago, Osvaldo Gimenez, who will be available during today's Q&A session.
I remind you that Management may make forward-looking statements relating to such matters as continued growth prospects for the company, industry trends and product and technology initiatives. These statements are based on currently available information and our current assumptions, expectations and projections about future events. While we believe that our assumptions, expectations and projections are reasonable in view of the currently available information, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.
Our actual results may differ materially from those included in this conference call for a variety of reasons, including those described in the forward-looking statements and Risk Factors sections of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, Item 1A-Risk Factors in Part II of the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2021, and any of MercadoLibre Inc.'s other applicable filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on our Investor Relations website.
I will now turn the call over to Pedro. Hi, everyone, and thanks for joining our earnings call this quarter. I'll start with a few notes regarding our operating environment. Fortunately, we've seen a consistent easing of mobility restrictions across our region in the last few months, with signs that we are approaching a new phase in our response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is great news as only a year ago, we had experienced the peak of severe lockdowns and government financial aid interventions in the third quarter of 2020. On the business side, these positive trends also mean that this is the quarter of toughest year-over-year growth comparisons for our main metrics.
Having spent over a year working through difficult macroeconomic and healthcare conditions throughout Latin America, we are starting to take stock of our role and our impact in commerce and financial services businesses throughout this time. In September, we released the results of a study titled Impacts That Matter conducted by Euromonitor that assessed our contribution to the socio-economic environment and ecosystemic effects in our key geographies over the past year.
We are proud to see that our mission of creating sustainable prosperity in our region through the democratization of commerce and access to financial services is coming to fruition. Our platforms have enabled the main source of income for over 900,000 families in our region and we generated six new jobs per hour during 2020 -- directly or semi directly -- through our ecosystem.
As we expanded our credit business, over 40% of our SMEs accessed their first loans ever -- most of which were geared towards investing in working capital for their businesses. Overall, we have enabled our merchants to grow their operations well beyond their cities and amplified their reach into a larger economy, becoming an even more important source of revenues during the challenging year of 2020. The full Euromonitor report summary has been uploaded to our website and we encourage you to have a look at it.
As a result of what we believe to be these lasting contributions to financial inclusion and the democratization of commerce through an improved experience for our users, our volume growth rates continue to demonstrate a solid trajectory over the long term. We have once again reached new records in gross merchandise volume, payment volumes and credit portfolio size, which demonstrates resilience and strength across all parts of our ecosystem. Moreover, we see our engagement and satisfaction improving sequentially for both commerce and fintech services, which is particularly encouraging given the user base expansion that we have driven over the last year.
Let me dive deeper into the third quarter results, starting with our commerce business. For the first quarter, we achieved a new record in GMV of over $7.3 billion, posting a growth of almost 30% on an FX-neutral basis. This represents an increase of over $1.4 billion compared to the same quarter last year. We also see consistency on a two-year CAGR growth in FX-neutral GMV of 73%, very similar to the 74% achieved in both Q1 and Q2 of this year.
We sold almost 260 million items in the third quarter, growing over 26% year-over-year. This growth is fueled by continued increases in our commerce user base. We reached 38.6 million unique buyers on the commerce side alone and our buyers are demonstrating higher levels of engagement, with increasing transactions per unique buyer sequentially. We are still seeing higher levels of new buyers to our platform compared to the periods before the pandemic and of equal importance, we are maintaining better retention levels, as well.
Taking a look across our geographies, the first that stands out in terms of growth is Brazil. With an FX-neutral growth of 28% in GMV, Brazil reached almost 138 million items sold during the Q3. These growth rates are above what we had experienced prior to the pandemic and the 51% two-year CAGR is flat compared to prior quarters with 53% in Q1 and the same 51% in Q2.
In Mexico, gross merchandise volume grew over 34% on an FX-neutral basis, accelerating compared to Q2 and growing unique buyers sequentially. Argentina reached almost 37% of GMV growth on an FX-neutral basis. And all three key geographies improved in transactions per buyer versus the previous quarter and net promoter scores are also trending to their highest levels yet in several of these key geographies.
We attribute the sustained and continuous increase in buyer engagement to several initiatives that we are running in parallel. First, our developments in product assortment and depth of product can be linked to this change in behavior towards higher frequency. Our marketplace is increasingly filled with well-recognized brands in the fashion, beauty, consumer electronics and consumer packaged goods industries, not only from marketplace sellers, but also through the development of our first-party assortment.
Just as an example in the last few months, items from Nike, Enjoei, Nivea and PlayStation can be found in our marketplace in Brazil, as well as Apple, Samsung and Asics that have been added to our platform in Mexico. Particularly for our grocery strategy, we have taken an additional step to expand our assortment with our first pilot programs for fresh items.
In São Paulo, we started operating with Mambo, a local food retailer to offer their fresh selection and we are setting up similar partnerships for the coming quarters in both Buenos Aires and Mexico City. During these early days of moving into the supermarket category, we have observed that supermarket buyers not only have a higher purchasing frequency, but also are demonstrating better user retention rates.
Second, we continue to enhance our tiered loyalty program, which not only builds strength on the commerce side, but also ties in our fintech services. With the strong partnerships we have developed with our content providers, we believe the benefits and discounts offered through the loyalty program are among the best in class. More recently in September, we started giving users the option of purchasing access to our highest loyalty tier, offering our most comprehensive benefits with the highest shipping and content discounts to these paid users.
Finally, the consistent results of the last year proved the great importance of reliable, fast shipping to remove barriers to ecommerce. We made significant investments in the continued roll-out of our managed logistics network during the third quarter.
So, turning to Mercado Envios, the advances in speed and execution on the network are transforming the commerce experience throughout the region. In Q3, we shipped almost 248 million items and developed more capabilities to expand fulfillment throughout key geographies. Our managed network penetration reached 86%, up from 64% in the same quarter last year. Within that network, fulfillment by Mercado Libre is propelling growth, having reached 37% penetration. We launched two new fulfillment centers in Brazil this quarter and converted two existing fulfillment centers into centers that are now fully-managed by us.
In Mexico, an additional fulfillment center was implemented and will be expanded in the coming months. Argentina, Colombia and Chile, we see more sellers and items moved into our fulfillment centers. Overall, we have now 16 active fulfillment centers throughout the region, enabling our delivery times to improve every quarter.
Faster shipping is also coming through our cross-docking network, which represents over 40% of shipments. We are improving our service levels within cross-docking as we scale and mature the various nodes of this extensive network. As part of this expansion, we signed an agreement to acquire a specialized logistics technology company, Kangu, in the third quarter after having developed a strong partnership of accelerated growth and shipping capabilities with them starting in 2019.
Operating over 5,000 pick-up and drop-off points, Kangu has created a differentiated value proposition for logistics in Brazil, Mexico and Colombia. It is asset-light and technologically-integrated. This network, which we call MELI Places is now part of our logistics assets, allowing us to increase our network's capillarity, reaching more sellers and buyers at faster speeds and growing the model based on our geographical and service expansion opportunities.
One example of this is that over 60% of the MELI Places are already enabled for pick-up functionality for buyers who have opted not to receive their purchases at their home address. In Mexico, we are already using some of these places to receive returns -- an experience we will roll out to other countries shortly. We can also count on our Flex solution to improve shipping times for shipments travelling within the same urban area. Flex is already operating seven days a week for all sites where it has been deployed.
The Flex technology is also running part of the hybrid shipping model for supermarket items. While dry goods are being shipped from our fulfillment centers, fresh products shipped directly from store to the buyer leveraging the capabilities of the Flex network. Flex represents almost 10% of our shipments today and has developed particularly quickly in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, and Uruguay so far, while also delivering the fastest times on our network.
Combining all of these flexible shipping capabilities, we are achieving our goals to run a faster and more reliable delivery operation. In the third quarter, almost 80% of all items were delivered within 48 hours, while consistently increasing the number of free items shipped. We are developing more specialized capabilities to take on a variety of categories within our network. The continuous improvement around our shipping solutions goes hand-in-hand with our category development expansions. Our strategy to create the proprietary technology and infrastructure around logistics continues to open new strategic doors for us and has become one of our key assets and strengths for our ecommerce operations.
I'd like now to spend some more time delving deeper into our fintech business, which we are extremely excited with. We are encouraged by signs that we have reached a level of product maturity in certain parts of the fintech business and simultaneously, we see vast opportunities to keep developing our reach into a large market of unbanked and underbanked users throughout Latin America.
We are focused on fueling these next growth engines by taking our new upcoming fintech products to market. In light of this, we have transitioned the organization to approach solution based on the end-user and not the product offering and are therefore dividing our products and services into two organizational units: Merchants and Individuals. This should allow for better cross-selling opportunities and also a more consumer focused go-to-market strategy.
A more integrated view of each segment of merchants will enable us to provide more customized solutions within our product portfolio. On the individuals' side, our strategy is to drive deeper relationships with our users and offer them a greater array of services through the digital account. To illustrate our efforts under this framework, we will begin disclosing our TPV with an additional breakdown of Acquiring TPV and Digital Account TPV from now on.
Together, Acquiring TPV and Digital Account TPV add to our consolidated total payment volume in the region, which reached $20.9 billion in the third quarter, growing 59% on an FX-neutral basis. This represents over 865 million payment transactions in the quarter, growing 55% year-over-year. Now let me give you a more detailed update of the third quarter performance for our Acquiring TPV, which encapsulates On Platform payments, as well as merchant services for Online Payments, the mobile point of sale business and QR payments.
Acquiring TPV reached $15.4 billion, growing 46% on a consolidated FX-neutral basis. Within that, On-Platform TPV reached $7.5 billion at a 29% FX-neutral growth, in-line with our On-Platform GMV growth. Online payments outside of our platform had a similar growth level of 32% on an FX-neutral basis, though with a more accentuated deceleration compared to Q2 as expected since physical retail started to reopen during this period and the year-over-year comparison steepened.
The leading highlights in terms of growth were MPOS and QR payments during the third quarter. We were happy to see strong payment volume figures in both of these segments as individuals and merchants are now back to safer mobility in the region, with Point TPV growing 78% on a consolidated FX-neutral basis and with 1.3 million in device sales this quarter. Equally important are the advances of the QR payments for our merchants, which have accelerated in growth this quarter in all geographies.
The new Digital Account TPV encompasses the individual payment services available in our Wallet as well as all card payments, including debit, prepaid and credit. But we are excluding unmonetized transfers other than peer-to-peer between MercadoPago accounts.
Digital Account TPV reached $5.5 billion in the third quarter with a 101% growth on a consolidated FX-neutral basis. The Digital Account is also the platform that hosts multiple additional services for users beyond the payments reflected in TPV, such as the adaption and management of a consumer credit line, hiring of insurance policies and certificates and the typical bank transfers to other outside accounts.
Though not reflected in our reported payment volume, these other services have increasingly better user interfaces and integration with our full ecosystem. We believe these other accessory services are key to maintaining users' trust and engaging with ample financial services available in the MercadoPago Digital Account as we increasingly vie for the principality in financial services of our user base.
And while I'm on engagement, I would like to introduce our new methodology of counting and tracking Unique Fintech Active Users. Within our full Mercado Libre ecosystem of almost 78.7 million active quarterly users in Q3, we have a subset of users that are employing a MercadoPago fintech product, which we call Unique Fintech Active Users. We count a user as a Unique Fintech Active User if they have engaged in at least one of the following services within the quarter: wallet payment online, in-app or in-store; transfers; withdrawals; consumer or merchant credit borrowers; card users; fintech sellers; and fintech active products such as asset management and insurtech users. We had 31.6 million Unique Fintech Active Users in the third quarter of 2021 alone, a growth of 13% compared to last year's similar quarter.
Until the last quarter, we had been giving a lot of attention to the number of Wallet Payers, which continue to trend upwards during the third quarter, reaching 16.8 million wallet payers, up from 15.1 million in the second quarter. Yet, given our increasing attention to serving individuals beyond the payment facilities offered in the Wallet, we believe that the Unique Fintech Active User metric better reflects our user base that is engaged with our Digital Account. We are looking forward to sharing more around this metric as our products continue to mature and the number of features per user presents growing trends.
A key extension of our fintech services that supports our merchant and individual user bases is our credit business. We have exciting developments taking place in this part of our ecosystem and we believe it will be a core server to users that are entering basic financial services in our region. Our credit business took another significant step in Q3, surpassing the $1 billion mark in total portfolio size.
The $1.1 billion credit portfolio is the result of originating over $1 billion during the quarter. Our consumer credit book is leading the growth with our two main products: personal loans and credits for purchases on our platforms. While credits for purchases is still the main product, personal loans for possible uses outside of our platform are accelerating and achieving a greater presence in the consumer credit book.
At a country level, our consumer credit book is growing at high triple digits across all countries. Overall, we have reached almost 36 million consumers with pre-approved credit lines at their disposal, up from 27 million in the second quarter.
In the merchant credit portfolio for both online and offline merchants, we see continued expansion in our merchant base opting for a credit line. We've made improvements to the product interface and collection processes that create a seamless and effective experience for our merchants. We developed repayment methods so that merchants can now settle their loans on either a fixed installment over time or opt to settle through a percentage of their transacted volume with us. At the country level, we saw a spiked increase in credit loans in Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico.
Considering our full credit portfolio, non-performing loans are stable compared to the previous quarter. Overall and at the individual portfolio level, we are encouraged to see our ability to score and manage risk as we extend more credit lines to our users and all of our credit books were profitable during the third quarter.
Building on our credit capabilities and our ambition to extend the services attached to the digital account, we are excited by the first waves of implementation of our credit card -- for now only rolled out in Brazil. We expect the credit card to be one of the key features of our digital account to unlock future payment volume growth, as well as a means to increase user engagement and retention.
In Q3, we were focused on new features for the credit card product and understanding our user behavior better. There are several encouraging signs that we are headed in the right direction for the credit card. Net promoter scores for MercadoPago credit card holders trended significantly above our MercadoPago averages during the third quarter. Secondly, over half of the credit card transactions are occurring outside of our marketplace and payment platforms, which is significant in our road map to drive the principality of our digital account.
We also have a long waiting list of users, demonstrating interest in accessing our credit card, which we will begin to score and unlock in the coming months. By stitching together our credit products with our payment and commerce services, our ecosystem is becoming increasingly more robust. We are seeing greater depth in our relationships with merchants and users that begin to engage with several touch points throughout our ecosystem. The credit business has the ability to fuel these increased connections between consumers and merchants, unlocking higher conversion rates and overall, more financial inclusion.
With that overview, now let's go over our financial results for the third quarter quickly. We had a record achievement in quarterly revenues, surpassing $1.8 billion on a consolidated basis, growing 66.5% in U.S. dollars and 72.9% on an FX-neutral basis. In Brazil, revenues grew 69% on an FX-neutral basis, while Argentina and Mexico posted even higher FX-neutral growth rates, with 83% and almost 76% respectively.
Revenue growth is driven by consistent growth in our third-party and first-party merchandise as well as payment volumes and the expansion of our credit business while maintaining the consistent monetization levels seen in the previous quarter. These strong results occurred despite revenues being negatively impacted by continuous rises of interest rates in Brazil, which compress spreads on our financing businesses that are reported net of funding costs.
During the quarter, we were able to partially offset this impact by implementing initiatives that diversify funding sources and through pricing. For the third quarter, gross profit was almost $807 million at a margin of 43.4%, very similar to the 43% margin in Q3 2020 and to the average of the first half of the year. We face some bottom-line headwinds as we expand our first-party business and incur more operational costs while expanding our own logistics network, but these effects are partially offset by cost reductions on our payment collection fees and leveraging our customer service costs as we reach scale. As we do every quarter, we've included a detailed breakdown of these margin effects in the slides accompanying this presentation, as well as the OPEX margin evolution.
Regarding our operating expenses, which represented 34.8% of revenues, we see sustained operating leverage from the scale and efficiencies over the last year and an improvement of 80 basis points on a year-over-year comparison. Operating expenses were $646 million, with higher bad debt expenses as we grow our credit book that are offset by efficiencies in other marketing initiatives and G&A expenses.
Consequently, we booked $160 million in EBIT in the third quarter, at a margin of 8.6%. It's important to note that at this quarter, our Argentine subsidiary's eligibility under the knowledge-based economy promotional regime was approved, which we have described further in our 10-Q filing. The tax benefits granted under the promotional regime are retroactive to January 2020 and will also apply to our future results. We have recognized this retroactive effect in full in our Q3 financial results.
In terms of net income, in Q3, we reached over $95 million at a margin of 5.1%, including these one-off impacts. On an adjusted basis, correcting for savings that are non-recurring in nature, net income margin would have been closer to 2% for the quarter.
Before my final comments, one announcement I'd like to make on our leadership structure. We'd like to share the news that after 22 years working with us, Stelleo Tolda has decided to leave his full-time role as President, Commerce Business, effective on April 1 of next year. Stelleo has been a key executive at Mercado Libre from the beginning of our journey, having had multiple roles during these years. Words really fail to describe the impact that Stelleo has had during this time. We are all incredibly lucky and grateful to have been able to count on him over the years. Fortunately, Stelleo will remain closely linked to Mercado Libre as a formal advisor to the company and its Board of Directors, allowing us to continue to benefit from his continued advice in the future.
As we previously stipulated in our company's executive succession planning process, we are also very pleased to announce that Ariel Szarfsztejn will take on the role of Executive Vice President, Commerce. Many of you already know Ari from his time leading our Strategy and Corporate Development teams, and more recently, he has been the driving force behind the build out of our logistics network -- a key differentiating aspect of our business today. Ariel has been working closely with Stelleo for the past few years and will continue to do so in the future.
This is a bittersweet feeling that I have making the announcement. But on behalf of everyone at Mercado Libre, we will miss having Stelleo involved in day-to-day operations and are at the same time pleased we can transition this leadership position through an in-house process, highlighting the depth of internal talent we have at the organization. We are all very confident that under Ariel's leadership, our commerce operations will continue to thrive.
In closing, I'd like to reiterate that our mission to democratize commerce and financial services in Latin America remains at the forefront of our minds, even as we begin to see positive indications that we are exiting the gravest part of the pandemic throughout the region. We continue to include and care for the communities around us through the expansion of our business.
We had another quarter of consistent, robust results and in parallel, we continue to plant seeds for our next growth avenues across the business and geographies where we are present. We are excited about the opportunities we have in front of us that will allow us to both build upon our current accomplishments and further innovate as we focus on our long-term growth strategy.
And finally, I'd like to mention that we have 27,000 employees that are making all these achievements possible along with our increasingly connected network of partners. I'm grateful to see the consistent level of execution and coordination within this ever-growing group of talents. And I am also very proud that despite the hard work we demand of them, they continue to rank us highly as an employer, having ranked us among the Top 25 Best Employers Globally according to Great Place to Work.
Thanks everyone for joining us on the quarterly conference call to follow our progress and as always we are now happy to take your questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bob Ford with Bank of America. Please, go ahead. Thanks very much. Congratulations on the quarter and thank you for taking my question. Pedro, how big is your exposure to PACS? Or how much did it impact payments in the quarter, if at all? Or I guess, how is it impacting payments day-to-day and how are you solving for that? And are chip shortages resulting in any scarcity of replacement MPOS units? And just with respect to supply chain issues as well, are you seeing any impact on platform inventory going into year-end? Thank you very much. Hi, Bob, this is Osvaldo. So, with regard to PAC, one of our five suppliers for POS and so far, we have not found anything to be concerned about the POS that we sell or the smart devices we sell. So we continue to work with them normally. And then with regard to chip shortages, I'd say, so far, we have been able to continue selling all of our devices. We do have some concerns around smart POSs, there is some shortage there. But our expectation is that we will sell less devices than we will be able to sell it, There was no shortage, but at that point, we would not be able to continue selling devices. So I'll say that will be our concern. On inventory, Bob, I think the global reality is well-known to everyone. What we've done on our end is we've started working with our merchants and the 1P business also additionally allows us to try to identify inventory gaps and try to step in as merchants to record ourselves. And we started working with them towards the holiday season a lot earlier than we ever have before -- I would say, at the beginning of this quarter. So, the situation is the one well-known to everyone. What has been under our control, we've tried to front-load a lot of the preparation inventory step in with 1P and we like the amount of selection and the depths of selection we have for the upcoming shopping season, given the overall reality. That's very helpful. Thank you very much. Our next question comes from Richard Cathcart with Bradesco. Your line is open. Hi there. Thanks very much for taking my question. Just one on the Digital Account TPV that you've disclosed for the first time here, but I think that's pretty aligned with the Wallet TPV previously. For the last few quarters, it's been running between $3 billion [ph] and $3.5 billion this quarter -- a big jump to $5.5 billion. So, perhaps you could just give us a little bit more information about what the driver of that big jump quarter-on-quarter? Thanks. Richard, we started to disclose the Digital Account TPV. It is similar to what we were disclosing in the past, but it has to [indiscernible]. First, it includes all of the Wallet payments but not QR code payments. QR code payments we are disclosing on the acquiring side of the equation. So, we did for acquiring. And then what we are adding is card transactions. So, TPV was $5.5 billion, as you said and it's growing, butt over 100% year-on-year in local currencies. Does that answer your question, Richard. Yes. Thanks very much. Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Okay. Thank you so much. So Pedro, I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks an increasing percentage of items on free shipping. I just wanted to see if I can get some clarification on that comment. Do you mean that there's just a greater number of SKUs on a site which qualify for free shipping or that you're underwriting, I guess, a greater amount of free shipping subsidies? And just taking a step back a little bit, as you look at the all-in cost to the consumer relative to some of your competitors who offer all-you-can-eat shipping. Do you think your offering is efficient to effectively disincentivize users from signing up for that upfront monthly or annual subscription fee? Thanks. Great, Stephen. So first of all, I think the remarks point to the fact that the volume of purchases made on MELI without the consumer having to pay for shipping hit an all-time high of over 70% of all volume. And when we look at items that can be shipped through Mercado and Vios [ph], that number is almost 80%. So, we actually view that as probably the most widespread free shipping program available without the need for the consumer to pay a subscription. We now also offer a paid subscription for consumers that potentially are looking for even more free shipping than that. But our understanding still is that for our markets, with consumers with potentially less disposable income, the fact that nearly 70-plus percent of volume is done on free shipping without any subscription cost, is actually a tremendous value proposition to users. Got you. Crystal clear. Thank you. Our next question comes from Marcelo Santos with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Hi, thank you for taking my questions. I have two. The first is the reacceleration of active payer additions. I know you're focusing more on fintech users now, but the metric you used to have with the active players. And there was a big jump this quarter. So could you just talk a bit of what's happening [ph]? What have you done to -- for that to happen or comment on the market? And the second question is regarding the potential impact of new regulations in Brazil regarding prepaid cards. Is that a negative to you? Or could that be a positive because you spend less? How could we frame that? Hi, Marcelo, let me start with the second question. You gave us asked that. And with regards to the potential change in regulation but as you know, what's happened is, the Brazilian Central Bank is analyzing putting a cap on interchange fees for prepaid cards. We do issue prepaid cards and this could have an impact. There are two different items that they're talking about. On the one hand, this cap that could reduce the interchange we collect for those transactions. And then the second effect they're considering is shortening the payment period from 26 days to 2 days, we already pay most of the bad majority of the contacts at 2 days because those are off-line transactions all transactions will pay later. So that would not have an impact in working capital. It would have, yes, an impact on the financial side. But on the other hand, as an acquirer and as a process of transactions, we will be paid earlier and will pay a lower merchant discount rate or interchange depending if we are an aggregator or where you see our own gateway for those transactions. So I think those effects will be of similar magnitude. So at this point, the calculations that don't make us concerned. We believe that those things will be of similar impact and the total effect will not be material. That's our expectation. On wallet, first of all, I think, as you pointed out in the question, we do increasingly encourage you to look at the active fintech users of nearly $32 million. It's a better metric to understand users across our entire financial service offering. But having said that, you're accurate in that there was an acceleration in wallet payers, and it's actually driven across the different use cases. We see a pickup again in QR payments from wallet, in part driven by gradual reopenings as consumers are able to use the wallets in physical stores increasingly. But also as gradually our wallet becomes better distributed, we also see a nice pickup in peer-to-peer transfers within the wallet and also growth in utilities and cell phones. So I think it's a gradual acceleration with core underlying metrics that are strong on the wallet which is great news, but also the number of overall fintech users is about twice that large. And one more thing. We are seeing increased engagement more transactions per user. Perfect. Thank you very much. Our next question is from Andrew Ruben with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Hi, great thanks very much for the question. My questions relate a bit to the macro backdrop specifically in Brazil. First, on consumer credit, can you talk through what gives you comfort in continuing the high levels of growth of the consumer credit book mid a backdrop that appears to be coming a bit more difficult? And then related with interest rates in your spread-based businesses, could you provide a bit more color on how you think about the ability to ultimately pass through higher pricing? Thank you. Hi Andrew, with regards to consumer credit, we have had a very good quarter, I think for all of the credit products. I think our credit products, all three of them have been profitable in all three markets. So in the nine different markets we're in, we were able to have good profitability. We have also been able to significantly increase not only the portfolio but the number of loans outstanding and the number of offers outstanding. There is 6 million people with offers for credit during the quarter. So far, we are very optimistic with how the product is evolving. Sorry, Andrew, on Brazilian interest rates, we are a company that will strive to not have to pass on increased fee structures to consumers where possible. So the first steps we're taking is how do we try to improve our funding costs. And in that sense, the financial institution license that we've been granted in Brazil has been instrumental because it does really give us access to cheaper funding sources from that financial institution. So I think the idea is, first and foremost, to try to improve cost structure and to avoid as much as possible, passing on increased fees on the marketplace to merchants. We might have to around the edges on certain types of credit passed on some of that cost. But again, we will do whatever we can to avoid the impact of passing that on to consumers, while at the same time, trying to manage our bottom line goals. Very helpful. Thank you guys. Our next question comes from Irma Sgarz with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Yes, maybe just piggybacking on the last question, if you could expand a little bit on the funding strategy for Creditor, how you see that evolve from here? I think Oswald already commented on that earlier this year, but I was just curious that given that Kaleido's been growing even faster than expected, how you see sort of off balance sheet versus on evolving in the different sources that you're using and maybe how you see it evolving into 2022. And yes, thank you for disclosing the fintech users. It's very helpful. I was curious not sure if I'm thinking about this the right way. But if you could talk about the intersection that you have between the 31.6 million fintech active fintech uses and the overall Meliusers -- or sorry, and the active buyers that you have, which I think were 37% or 38%. Sure, Irma. So on credits, I think we continue to execute on the plan we've had all along. We've signed incremental deals with some of our banking partners in different markets for the SPVs. The Fujiki that we use to fund that. We're on track to exit the year within our objectives of having almost half of the credits already coming from third-party funding. And going forward, given the immense potential in the credit book. And you can see the Q-on-Q and year-on-year growth in the size of the credit book, it's phenomenal. We will continue to open outside windows for funding. Additionally, and tying into the previous answer, the financial institution in Brazil also allows us to issue Letras Financieras, Stebe and whatnot, which are also very, very efficient way to fund the credit book as it continues to grow. So I think things are evolving positively in terms of overall cost, which is helping spreads, and we will continue to work to make sure that we have multiple windows available to continue to fund the credit book also off of our own balance sheet. In terms of the user metrics, I think what we're trying to do there is to give you metrics that do not have too much overlap.
So marketplace Pago users, users who use Pago to purchase on the marketplace, we are not including in that unique fintech active user base. So you can add them both to get to an overall sense of actual total payers that have engaged with Mercado Pago either on the marketplace or off the marketplace, which then becomes a sizable number of, I think, something close to probably $70 million. Probably one other thing that we are not included in the metric we are including the metric, as we mentioned, those who are paying with either the wallet or payment of land in app or in-store tons as we draw consumer merchant credit the car users, fintech sellers and fintech active products such as asset management. What we are not included in the metrics is people who are paying at the POS we own or people who are paying the checkout as a guest and not logging into their credentials tearful. So the number -- the total number of players from Macao Par would be higher, and we're not including those. Thank you. Our next question comes from Deepak Mathivanan with Wolfe Research. Frank on for Deepak here. So I wanted to start, can we talk a little bit about fulfillment in Brazil? You talked about new fulfillment centers, but we're curious where we're at with regard to the ideal model. Looking for what kind of areas you have to build out and how we should think about some of the monetization plans from sellers? And then beyond that, can you talk a little bit about your expectations for investment levels in the holiday season, both on the -- in regards to stepping up spend on marketing or other customer acquisition programs and then as you mentioned before about kind of looking to work with vendors ahead of any supply chain issues, what kind of incremental investments that could incur? Great. So, the more we see the power of our logistics network in terms of fast, reliable and ideally free shipping. I think the more conviction we have to continue to build out the multiple nodes within the shipping network and to build those closer and closer to the consumer. So I think we will continue to build out more fulfillment centers, also fulfillment centers to be able to accommodate for a growing type of inventory. We've added bulky fulfillment center inventories. At some point, we will continue to grow and expand our supermarket and fresh offering. And I think equally important in terms of the long-term stickiness and loyalty of our users, we are now beginning to roll out our logistics network in some of the MDM countries that ideally will ignite significant growth there. We've already begun to see that in Chile, and hopefully, Colombia will follow suit as well as continuing to build out the logistics network in Mexico, Brazil and Argentina. So I think, again, we are building out what we think is one of the best-in-class networks in the region, and we will continue to grow the nodes on that network.
In terms of Q4, as you know, we like to not give too much forward-looking comment. In general, it is a quarter where marketing spend and customer acquisition increases. We then see those users retained, and we can benefit from them in the upcoming year. Typically, overall shipping costs as merchants send more inventory to our fulfillment centers at times also increases. And so from a margin perspective, it typically is a weaker quarter. And then in terms of incremental cost in working with merchants, I don't see that there's any material cost aspect there. I think the way we've tried to manage around that has been to work with the merchants from a lot earlier on to try to plan and secure inventory. And then, yes, it's very likely that we will step in with more of our 1P business in the fourth quarter and the 1P business at the scale it's at now, which is phenomenal improvement if you look at year-over-year and how fast that business has grown. But at this scale, from a margin perspective, it still is detrimental to margins versus a 3P sale. And so as mix naturally tends a little bit more towards 1P in the fourth quarter that also typically delivers a structurally weaker margin during that quarter. Thanks so much, Pedro. Congrats on the quarter. Our next question comes from Jamie Friedman with Susquihana. Your line is open. Thanks, Pedro, Osvaldo. When you said before on the credit product, you had $36 million approvals up from 27%. Is that -- does that mean they've been approved and drawn or just approved? James. When I mentioned, we had 36 million approvals. Those are the number of users to which we approved a credit line. Of those 6 million using it or use it during the quarter. So what I mean is we have been able to -- and this number was, if I'm not wrong, 27 million the prior quarter. So we increased by 9 million, the number of people with the credit offering just in the last quarter. So we are very excited by that. And also very excited about how we have grown our portfolio. We have grown our portfolio ForEx in the last year. Okay. And then and then just a more general question. I appreciate the changing characterization of the fintech and the unique fintech active users, that's really helpful. When you said at the beginning Petroabout ecosystems of merchant and individual in your go-to-market. Could you elaborate on that what's that -- What's that about? Like why are you decomposing merchant and individual on the fintech side? Sure. So I think as a product and technology company that we are, we place a lot of focus on the quality of the products and the user experience. What -- as we've grown out the portfolio of payments products, what that was leading to was a less cohesive go-to-market and sales strategy because we had a lot of product focus. As we try to shift to dividing merchant and individuals within how we view the market, the idea is to be able to think from the consumer backwards and to be able to more effectively and efficiently cross-sell the entire product within the Mercado Libre universe, which could also include marketplace and content offerings that we have based on the consumer segment and less so on the individual products. Got it. That makes sense. Our next question is from Marvin Fong with BTIG. Your line is open. Great. Thank you for taking my question. Just two for me. Just one on fintech. It looks like the take rate might have compressed a little. So was that due to the spread compression that you were alluding to Pedro. And if so, could you maybe talk about with a little more granularity, which revenue line might be more impacted than others? And then second question, just on the third quarter, it looks like it was a bit of a bit of an improvement in the COVID conditions towards the back half of the quarter in Brazil and Mexico. Just curious if you could comment on how that might have affected your GMV trends throughout the quarter. Sure. So just on the fintech take rate, you're absolutely right. What we see is we see continued improvements driven by credit revenues, about 10 incremental basis points Q-on-Q. But then with the increase in financing costs and my previous comment that we're trying to not have to pass all of that on to consumers, we saw about 20 basis points of contraction on take rates because of the higher cost in financing. So that's kind of how the key drivers play out on that. And then, with regard to [indiscernible]. As you mentioned, I'd say there has been more of a normalization of commerce during the last quarter with increased fascination rates and lower contagious rate -- And so what we have seen is probably a reacceleration in the use of QR code and increase in the use of POSs and probably comparisons for online payments and the marketplace itself suffered a little bit because a year ago was -- we were right in the middle of the big boom driven in part by lockdowns and in part by Oilergenial and government payments. So stats were probably tougher this quarter than the prior one. Just one thing here. Osvaldo is correcting me, retroactively, accurately correcting me. So on the unique user metric, what I meant to say is when we measure the unique metric user, that the number of users that we report as fintech users does not include payments on the marketplace. Now if one of those users also use the marketplace, he could appear on the marketplace metric if we are to disclose that. So we're not deduplicating the users. My intention was to say that those nearly 32 million users are users that only fall into that bucket because of fintech usage. So that was regarding to Ermos question That's it for me. Thank you. Our next question comes from Jen Thompson with Autonomous. I think you mentioned earlier that fulfillment as a percentage of total deliveries was at 30% in all markets. I know that Mexico typically leads that in Brazil somewhere in the middle. Do you have the breakdown by country, again, like you've given on previous calls by chance. Yes, I think what we've disclosed this time around is the overall level. I think your assumptions are fairly right, but we didn't give out any of the country-by-country fulfillment levels. Fulfillment continues to trend in the right direction. And hence, that's also tied to my comment on the continued conviction behind investing in more warehouses as more and more inventory comes in. I think what we didn't answer there was the monetization part of that question. We will introduce gradually and cautiously, but we will introduce incremental monetization to sellers using our fulfillment services because we feel that there's significant value add to these users. And the level of penetration and the feedback we're getting from our merchants allows us to start sometime next year, introducing monetization on items that are stored in our fulfillment centers. And part of that is that we continue to see good traction and adoption of our fulfillment offering. Perfect. I actually grabbed this up, and I see it on slides up and now, so I should not ask with my lips, I should ask my eyes, I guess, next time. Sorry about that. Okay. Next question is from Caio Prato with UBS. Your line is open. Thank you for the opportunity for asking question. So my question is more related to the quality business. So I just would like to have a sense for you, which is the line that's gaining more traction looking to the consumer side, if this is a preacute product or if this is by an operator offering? And if you could share the penetration level of the bowel projects in each geography in the third quarter as well. Thank you. The consumer side of our credit business, we have two main products. The first one is how similar to pay later. What we offer is purchasing loans. These are loans where people pay in installments, typically between two installments and 12 installments, and we usually charge an interest for those. Only in Mexico, we have started offering the first 30 days for free. So if you want to pay 30 days later, you're going to do it for free. But it's basically by opalater loan where we charge interest given the iterate conditions in Latin America. And to that, we have recently added personal loans, which is money with deposit into the wallet in the colo or valent and users are free either to use it anywhere or to withdraw it to their bank account or through an ATM. So those are the two products we are very excited with the growth of the second one, but we are not at this stage disclosing specific percentages or country details. On top of those two consumer products, the third one is a credit card, we launched a credit card a couple of quarters ago, and we are excited with the initial growth. And sir, I'm not showing any further questions in the queue. Great. So thank you, everyone, for listening in. We look forward to giving you a full year and a wrap-up of Q4 when we announced those numbers. Until then, happy holidays to everyone at Mercado Libre, we will diligently be working through the holiday season to make sure everyone's parcels arrive in time and almost certainly with free shipping. Thank you. Thank you. And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.","all participants are in a listen-only mode after the speakers' presentation .

Hello everyone, and welcome to the Mercado Libre earnings conference call for the quarter ended December 31, 2021. I am Lissa Schreurs, Investor Relations Officer for Mercado Libre. Our Chief Financial Officer, Pedro Arnt, will be leading today’s prepared remarks. Joining him on the line is Chief Executive Officer of Mercado Pago, Osvaldo Giménez, who will be available during today’s Q&A session. I remind you that management may make forward-looking statements relating to such matters as continued growth prospects for the company, industry trends, and product and technology initiatives. These statements are based on currently available information and our current assumptions, expectations, and projections about future events. While we believe that our assumptions, expectations and projections are reasonable in view of the currently available information, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from those included in this conference call, for a variety of reasons, including those described in the forward-looking statements and risk factor sections of our upcoming Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, and any of MercadoLibre Inc.’s other applicable filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on our investor relations website. I will now turn the call over to Pedro. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining our earnings announcements this past quarter and the full year 2021. Before we delve into our Q4 performance and financial results, I'd like to begin by sharing some reflections on fiscal year 2021. Last year presented us with challenges, and with those also came many more opportunities. With our teams’ resilience and focus on delivering on our strategic objectives, we've been able to overcome shifting pandemic lockdown measures, rising inflationary cost pressures and a highly competitive environment in the digital commerce space. The final outcome was a year with record results across the board, sustained strong growth in key business metrics and top-line, and improving margins and operating income for a second consecutive year. In commerce, we had another very strong year, reaching $28.4 billion in gross merchandise volume, a full-year growth of over 48% in GMV on an FX-neutral basis. This represents an additional $7.4 billion over 2020’s GMV, positioning us well-ahead of our competitors in market share in the region for yet another year. More importantly, we saw a sustained shift in consumer behavior on our platform. Customer loyalty and retention are improving consistently and our clients are buying more with us. On average items per buyer were up by 17% on a year-over-year basis, growing over a strong 2020 baseline. Even with the reopening of physical stores, customers in Latin America have embraced shopping online, paving the way for further long-term growth in our region. We attribute this growing engagement and improving cohort behavior to our free shipping program that already delivers over 80% of GMV on our network at no cost to our buyers, continuous improvements in delivery speed, a robust buyer protection program and customer service, an enhanced loyalty program, and our increasingly wide assortment of products sold on our marketplace as we push into new categories. All this, in turn, has resulted in more than two-thirds of our GMV coming from organic, non-paid traffic, mostly through our app, cementing our position as a pull rather than push business. On the fintech side, growth comes from both our established strength in the payments business and, increasingly, from our newer, consumer-facing financial services businesses. Total Unique Fintech Active Users topped 51 million annually, with transactions per unique fintech active user also increasing steadily throughout the year, as our product suite became more comprehensive. Originations on our credit book surpassed $3.8 billion this year, as we improved our credit underwriting capabilities. The Credits business has become a core piece of our ecosystem, enabling merchants to invest in more inventory and working capital, and consumers to finance their consumption needs in all of their touchpoints with our platforms. We also distributed over 1 million insurance policies during the year, and began rapidly expanding the portfolio of savings and investments products available to our users towards the latter half of the year with the launch of our crypto wallet in Brazil. Our payments business delivered consistent growth in 2021. Total Payment Volume reached $77.4 billion for the full year, growing 78% on an FX-neutral basis. Considering just the off-platform Total Payment Volume, we reached over $48 billion, an FX-neutral growth of 97% year-over-year. We continue to onboard more merchants into our ecosystem, doubling the number of off-platform merchants year-over-year, reaching over 20 million unique payment collectors in 2021. We sold over 4.7 million mobile point-of-sale devices this year, and are expanding greatly in Brazil and Argentina, while making important strides in Mexico, and we also launched the MPOS business in Chile at year's end. Regarding our financial model, we are increasingly focused on efficiencies and operational leverage across our expenses and cost bases, while continuing to invest appropriately in our long-term growth to maintain our competitive leadership. Our desired outcome is to construct a financial model that can gain overall market share while growing our profits. During 2021, net revenues grew by 78% year-over-year, reaching $7.1 billion on a consolidated basis. The revenue expansion was coupled with margin expansion at the EBIT level, improving by 300 basis points year-over-year, reaching a 6.2% EBIT margin in 2021, up from 3.2% in 2020 and a 6. 7% loss in 2019. Our EBIT dollars reached $441 million in 2021, which translates to over $330 million in incremental EBIT dollars compared to 2020 and $594 million of incremental EBIT when compared to 2019. While there may be oscillations between quarters to accommodate for seasonality and product launches, we aim to deliver consistently growing profits over time on a full year basis. With that broad overview of the year, let's now jump into a deeper review of our fourth quarter results, starting off with the commerce business. During the fourth quarter, gross merchandise volume reached almost $8 billion, growing 32% on an FX-neutral basis despite challenging comps. Our two-year CAGR trend on an FX-neutral basis was relatively stable compared to the prior quarter, with a 71% growth in Q4 compared to 74% growth in the prior quarter of the year. Our unique buyer base continues to grow year-over-year and sequentially, with 40.5 million unique buyers on our marketplace during the fourth quarter. Not only are we expanding our user base, but we are also increasing the number of purchases per unique buyer. In Q4, items per buyer grew by 14% year-over-year and they are now over 50% higher than they were during pre-pandemic times. The higher engagement levels throughout the year were sustained across all of our key geographies. The improvements in buyer experience are also linked to our relationship with sellers on the platform as we continue to increase assortment and improve the quality of our merchant base. We had close to 300 million live listings in Q4, and our seller base is diverse. Sales from official stores represented over 23% of GMV during the fourth quarter, and the remainder comes from an array of mid and long-tail sellers. For the promotional season, we also ramped up our first-party assortment, reaching almost 5% of our total gross merchandise volume during the quarter. During this promotional season, we also saw improvements in our logistics network. During the fourth quarter, we shipped over 275 million items, while decreasing our average delivery times and simultaneously lowering average shipping costs per order. Almost 90% of all our volumes were delivered through our managed logistics network compared to 77% in the fourth quarter of 2020. The evolution of efficiencies and delivery times has also been significant. For the fourth quarter, almost 80% of the volume was delivered within 48 hours and close to 60% of the volume was delivered within the same or next day when the purchase was made. Particularly for the items within our fulfillment centers, average delivery times are less than 24 hours. Volumes in fulfillment increased sequentially in Brazil, Mexico, Chile and Colombia this quarter. We are now able to handle heavy and bulky items within our fulfillment network, unlocking our potential to execute better service levels in consumer electronic categories like home appliances and white goods. These continuous improvements in productivity of our fulfillment centers have enabled us to deliver cost efficiencies throughout the peak shopping season compared to last year. And therefore, we are encouraged to keep scaling our warehousing operations. Moreover, we continue to invest in additional capabilities and efficiencies in our cross-docking network. MELI Places, our network of pickup and drop-off points, have been leveraged to provide more services to our customers. 90% of our places are enabled now for both package pickup and drop-off. And we have already started using the technology rollout to receive returns from buyers in these MELI Places. MELI Places’ network spans Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Chile and Colombia already. The reliability of our shipping solution has thus become a key driver behind our Net Promoter Scores and we continue to believe that shipping is a key lever to drive higher e-commerce penetration throughout Latin America. As a result, we remain committed to continuing to decrease delivery times and offering a wide variety of services to a larger range of customers across the entire region. Let's now turn to the fintech business, starting with a review of our credit portfolio performance. We are very pleased to see that our credit book continues to grow as we expand our credit offering to a broader group of users without signs of behavior shifts in loan default rates. We closed the fourth quarter with a credit book of almost $1.7 billion after having originated close to $1.5 billion during the quarter. Over 65% of these originations were consumer credit loans. In consumer credits, we saw for the second consecutive quarter, originations in the Mercado app outpacing originations from the marketplace app, especially driven by personal loans offered through that Mercado Pago app. We finished the quarter with 7.4 million consumers with an active loan, and we have been consistently growing the base of prescored users with an active credit offer. This growth is driven by the strong combination of more user data from interactions with our ecosystem being fed directly into our risk and pricing models and continuous improvements in our technology models. Looking into the future, we are excited about the role the credit business plays in our entire ecosystem. Growth will remain spurred on by increasing the knowledge we have of merchants and consumers and our continued access to several proprietary distribution channels to offer credit. We have developed an attractive and resilient business model that allows us to grow sustainably and adapt quickly when uncertain circumstances arise. We have been managing the default risk levels in our credit book very closely and observed sequential improvements in nonperforming loans during the fourth quarter. Total nonperforming loans as a percentage of the outstanding portfolio have improved from 28% in the third quarter to 24%. And the allowance for uncollectibles has also reduced relative to the size of the portfolio sequentially. Our earnings strategy has also evolved as the portfolio has matured over time, having ended 2020 with 20% of the portfolio being funded through external securitization, while now having closed 2021 with 45% of the portfolio through external securitization. Our financial services offerings beyond credit are also showing important growth. We reached 34.5 million unique active fintech during the fourth quarter. Growing 23% versus the previous year, and the new product launches are boosting engagement levels for these users. We had 22.3 million investment accounts in Q4, an additional 7.4 million compared to the same period in 2020. Users have also increased payment transactions for utilities and peer-to-peer transfers using the wallet in most of our key geographies. Digital Account Total Payment Volume, which includes these wallet payments as well as card payments, reached $7.1 billion, growing 138% during the fourth quarter on an FX-neutral basis. Within insurtech, we launched the distribution of insurance for card and PIX payments in Brazil, expanding on our insurance product offering. Our goal is to keep adding to these services such that the digital account becomes a more integrated offering, making it a seamless experience for individuals to concentrate their financial lives with us. Among the most recent launches is the trading function for cryptocurrencies. Within the digital account, all users in Brazil can now buy, hold and sell Bitcoin, Ethereum and the USDP stable coin. Our cryptocurrency custodian partner will provide the blockchain infrastructure platform, while we act as the distribution channel and user interface. Consistent with our other products, the crypto trading interface is very user-friendly, simple to navigate, secure and inclusive, with a minimum investment value of only BRL1. It is still early on in our crypto journey, but we are encouraged with the uptake we are seeing in the number of Brazilian users transacting with crypto in our wallet. Finally, I would like to go over some of the highlights for our payments processing and acquiring business. Acquiring TPV grew 51% in the fourth quarter on an FX-neutral basis, reaching $17.2 billion. On-platform and off-platform online merchants accelerated payment volume growth in the fourth quarter, surpassing 32% and 54% year-over-year growth, respectively on an FX-neutral basis. The off-platform online payments are particularly improving in Brazil and Argentina, where we are adding new merchants to our base. In Brazil, the addition of PIX as a payment checkout option online is also gaining traction. Our offline payment solutions with the QR network and MPoS devices are growing steadily and the cross-sell opportunity for payment services is starting to come to fruition. The QR network continued to post triple-digit growth rates for TPV in Argentina, where we have our most mature QR network. And we are happy to see that we have been able to accelerate our expansion of the QR merchant base in Brazil and Mexico in the last few quarters. In Brazil, new active QR merchants are soaring as we leverage the PIX rails to introduce the QR network to long tail sellers. Furthermore, within SMBs, we have stepped up our go-to-market strategy and improved our capacity to convert MPoS device merchants to also use QR, and vice-versa. We also achieved some exciting milestones in the MPoS business in the fourth quarter, which grew 69% in TPV on an FX-neutral basis. We sold over 1.3 million devices across our core markets, a record sales mark for us. In addition, we made an important acquisition in the Chilean market by adding Redelcom, a payment service provider, to our ecosystem, allowing us to accelerate our expansion of financial services for local SMBs and micro-merchants in Chile. We are encouraged by the initial growth potential that we have seen as we ramp up our payment services in these new markets and transition SMBs into digital financial solutions. With that, let’s review the financial results for the quarter. In terms of net revenues, we delivered a record $2.1 billion on a consolidated basis; a growth rate of 61% in US dollars and of 74% on an FX-neutral basis for the fourth quarter of 2021. Strong revenue growth, on top of a record in absolute dollars, was achieved despite headwinds in fintech monetization. Our fintech take rates over the total payment volume have been pressured by increases in interest rates, mainly in Brazil. This spread compression effect on take rate is about 10 basis points year-over-year. We recently announced a new pricing structure for our financing fees, starting in 2022, to contemplate new interest rate levels and begin offsetting these pressured financing revenues and the subsequent impact to profitability. On the other hand, we had a strong year-over-year improvement in take rates over gross merchandise volume in the commerce business, as well as a higher penetration of first-party sales, both of which are boosting our commerce revenues across all key geographies. Even more relevant than these two offsetting monetization trends, is the increasingly positive impact on take rate coming from the Credit business. Credit revenues reached almost $300 million during the fourth quarter alone, triple the value of the previous year. During the fourth quarter, our gross profit reached $853 million at a margin of 40%, a 320-basis point improvement compared to the 36.8% in Q4 of 2020. Our shipping operations were more efficient this quarter compared to last year, and we were able to further scale other costs associated with customer service, fraud prevention and collection fees for processing payments. Consolidated operating expenses represented 39% of revenues this quarter, similar to the 38.7% in the fourth quarter in 2020, albeit with a different mix, and more importantly, with solid operational leverage across key expenses. General and Administrative expenses were $148 million, or 6.9% of revenues, down from 8.7% in the fourth quarter of 2020. Product Development expenses were almost $180 million, or 8.4% of revenues compared to 8.8% last year. We have scaled across our investments in product development, even while onboarding 4000 additional software developers and data engineers to our employee base this year. Within Sales and Marketing, the 23.6% spending as a percentage of revenues, which is up from 21.3% last year is explained by increasing bad debt allowance. Our Credit book’s bad debt provisions, which are booked under Sales and Marketing expenses, have increased compared to the fourth quarter of last year due to our expanding Credit origination. While this does add pressure to an otherwise scaling expense line, the incremental revenues from the Credit business more than offset the bad debt charges when looking at impact on dollar earnings. Other Sales and Marketing investments in marketing activities such as branding, customer acquisition, buyer protection program and other incentives and sales initiatives are showing operational leverage of 170 basis points as a percentage of total revenues when compared to same quarter in 2020. Consequently, our fourth quarter EBIT was $23.3 million, at a margin of 1.1%, an improvement compared to the negative 1.9% EBIT margin loss we had in Q4 of last year. During the fourth quarter, our interest income was positively impacted by the higher interest rates, reaching $53 million and more than doubling compared to last year. Similarly, interest expenses were $54 million, offsetting the capital gains from interest income. We also had a foreign exchange loss of almost $57 million in the quarter, mainly due to the difference of the Argentine official exchange rate and the blue chip swap rate at which we effectively repatriate retained earnings from the Argentine subsidiary. The resulting net loss after income tax in the quarter was $46 million, a negative 2.2% margin over revenues which is an improvement compared to last year's negative 3.8% net income margin. As I noted previously, we are closing 2021 with several important achievements in terms of growth and our ability to deliver consistent improvements at the EBIT margin level for the full year marks our long-term commitment towards growth with sustained operating leverage and increasing earnings. To conclude this section, I'd like to reiterate that there remains a huge runway of opportunities ahead of us. Even after the significant uptake in digital services we experienced over the last couple of years, e-commerce penetration in our region is still only at around the 10% range. In the same light, even with all of the recent advances in the financial technology space in Latin America, we still live in a context where most people have difficulty accessing credit, savings and insurance products and controlling their finances. This emboldens us to remain committed to our mission to democratize access to commerce and financial services throughout the region. There is still a lot to build and we trust that our continuous investments in technology and human capital will be determined factors in our future success. I'm also happy to announce that we are releasing our annual impact report simultaneous with our 10-K, allowing us to communicate with shareholders, both our financial and nonfinancial objectives and performance. We believe this allows for a more cohesive understanding of our value-creation capacity and its impact over time. We are also publishing our first sustainability bond report in connection with the 2026 sustainability notes issued a year ago, with 15.5% of proceeds already having been allocated this past year. Finally, we can now share an in-depth analysis of climate-related risk factors following the framework of the task force on climate-related financial disclosures that we conducted during 2021, and we will be deep diving into in coming years. We are proud of this integrated approach and are committed to improving upon it year-on-year and encourage you to review the material to get a clear understanding of our sustainability programs and their impact. Thanks, everyone, again, for joining us today to review these results and we're happy to take your questions and to connect with you over the next few weeks. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Ruben with Morgan Stanley. Hi, thanks very much for the question. It was helpful to hear about the commitment towards growth with sustained operating leverage. I was curious if you could please zoom in a bit on how 2022 fits into this narrative, namely your incremental investment focus areas for the year. And conversely, any areas where you could see incremental expense leverage? Thank you. Hi, Andrew, as you know, we don't guide. I think conceptually, we will continue to invest behind the key areas that are a part of our strategy, logistics, category expansion, the rollout of our different fintech products, our credit business, which we are very encouraged by. And as we've said, I think growth and making sure we're investing behind these many growth opportunities that still have significant run rate is our number one priority. Having said that, given the size of the business and the operational leverage that is still inherent in the business model, we enter a phase where we think we can continue to invest, maintain our focus on share gains and sustaining our leadership and yet still deliver modest yet consistent increase in earnings over a multiyear cycle. So you shouldn't see any departure from what you've been seeing in terms of the area of focus. We're pleased with the portfolio of services we have. We think it's ample and many of these are in the early stages and have significant room to grow. And even the more mature businesses where we see really strong capabilities to sustain and potentially even increase our leadership. All very clear. Thank you. Our next question comes from Irma Sgarz with Goldman Sachs. Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. There was no direct mention of advertising revenues this quarter. I think there was maybe a comment about monetization. And I know it's still a small percentage of overall sales, but with a very strong organic traffic numbers, that you spoke to and the use engagement that you provided, it feels like 2022 could be a year where this is becoming overall more important. And I would imagine it's also accretive to the overall margin story that we're seeing play out. Could you just maybe talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of new developments on the advertising front? And what incremental maybe investments you're making? Yeah, Irma. So thanks. We continue to see a very, very significant opportunity in the advertising business. It's a high-margin business with gross margins above 70%. As we grow our first-party business and as we get into new product categories, such as consumables that have very large advertisers, we're seeing some really interesting work in combination with those advertisers, along with our 1P business, but also behind the marketplace. The advertising business as a percentage of GMV has crossed the 1% mark, which for us is the first big milestone in a multiyear trajectory that we think, could deliver multiple times that. And then we see really good progress so far in a fast growing, high margin business that's very, very synergistic with what we're doing on the marketplace. And also, we began to now integrate some advertising placements and advertising features into the payments app and some of our payments products as well. So we will report in the future when we think it makes sense, but it's yet another very encouraging business that is performing well and that we will continue to add engineering talent and innovate on because there's a lot of potential there. All right. Thank you. Our next question comes from Thiago Macruz with Itaú. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. You guys seem to be at the very beginning of our monetization trend of your e-commerce business. And I wonder if you could give us some feedback on the initial reaction of sellers to your first attempt to charge for your fulfillment services chiefly in Mexico, in Brazil? And if I may, on the credit side of the equation, we already see some NPL deterioration for banks exposed to lower-income clientele chiefly in Brazil. We're not seeing that for you guys. Is that a case to be made that your credit business in Brazil is more exposed to higher income clientele? Can you discuss that with us? Thank you. So starting with monetization on logistics. We haven't seen any negative impact of this. Our logistics network as it's consistently driven better delivery times, better conversions, therefore, for merchants, I think justifies initiating monetization. Having said that, I think it's still early, so let's keep tracking that and see how the monetization efforts progress throughout the year. So far so good. And if you look at the Mexican business, you'll see that Mexico delivered in the first quarter -- fourth quarter, one of its best direct contribution margins in this multiyear investment cycle we've been in, in Mexico. That's a consequence of many factors of that improving P&L as it continues to execute towards profitability. But one piece of that is the better overall economics on the logistics business, and charging is a piece within that. So, so far so good. With regards to credit, we have continued to see improvements in NPLs. Our clients, our users tend to be middle to lower income. So we are happy with how we have been improving our risk models and monitoring how much risk we think. Yes. I think just a quick conceptual complement there. At the end of the day, the reason that we think there is so much potential in the credit business, is directly linked to our ability to underwrite credit for segments of the population that historically have been very difficult to underwrite for either because of cost to serve or the actual underwriting capability. Again, we need to continue to monitor this. It's early stage. But everything we've seen so far makes us very encouraged in the capabilities we've built in-house to be able to serve that very large portion of the Latin American population that has historically been starved for credit. Fantastic, guys. Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Ford with Bank of America. Hey, Pedro, Osvaldo, Lissa. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on all the operating strides. In the presentation, there is a mention of the strong scale up in the credit card business. Can you put some numbers around that in terms of the Brazilian credit card base today, average credit limits, the take-up of those limits and bad debt trends in that product? And are those card balances reflected in the loan book numbers that you gave earlier, Pedro? Let me go from back to fourth, Bob. Yes, they are part of the books that we disclosed. Roughly, 17% of the credit on the balance sheet is from the very nascent credit card business. It's very early, Bob. We're scaling it well, hence the mention. As you know, MELI as a whole, is a phenomenal distribution platform. But let's wait a few more quarters. This is a very new product. It's in one country, and then we can begin to give more disclosure and visibility. So far, everything we've seen is a part of our enthusiasm with our ability to efficiently underwrite credit and serve credit. So, so far, so good. but that's one of the newest products within the credit portfolio. So again, another case of something that has enormous potential, but let's cautiously and diligently build that out and keep you guys posted on how it's performing. And we don't provide any numbers. Probably, the other thing I want to add is that, we are very excited with how people who have a credit card are showing increased engagements with our platforms and also increased Net Promoter Scores. And is it fair to say, Pedro, that you're starting off with relatively low limits and being very prudent in terms of the way you're moving forward? Because you really don't see this in the Pago kind of user numbers, whether it's unique users or frequency? That's correct. We're starting with low limits and we will increase them afterwards. Okay. And then my second question, I'll make this the last one, is if you could comment, please, on the Mexico City mass transit deal, right? I just wanted to confirm that it's exclusive as well as the reported transaction fee, which seemed a little bit high relative to what I would have expected. And I was just hoping -- or hoping to get a little bit of color around the service commitments that you're making? Are you required to make to win that that base of business? Yes, we are very excited with the transaction. And there are roughly 10 million daily passengers in Mexico City, and they will be able to top-up their cards using our app or even using our POSs, we believe it's a tremendous deal. The economics also are reasonable and it would be profitable, and it will allow us to significantly increase, we believe the number of active users in the city. And Pago its an exclusive contracts, right, two years, is that correct? Exclusive. That's correct, yes. Yes. Great. Thank you. The next question comes from Marcelo Santos with JPMorgan. Hello, thanks for taking my question. The first question is regarding the new pricing fintech that you mentioned starting 2022. How much do you think this could offset the increase in interest rates? And could you give a bit more detail on how this will impact different products that you have? This is the first question. And the second question is, more how PIX helping the QR code payments? I couldn't understand that very well. Thank you. Marcelo, with regards to PIX, what we are seeing is I think there are -- there's a different effect online and offline and then offline also a different effect in the long tail and with large merchants. Let's start with online. We are very excited with the with the PIX line because mostly, there was really no debit cards online in Brazil. And so this is, we believe, incremental volume, and we are seeing not only on MercadoLibre, but also on merchant services and it already represents double digits of the PPV we are seeing in merchant services. So we are very excited with PIX there. With regard to offline, I'd say, in the long tail, what we're seeing is, in some cases, it's the same merchants who have an MPoS device who are using PIX and in some cases, probably some merchants are switching and instead of using a POS device, they does rely on PIX. It's the usability is not great because in most cases, they are typing in either the mobile phone or the e-mail information to make a PIX transfer rather than scanning and QR code, but we are seeing that it's taking some traction. And furthermore, what PIX is allowing us is reaching out to large merchants. For example, we are working with Burger King over the CNA, and they are using Mercado Pago to collect PIX and this is a small portion of their revenues of land, because mostly its hard to cash, but we are excited with how it is growing and it is allowing to reach these merchants. Great. On the pricing piece, Marcelo, a couple of thoughts. So the first one, if you look at the presentation and you look at fintech take rates, you'll see that despite the compression because of interest rates, the growth of the credit business, the fact that we did adjust some prices in December on the parcelado spoon jurus [ph]. So the interest bearing purchases by consumers, we had already started to adjust pricing, offset a lot of the take rate compression. So I think we've been less hit than others. Second piece, as we rolled into 2020, we've also began to adjust prices on installment purchases on the parcelado sen jurus [ph] off marketplace. And, therefore, we are passing on a lot of the incremental interest rates to merchants who then can decide how much of that to eventually pass on to their consumers because it's the free installment product. We've done this also understanding what competitive movements have been -- and that's why we took our time and decided to not move too quickly in the fourth quarter, understanding that we had some interesting revenue streams that were allowing us to offset some of the compression. So going forward, I think that's what's happening, right? There's clearly an environment of higher interest rates, primarily in Brazil, we think that's probably here to stay for some time, and we've intelligently adjusted pricing. On the marketplace, where as we had said in the last earnings call, we were going to hold steady during the shopping season and absorb a lot of those incremental costs. And you will see that in some of the commerce take rate evolution Q-on-Q. As December has finished and we rolled into 2022, we've also began to adjust pricing on the marketplace. We've done it in a more, I would say, surgical way where it hasn't simply been raising prices. A lot of that has been a more intelligent installment engine that will allow different lengths of installments depending on product profile, requirement of credit on that product and conversion rates, but that allows us to offset some of the interest rate spread compression by offering less lengthy credit on products where that doesn't have such an impact on demand elasticity. So that should also be something that helps us offset the spread compressions from the rising interest rates on the commerce business throughout the year? Perfect, Pedro, Osvaldo. Thank you very much. Our next question comes from Kaio Prato with UBS Bank. Hi, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. So my question is related to Mercado credit solution. So we saw that the credit portfolio and revenues continues to increase steadily. While among this environment of higher policy rates, we have been seeing some announcements made by the company, as you mentioned during this call, such as higher prepayment rates for MPS business in Brazil. So having said that, my question is related to the level of interest rates that you are charging to consumers today, I would like to understand if you are increasing rates for new originations because of this environment of higher rates as well, or as we are starting to see better trend in terms of NPLs, we could start to see some interest rate normalization, both for consumers and measurements going forward? Great. So look, if you look at the aggregate numbers, the actual implied APRs in the consumer book in Brazil are down sequentially into the fourth quarter. Now you have to be careful because there are multiple products and multiple segments that we're expanding into. And so you really need to be able to look at this at a more segregated level, which we don't necessarily disclose. But all in all, I think what we're seeing is longer legacy cohorts, better understanding of older cohorts and also newer products with different risk profile and therefore, lower APRs. So it's not like we've simply adjusted APRs up across the board to reflect the changing macro environment. I think the complexity of the underwriting models and the overall diversity of the books has really been a big part of why we continue to be able to grow the business significantly and have seen an actual improvement in NPLs over the last few quarters. Okay. Thanks. Our next question comes from Marvin Fong with BTIG. Great. Thank you for taking my questions and congratulations on the quarter. Two questions, if I could. Just first, I guess, a high-level question. Just we're seeing several competitors with marketplaces acquire more and more local sellers, Brazil-based sellers in that country. Just wondering if you could comment on your strategy there? What is it about the MercadoLibre marketplace that will keep local sellers allocating their inventory to your fulfillment centers? Is it -- is it a matter of your speed of delivery and fulfillment capabilities, or is there some pricing component? Just your thoughts there would be great? And then a second question on lending. You mentioned how you're leveraging your proprietary platform. And I'm just curious if you could comment just how the launch of open banking is affecting that? Do you feel like open banking really isn't helping you expand the credit book and you're just going to primarily leverage your own data to make your credit decisions for both consumers and merchants? Thanks. Great. So, first of all, I think we continue to focus primarily on ourselves and what we can offer our merchant base and even more importantly, our consumer base. Merchants will probably trial and test multiple marketplaces. At the end of the day, the determinant factor is where consumers are buying and why consumers are opting for one platform over the other. When we look at the MercadoLibre value proposition for consumers, we are very confident that it is significantly improving from an already solid base. So the combination of widespread selection across a growing number of product categories that allow us to service more and more the overall needs of households. Our best-in-class probably, if you look at it regionally, logistics network that continues to lower cost and increase delivery speeds and amount of inventory delivered within 24 hours. The widest and most available free shipping program where over roughly 80% of volume is free shipping to the consumer. A loyalty program with expanding benefits, a very, very strong value proposition now in terms of content distribution of premium content. Subscriptions to the highest level of our loyalty program are growing very nicely, which shows that Latin American consumers as they see the offering and the loyalty program are increasingly willing to pay to reach that Level 6 even before their behavior on MELI gets them there for free. And then the overlay with all the fintech offerings. So our ability to extend credit in different formats, whether it's the MELI credit card now that gives you longer duration installments on the marketplace, if it's personal loans, if it's buy now, pay later type products, is also a strong advantage because the visibility we have to that consumer and the way we can score him more efficiently. So, going forward, I think we will continue to focus on these areas of competitive differentiation for our consumers. And we think that if we do that, we will be able to continue to grow the business, sustain our leadership position and continue to offer what we think is a very, very solid value proposition to our users. And again, merchants above else they value volume. If you look at pricing, I think we have a solid pricing for merchants that reflects the value we add to them. I think we've never been price followers. We've typically been price leaders, but the quality of the service and the volume that we offer, I think, allows us to charge what we charge without seeing significant churn to other merchants. So, at the end of the day -- sorry, to other platforms. Merchants will be multi-platform, we're not seeing churn and we're seeing a consistently better experience being delivered to our buyers. And we think that, that's what is the most relevant element in the competitive dynamic. Marvin, with regards to credits, I agree with you. Definitely, open banking is a significant upside. First of all, we believe there is a huge opportunity to expand credit throughout the region, and we are already doing that. And open bank will allow us to get more information from our users and also to initiate payment transactions actually, MercadoLibre is among the first institutions that have been issued a payment initiation transaction license, and we are already testing that product with a few users. Thank you so much. Thank you both and congratulations. Our next question comes from Trevor Young with Barclays. Great. Thanks. Two, if I may. First, you saw a nice reacceleration in unique wallet payers and the strongest net adds in quite some time. Can you help us understand what drove that reacceleration? Was it the crypto rollout or something else? And then second question, on the consumer credit side, could you comment on average loan size and delinquency rates for loans originated within marketplace app versus the Mercado Pago app? Is there any notable difference as you mix shift more originations to the Pogo app? Thanks. Hi Trevor, let me start with the first one regarding unique wallet payers. I think we have seen strong trends in all three countries. Particularly in Argentina, we have seen a reacceleration towards the end of last year. But also, we have seen strong numbers coming from both Brazil and Mexico. Crypto definitely is another net positive, but it's still early. We only launched crypto in mid-December. So there's very little effort in the fourth quarter coming from crypto. With regards to the second question, I'd say that increasingly, what we are seeing is a shift -- actually no shift, but as we rolled out lending in the Mercado Pago app that has been gaining share. And in some countries, it already represents over 50% of the personal loans we give, all the consumer loans that we give. So far, we have not seen a very significant profile between one and the other, yellow app loans and blue app loans, although we do have this concern that you have that -- our team delivered more risky because it's money that the users can withdraw from an ATM or from their bank account, I not necessarily buy something with it. However, so far, we have not seen very different numbers. I think on the second question, we don't really disclose any data on the differentiating profiles of credit on marketplace versus off-marketplace. The comments in the prepared remarks, I think, aimed at disclosing how our credit business is not any longer primarily an on-marketplace credit business. But it's actually a credit business that can aspire to the entire TAM away from the MELI marketplace. If you look at the size of our credit book and the potential size of the credit book, you'll see it's still a drop in the ocean in what the overall demand for credit is among these consumer segments that we're operating in. So the size of the addressable market is enormous. And I would even venture to argue that it can accommodate for many quality players without affecting the growth of any of them. So this is far from a zero-sum game once we move into the open Mercado Pago app and away from marketplace consumers. And obviously, on the marketplace, we have significant advantages over any other credit offering, whether that be through a credit card. So I think that's what we were trying to disclose how much of the credit origination already occurs away from marketplace and how that sets us up for significant long-term growth. We don't give any granularity on how those consumer profiles or books defer. Great. Thank you both. Our next question comes from Deepak Mathivanan with Wolfe Research. Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple of ones. So first, Pedro, a large portion of the volume is already on one day and two day in our shipping windows. Where do you aim to take these service levels maybe in the next like 12 to 24 months? I mean I'm asking is because shipping and career cost is still delevering gross margins. But curious how we should think about the growth in these expenses? And then another question on the credit business. Clearly, you're integrating these into various products. But how should we kind of think about the sustainability of this in the next few quarters? Do you think whether any external factors like tightening credit maybe for cash advances and some of the other places outside of your platform that's helping it, or like you said, it's just still kind of like an early innings for you? Deepak, so let's start with the second question with regard to credit. I think that despite the tightening environment, I think that we are seeing improving NPLs, and we are comfortable, we'll continue growing the business. What we have been doing is increasing the part of the portfolio, which is securitized or funded by third parties at the beginning of last year that was roughly 25%. And by the end of the year, it was more like 45%. So our share of the portfolio is diminishing, but we are comfortable that we can continue growing all of the credit products. So Deepak, a couple of things. If you look at annualized gross profit evolution, so first point here is, yes, you do see compression. But when we actually look at the shipping piece, we see some interesting improvements in margin structure, despite the significant improvements you mentioned in terms of percentage of total shipments delivered same day and next day. So we're at nearly 30% same day, another 31% next day, which is really very, very solid execution on the network, and that's for the entire region. Individual markets are even stronger than that. And shipping costs when we compare to Q4 of last year actually scaled positively. A lot of the gross margin pressure you see is coming more from the scale-up and the build-out of the 1P business and a few other line items. So very encouraged with shipping. I think we continue to look to follow that same pattern. How can we continue to drive faster shipping? We're seeing some really, really interesting results from our crowd-sourced shipping solutions that we've launched in Brazil and Mexico recently. So I wouldn't attribute the gross margin pressure entirely to the evolution of shipping that actually, if we look at Q4 of last year to Q4 of this year, scaled, despite the improvements in delivery times. Thank you. Our next question comes from Richard Cathcart with Bradesco. Hi guys, good evening. Thanks for taking the questions. So, just a question here on direct costs in Brazil. If we look at kind of quarter-on-quarter was a pretty large increase in direct costs in Brazil. So, perhaps you could just give us a little bit of information about what was exactly driving that and whether it was more on the COGS or in the SG&A or a combination of the two? Thank you. Yes. So Brazil has, I think, I've mentioned some of them in the previous question, but just to give you greater detail. If you look at the evolution of the Brazilian P&L, first of all, if you just look at cost, you will see an increase in the provisions for bad debt from the credit book. Now, remember that, that's more than offset by credit revenues. So, in terms of net contribution at the EBIT level and net income level, the credit books are positive, but they do generate significant increase in sales and marketing year-on-year because of how much the credit books have grown. Second factor there is the first-party business. That has grown a lot versus prior year. But even sequentially, when you get into Q4, typically, we lean into the 1P business more aggressively during the holiday season, and that business is still subscale and therefore, drives a lot of margin compression. And then the third area that we continue to invest aggressively in and also generates some of the compression is the Q4 promotional season. So just if you compare it to Q3, there's clearly incremental marketing spend during Q4. That makes for the fourth quarter a seasonally weaker quarter than the prior three. And those three items explain most of the sequential compression in margins at a Brazil level, but also at an aggregate level. Perfect Pedro. Okay. Thanks very much. Our next question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Okay. Thank you. So, Pedro, I think in your prepared remarks, you talked about units per buyer continuing to improve year-over-year. And maybe this is cutting things a little bit too fine, but can you talk about the behavior of your newly onboarded users versus existing users? And where you are getting most of this bump in transaction velocity from? And secondarily, now that Envios is handling the vast majority of shipped units. The optimistic me wants to start thinking about what you might do to combine deliveries over time to take down the shipping costs even further. So, you saw this with other global operators used to ship you one order per box. And over time, you start to get multiple orders in the same box. So, how far away do you think you are in terms of getting such a move implemented? Do you need greater order density to get that done? Thanks. Thanks Steve. Great question. So, look, we don't share cohort analysis. We did -- we do show and you can back into the math right, the buyer frequency for the first time ever in the fourth quarter of 2021 surpassed seven purchases per buyer in the quarter. That's up from almost a whole one unit less per buyer per quarter a year ago. So even within two pandemic influenced years, I would say this one less so because reopenings are much more widespread. And the successful items per buyer are up quite nicely versus fourth quarter of last year. Implicit in that is that there isn't any material change in cohort behavior that's worth disclosing. Second piece on Envios, I don't want to get ahead of myself, but I think your readout is accurate. We are now very focused on interface and products that will help us drive larger baskets. That comes with tweaks to the interface, probably with certain monetization incentives for users to place more items into a basket. And it also requires that we get very good at where we route inventory from given the growing number of warehouses that we have that split inventory. But that will be a significant focus during this year. And hopefully, we can see results in terms of greater items per order. Thank you. Our next question comes from Ed Yruma with KeyBanc. Hi guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just two quick ones for me. I guess, first on the NPLs. Obviously, some nice improvement quarter-on-quarter there. But bad debt expense is still higher. I guess, do those overtime converge, i.e., bad debt expense comes down as NPL comes down? Was there some kind of expensing that allowed you to pull the NPLs down? And then as a follow-up, just Pedro, on your prepared comments, you talked about kind of earnings, modest earnings growth. Are you talking about margin or earnings dollars? Thank you. Hello? Yeah. No, we're here. Sorry, we were just caucusing on your first question. So I'll tackle the second one first. Yeah. So look, at the end of the day -- first of all, certainly, we would like to manage the financial model for incremental EBIT power in dollars and earnings per share. To accomplish that, I think it would be ideal if we can drive enough operational leverage in the financial model, so that also means modest margin gains. Now we're operating across multiple product lines with significant and different competitors across many of these in many different regions. And because we don't give specific guidance, I want to be cautious. What we're saying here is there's a strong commitment on our part to increase our earnings capacity given the size and scale of our business. We believe that there are continuous operational efficiencies that if we focus on, we can deliver that growing earnings power. If that also means margin increases consistently over a multiyear period, excellent. But the first order of priority is to secure that we're increasing our earning power, whether that comes through margin increases or potentially flat or down margin. But given the scale of our top line, that still means incremental EBIT dollars and net income dollars, then I think that still accomplishes the overarching goal that we're shooting for. With regards to NPLs and bad debt provisions, the numbers are still high at 24%. But you have to bear in mind that the duration of our loans is pretty short, typically consumer loans having a duration of three months. So in the denominator, the portfolio we have is rather short. However, the bad debt stayed there for a year. Now when it comes to bad debt provision, I think it's mostly related to the credit card business, which has been growing very fast. Since we only started that business six months ago, we don't still have enough track record and are being cautious in the provision of potential bad debt. Got it. So just I'm clear, there wasn't any change in how you classify nonperforming? Because I think you changed it a couple of quarters ago. So that treatment is still the same as how you had previously treated it? Right. So we've only changed it once, and we haven't changed that again. Thank you. And this concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I'd like to turn the call back over to our host for any closing remarks. Great. Thanks, everyone. A lot of great questions. We apologize we weren't able to get to everyone, but we'll make sure to cycle back. And we look forward to being able to speak again in a few months and report the beginning of the year that we are very enthused about and where a lot is going on at MELI. So we will speak again in three months. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.","the Mercado Libre earnings conference call for the quarter ended December 31, 2021 . our Chief Financial Officer, Pedro Arnt, will be leading today's prepared remarks . the forward-looking statements are based on current assumptions, expectations, and projections .",0.0

I’m Lissa Schreurs, Investor Relations Officer for MercadoLibre. Today, we will share our quarterly highlights on video. After which, we will begin our live Q&A session with our Chief Financial Officer, Pedro Arnt; and Chief Executive Officer of Mercado Pago, Osvaldo Gimenez.
I remind you that management may make Forward-Looking Statements relating to such matters as continued growth prospects for the Company, industry trends and product and technology initiatives. These statements are based on currently available information and our current assumptions, expectations and projections about future events. While we believe that our assumptions, expectations and projections are reasonable in view of the currently available information, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.
Our actual results may differ materially from those included in this conference call for a variety of reasons, including those described in the forward-looking statements and Risk Factors sections of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, and any of MercadoLibre, Inc’s other applicable filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on our Investor Relations website.
With that, let’s begin with a summary of our results. Hi, everyone. I’m pleased to present some of the highlights and key messages regarding the performance in Q1 of 2022. We had a very strong start to the year, setting a sound base for the challenging ramp-up ahead of us in the coming quarters.
Our Marketplace growth has remained consistent for yet another quarter. We reached almost $7.7 billion in gross merchandise volume, growing nearly 32% on an FX-neutral basis and sustaining a two-year CAGR above 70% with almost 40 million unique buyers in the quarter, buyer behavior remains sticky, total items per buyer continues to grow versus last year’s pandemic-impacted year.
We are confident that the depth of product and category mix on our Marketplace and the quality of our seller base places us in a unique position to drive continued growth with solid monetization in commerce.
The services attached to our Marketplace are also continuing to expand. Specifically, the Advertising business has been a consistent highlight in terms of growth and margin structure and has almost doubled in revenues year-over-year as we have improved our technology to serve ads throughout our platforms. We will continue to launch more features and channels behind this business.
We are also very encouraged by the performance of the FinTech business during this quarter. Total payment volume surpassed $25 billion for the first time ever and has accelerated in both Acquiring and in digital account TPV with important growth in overall FinTech take rates.
We had almost 36 million unique active users in the FinTech segment, growing across all of our geographies, boosted by higher engagement in wallet payments and the growth users. The credit portfolio continues to deliver consistent profitable growth, while the credit books are performing to our expectations.
Regarding our financial results, we have achieved a new record in terms of total revenues, even higher than the fourth quarter of last year, with improvements in monetization in both commerce and FinTech.
Our gross margins have improved year-over-year with better operating leverage over our cost base. And in line with our objective to grow profitably, we have sustained consolidated EBIT margins at similar levels to Q1 of last year despite the tough comp.
Bottom line performance was equally strong, delivering record net income for the first quarter. A more detailed customary commentary on the first quarter operational and financial highlights are now available in letter to stakeholders, which we will now release to our Investor Relations website on the day of earnings.
And before initiating the live Q&A section of tonight’s earnings call, there are a few more highlights we want to share with you. MercadoLibre continues to expand its ecosystem to offer its 140 million users solutions that simplify and improve their digital experience for buying and selling and to deliver on our mission to democratize access to e-commerce and financial services in Latin America. Logistics operations are increasingly efficient, not only due to scale, but also through the use of technology to optimize each step of the process.
Our fulfillment continues to grow, driving more same-day and next-day deliveries. We started the year of 2022 with 40% of the volume of delivery by fulfillment. And we already have 20 sites in operation.
MELI Places is also growing. There are already more than 5,800 spaces like this in Latin America, offering sellers the ability to drop off and allowing customers to pick up and return packages in a very convenient manner.
Mercado Credito is an important catalyst of the MercadoLibre ecosystem. Almost 10 million users already have an active credit line. The greater their engagement on our platform, the better we can score them for credit. Users can take loans through the app to make payments on the Mercado Pago checkout or when making a PIX payment in Brazil. The merchants receive the funds instantly.
We are also creating an easy way to manage crypto currencies on our digital accounts. In the first quarter of the launch, the crypto wallet reached the mark of one million users that have purchased or sold crypto currencies.
The MercadoLibre ecosystem is experiencing a peak of operations growth in recent years and will continue to evolve. In this complex environment, clear priorities and agility will be essential to perform with excellence and to continue to innovate. To do so, we will also hire over 13,000 employees in the region by the end of 2022, totalling a team of more than 43,000 employees.
As always, the best is yet to come. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Ruben with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Hi thanks very much for the presentation and a question. And I might like to dig in a bit more on, there is a number of cost pressures in the backdrop, whether it is oil or rising interest rates. I was hoping you could update us on your strategy of passing through these higher costs on the commerce side and any thoughts on elasticity when you make those moves. Thank you. Andrew, thanks. So we have been trying to pass on at least a portion of those costs to offset both increases in transportation costs through labor increases and obviously, oil cost. And if you look at the management of the interest rate increases that have been significant principally in Brazil over the last two, three quarters, I think we have done a good job of being able to offset a lot of that pressure through pricing.
And clearly, the business continues to grow at a healthy clip. So we will continue to try to find the right balance of being able to push through cost increases and finding the right mix of elasticity so that we don’t slow down the business more than what makes sense, given how much opportunity still lays ahead of us. Very helpful. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Irma Sgarz with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my questions. So also on expenses, when you think about the forward for the different lines, and we have seen some moving parts here in the quarter, obviously, with the build-out of the credit book on the one hand side, but you also, in the release, called out sort of higher G&A and expenses around some of the investments that you are making. When you think about the cadence of these investments going forward, can you just talk us through a little bit of the puts and takes of different areas where you are incrementally investing more, specifically on the operational expense side? And then if I may ask a second question, you make an interesting point in the release about the next leg of fulfillment improvement being about technology to optimize the operations. So just curious if you could share some examples, whether it is in warehousing or routing, what you are implementing to just run your operations at an even higher level. Thank you. Great. So product development, primarily through the increase in engineers, is the one of the three areas where potentially we continue to be very committed to investing behind that. These are the kind of investments that then unlock all sorts of software development and product improvements that should help us to sustain growth for many years and launch all the different products we have in mind.
Sales and marketing was showing operational leverage. And ideally, we can continue to deliver on that going forward. And then G&A on a year-on-year basis didn’t, but I think that is another line where we would strive to deliver operational leverage there going forward.
I think in general, our management of the P&L continues to be what it has been over the last few quarters of communication, which is we run a business that is growing very well, and on top of that is a profitable business with a growing operational income profile, which I think in this day and age is the right way to manage an e-commerce business and something that not many competitors necessarily can say. So that will continue to be the way we are trying to manage the P&L.
In terms of where technology impacts our logistics operation, I think in general, everything we do at MercadoLibre tries to have technology at the core. This is a combination of software to improve routing, to optimize demand analytics, to try to get more items into a parcel and also increased investments in automation.
You look at most of our warehouses, cross docks, service centers, we continue to invest in improving automation, layout to increase productivity and be able to continue to drive down costs, which we then - some of that drops to our bottom line. Some of that allows us to afford an even more expensive free shipping program.
But most importantly, we think is one of the biggest competitive advantages we have is the quality of our logistics network and also our continued commitment to continue to drive cost out of it. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Ford with Bank of America. Your line is open. Hey thank you very much. Congratulations on the quarter. Pedro, you comment a little bit about the competitive response with the increases in terms of the reductions in terms or other pricing that you may have taken? Bob, so look, I think we are going to do what we think is right for the combination of our business and our consumers. And I think we have been intelligent in the way we have optimized pricing and optimized installments.
And again, like I said in the earlier question, if you look at growth over the last few quarters, combined with bottom line performance, I think we have been able, especially on the financial piece, to weather a very dramatic increase in interest rates quite interesting.
If you look at take rates on the FinTech business, it does show how we have been activating the pricing levers to offset those increases in costs and yet, TPV, creditor originations, all of those businesses continue to deliver incredibly strong growth rates even against an incredibly tough Q1 comp.
So I think our commitment is to try to continue to deliver that kind of performance as we did in this last quarter. Competitors will do what competitors will do. I think that is not where we have to focus and not where we will focus. Understood. And I have been fascinated with your entry into the payroll services space. Can you talk a little bit about your initial pilots and how we should think about that scaling? Hi Bob. I think that we are still very, very early on with regards to payroll. We are very excited about the opportunity in terms of having more principality and we are just really getting started with the ballot and we cannot comment on it yet. Understood. And then when it comes to putting multiple items into a single parcel, Pedro, can you talk about the implications for maybe delivery costs, but also centralizing more inventory and maybe further build out of the work to warehouse network. Sure. So clearly, the ability to continue to drive more items per purchase is one of the most critical drivers of continuing to lower cost. Obviously, the centralization of inventory. So continued adoption of fulfillment by MELI, combined with intelligent inventory location, should help us improve even more on our ability to reduce split purchases where we might be shipping one item from one FC and another item in the same shopping cart from a different FC, and that is a big focus for us right now.
And it should have a positive impact across most of our categories, but a more dramatic impact on higher item per basket categories such as CPG and groceries, which long term is an important category for us.
So the better we can get at that, the better the economics look in groceries in some of these categories and the faster we can accelerate there. And obviously, those are large share of consumer wallet categories in the region and also importance for engagement and recurrence.
So it is an area of focus for the logistics team and something that we should be working on diligently through the remainder of the year to continue to improve our ability to increase items in a single box leaving from a single FC. Very helpful. Thank you very much and again congratulations. Thank you. Our next question comes from Marcelo Santos with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Good evening. Thanks for taking my questions I have two. The first is if you could discuss the NPLs on the credit product, how it behaves on a same product basis, like on each portfolio? And if you could attribute how much of the increase we saw sequentially to changes in the mix and how much to macro scenario. And the second question is if you could comment on your efforts to increase logistic monetization, what have you done so far? And what’s in store for the rest of the year? Thank you. So Marcelo, with regards to NPLs, directionally, I would say that the combination of factors, we are very, very confident with how the business is evolving. There has been a little increase in NPLs, but it is mostly because we are growing the consumer business faster than the merchant business and that we are pricing that risk already.
So the spreads remain fairly constant. There was nothing unexpected here. And that is related to two factors, as I mentioned. First is the increase of the consumer volume. And particularly, we are doing more personal loans rather than buy now, pay later.
And we know that is a little bit riskier, and it is priced higher and also is related to the increase on the size of the share of credit card within all of the credit volume. But I think that is going exactly as we expected. Sorry, there is a second part to the question. So look, in terms of - no, we were - in terms of monetization of fulfillment, it is still very much in the early phases today. In terms of overall commerce revenues, it is insignificant. It is less than 1%.
And we have only really initiated most of the charges so far for low-rotating inventory that is not intelligently utilizing capacity in the warehouses. And only over the last few months have we launched utilization rental space. So actually having to pay to use our fulfillment centers.
So we will try to keep you posted over the next few quarters, what the reception to that by merchants is, whether it is having any negative effects on incremental adoption of fulfillment or not. So far, the charges for poorly managed inventory have been very positive because they help reduce low-rotating inventory in the warehouses.
And as you can see, fulfillment percentages, although somewhat flat, it is not driven by this. It is driven by other factors. So that is been working very well. And we will now have to see what the impact of the introduction of the rental for using fulfillment. So the fulfillment by now a service fee will be, again, very early for that. Thank you Pedro. Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Kaio Prato with UBS. Your line is open. Hello everyone. Thank you for the opportunity for asking question. So my question is related to Mercado Credit Solution as well. So I would just try to understand what gives you confidence that you can continue growing the credit portfolio, even with the signs of NPLs increasing today? And just would like to better understand about the risk models, if you believe you have an advantage versus other FinTechs because of your Marketplace data that helps you on the underwriting or if there is any other reason? And finally, I would like to understand as well, if you are increasing rates charges in the credit business because of higher policy rates in LatAm as well. Thank you. So look, what gives us confidence is simply looking at performance so far. I don’t want to get into any forward-looking comments on how the credit business will perform. If we look at what we have done so far in a tough environment, we have been able to continuously grow originations in the size of the book at a good pace.
And as Osvaldo just walked you through, the significantly largest portion of the increase in NPLs are a consequence of product mix, and only a smaller portion of the NPL increases are driven by improvement in existing products. So less than a third of the NPL dis-improvements.
We continue to believe that the data we have on consumers, the touch points with consumers, the collections operations we have built are competitive advantages that help our underwriting. But notwithstanding, I think we need to continue to deliver on that and continue to grow the books in line with our confidence in our underwriting, and then we will see what happens going forward. But so far, all the signs continue to be positive and executing to plan. Complementing on that basically, today, the three main products, which are merchant loans online, merchant loans off-line and consumer grade, in each of the three countries, Argentina, Brazil and Mexico, all those nine segments are profitable. So we remain confident that we will continue being profitable going forward. And this has been in an environment where the SELIC over the last year has increased from 2.75% to 12.75%. Yes, thank you. Just a follow-up in terms of the policy rate. I just would like to understand if in the Quadrem products are you also increasing the rates charges because of this increase in select rates. So certainly, we are. But again, remember that given the segments where we lend, the performance of the credit books, because of the spreads, is the more relevant driver versus incremental points in terms of cost of capital. So the answer to your question is yes. But really the most significant driver to sustain the profitability and the performance of the books continues to be the quality of the underwriting. Okay, great. Thank you very much. Thank you. Our next question comes from Deepak Mathivanan with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Great. Thanks for taking the questions. So first, Pedro, can you provide a little bit more color on the GMV growth during the quarter? You guys are compounding at a pretty healthy pace on top of very tough comps. Maybe elaborate a little bit on how the cohorts that came in during the 2020 are behaving in terms of the spend. And what are the spend levels you see in the initial transaction levels of some of the new customers?
And then the second question, obviously, many companies, in our coverage universe and certainly much more broadly, are revisiting their capital allocation decisions in the face of tough capital markets and then also a weak macro environment. You guys obviously have a lot of growth opportunities ahead. What is the kind of thought process in terms of balancing between an uncertain macro environment in the future and then also your capital allocation needs? Thank you. Thanks, Deepak. So if you look at the two-year CAGRs, we continue to deliver very consistent growth, which for us is a sign that unlike other e-commerce markets or players that have given back significant portion of what was gained during the pandemic, MELI purchases for our consumers seem to have been very sticky.
When we look at cohort behavior or engagement behavior in general, it is up a little versus last year. So there hasn’t been a deterioration in engagement levels or cohort behavior. We haven’t seen a continuation of the incremental engagement from new cohorts either. So it has been slightly above flattish, which, again, in the context of dramatic reopening of physical retails, we think is very, very strong performance.
In terms of capital allocation along similar lines, I think we are in a privileged position of running a high-growth e-commerce business that is a market leader and yet also is able to deliver profits, incremental profits. And so we are not at a point where we are changing our capital allocation.
As I answered earlier on the margin question, we will continue to invest in engineers. We will continue to invest in capacity for our fulfillment network. We believe that those generate long-term competitive advantages. We might even see some rationalization in the market over the next few years, which could position us to capture even more of the incremental consumer spend that moves online.
Latin America is still early stage. So there is a lot of incremental spend that will move online over the next few years, and we want to make sure that we continue to take a long-term view on all that. At the same time, we continue to strive to generate operational leverage where it makes sense, sales and marketing, G&A.
You have seen us rationalize very, very significantly the amount of couponing and discounting spent on our FinTech business. And all of that is what leads to the incremental operating income that we have delivered this quarter versus many previous quarters.
And so I think that management of the P&L, commitment to invest where we need to invest for the long term, is still the same, and we really are not reassessing capital allocation. Should conditions change, obviously, we will move quickly, but that is not where we are at so far. Got it. okay, thanks Pedro. Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna. Your line is open. Hi, congratulations on the results. I just wanted to ask a kind of combination of Slide 9 and Slide 17. On Slide 9, you showed the growth of the off-platform. And so this is a TPV off Marketplace, I mean. And that is now up to 68% of your total, up 103%. So Pedro, when you think about the impact of that on the take rates, like does off-platform have inherently different take rates than everything else? And then related to that, in terms of the 65 basis points of increase in your FinTech take rate, I realize you decompose that between credit and other. If you could help us a little bit to think about pricing, I think it is a fair question, why is the FinTech take rate up to that degree? So I will let Osvaldo answer the take rate question. In general, off-marketplace TPV today is driven significantly, and so is the acceleration, by the - not the Acquiring business, but the processing business. A lot of that is on the back of our wallet. Some of that is because our wallet, in a way, is a natural hedge to re-openings as is our MPOS business.
And so as economies have reopened, we have seen those businesses step in with strong acceleration in growth. The wallet business is not a business that has a higher take mix than the TPV average. So the strong improvements in take rates are explained by what Osvaldo will walk you through right now. Those have been mostly related to the increase in credit revenues on the overall Mercado Pago TPV - or Mercado Pago revenues actually. And therefore, I would say, we have been able to maintain typically the same transactional revenues about increased component of credit revenues and a few other things, but mostly has been required revenues on top of what we are already doing, given that our mix - our portfolio has grown faster than our TPV over the last year. Great. Thanks guys, I appreciate it. Thank you. Our next question comes from Marvin Fong from BTIG. Your line is open. Congratulations on the quarter. Two questions. I would like to follow up on what you are saying about the great performance in the wallet and, in particular, the 100% plus growth in QR payments. So should we view that primarily as driven by the reopening? Or were there other factors at play to drive the acceleration in QR?
And my second question is just on Argentina. We don’t talk about it much, but it looks like it had a nice step up on the e-commerce side, both in terms of units sold and GMV on a two-year basis. Anything to call out there that you are doing in Argentina that you can then apply to your other geographies? Marvin, yes, I would say that there has been an acceleration in the use of their wallet. Probably part of that is related to reopenings across all countries. Basically, we are comparing with the first quarter with some lockdowns last year. Nonetheless, we believe this has been a significant aspiration.
I think that in all of last year, we never grew at this pace at the 200% year-on-year. And significantly, this has happened. We have grown a lot in Argentina. Really our world has taken a lot of traction, and it is pretty much everywhere in Argentina. And we have also seen significant growth, both in Brazil and Mexico. So it has happened in those three countries. And Argentina, so certainly, it is shown acceleration in units and acceleration in GMV. I would say that it is good to see Argentina rebounding. If you look at the previous two quarters, that business, which has historically been very strong because of tough comps and other things, had delivered somewhat sluggish growth.
And we are seeing it come back to, I think, the kind of growth that we expect from that business. So it is good news. It was a strong performance, but I think it is also fair to acknowledge that it is coming off of two previous Qs that were fairly easy to accelerate growth given that they were clearly among, most of our geos, some of the sluggish growth. Great, thanks guys. I appreciate it. Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Okay, thanks guys. So hi Pedro. So I guess, kind of taking a step back and looking at it from, I guess, 30,000 feet, the relationship that you guys have with the merchant and the nature of what you are selling them has expanded pretty significantly over the years. So you first provided them with the traffic and the transactions and then you help enable payments and you are - now you are helping to provide delivery and logistics services and now you are increasingly providing them with working capital. So this is a pretty significant suite of services you are providing your merchant clientele. And I think in the past, you have talked about wanting to provide folks with the e-commerce platform services. So where are you in bringing all of your services together holistically in an e-commerce in a box type service? Thanks. Yes. So I think increasingly, when you look at the different pieces that we have built: logistics, payments, credit, even the relaunch shops, front-end, plus the integration with the marketplace so that you can drive multichannel operations, each one of those now is probably scaled.
And we have built enough capabilities that we can start considering becoming more aggressive there in terms of bundling it all together or in different combinations and then offering that to merchants away from the marketplace.
And then if you think of advertising as an overlay on top of that to assist merchants to drive traffic to their shop store or back into their MercadoLibre listings, it really becomes a very powerful combination that when you look at many of our competitors that offer each one of these services on a stand-alone basis, whether that be payments processing or credit or marketplace or storefronts or just an advertising platform, we believe that the ecosystem approach is a really, really powerful way to sell these different services.
So clearly, this is something that we are doing work on. It is part of our strategy, and we will keep you guys appraised on this as these products take more and more form. You already see live Pago clients that have an integrated shipping offering.
And obviously, Mercado Shops has an integrated shipping offering to many of these clients. So these things are already being piloted in market, and we will have to iterate and see how we improve on those products and then go into full deployment mode sometime in the future. Thank you. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Trevor Young with Barclays. Your line is open. Great, thanks. Just looking back at last year, your nearly doubled headcount, and a big piece of that came on your R&D organization, can you just tell us how you feel staffing levels now kind of going forward into this year? Are there any pockets where you expect to have kind of outsized investment or should we expect headcount growth to maybe slow here and more closely near your revenue growth? Yes. So like I said before, I think the engineering headcount commitment remains unwavering. I think as in most product-focused technology companies, the biggest bottleneck is the number of engineers that you have that are able to push code and build products. And so we want to continue to be aggressive in growing that team.
I think when we have looked at the moments MELI has sputtered in growth, it has been the moment where we have run up against more engineering bottlenecks. And the moments where we have grown the most is when we have had enough output capacity in terms of code and product build-out to continue to innovate and launch and cater to all the needs of our consumers. So we are not going to, I think, waver on the commitment to continue to grow the engineering talent pool.
I think all other areas we will look to grow headcount significantly less than revenue growth. There are inflationary pressures in terms of salaries and wages. I think the battle for talent is heating up throughout Latin America. So we will be as diligent as we can in terms of managing salaries and wages.
But again, we need to make sure that we are not trying to drive too much operational leverage short-term and sacrificing on continuing to have the best human capital in the region, which is our objective. So again, we will do what’s right there, but it is an area that we believe investing behind, particularly engineers and the product development organization. That is really helpful, thanks Pedro. And just a quick follow-up on ad revenue. I think in the video, you mentioned that it nearly doubled year-on-year. It is now up over 1% penetration, I believe. Can you just unpack what the lift is there on gross margin or EBIT and then saving the bridge? And then remind us where you think that penetration rate as a percentage of GMV can go over time. Thank you. Yes. So the more we build product and technology, here we are again, and we improve the ACOs for our merchants, the quality of the platform that we serve, the more we believe in the long-term potential of that business to grow significantly.
So no publicly stated long-term goal. I think certainly, it can be a lot more than 1% of GMV, and we will continue to strive to deliver significant growth there, both in absolute terms, but also as a percentage of GMV. And of course, GMV should also continue to grow for many years to come. In terms of the impact, I think we have gone on record saying that it is an extremely high-margin business. It runs at an over 70% EBIT margin today.
And so a lot of those incremental revenues really have a very, very good flow-through to the operating income line, more so than most of our other business units, which also makes it a very attractive opportunity. So it should be one of the big drivers of take rate increases over the next few years and certainly of incremental operating income. Thank you. Our next question comes from Soomit Datta with New Street Research. Your line is open. HI guys, thanks for the question. It is on FinTech and focusing on Brazil for a second, please. First of all, are you seeing any impact of PIX at all on debit volumes in the long tail? I take it the acquirer volumes look very healthy this quarter, but I just wondered whether within the mix, you are beginning to see any impact from that.
And then secondly, I think you recently launched installment, buy now, pay later scheme over PIX as well, beginning to see a few of those in the market in Brazil. What are your expectations for that product? Can you give any initial feedback on how that is going? Thanks. Hi Soomit. I would say, yes, regarding the first question, with debit volume being affected by PIX, I would say it is marginal at this stage. Probably, what we are seeing is very, very small individuals who - in the past, who buy small POS and MPOS, where they don’t need to do it because they get - they used to get a few payments per month by debit card, and now they are able to get those through PIX. That is really a very, very small long tail.
So I don’t think it is affecting our numbers necessarily. And if anything, we are - we continue to see a healthy increase in the mix of credit versus debit card in our POS. So I will say there is some impact, but in a very long tail. When we look at larger merchants, the volume they are getting from PIX is really marginal.
And then moving on to buy now, pay later and PIX, it is a product we have already developed and we are starting to test first within our own - with our own merchants. And we are excited by that opportunity. It means that anyone who has our wallet and is trying to pay on a QR code will be able - today, he is able to do it with a store balance.
But in the future, he will also be able to do it with a grade we are providing them on the spot. So we believe that this will significantly expand the scope of merchants where we can offer buy now, pay later because it is not only will be the merchant acquired, but any merchant who has PIX. And if I may, just a quick follow-up. I mean is that expected to cannibalize credit cards, do you think, at all or is this going to kind of sit alongside it? Thanks. I think it will be more of a different segment. Typically, most of the target of our Buy Now, Pay Later consumers are consumers who either don’t have a credit card or they have topped up their credit limit. And that is why they are willing to pay extra - we charge for buy now, pay later. Remember as opposed to some players in the U.S., in Latin America, we charge for that because interest rates are higher. So if you have balance available on your credit card or you will still use your credit card, but this expands the market for financing at the point of sale. Got it. that is very clear. Thank you. Thank you. And at this time, I’m showing no further questions at this time. I would like to hand the conference back over to Pedro Arnt, CFO, for closing remarks. Thank you. Thanks, everyone, for assisting. We hope the new format has made the initial remarks more engaging, certainly shorter. Just a reminder to everyone, the traditional management comment that you have grown accustomed to is still available. It is now simply in the form of a letter that we post on the IR website rather than having to hear me voice over.
We are quite pleased with the video format. It gives us more time for Q&A as well. So hopefully, we will repeat that next quarter. And we look forward to speaking again in three months with an update on the full first half of the year. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.","MercadoLibre earnings conference call for the quarter ended march 31, 2022 . today, we will share our quarterly highlights on video . we will begin our live Q&A session with our Chief Financial Officer, Pedro Arnt .",0.0

I’m Lissa Schreurs, Investor Relations Officer for MercadoLibre. Today, we will share our quarterly highlights on video. After which, we will begin our live Q&A session with our Chief Financial Officer, Pedro Arnt; and Chief Executive Officer of Mercado Pago, Osvaldo Gimenez.
I remind you that management may make forward-looking statements relating to such matters as continued growth prospects for the company, industry trends and product and technology initiatives. These statements are based on currently available information and our current assumptions, expectations and projections about future events.
While we believe that our assumptions, expectations, and projections are reasonable in view of the currently available information, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.
Our actual results may differ materially from those included in this conference call for a variety of reasons, including those described in the forward-looking statements and Risk Factors sections of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, and any of MercadoLibre, Inc’s other applicable filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on our Investor Relations website.
With that, let's begin with a summary of our results. Hello, everyone. I'm pleased to present some of the highlights and key messages regarding the performance during the second quarter of 2022. Despite a challenging macroeconomic scenario, we delivered a strong quarter across all of our businesses. Our marketplace achieved consistent results despite the challenging environment for retail businesses with a gross merchandise volume of over $8.5 billion, delivering solid growth year-on-year despite tough comps for the second quarter.
We reached over 40 million unique buyers, during the second quarter with sustained levels of engagement and items sold per buyer, with a diverse seller base and an efficient logistics network for a wide variety of items. We have a differentiated user experience and product assortment to keep growing and drive further online commerce penetration throughout Latin America.
On the FinTech side, Mercado Pago continues to grow and gain relevance in our ecosystem, delivering strong results in Q2. TPV surpassed $30 billion for the first time, growing both in acquiring and digital wallet. Mercado Pago reached 38 million unique active users growing across all geographies.
Mercado Credito continues to grow its credit book, reaching more consumers and sellers and delivering an important ecosystemic effect for engagement and loyalty. With sustained healthy trends in the second quarter, the credit business continues to contribute to our operating margin expansion.
As a consequence of the consistent performance in commerce and FinTech, we delivered record results in net revenues and EBIT, with strong improvements in cash generation during the second quarter. Revenues for FinTech have surpassed $1 billion in the quarter for the first time ever as our FinTech products gain more relevance in our ecosystem.
In commerce, revenue growth comes mainly from our strength in third-party marketplace categories and the expansion of our advertising business. Our gross profit margin expanded year-over-year and quarter-on-quarter as we scaled our businesses and delivered operating leverage across most cost of goods sold.
As a result of this, our operating profit reached a record in the quarter with operating margins that were directionally in line with last years as we continue to balance investments mainly in product and technology and the credit business with cost leveraging across other operational expenses. The second quarter closed with net profit in our three main segments, including Mexico and with improvements in net income margin year-over-year.
We also optimized our cash conversion cycle, leading to improved cash generation for all business units and strong cash from operations results. We will continue to target growth with the correct profitability and cash generation profile. This will mean balancing our focus on the long term with a commitment to constructing sustainable businesses with scalable financial models.
A more detailed customary comment on the second quarter operational and financial highlights is now available in a management commentary letter to shareholders, which we release on our Investor Relations website.
Before initiating the live Q&A sections of tonight's earnings, we want to share with you some additional news and achievements from the quarter. Our marketplace continues to grow. And technology has an important role to improve the experience of our buyers and sellers, deploying continuous improvements to selection, search and discovery. In our apparel section, we now have improved filters and brand searching.
We expanded the MELI places network enabled for reverse logistics to improve the shopping experience for our customers. We also keep improving our delivery service throughout Latin America. The MELI Air network reduced our delivery times by two to six days in the Northeast and Midwest regions of Brazil.
In line with improvements in our buyer experience, our loyalty program has been growing, reaching millions of subscribers and strong year-on-year growth. After reaching Level 6, the highest on the program, users have higher frequency, GMV and retention, enjoying multiple benefits from free shipping, special discounts and offers to access to content streaming partners.
Our loyalty program also plays an important part in connecting and raising engagement, both in MercadoLibre and Mercado Pago, offering benefits in all of our services for our users.
On the fintech side, our credit business also plays an important ecosystemic role, as a tool to provide our merchant base with working capital and our consumer base with personal loans and credit cards.
To continue to provide these solutions for our ecosystem. We recently announced new funding partnerships to expand credit lines in Brazil and Mexico. All of these initiatives that potentialize our ecosystem are a result of our tech DNA and execution focus. We believe times like this are ideal to invest and create sustained long-term differentiation, leveraging technology and we will continue to invest in technology and in hiring engineers throughout the next quarters.
As we grow, we watch closely our impact in the community and environment around us. That is why we’ve just launched another round of investments in our preservation program, Regenera America in Brazil and Mexico to preserve Latin American biomes and biodiversity. As always, the best is yet to come.
[Technical Difficulty] …probably a combination of those, but maybe if you could just lay out which areas you're most focused on in terms of driving advertising revenues higher. Thank you. Thank you, Irma. Let me take them in reverse order. So you're correct. I think advertising is beginning to scratch the surface of its potential. There's room to increase the number of advertisers across many product categories, but obviously, as we grow into more and more categories. And equally important, as we grow our first-party business, which has a much higher attach rate of advertising in terms of percentage of GMV, that should also help. There's room for increased engagement for advertising and all of this always driven by technology, so new formats and new positioning throughout our different ecosystems.
We've started experimenting with advertising in the Mercado Pago world and the Mercado Pago app. And we have other formats that we can launch going forward. So I think this continues to be an opportunity that we're very enthusiastic about. And as I always say, is a very high margin one with EBIT margins in the high 70s, low 80s.
In terms of what we're focused on going forward, correctly, we don't guide. I think we've shown that we have a good grasp right now of the cost structure in MELI. We continue to invest in a few critical areas like product development, where we're not looking for operational leverage, but we continue to deliver solid improvements in gross profit, if you look at H1 and so I think I'm confident in our ability to continue to balance cost management with investing in growth, where there's the greatest uncertainty going forward is just what happens to the health of the consumer in Latin America. But so far, everything we’ve seen despite, I think, concerns around the consumer having been around in the second quarter as well, we've continued to deliver solid results and I think the consequence of that is to the best of our assessment, we've accelerated our share gains in Q2. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Ruben of Morgan Stanley. Andrew Ruben, your line is open. Hi, thanks very much for the question. I appreciate the additional disclosure you gave around the credit portfolio. I was hoping if you could dig in a bit more on how you've seen performance by the main product line card, consumer, and the merchant loans. Just a bit more color how you're thinking about trends, both in loan performance and growth of those segments would be helpful. Thank you. Andrew, I think that overall, when we look at our portfolio, there are, I'd say, nine main segments being those Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico on the countryside and they are part of the market -- the merchants, the small merchants and the consumers. And all of those nine segments are profitable and have remained margins similar to what we saw in prior quarters. So, we are very, very happy with that performance.
And the 10 would be credit card, which is a smaller product -- and we are still within the first year. We launched that a year ago, but is not yet profitable, but it's according to what we expected. So, I think both has been evolving very positively. And tomorrow, in the filing, we will make -- we will provide extra information, then we'll give more color to these details. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Marcelo Santos of JPMorgan. Marcelo Santos, your line is open. Good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. First question is, if you could talk a bit about the profitability ex-credit. So, you said, Pedro, that the gross margins are improving, but how do you see the business excluding the credit? Should that part also see profitability improving? And how were the gains on that front?
And the second question is how relevant is credit to GMV generation nowadays, could you give some ballpark idea on what's the penetration maybe per country or in a consolidated level of how many -- how much of your marketplace sales are done through credit? Thank you. Hi Marcelo, let me start with the second part of the question. Regarding how relevant is credit generation. I'd say it varies on a country-by-country basis, but in some countries, it's and say, go from mid-single-digits to low -- very low double-digit. Thanks Thank you. Our next question comes… In terms of -- sorry. Sorry, there was a second part of the question there. Look, the operating profit that we delivered is delivered from operational lever and improvement sequentially across most of our business units. Credit is obviously an important piece of that. We've given some disclosure on interest margin after losses. You can calculate a cost of funding. The operating cost is fairly small there to get to your own assumptions on profit from in terms of EBIT dollars from credit, but it's still significantly less than -- or maybe around slightly above one-third of the overall number. So the remaining numbers show growth in profit coming from the advertising business and some significant profitability improvements across the rest of the Mercado Pago products who are either improving their EBIT generation or for some of the still money-losing products that we're investing for the long-term like the digital wallet or the digital core bank account. Those are improving significantly their negative margins, and we see a good runway to towards eventually profitability there. So don't assume that our incremental EBIT is coming solely from the credit business, not at all. We're seeing good operational leverage sequentially across most of the product lines.
I think one last thought on this. The one where we are seeing the least amount of incremental EBIT if we look on a year-on-year basis is Brazil marketplace, but that is primarily driven by expansion in -- or actually the increase in interest rates that compressed some of the financing revenues on Marketplace. Off marketplace, we've been able to pass those interest rate increases on to the consumer across most of the Pago products on marketplace, as you know, the price of the parcelado sem juros, we have not changed it for competitive dynamics, and I think it's helped us gain shares. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kaio Prato of UBS. Kaio Prato, your line is open. Hello, everyone. Thank you for the opportunity for asking question. I have two questions on my side, please, and also related to Mercado Credit Solutions. The first one is regarding to asset quality. So we saw that your 90 days coverage ratio actually decreased quarter-over-quarter. So just wondering if this concerns you at some point and could trigger a further increase in provisions going forward? And what is the level of coverage that you think would be a comfortable level without your growth level? And then I will follow up with my second question, please. So we -- the question was why have the coverage ratio going slightly down from quarter-to-quarter. And the reason for that is that we provision on originations and as originations, we have decelerated a little bit from the past, we are originating credit and provisions have come down a little bit. Nonetheless, it's way over 100%. On top of that, in regard to -- give you a little more, if you want qualitative and color on a credit business. I think that throughout this year, we have been aggressive in being able to expand our credit business to riskier segment. And we have been able to do that by charging accordingly to those more retail segments and those are higher rates and therefore, our margin has been maintained or even increased and the contribution for Credito increased quarter-to-quarter. Having said that, as we see some deterioration in the market in the current quarter, we are starting to be a little bit more cautious and necessary offering prior to those segments, which we did riskier and which in the past we have offered Credito. Okay. Perfect. Thank you very much. And the second question is related to the credit card business in Brazil. Just if you could provide any details, I don't know, the level of NPLs of this product and how this or at least how this compared to the overall industry in Brazil, especially the digital banks. And you also mentioned that this project is not positive yet in terms of margins.
So, if you could mention when do you expect this product to become profitable? And last but not the least, how -- comfortable you are nowadays in terms of increasing the pace of origination in this product? Thank you. Okay. So you'll get some additional product disclosures on loan performance in the Q tomorrow. I think with a credit card product that is basically less than a year old, comparisons are not going to be very useful. I think the way you build out a solid and profitable credit card business is over multiple years, which has been the case of many of the neo banks. So this is very early for us.
We continue to see, I think, a product that will be very critical for our long-term strategy and that we're continuing to invest behind. Obviously, once we've distributed cards to the strongest and users we had, the deepest relationships with in the earlier quarters, we're now slowing down the rate of new cards, but it's still growing. And we're seeing improving profitability as those earlier cohorts begin to clean up and perform better and better. So, it's early. I think we're going at the right pace, making sure that we have the right underwriting capacity. And long term, this is still a critical product for us within our fintech ecosystem Okay. Good. Thank you very much. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Ford of Bank of America. Bob Ford, please go ahead. Thank you very much and hi Lissa, Pedro, Osvaldo congratulations on the quarter and thanks for taking my question. I'll ask them really quickly. What was behind the strong unique buyer growth rates in the quarter in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico, given the regional deceleration in e-commerce and we found them very noteworthy? And then can you also discuss the move into used car loans with credit card in Mexico? And maybe more broadly, the transition from a transaction or I should say, an insertion-based model into a transaction-based model across classifieds.
And then lastly, how does your deal with Western Union changed your strategy in remittances and maybe the functionality roadmap you're building out for Pago in Mexico? Thank you. So Bob, I think, again, when we look at the consumer backdrop, when we look at the general, I think, e-commerce market data, and we look at our Q2 numbers. What we're seeing is the return on the investments that we've been carrying out over years in user experience in logistics and payments and credit. I think a unique buyer metric is a consequence of that. I think consumers when they begin to get tighter in their wallet, they will probably focus more and more of their spend on places where they can find selection, value and convenience, and we seem to be gaining a growing number of that user preference and choice throughout Latin America when you look at market share.
So I don't think I have any specific call out. Marketing and customer acquisition has continued to scale actually as a percentage of revenue. So this is not an uptick in investment, this is simply a consequence of everything we've done over the past multiple years in driving the best user experience possible.
The Credito’s experience in Mexico, I think, is a small pilot with a company that we think does a great job in that space. And I think it's a similar deals that we have with financial institutions in Brazil. It continues to inform our understanding of that space and is potentially a space that eventually Mercado Credito could look to expand with a combination not just of these partnerships, but also building a product for securitized lending, which is an interesting space throughout Latin America.
In terms of the transition to a more transaction-based model within Classifieds. I think we're still working on that. We see the potential of that space. We see that it's a high-traffic category within MELI. So one that we should be able to cross-sell very efficiently to. But I don't think we have defined or have really figured out how we move into the transactional model. Some of our previous intents around reservations and whatnot, I don't think have been the right solution. So in typical MELI fashion, we will continue to iterate and think through the business model until eventually we find something that sticks and we can see a reacceleration in Classifieds.
Remittances is a market that we've always identified as a large market. We think allowing remitters in the US to be able to send remittances direct into a Mercado Pago wallet which generates all sorts of use cases for the receiver. He can purchase. He can then use his debit card. He can pay utility bills, he can use in-store QR, is an interesting solution rather than driving that consumer to have to go to a Western Union Kiosk and extract cash. It drives further financial inclusion. So it's a win for Mercado Pago and it's a potential added service for our partners. We're pleased to have partnered with Western Union, but you will see other partnerships in this space as we look to grow our pie of the very, very large remittance business. Very helpful, Pedro. Thank you very much Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of also of Joao Soares of Citi. Joao Soares, Your lines is open Thanks for taking my questions, Just a quick one on my side. I just wanted to Pedro, if you could talk a little bit more about the 1P if I'm not mistaken, we saw a slightly lower contribution sequentially when we look into the first quarter and now into this quarter, it seems, I don't know, it seems like if you could talk, maybe if there is any change here in the 1P strategy and talk about any changes or how you're seeing your relationship with consumer electronics, home appliances suppliers? I think would be interesting. Thanks so much. Yeah. So when you refer to contribution, I assume you're referring to the mix of total GMV coming from the first-party business -- and you're correct, we have decelerated that business somewhat. I think I've addressed this somewhat.
Our 1P business overall is still a business that is money losing at the EBIT line. And in the current market context and as we've looked to tighten the screws and improve our efficiencies in terms of margin and also cash generation, that business falls under the bucket of businesses that we continue to believe are long-term critical, but that we will grow slightly lower -- at a slightly lower rate given the current market context, focus more aggressively on improving pure product margins and direct contributions and EBIT margins within the different 1P categories. And once those margins are, again, either breakeven or positive or very close to breakeven then we can reaccelerate growth there.
So we're pleased with the direction the 1P business is going, again we continue to see it as strategic long-term. But given current market context, we thought it made sense to slow down growth a little bit as we improved operational efficiency and got closer and closer to EBIT breakeven or even positive before we reaccelerate aggressively. Understood. Thanks Pedro. Thank you. Our next question comes from Marvin Fong of BTIG. Marvin Fong, your line is open. Yes, good evening. Thank you for taking my questions. And I wanted to reiterate that I appreciate all the additional disclosure that you have made. Two questions, if I could, on the FinTech side. So first question, just looking at your disclosure about the average exposure per user, so for example, $1,400 for online merchant, $150 for consumer, should we think about these levels in the four categories you disclosed? Is that being about where you expect them to stay, or is there room for these average balances to grow over time in any other categories you're talking about? Just trying to understand what the opportunity for growth there is on a per user basis?
And then my second question on the IMO, the percentage, you mentioned in the shareholder letter averages around 30% historically. So should we view that as perhaps a level that you would consider to be the normalized margin? And in that case, if you're earning above 30%, like you did this last quarter, that you might see opportunity to get more aggressive with your loan growth versus slowing it down when that percentage is lower? Thank you. So Marvin, I'd say with regard to our exposure for user, it depends on a couple of things. Probably the most important one is how fast we are growing our new profits. Typically, when we bring new users or borrowing, we get it to new either merchants or consumer's who starts with lower credit lines, and as those cohorts mature and we feel comfortable with users, we expand those plans.
So we expect for the older cohorts those numbers to continue funding and a lot of win for growth we have there, particularly, in the consumer side of the business because we really start very conservative limit.
On the other hand, we build new cohort and we are growing very fast. Typically, those -- the mix will change at these new clients, we have lower land. So FinTech will be the main driver.
On interest margin after losses, as you see from the new disclosures, those have fluctuated. And that's a consequence of new products, new segments, launches in new markets. And this is still the very early days of our credit business. And so we will continue to launch new products. We will continue to expand into new user segments, always prioritizing our confidence in the quality of the underwriting of our models.
So I don't think I would signal that this is a steady state. The more important thing and the reason we think that it's important to give this disclosure is that just looking at NPLs without understanding the pricing and the spreads is really an incomplete way of understanding our credit business.
And what you can see, if you look at any of the historical quarters, is that the iML [ph] are actually extremely healthy. And if you assume and cost of funding, you know it's close to market, and one of the big competitive advantages of MercadoLibre is that our cost to serve and our cost to acquire is extremely low because most of these users are already MercadoLibre or Mercado Pago users who we don't have to acquire and who we have multiple touch points with.
So this is a very profitable business for us and even as NPLs have increased, and part of that is just the math, we've been able to price risk very effectively, and the margins have been very healthy and have actually been better in the second quarter than the two prior quarters, which is why we continue to remain very confident with the credit business because not only is it a significant catalyst for more sales, for better sales for more working capital for our merchants, but it's also been a great business the way we've been managing underwriting and pricing. Yes. I definitely agree based on the results. Thanks so much, Pedro and Osvaldo. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous. Geoffrey Elliott, your line is open. Geoffrey Elliott, your line is open. We'll go to the next question, it comes from the line of Neha Agarwala of HSBC. Your line is open. Neha Agarwala, your line is open. Operator, it might seem like we have an issue with the lines. Ladies and gentlemen, please standby.
[Technical Difficulty] [indiscernible] Your line is open. Please go ahead. Yes, hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Just a couple of quick ones here. So firstly, GMV growth in the other markets. So ex the big three market is down, I think, 18% year-on-year. So perhaps you could just gives us a few points as to what's going on there? And then the second question just on Mexico, very, very decent margin there. I think probably the highest you've delivered on a quarterly basis in Mexico. You've already talked about kind of the areas where you were leveraging. I just wanted to ask if anything specific that you would call out that has contributed to that margin in Mexico? Thanks very much. Great. So the other segments, which includes all other markets, the largest market there is Chile. Chile is a market that had phenomenal performance last year. It grew 4x certain quarters. A significant part of that was driven by distributions on pension funds that spurred a very significant consumption boom last year. And so the comp is extremely, extremely tough. And the expectation was that that Chile would short-term decelerate because of the tough comp, when we take a longer-term look and we look at how that business has been growing over the two-year CAGR over a longer period of time, Chile is a significant outperformer and I think shows the increased potential that some of the smaller other markets still have for us. So it's entirely driven by comps in Chile, and slower growth in Colombia compared to other markets.
Mexico, I think what's interesting about Mexico since you asked the question is, this is the first profitable quarter out of Mexico in the last five years. If you recall, five years ago, we engaged in a very aggressive investment cycle, confident that long-term, if we invested in Mexico, given the size of the market, the potential of the market, eventually scale would kick in and Mexico would become a profitable business at a much larger size.
And additionally, it's allowed us to defend our leadership position where despite an incredibly competitive market, we still are market leaders. So I think this, for us, is a confirmation of the potential for Mexico to be a very large market and a profitable market as we emerge from the heavy investment cycle and start to reap some of the benefits of scale and of the investments made in the past.
I think this is a bit ahead of schedule. So this is not necessarily a trend in terms of short-term performance but it definitely confirms the conviction we had all along that Mexico will be profitable and also very large when we look at longer term. Excellent. Very helpful. Thanks. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse. Stephen Ju, your line is open. So I think on the disclosure, you once again called out fulfillment penetration having reached about 40% across your network. So -- are you basically at a point where you can start combining multiple items per delivery as of yet, or do you think we need to see a higher level of order density or fulfillment penetration in order to start doing that.
And one more on the fintech side, if I may. I think in the past, you've mentioned really access to asset management products for your wallet users as another sort of pillar for growth of your fintech revenue. So our recollection is that this has been out in Argentina for some time. So maybe it's a little bit more mature there versus the other regions. So is there anything you can share in terms of your users propensity or willingness to keep a balance in the wallet? Thanks. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line… No, sorry, sorry, sorry. No, operator, sorry. We haven't gotten there yet. Oh, okay. So do you want to start with the asset management? Yes. Let me start with the second part of the question with regards to user propensity to store balance in Mercado Pago. I think that we have seen increased balance in all of the countries, particularly -- so I'd say, in Argentina because on the one hand, we have the wallet where we're seeing easily lots of daily transaction and it's very convenient to have that store balance in order to pay those transactions easily. And what we have seen over the last year is an increase in the mix of payments that is to with store balance.
On top of that, we offer an Argentina Money Market Fund and that money market fund yields north of 30%, which is below inflation, but it's north of 30% larger that you get in the savings account, so it is really no ran as a user to have the money in Mercado Pago and being able to use it any time.
With regards to Brazil, the one thing we offer now is just interest on your balance in your account. But I'd say in the last few quarters, some of our competitors who used to offer this MT have stopped doing so, and that has made the Mercado Pago count more attractive. And we still, what we offer is pretty basic. And we are in the process of building better yielding products for Mercado Pago, and we expect this to increase. We believe that store imbalance in user account is a big part of our ambition to become -- to gain principality and being regarded as a full solution for basic banking. Great. On orders per shipment, so obviously, we already do that. All orders where more than one product come out of one fulfillment center, obviously, our multi-item per order. I think there are many drivers that we still can act on to drive up orders per shipment. It's true that fulfillment penetration is one of them, but incremental fulfillment penetration also comes with a growing number of warehouses.
So it's more complex than that. I think a lot of it is tied to the user interface and how we can drive larger shopping cards, but then increase the number of items per order and decrease, obviously, the unit economics on each shipment.
So I think I mentioned this last quarter. I would say this is still a lever that we're working on and where we can drive incremental operational efficiencies going forward. I think the number has been relatively stable for a few quarters. So there is opportunity there. Thank you. Our next question comes from Neha Agarwala of HSBC. Neha Agarwala, your line is open. Hi. I hope you can hear me now? We can hear you now. Perfect. Thank you for taking my question. I have three questions. First, a quick clarification on the Creditas comment in Mexico. Did you say that you were looking to do securitized credit on your own balance sheet in the future, or would you stick to the partnership model? I think we are open to having a combination of both things, but we'll have to wait and see. Okay. Clear. My second question is on the funding cost. Could you talk a little bit about how you fund your credit and the prepayment business? And how has your -- the combination of keeping it on your own balance sheet versus using third-party funding? How has that evolved? And where should we see this going forward?
And my last question is regarding asset quality. In the recent months, we have seen -- what changes have you implemented in the credit business? And here, I'm talking in terms of maybe ticket size or approval rates, et cetera, to prepare for a potential worsening in the asset quality cycle. Thank you. Great. So let me start with funding. The funding is done through multiple funding windows, and we believe that for the long-term health of the business, having available -- availability to multiple funding sources is the correct structure, and then we can vary between funding structures based on cost and depth of each different funding pool at different times.
So today, some of that is done through equity with a very attractive ROE. Some of that is done through SPVs or FIDCs specifically in Brazil, with some of our financial partners, Goldman Sachs and Citi being two of the largest.
And then increasingly in Brazil, we have, what would resemble retail funding, although, we are not a bank, which is the issuance of certificates of deposit, which is also one of our sources of funding.
In terms of the evolution over time, what you've seen is, increasingly over time a mix shift towards third-party funding as the business grows. And as the amount of equity that we're willing to commit to that, I think, has decreased.
We're confident that going forward, the combination of these third-party funding sources, plus incremental equity that we are willing to invest in the business, given the ROE, can fund the growth in the credit business for the foreseeable future. With regards to asset quality, I would say that during the last year, we have been growing aggressively our credit portfolio, focusing mostly on profitability, not in growth itself, but in profitability, and we have been able to do so by reaching out to riskier consumers, riskier merchants, and pricing accordingly. That's why we have seen despite taking more risk, we have been able to maintain margins and grow profitably.
Now as the -- I'd say the credit environment is looking more cautious. We are also becoming a little bit more cautious. And what we are doing is probably focusing more of those consumers we be more creditworthy and being more cautious on lowering offers or removing offers to those segments that are riskier. -- and we have started doing this actually this quarter, the third quarter is early, very early in the third quarter in the consumer business, and we have already started doing so in the credit card business in the prior quarter -- in the second quarter. Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous. Geoffrey Elliott, your line is open. Geoffrey Elliott, please go ahead.
We'll go to our final question in queue, which comes from the line of Sean Dunlop of Morningstar. Sean Dunlop, your line is open. Yes. Thanks for the question. Just a couple of quick ones on the commerce business. It looked like the third-party take rate declined a little bit year-over-year. I'm just sort of wondering what drove that, particularly given that the ads business is growing. Is that going to be category mix or higher shipping incentives, maybe higher-priced product that might see order fixed fees. It looks like that said the seller final value fees in the flat fee component. So, I've got one quick follow-up. Okay, great. So, I think it's down very slightly. It's about -- what is it, like 30 bps, primarily on increases in interest rate that compress some of the take rate on zero installment financing listing types and then also different growth rates, especially Brazil with lower grade growth than some of the other markets. Brazil is the highest take rate market.
Those two factors account for that 30 bp compression. I think year-over-year, it's actually up by 10 bps. In general, I would say it's a solid level of monetization around 16.5% to 17% that we've been able to sustain. Got it. That's helpful. Yes, I was looking specifically at that third-party business. But diving a little bit to first party, what's the long-term appetite for that? Obviously, a little bit slower here in the near-term, but is that still double-digit percentage of GMV in the long run? Yes. 1P clearly has a role to play in -- I guess, one way to simplify the strategic thought is, there are certain subcategories in our very wide selection where market structure of the third party market might not be the most efficient, either because there are very few suppliers, because third party merchants don't have access to competitive pricing, and that's typically where we'll step in with 1P.
I think it's fair to say that our long-term ambition of percentage of overall mix is in excess of single-digits. Exactly what it will be will depend a lot on our capacity to execute and how also our third party business evolves. Where it's incredibly efficient and there's less need for us to step in, then I think we will remain 3P and asset like where we can better serve our consumers by stepping in with a 1P offering, we will see that. So we need to monitor that over time, but it should continue to grow. Great. Thanks so much. Thank you. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pedro Arnt for closing remarks. Sir? Great. Thank you. So, really pleased with the quarterly results. I think we are delivering on a combination of growth above market with market share gains improving profitability. And one thing that hasn't been mentioned is also improvements in our cash conversion cycle, in our cash from operations and the increase in liquid assets that we have on our balance sheet. So, great quarter. I think the team has done phenomenal work, and we look forward to updating you after Q3. Thank you very much. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

Before we go on to discuss our results of the third quarter of 2022, I remind you that management may make forward-looking statements relating to such matters as continued growth prospects for the company, industry trends, and product and technology initiatives. These statements are based on currently available information and our current assumptions, expectations, and projections about future events.
While we believe that our assumptions, expectations and projections are reasonable in view of the currently available information, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.
Our actual results may differ materially from those included in this conference call, for a variety of reasons, including those described in the forward-looking statements and risk factor sections of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31st, 2021, and any of MercadoLibre Inc.’s other applicable filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on our investor relations website.
With that, let’s begin with a summary of our results.
Hello everyone. I'm pleased to have the opportunity to share some of the achievements and key messages from our third quarter of 2022 results. During Q3 we were able to deliver a strong combination of growth in Commerce and Fintech, with continued progress towards our annual targets for profit expansion.
Our operating margin expanded more than 500bps to 11%, contributing to quarterly profit of 296 million dollars, while operating cash generation was solid once again. This reflects the strong performance of our business, our ability to dilute costs as we scale, and our long-term commitment to delivering sustainable and profitable growth.
Our commerce business continues to show resilience amidst macro-economic challenges and as physical retail fully reopens, with GMV growing 32% on an FX-neutral basis. Our investments across the business over the last few years in technology have enabled us to improve our service levels significantly, and this is translating into market share gains across geographies both on a consolidated level and also across multiple product categories.
Logistics investments have been the other major contributors to the improvements in service levels, as our Mercado Envios managed network penetration hit 92% in the third quarter, up 5 percentage points over the last 12 months.
We are progressing our strategy to increase monetization, with our Ads business reaching 1.3% penetration of GMV, a small but steady increase on previous quarters. We delivered a series of improvements in our Ads tools, and we have a roadmap of technology improvements that is accelerating.
Mercado Pago had another exceptional quarter, with unique active Fintech users surpassing the 40 million mark for the first time. Off-platform TPV achieved its fourth consecutive quarter of triple-digit growth, reaching 23 billion dollars, with growth of 122%. Our MPOS business in Mexico and Chile made a strong contribution to this growth, as did QR in Brazil and our Digital Banking Account solutions in Argentina.
Mercado Credito's portfolio reached $2.8 billion, growing at a slower rate than in past quarters as we slowed originations.
This is a reflection of our prioritization of risk management and margin over growth. Our Credits business delivered a resilient financial performance, with annualized IMAL spreads rising quarter-on-quarter to almost 37%. Our early NPLs are stable versus the prior quarter, which is a reflection of the steps we took to mitigate risks in a weaker lending environment, particularly in Brazil.
With significant gross profit and operating margin expansion, we closed out another quarter of strong financial results that reflect the growth of higher margin business, our disciplined approach to short-term growth investments, as well as our focus on leveraging our scale to deliver cost dilution on COGS, Sales & Marketing and G&A expense lines.
This has enabled us to continue to invest in engineer headcount, which is reflected in higher Product & Development expenses as a percentage of sales, as we anticipated. A more detailed review of the third quarter operational and financial results is available in a shareholder letter, which is published on our Investor Relations website.
Before turning to the live Q&A section of today's earnings, I'll hand it back to Richard to go through some of the latest updates to the MELI user experience.
In our mission to democratize access to commerce and financial services, we continued to deliver improvements in the shopping experience of our marketplace.
One example of this is the short videos that can be found on the homepage of our e-commerce app, where our consumers can discover products and learn more details and features about the products they are looking to purchase. This introduces enjoyable content, a discovery element to the search experience, helps to promote user engagement, and for our sellers is a new channel for marketing and sales.
When shopping for apparel and fashion products offered by thousands of sellers, brands and official stores, the search experience matters. We improved the user experience of our fashion segment, and you can now browse through different product segments, lifestyles and brands. This enhances the discovery experience that is key for this category.
As buyers search for something they need, they have better filters to facilitate their search. This is another example of improvements that have been enabled by our continued investment in technology this year, but you can find much more on our app.
And, as always, we will deliver it quickly to your house so you can start using your new item as soon as possible. On the path to improving delivery times and bringing down logistics costs, we have introduced our crowdsourcing solution for the last mile in Brazil and México, leveraging on our service centers network.
With this innovation, our vans will take products destined for a high density delivery neighborhood to a service center that serves as a last mile facility, instead of delivering from door to door. From there, the drivers from our crowdsourcing platforms make the deliveries to our final consumers.
All of this is underpinned by technology developed by over 1,500 engineers that are dedicated to logistics. These developers continue to work on logistics projects like this that will make our network more effective and cost efficient, from inbound to delivery and returns. The Meli Places network has grown to almost 7 thousand locations, with over 99% enabled for pickup and returns.
On our path to democratize financial services across the LatAm region, we launched many products over the last 18 months. This includes debit and credit cards, savings and investments, crypto wallets, insurance, personal loans and many other products.
We now have a complete offering tailored to the needs of our users, allowing 36 million people to manage all of their financial services within our ecosystem, whether they are individuals or small, medium and large entrepreneurs. That enables us to position Mercado Pago as a digital bank, as we are now communicating in our more recent campaigns in Brazil. This is not just happening in Brazil, as the approval of our IFPE license in Mexico allows us to begin to market Mercado Pago and actively offers its tools to the country's large unbanked and underbanked population.
Mercado Libre will continue to deliver better products and services, focusing on the experience of our millions of users, with solutions tailored to their needs. To underline that commitment, we will have hired an additional 4,000 engineers by year-end, all of whom will work to develop and extend the competitive advantages of our ecosystem.
As always, the best is yet to come. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Ruben with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Hi. Thanks very much for the question. So, some strong results overall, but just to focus on credit and particularly the past due rate, so, when considering the moving pieces, you mentioned origination, loan performance and the 360 day dynamics, how do you see the evolution of this metric playing out? Really any color on the drivers when you think this past due cycle could end and what the necessary factors might be? Anything around that would be highly appreciated. Thank you. Hi, Andrew. This is Osvaldo. So, I think we – why we see the total receipts is fairly in line with what we expected when we look at the segments in terms of past due dates. We see that basically performing as we expected them to perform. We did see some degradation of maybe publically in Brazil mostly during the second quarter and that was when we started to limit the amount of loans we offered, particularly the personal loans and it is in the results, this quarter have been in line with what we expected.
Going forward, we don’t provide guidance, but we believe that probably interest rates in Brazil are close to – have peaked already or close to peaking probably next year. Should start coming down. It’s still too early to tell. Just Brazil elected the new President last week. So it’s still very early to tell that.
With that in mind, we expect that macro conditions will start to improve in Brazil which was the country we were more concerned about the degradation of personal loans. So I think that all is working according to what we expected. Very helpful. Thanks, Osvaldo. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Irma Sgarz with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Yes. Hi. Thank you for taking my question. So with ads now reaching 1.3% of GMV I was hoping you could just shed a little bit more light on what drove this quarter-over-quarter increase as you correct – as you pointed out it was just the small, but steady increase. So I was wondering if you already feel that you saw an impact from the launch of the new HQLs that you have been developing or if this is just much more something for the quarters to come off for even for 2023?
And a second quick question is, with encouraging metrics that you’ve posted once again around user growth and engagement I was wondering if you could perhaps just share your latest thoughts around shifting to a different perhaps two-tiered loyalty program going forward. Great. Thanks, Irma. So, on advertising, I think most of the roll out of the new product tools have come towards the end of the quarter. And the impact of those and this is obviously constantly evolving and improving product. I think we should see more in the upcoming quarters than the entire third quarter.
I think what we see in the third quarter is just the natural evolution of an advertising business where that there is very strong demand for despite the macro backdrop given where we play along the conversion funnel and as we continue to invest resources and roll out the tools that came out towards the end of the quarter but also new tools that we have, we continue to think that there is a lot of upside from our advertising solutions to come in the future.
In terms of loyalty, we continue to work towards launching a next version of the loyalty program. I think we’ve identified that where most of the value is, is in L6. We continue to see a strong evolution of users buying L6. The overwhelming majority of Level 6 users are purchased users and not users who have earned their way towards L6.
And so, we would hope to be launching a new version of the loyalty program in the upcoming quarters that really positions it increasingly better to be a subscription model with more and more benefits that we will continue to build for that highest level where a majority of the users will probably purchase. But we will continue most likely to offer the ability to be earned into that as well. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Thiago Macruz from Itau. Please go ahead. Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. Well, my first question is regarding MercadoPago’s cost of funding. You have been consistently bringing it down but arguably there is still some way to go to reach levels similar to those of your competition. Which alternatives do you feel you have to accelerate this process? If set, is it fair to say that your cost of funding keeps you from maybe entering any lower spread credit products today?
And my second question is regarding the World Cup and Black Friday, very unique combination at the end of this year. Should we expect it to become maybe a little bit more aggressive when your 1P product in the upcoming month? Thank you. So, let’s see. You are correct in saying that there is still room to continue to drive down the cost of funding through renegotiation in structures more use of CDDs. For the current segment where we participate and where we still think most of our focus will be, the quality of the underwriting is still by far the most significant driver of the margins in that business and less so incremental basis points or hundreds of basis points even that we can derive from cost of funding.
I think if you take a longer term view, then what you bring up is valid and as we look to penetrate higher income segments or pursue lower spread credit products, then we will have to continue expanding our cost of funding. Windows and alternatives to look for increasing the lower cost of funding. But that’s not a short-term priority right now. It’s more something that it’s in more of a mid-term roadmap.
In terms of fourth quarter, historically, the fourth quarter we do lean into it more in terms of the 1P business. You see that in the results last year where the profitability in the fourth quarter was significantly lower than prior quarters. But I think we continue to see a combination of a 1P business that has a better margin structure than it had last year. And overall business with a better margin structure.
And so, although there will be a ramp up in the pace of investment, I don’t encourage investors to assume that what happened last year is what we will replicate this year. I think the margin in the fourth quarter should be better this year than it was last year. So don’t extrapolate from prior year performance. Thank you very much. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Bob Ford with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Thank you. good evening, Pedro, Richard, Osvaldo and congratulations on the quarter. How is the ad penetration across geographies? And how do you expect that to evolve? And in that context, how should we balance the contribution margin in Brazil? And the outlook for that as well please.
And then, Richard, you mentioned nearly 7,000 places in the opening remarks. Can you provide some of your one year numbers for maybe the top three markets and describe any additional functionality besides the pickup and drop off that you are doing now please? Hey, Bob. So the margin structure for the advertising business is fairly consistent across geographies. It’s a very high margin business. I think we said EBIT margins are in the high 70s, low 80s. Attach rates or adoption do vary by geography. Mexico is the country with the highest attach rate. There is, I think a combination there of 1P business, but also simply how far we’ve executed and what the overall market dynamics are. But in general, I think with 1.3% of overall penetration, it’s still insipient in any of the geographies that we look at and we expect very solid growth over a multi-year period across all of the geos. That makes sense. And then, with respect to the contribution margin from Brazil, how should we be thinking about that? On advertising? No, the total contribution margin. It just seem to dip a little bit. Okay. It was the second question. Sorry, so, Brazil did have impression in contribution margin. A majority of that, you can explain really by top-line movement where our reticence to pass on incremental interest rate costs into the marketplace pricing unlike what we did off-marketplace generates a certain amount of compression in terms of take rates.
And when you combine that with investments that have continued to grow at a constrained pace but somewhat faster than what revenue growth is where you see that compression. I think the overall idea is, if we get a change in interest rate environment and just through natural scale, going forward, we don’t expect the Brazilian market to necessarily be one that doesn’t add incremental margin. But it should also be able to scale going forward. That makes sense. And then on places and functions, so it’s interesting. I think we’ve always said that places had potentially a very important role in adding notes to our logistics network. So for pickup, delivery and returns. Returns continue to grow in terms of percentage, but more importantly the customer satisfaction that that drives and ideally also better conversions. But if you look for example at Argentina, we began to see the other piece of the places thesis which is the creation of a cash in and a cash out network that has the potential to rival ATM machines. So these small store owners can make incremental revenue and drive incremental foot traffic by serving as cash in and cash out points and we are seeing strong execution on that front in Argentina and it’s something that we would look to mirror across all of the geographic footprint. Remember that we have these cangue points in Brazil, in Mexico and in Chile, as well. But right now, are you testing any other functionality around fintech or maybe apparel, something like a little wardrobe area for try things on and return right there? Those types of things. No, not yet. I think we need to be cautious with how much extra operational demands we overlay on these corner shops and small stores. So the focus right now is on the two biggest opportunities we see short-term, which are the nodes on the logistics network, drop-off, pickup, returns. And the ability to move money into and out of your digital wallets through these store fronts. Understood. Thank you very much. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Marcelo Santos with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Good evening, thanks for taking my question. I have two. The first is regarding fulfillment. It’s – the penetration has been kind of around 40% for a while. What has been the performance there? What are your woes regarding this modality? And the second is regarding logistic monetization. So I think a couple quarters ago, you said you’d start to experiment some way to differentiate the monetization or fulfillment. How has that been going? Maybe you can give some color geographically or in general? Thank you very much. Marcelo, thank you. So we continue to aspire to drive greater adoption of fulfilled by MELI in Brazil and across other markets. So we've invested in warehouses and the infrastructure that allows us to scale up and have a higher percentage of orders and purchases being made on MercadoLibre being fulfilled through us. And if you look at the evolution from Q3 to Q2, it was actually positive.
We added about 3 percentage points of adoption of fulfillment in Brazil, added three in Chile as well. So Mexico has always been the highest penetration. It's over two-thirds of all orders fulfilled from our fulfillment centers and the other markets we believe will continue to grow and trend towards a higher number.
We have to see what the end state there is. But we continue to try to improve the experience for sellers in terms of sending inventory to us, removing inventory when it's not having the right kind of turn performance. And all of these things eventually should help make it easier and more attractive for merchants to continue to send more and more inventory to our fulfillment centers.
Simultaneously, and this also explains the double act we are trying to carry out here. We have introduced monetization not only on low turning inventory, but simply on usage of our fulfillment centers. That obviously helps our P&L. But in a way, it generates a disincentive for merchants to send us inventory until they see that the added cost is more than offset by the improved conversion and lift in sales.
That monetization is still very timid. So we are talking something that's closer to $10 million a quarter of monetization than what its long-term potential could be. So it's still fairly slow because we are trying to carry out both the introduction of monetization, but more importantly continuing to grow the adoption of fulfillment. Perfect. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. One moment for the next question. Our next question comes from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Okay. Thank you. So, hi Pedro, I guess a follow-up question on the advertising business. So what about principal ad units that are driving the growth there? I think you talked about display as what sounds like sponsored search ad units. So, and also, how much more heavy lifting do you think you need to do on behalf of your sellers?
Because some of them will be very sophisticated and will understand how to run ad campaigns on their own, but others may need some help. So, can you talk about some of the advancements you may be driving with automation on their behalf? Thanks. Great. So, still, the vast majority of the monetization is on product ads. So the insertion of sponsored listings that are interspersed within search results are identified as a sponsored listing, but they appear in the middle of a search result.
We have growing capabilities and begin to see improved monetization in terms of display advertising and other more complex ways to work with larger merchants or even brands that want to promote the sales of their products either directly by themselves or from merchants that are already selling on the network. But that's still a smaller part of the revenue base and where a lot of the uptick can come from.
You are correct in saying that many of the merchants, especially the smaller merchants still have a learning curve. We see that very clearly when we look at the dollars invested per listing that we see from cross-border merchants, many of them coming from China and Asia that are much more sophisticated in terms of the use of advertising to help conversion rates.
So over time, we will have to work with the local Latin American merchant base, which is by far the largest merchant base, for them to be able to gain the level of comfort and also ability to use the advertising product as we see in those cross-border merchants. And that will be a combination of better tools and greater automation, which is what we've been working on and also simply education and also patience over time.
In the case of the larger brands and larger merchants, it was more a matter of having improved reporting capabilities and improved abilities to segment and generate audiences within MercadoLibre and a lot of the more recent rollouts in the back half of this quarter were really tailored around that, reporting capabilities and the construction of audiences.
So hopefully, as I answered in an earlier question, we'll begin to see the results of that over the next few quarters by seeing some of these larger brands and advertisers increasing their average spend on our platform. Thank you. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Marvin Fong with BTIG. Please go ahead. Great. Thank you for taking my question. A question on achieving the 40 million Fintech users for the quarter, I think in terms of percentage growth and as well as absolute new users, this is the best quarter in recent memory. Just could you comment on any particular things that you think drove this higher adoption rate? Or do you think it was just general trends towards more Fintech usage?
And then a second question, just on contribution margins. I did note the decline in Brazil, but also Argentina increased pretty significantly even in U.S. dollars. What drove that improvement? Is it because the mix of Fintech in Argentina is higher and that's a higher-margin category compared to Commerce? Hi, Marvin, so with regards to the Fintech users per quarter, I would say that this has been a year where we decreased the incentives we have been giving users to use our products, particularly we decreased mostly in the first and second quarter. In the past, we were offering more incentives and discounts for people to try our QR codes or pay utilities with or top their mobile phones using our wallet.
We stopped pretty much doing all of that. And so I would say that it's more organic, the growth we are seeing now. And the focus has been mostly on increasing engagement, increasing principality, and having our users come and try different use cases and the larger possible amount of product flows.
In terms of what are we going to do to continue doing that, it's mostly we continue rolling out new products and services. And in different countries, I would say today that the focus is at a given level in Argentina, Brazil and Mexico and only now we're starting to roll out more products to Chile. So there's room for us to continue with these rollouts and this growth. Sure. In Argentina, what we see is, yes, there's an increase in participation from Fintech. In Argentina, the Fintech business in general is also higher margin than in other markets given the scale that we've already reached there.
I think one interesting data point is the digital account and the wallet in Argentina are already breakeven or actually slightly positive in terms of margin structure. That's interesting because for us, it shows the way that ideally other markets will evolve over time as those businesses grow and gain scale.
And then, so on the back of that kind of high-level growth, some of that's burned by inflation, there is also a greater ability to dilute costs in general. So, both at the gross profit level and also a direct contribution level, there is a significant amount of cost dilution given a much higher rate of growth of local currency revenues than the expenses that are mostly denominated in local currencies as well. That’s terrific color. Thanks, Osvaldo and Pedro. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Deepak Mathivanan with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Great. Thanks for taking the question. So first, given the recent sort of changes in political climate in Brazil, do you anticipate any operational or sort of business strategy changes over the next maybe 12, 24 months in any areas that we should be aware of?
And then maybe second question, Pedro, can you give us some color on the current profitability on the e-commerce segment? With advertising scaling and obviously, logistics monetization kind of coming through in many markets, how should we think about maybe at a high level, contribution from e-commerce to the total profitability over the next 12 months? Thank you so much. Great. So the answer to the first question is no. No change in strategy derived from any change in political governments. I think our business has thrived over the past 20-plus years throughout the entire region and has gone through multiple changes in Presidents and ideological lean of governing parties, and that's never changed our strategy.
I think our users inform our strategy and the enormous need for digital commerce and digital payment that exists across the region. I think both on the e-commerce side and on the fintech side, the story and the way we're trying to manage the P&L continues to be, first and foremost, for growth and continued market share gains and hold our leadership position.
But we believe that given the scale we have, some incremental profit engines that we found in the different commerce and fintech businesses, whether that be advertising, credit, the MPOS business, we can combine that growth with consistently delivering incremental EBIT over the upcoming periods. At least that's the aspiration in terms of the financial model. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Kaio Prato with UBS. Please go ahead. Hello everyone. Good evening. Thanks for the questions. I have two on my side here regarding Mercado Credito, please. So we can see that the overall margins of your credit business actually expanded on a quarter-over-quarter basis. But if you take a look in your provision coverage, you actually reduced it if we look on 30 days or 90 days.
So just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about your provision coverage going forward. If in the next quarters, we should see – should we expect an increase in the provisions as a percentage of total portfolio in order to increase the short-term coverage ratio again or not, if this is a matter only of lower origination?
And the second one is around your appetite towards the end of the year and the beginning of next year in terms of origination. If you are already originating more during October or not and what is the strategy going forward, as well? Thank you. Hi Kaio, we disclose more information this quarter in the shareholder letter, but there's -- it's clearly broken down how our current and 1 to 90 days past due or 90 days past due is provisioned in our portfolio. And when you look at that, you can see that basically, we are provisioning pretty much 93% of all of the loans that are over 90 days past due and over two-thirds, 68% of those that are between 1 and 90 days past due.
So I think that we have been very conservative in our provisions. We continue to be. We have remain using the same way to provision bad debt, and we have been very, very conservative. The increase you see in NPLs is related mostly to us slowing down the originations and having an average duration of about two months and keeping the bad loans in our books for a full year. But it's mostly related to that.
With regards to year-end and early next year, as you know, we provide a guidance. So far, what we have done is reduce the volume of origination. And as we see conditions improve, we will reverse that, but we're not giving guidance on when that should happen. Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous. Please go ahead. Hi, hello. Thanks very much for taking the question. On this topic of credit and when you can ramp up originations again. I mean the way you describe trends during the third quarter, it's kind of in line with what you expected. It doesn't sound like things fell off a cliff. So what is it now that is stopping you from ramping back up? What would you need to see to get more profit on credit origination. Is it something in your portfolio? Is it something on the macro side? What do you need to see there? So Geoffrey, what we did during the last end of the second quarter and during the third quarter, basically, we have scored users in 12 segments. And those that were lower ranking, we stopped offering them both personal loans and buy now pay later. Those that were a little bit better ranked but still not so high up, we stopped offering them personal loans. And we – but we continue to offering them buy now pay later.
The good news that we saw is that we believe in hindsight that we took the right decision. This was a wise decision because on the one hand, those segments where we continue offering loans were profitable. And on the other hand, we kept control groups for those groups where we were not -- where we stopped offering loans and those who have not been profitable.
So I think that we took a wise decision. And now we continue offering loans in terms of control groups. When we see conditions improving, we will be able to ramp up those segments again. And if I can add a 30,000 foot here, I think the way we've always constructed MercadoLibre is with a long-term view we're not looking to maximize the size of the credit portfolio over the next 2 or 3 quarters. We're looking to build a very healthy and sustainable credit book and business over 10 years.
And so I think we've said from the beginning that we would slow down when we thought that the quality of the underwriting merited that and make sure that we don't put the credit organization under any pressure to accelerate unless they are very comfortable that it's the right time to start accelerating originations again. So I think we will continue to manage it in that conservative fashion. Thank you. And also one of the Fujikis that made a way that would allow it to buy the loans, as well as consumer and merchant loans. How soon could you start doing that originating auto loans and funding them through the Fujiki channel? Not sure I fully understood the question. So there was a change in the offering memorandum of one of your Fujikis improved in the last few weeks to allow it to hold auto loans. So the question was, are we going to see your Fujiki holding auto loans soon? How are they going to be originated? What was behind that change? Okay, auto loans was the question. Sorry, I apologize. We didn't pick up on that. So, we are going to take our time over the next few quarters to make sure we build out the product, we build out the user experience. We test the risk models. So don't expect any rapid ramp-up of auto loans. It is a segment that we're interested in.
It's one that, over the long run, should be one of the multiple credit segments that we move into. But we are still in the process of building out the product, building the user experience, testing product market fit and gathering data for the models. So it's not something that will be material in any way over the next few quarters. Perfect. Thanks very much for those answers. Thank you. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Neha Agarwala from HSBC. Please go ahead. Hi, thank you for taking my question. Congratulations on the results. On your credit book, could you give us some light -- throw some light on how the – your underwriting models have performed across the geographies. Has one geography performed better than the other versus your expectation and also across the different verticals, so across consumer loans and merchant loans.
I noticed that the duration for the merchant loan book has gone down quarter-on-quarter. Is that on purpose? Or is that the kind of the one that you're seeing?
And the second is on secured lending products, are you looking given the current environment where you're being cautious on the unsecured lending products, are there new secured lending products like, say, a collateralized credit card where you are looking to grow to compensate for the slow growth in the unsecured side? Thank you so much. I would say that – let me start with the first part with regards to the different geographies and different products. So I think, again, we have three main geographies and mostly two or three products, merchant loans, which are split in online and in-store and then consumer loans. And each of those 9 categories were profitable during the quarter.
I would say that probably, we saw more pressure mostly on Brazilian consumers, and that is where we took the – we became the most restrictive with regard to our loans, and that was compensated with higher profitability and higher margins in Argentina. But all in, our IMAL numbers improved for the quarter. So we are happy with the results that we have seen. On top of that, sorry, merchant margins also improved, both in Brazil and Mexico. On collateralized credit cards or other secured lending, let me just separate. This is not a consequence of slowing down the unsecured lending. I think one of the beauties of MELI is we are not solely a financial institution that needs to grow the credit business in order to continue delivering growth and margin expansion.
Credit for us is a business that serves as a driver of more volume and sales and more wallet adoption and usage in our transactional businesses but we're not under any undue pressure to grow it because it is our core revenue stream. And so that allows us to pace ourselves going back to my previous answer.
So I don't think we get into the more secured lending product because we're having to slow down unsecured. Those have always been attractive segments that have been within our view of what the product road map would be. Collateralized loans, credit cards is one alternative. We mentioned auto loans. We've talked in the past about payroll loans.
But those are all things that are in the future. So right now, some of those are being built like the auto loan product. Others are just ideas. Eventually, we'll get there, but not as a consequence of what's happening in the unsecured lending businesses, which, by the way continue to be very profitable and actually expanded margins despite the macro headwinds. Perfect. If I can just follow-up on that, have you been raising prices even in the third quarter for your loan products passing on the higher funding cost or passing on the higher risk perception that you have? Or are you largely done with the repricing initiative for the lend loans? So, yes, there has been an increase in APRs as a consequence of an anticipation in certain deterioration of credit performance in the mid-risk segments. And for the lower risk segments, we actually turn those off in many aspects. But so yes, there has been a price increase in anticipation of weakening performance. And we should continue to expect that in the fourth quarter as well? Or do you think you're largely where you should be? I think let's talk about the fourth quarter when we report the fourth quarter. It's still early in the quarter. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from João Soares with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Thanks. Thanks for taking the question. Just two quick ones from my side. The first one, Pedro, you mentioned the profitability of your ad business currently at 70 – low – high 70s, low 80s EBIT margin. Can we expect -- I mean, as this business changes, is this margin sustainable? How should we see this margin in the medium long run? That's my first question.
The second question is a more broader question. When you take into consideration, I mean, you're basically stepping back on certain initiatives that have been dragging margins, right? And you're -- right now, as you revised the underwriting of the credit card business and reduced origination, you're also lowering at least as a percentage of net revenue, you're probably going to lower your provision.
So it seems just to me, everything points out to constructive margin at least in the medium run. So just wondering how – what can you share in terms of messages on all those moving parts in terms of how should we see those margins going forward? I know you don't provide guidance, but just anything you can share would be very helpful. Thanks. Sure. So, on advertising, we've said that we are going to start accelerating the rate of engineers that we allocate to the advertising businesses. We see very encouraging signs in terms of how big this could be. We see very strong product market fit and are getting very good feedback from advertisers. And so that probably implies that as we try to accelerate the revenue base and the penetration of GMV, those investments could compress those margins somewhat.
I think we give out the high 70s to low 80s just to give a clear indication that even if you assume a ramp-up in investment to accelerate growth, this is still incredibly accretive to overall margins and an incredibly attractive business. But I think it's fair to expect that as we accelerate growth, by throwing more resources at it and most of that is actually research and development and engineers, you could see some margin compression.
I think you're right, we don't guide bigger picture. What we've said is that we have made sure to be constantly reviewing our portfolio of revenue streams, and many of these revenue streams are newer revenue streams with negative EBIT margins.
But that we have confidence that, over time, will grow into profitable businesses and to differentiate between the ones where we believe we should continue to invest aggressively and others where we are not going to give up. There are no changes in strategy or tactics, but we think that we can wait because they're strategically potentially less critical.
So certain areas like supermarket, for example, there has been a strong effort to improve the margin structures there, and we're seeing good results so that we can reaccelerate as quickly as possible. That's the largest category in terms of household spend and one that as we improve the margin structures, we can accelerate again.
Others where potentially we think there's time, we can wait and not have to carry as steep losses as something that for us is a priority. So I think the takeaway I'm trying to transmit here is our strategy hasn't changed over the last few quarters.
Tactically in this market, businesses that are very EBIT negative and that we don't see a strategic imperative, we're comfortable slowing down their growth. But there still are some where we continue to invest.
And then on the two other fronts, which are engineering headcount and product development salaries and wages and also the rollout of our logistics network, we've said that we've continued to invest aggressively there. We called out in the video, 4,000 engineers that we'll be adding this year. That's the same number that we had planned towards the end of last year and that remained unchanged for 2023.
So again, I think being reiterative, we continue to aspire for growth for market share gains and we think we can deliver that while also increasing our EBIT generation on an annual business. That's the financial model that we're striving to deliver. Very clear. Thank you. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Sean Dunlop with Morningstar. Please go ahead. Awesome. Thanks for the question. It sounds like we're fairly constructive on the macro at least taking all those comments about Brazil and it was great to see ongoing market share gains. I guess I'm just wondering how we can think about buyer health in some of the key geos, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico? Any sort of color regarding the cadence of spend during the quarter?
If you saw a good drop off towards towards the back half and the last month would be helpful among certain demographics or geographies.
And then, to the extent that we did see a downturn, would it be appropriate to look towards in 2014 to '16 or 2009 as an analog? Or are there maybe features of the business today that would render it more or less recession-resistant than these periods? Great. So let me take those in reverse order. Historically, our business has been resilient. We've never said countercyclical, but we do think that because of the breadth of selection that a marketplace can offer in tougher macro conditions, consumers have the ability to trade down while continuing to shop from us.
Now we have to see what happens. I wouldn't try to linearly extrapolate 2014 to 2016, because when you look at the overall percentage of retail, not even online retail, just overall retail that MELI represents today versus what it did in 2014 or 2016, that's changed significantly, and we need to see what happens.
More importantly, the first part of your question, and again, it's still early and really the peak period in Q4 is about to come about. So we'll have to see what happens. But we don't see any indications of any significant weakening in consumer spend so far.
Again, we'll address the full fourth quarter when we reconvene in February. But so far across most of the geos, nothing significant to report. Argentina potentially is the country where we are seeing some level of weakening. But elsewhere, nothing to call out at this point and we'll go through the full quarter in February. Awesome. Really appreciate it. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from John Colantuoni with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Hi,this is Chris checking in for John. Thanks for taking my question. So your marketplace has been gaining share in Brazil over the past year. Can you just talk about what you think are the most impactful drivers of that outperformance? And then again, what gives you confidence kind of in the business' ability to continue those share gains going forward? Thank you. We've been investing behind this business for over 20 years. I think we have an unparalleled tech team that's really, if you look at the pace of innovation on the user experience over the last two years, it's dramatically increased in quality and quantity of output and I think our users begin to see that in the experience. We've expanded our selection.
We've gotten a lot better category management and we see that with market share gains in Brazil, if we look at our data, not only on a consolidated basis but also across most categories. And that's a reflection of more verticalized category experiences.
Obviously, the overlay of our logistics network is a critical part to that, a network that today in Brazil, nearly 90% of all deliveries are done through what we call MELI logistics, so 3PLs that we control most of the routing and the experience.
Pago is increasingly a differentiator on marketplace, the availability of credit, the ease of payment. So again, I think we are now reaping the benefits of investments that we've been carrying out over the past five, six years. Great. Thanks so much. I am showing no further questions at this time. I'd now like to turn it back to Pedro, MercadoLibre's CFO, for closing remarks. Thanks, everyone. Thanks for the questions. We, and the whole MELI team have a big fourth quarter coming up, moving into the peak season. So, back to work for us and like we said, we'll be able to go over the fourth quarter when we speak to you again in February.
We look forward and until then, bye-bye, everyone. Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect.","Mercado Libre earnings conference call for the quarter ended September 30, 2022 . today we will share our quarterly highlights on video . we will begin our live Q&A session with our chief financial officer .",1.0

Thank you for joining us. I'm Richard Cathcart, Investor Relations Officer at MercadoLibre.
Today, we will share our quarterly highlights on video, after which we'll begin our live Q&A session with our Chief Financial Officer, Pedro Arnt; and President of our FinTech business, Osvaldo Gimenez.
Before we go on to discuss our results for the fourth quarter of 2022, I remind you that management may make and this presentation may contain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the disclaimer on screen, which will also be available in our earnings materials on our Investor Relations website and our Form 10-K for the year ended 2022.
With that, let's begin with a summary of our results. Hi, everyone. I'm happy to share the key messages about MercadoLibre's performance during the fourth quarter of 2022 and the year as a whole. We're particularly pleased to have been able to deliver an attractive combination of growth and profitability throughout the year. Alongside strong operational KPIs and market share gains all while sustaining a high level of investment in products and technologies. We've successfully navigated a challenging environment, and we've reached new records across the business despite uncertainty around consumer spending, interest rates and inflation.
With a strong fourth quarter, we end 2022 with record results in GMV, TPV, item ship and net revenue as well as EBIT. Revenues for example, for the first time ever, surpassed the $10 billion mark for the quite a milestone for our company. EBIT also came in at a new landmark level, surpassing $1 billion while delivering margin expansion. And perhaps even more unique is the combination of record EBIT and margin expansion while still growing revenues at roughly 50% year-on-year.
During 2022, MercadoLibre strengthened its leadership of the e-commerce market in Latin America. As our data indicates that we achieved market share gains across the entire region with Brazil and Mexico standing out. These market share gains are grounded in our consistent investment and execution around all aspects of our commerce value prop and also an extended period of time.
Our ability to offer a very broad product assortment from sellers of all sizes at competitive prices and with fast deliveries continues to be a key differentiator for the company. The profitability of our commerce business also improved substantially year-on-year during the fourth quarter helped by the expansion of Mercado ads revenues, better management of promotional budgets, a healthier margin on 1P merchandize sales and the continued overall scaling of our business.
Development of technology for Mercado Ads has been a major focus during 2022, increasing presence of ads and their monetization as well. Ads penetration, for example, grew another 10 basis points in the fourth quarter, despite strong growth of GMV, while maintaining its attractive EBIT margins. We still see plenty of opportunities for ads growth ahead of us as we continue to improve technology to better serve our advertisers.
2022 was also a fantastic year for Mercado Pago, with TPV growth exceeding our expectations while delivering take rate expansion on a year-over-year basis. On the acquiring business, first of all, we maintained our strong growth and margin performance, driven by QR payments and our POS business in Brazil, Mexico and Chile. On the other side of Pago, the digital accounts business, both payments and cards TPV continued to grow at triple digits in 2022, highlighting the traction in becoming the digital account of choice of our users.
Mercado Credito performed well in the fourth quarter once again and in the year as a whole, positively contributing to our profit growth despite tougher economic conditions. Throughout the year, we were able to manage the performance of our book closely and us to the changing realities. These effective risk controls resulted in record profits. We remain optimistic about the positive ecosystemic effects of Mercado Credito as well going forward.
2022 has been a year of adjustments on the other hand, for the credit card product. But with improvements to the underwriting models, we've seen a much improved performance from the most recent cohorts on the credit cards. That leaves us encouraged by the performance of that product, which will remain a key element of the wider Mercado Pago value proposition and strategy going forward. All of these credit products complement our wider Mercado Pago offering, for which 2022 has been an important year terms of broadening the scope of financial services we're able to offer.
We think we now have a product stack in place that is sufficient to meet our core day-to-day needs, which will enable us to accelerate our efforts to achieve principality within that user base. All of these strong results have been made possible by top-notch execution from the team and discipline in leveraging our scale to deliver continued cost dilution. You have a much more detailed review of all of these fourth quarter operational and financial results made available to you both in our shareholder letter and also presentation, which are published on our Investor Relations website.
With that, before turning to the live Q&A section, I'd like to hand it back to Richard to go through some of the latest business and product updates of the quarter and year. Thank you. 2022 was another important year for investments in technology at MercadoLibre. And today, we want to share some of the key impacts these investments have delivered to our ecosystem as we continue on our mission to democratize commerce and financial services in Latin America.
We're now able to offer a full stack of day-to-day financial services and products to our millions of Mercado Pago users after 18 months of intense technology deployment. We are leveraging our data in order to cross-sell new products and services to our users.
Users of our digital account and have access to debit and credit cards, along with QR code payments and an online transfers, making Mercado Pago more useful for their day-to-day needs. This is an important step in building towards achieving principality. Mercado Pago also offer saving buckets dedicated to our users' specific objectives and they are able to choose from different risk profiles with a minimum investment of just BRL 1 in Brazil.
Users can now also make investments in a quick and simple process by the Mercado Pago app. This includes banking deposit certificates from our financial institution with a fixed rate and more recently, users in Brazil have actions to three simple investment funds.
Mercado Pago also offers different insurance options to suit our users' needs with life, personal accident and online transactions insurance. This offers protection against uncertainties that many of our customers may face in their daily lives. Now with a complete product stack, Mercado Pago is well positioned to become a leading financial services provider in the region, enabling us to foster financial inclusion across the region.
Our commerce platform currently serves million sellers by offering a world-class experience we've surpassed the mark of 1.1 billion items sold in 2022. We are investing in technology to continue to improve the online shopping experience of our users as we believe this will drive more retail spend online, particularly in categories where e-commerce penetration is low. We deployed improvements to several categories in 2022, including home decor, fashion and beauty and Auto Parts.
For example, in the auto parts category, we have simplified the surge and filters in order to create a more specialist experience whilst in the home and decor category, we've further developed our discovery lab navigation experience.
New features have enabled sellers to promote their products in different formats. Short videos recorded by sellers to promote their products have reached millions of monthly views. And improvements in our advertising fuel have increased the presence of out in product pages. MercadoLibre continues to have the fastest delivery times in all of our key geographies. We're also investing in technology to improve the efficiency of our logistics network. And in 2022, we were able to deliver significant improvements in the productivity of our fulfillment centers, which means that even with a higher penetration of fulfillment deliveries, our overall net shipping cost as a percentage of GMV remained broadly flat year-on-year.
Our MELI Places network grew to over 7,000 locations with over half of the returns already done through places. These returns have a higher NPS than other actions, such as the local postal service. For buyers that choose to pick their items up from the MELI Places network, the NPS is the same, the deliveries made to the buyer's homes. We also delivered improvements in lead times with the MELI Air operations reducing over one day in lead times as well as optimizing costs.
We ended 2022 with a stronger ecosystem and great opportunities ahead of us, and we are as confident as ever that the best is yet to come. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Andrew Ruben from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Hi, thanks very much for the question and detail. You made a comment in the release about operating in a fast-changing competitive landscape in Brazil. I'm curious if you could elaborate and specifically in that type of competitive environment, as you run your business, what changes and what not? Hi, Andrew. So in general, I think the area we operate in, both consumer commerce and FinTech and specifically the technology areas are low barrier of entry, high competitive markets which generate extremely dynamic market situations and structures. And I think one of our characteristics over the last 20 years has been speed to adapt and speed to change course, while at the same time, having a very clearly defined long-term focused strategy. And that's what we consistently refer to when we talk about how dynamic this is.
Our long-term vision for what we're building is very consistent. The areas we focus on our consumers, our merchants, the quality of our products and our technology has remained incredibly consistent over time. And tactically, we try to adapt very quickly to changing market dynamics, to changing technological dynamics and consumer habits. And we think that we've served our consumers and shareholders well because of that speed of adaptation that we've built into our culture and how we operate. Great. Thank you. And if I could just follow up quickly, in terms of how you're thinking about the 1P business. I know it was an area that slowed down a bit in the past year, but you've talked about a greater opportunity over time. Any updated thoughts about how you're feeling about that business, the economics, et cetera? Thank you. So we've continued to see improvements, first and foremost, in capabilities, how we operate the technology that we've built in-house to run that business in terms of pricing, buying and promoting. And a consequence of those improvements and capabilities has been improved PPMs and better economics coming out of the 1P business. So that bodes well in terms of our expectations going forward for the 1P business and that we feel we are closer and closer to the point where the combination of capabilities and also what those P&Ls look like allow us to reaccelerate that business again sometime over the next few quarters. Very helpful. Thank you. Thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Irma Sgarz from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Yeah, thanks for the opportunity. The CapEx for the year came in just a bit lower -- actually quite a bit lower than we had maybe imagined at the outset of the year. And obviously, no negative impact to the overall results there. But I was just trying to think a little bit how you would characterize maybe the path for CapEx going forward, just what you still have to deploy specifically on the fulfillment of the technology side within those fulfillment centers and automation equipment, et cetera, as you take your logistics network to the next level?
And then shifting to payments in the release, you point to share gains that you've been driving in the MPOS business in Brazil as you've been shifting little bit more upmarket. Can you talk about what -- how your offering is different from the competitors and how crowded you see that space? And as a function of that, sort of how you're seeing -- how you're thinking about room for pricing adjustments? And how you expect churn to develop? Sorry, Irma. So let me take the CapEx one first. If you look at the cash profile that we delivered both in the fourth quarter and full year 2022, I think '22 was a stellar year in many aspects. Cash generation was one of them, both from an operational cash flow, but also some of the disclosures we offer in the PowerPoint around available cash and change in free cash generation.
Part of that cash generation was because we are operating close to peak utilization in some of our geographies in terms of our logistics and CapEx -- logistics fulfillment centers and sortation centers. So we do anticipate some incremental investments when we look at '23 versus '22 in terms of CapEx primarily on the logistics front as we build incremental capacity that we are needing in some markets, primarily in Mexico.
In terms of the other big CapEx item, which is developers and capitalized product development, I think what you're seeing going forward is a bit of a slowdown in the pace of net new adds of developers. I think we're still going against most others in that we continue to hire, but probably at a somewhat more measured pace than we had been adding engineers over the past few years. So that will also, in a way, generate a lower cadence of capitalized R&D when we look into the future years. But net-net, '23 should come in higher than '22 did in terms of CapEx, at least, as we see it right now. With regards to the payment question regarding our POS and our move up market in Brazil, in Brazil and in all of the regions, it's something we are very excited about. When we look at how we have been able to grow TPV. It's not because we are selling a whole lot more devices than we were a year ago, but rather because we have been able to significantly increase the TPV per device. And this has been driven by rolling out and deploying larger pulling out the products that we believe are more robust that have better connectivity, better approval rates and better NPS than we had in the past, and that is recognized by some of our users. And so what we are seeing is a significant increase in this [Indiscernible] for device.
And also, we are deploying a larger the sales force than we did in the past. Most of it is a third-party sales force is not our own, but nonetheless, they enable us to scale in the SMB segment. Thank you. Thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Marcelo Santos from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Hope you can hear me. The question is about the provisioning on the credit business. I think in the presentation, you mentioned that the provisioning went down partially because of better credit quality. Does this mean that you reduce the amount that you provision for -- in terms of like late past to payments? So I think in the previous quarter, you showed a range of how much you provision per cohort. Did that change because you improved the quality or it didn't change? Thank you. Hi, Marcelo. I think let me describe in more detail what has happened over the last few quarters. As you recall, during the second quarter towards the end of the second quarter, as we saw that market conditions were worsening. We decided to be more restrictive and to lower our exposure to higher-risk segments. That has been the case for the third and fourth quarter, and we're in each of the countries and each of the businesses we lower our exposure to the higher risk segment.
As a consequence of that, we had lower NPLs and that reduction in NPLs drove a reduction in provisions. But nonetheless, as we are originating loans that are less risky, the new provisions have slowed down proportionally. Nonetheless, they accurately reflect our best estimate of what the risk is. So we are comfortable with the level of provisions we have. It's just reflecting an improvement in the risk we are taking. Thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Robert Ford from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Thank you very much. Hey, Pedro, Osvaldo, Richard. Congratulations on the quarter. And thanks for taking my question. Pedro, how are you thinking about the disruption to our relative competitive advantage and near-term market share opportunities? And is that dislocation having any impact on the promotional support from suppliers in key categories? Hey, Bob, thanks. So in a way, it's a continuation of the answer to Andrew's question at the beginning. Our strategy has never been driven by what competitors are doing or not doing, but much more focused on what we're doing and our consumers.
On a tactical level, I think if there are market share opportunities that become available, then without changing strategy, we will see how we can potentially lean into those and try to take advantage. And in some of those shares or gain some of those share gains that are being lost potentially by our competitors.
So we are seeing the market being disrupted in some ways positive, in some ways negative. And we do have short-term tactical plans to see how we can potentially take advantage of that. But again, I think much more importantly, from a strategy perspective from the business lines that we're trying to develop, nothing changes as a consequence of what might or might not happen going forward with That makes sense. And in terms of the Ad business, can you provide a little bit more color in terms of the incremental functionality on the ad server and the demand side platform as well as any expected timing of improvements? Yeah. So I think over the last probably two or three quarters, we've been very consistent about talking about the new product deployment and how we've accelerated our focus and investments on technology and ad tech business. We've doubled the engineering headcount there -- probably half a year.
We also, I think, have been very consistent in saying that between the product launches and the technology improvements and when we actually see the results coming in, there is a lag, and it's hard for us to predict how long that lag might take. And so we'll need to see how that plays out throughout most of this year.
We've continued to push significant product enhancements in the advertising business in Q4 and into the beginning of '23. And so we remain optimistic about eventually being able to reap the returns of those improved investments in the ad stack and hopefully, we'll be able to report something over the next few quarters. We continue to see constant penetration gains from advertising revenues as a percentage of GMV, and that continues to be one of the most attractive revenue streams when we look at the margin structure there.
So I guess we all are very focused on this, and let's keep you posted as we go forward into the year and how the results begin to flow in. Yeah, we'll look forward to. Thank you very much. Thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Thiago Macruz from Itau. Your line is now open. Hi, guys. First, congratulations on the quarter. Two questions from us. First, regarding the Mercado Credito business, I think that achieving a lower cost of funding is key here. And I just want to understand if that is entirely dependent on the e-wallet, reaching further users and principality, or if there's another avenue to that end?
And a follow-up on the ads question just a few minutes ago. Is it fair to say that technology is not a restriction for the marginal growth of the business and rather generating further demand by eventually showcasing the economics of what you guys are offering from the seller standpoint? Those are my two questions. Thank you. Hi, Tiago. I would say we have started to grow the CDBs we offer to users -- and we, in the past, used to do this through third parties until then we have done more and more throughout the -- since we launched it in the fourth quarter. Still, I don't I think has had yet relevant impact in the overall cost of funding because we are paying -- since we are promoting the growth of CDBs at Mercado Pago, the cost we have is similar to the one we are getting from third parties. But as we expand this, this could be relevant in the future. But so far, I think it's still early days of our funding with CDB. Thank you. Sorry, one second. There was a second part to the previous question. On the ads piece, Tiago, if I understood the question correctly, we do think that technology is not just a nice to have or an additional benefit. It is a core necessity of being able to scale out the advertising business and have it reach the long-term size that we would like to reach.
So the improvements we've made in terms of incremental positions and inventory for advertising -- the improvements in the ad server technology that delivers display advertising throughout the platform. The launch of a self-service DSP platform for ad displays. The improvements in self-service reporting for advertisers to be able to see their results in near real time and react to that quickly.
And equally important, the ability to better target audiences within the -- so all of the focus in terms of technology over the last few quarters, probably begins to put us on equal footing with some of the largest and most successful technology platforms before we simply weren't there.
So this really is, I would say, a necessity to have launched this technology and get it right. We're very encouraged by the fact that it's now out there. And hopefully, we'll see over the there's adoption of all these different pieces of the stack deliver the kind of results that we Fantastic. Thanks, guys. Thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott from Autonomous. Your line is now open. Hello, thanks very much for taking the question. The release talks about a sequential increase in fulfillment penetration looks like in Brazil, Mexico, Chile, kind of across the board. Can you give us a bit more detail on that and update on where we stand on charging for fulfillment? Thank you. So in terms of the model, we charge for both rental space, and we charge for inventory that doesn't rotate quickly enough and generates inefficiencies in terms of floor space. What we've been saying over the last few quarters is that we have dual objectives of introducing monetization behind fulfillment yet at the same time, still push adoption and usage of that service primarily outside of Mexico to Mexico-like levels are in the direction of Mexico-like levels. And in a way, those two levers are opposing levers. And so we've introduced the full model, but we've kept pricing relatively low.
If you look at the fourth quarter results, the monetization overall in the logistics operation in Mercado Envios was actually higher. So we have gradually been dialing up monetization around the cost side of logistics services, in part to offset cost increases and also in part to better reflect the services we're offering. But it's still being done so at a very gradual pace. Again, repeating myself, bearing in mind that we still need to drive significant penetration growth in fulfillment, primarily in Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Argentina that are still 20-plus percentage points behind Mexico in terms of adoption.
So it will be a very gradual and steady process. It will be a gradual and consistent process over the next many years. But I wouldn't expect any significant step functions in terms of monetization, not anytime in the near future at least. Great. Thank you. Thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Jamie Friedman from Susquehanna International Group. Your line is now open. Hi, thank you for taking my question. So for Pedro or Osvaldo, two questions, so just ask upfront. How should we be thinking about the journey in the TPV between on and off platform? What would it -- I mean, obviously, the off-platform number was great. What would it take to get even more ubiquitous acceptance off? That's the first one like the journey on, especially off platform.
And then in terms of what is the current messaging and strategy of the company? Previously for Credito, I thought that the goal was to syndicate more and more of the credit. Is that still the approach? Or would you be comfortable if credit quality improved profitability was great today, taking some more on balance sheet? Those are my two questions. Thank you. Hi, Jamie. Let me start with the first one regarding TPV. I think that we are really happy with how TPV-off platform has been evolving. TPV on platform basically now already tracks the gross merchandise volume we do in the marketplace, we're already at 100% -- we have been at 100% for a long time. So that tracks e-commerce marketplace growth. And with regards to TPV off-platform, I think there are several avenues for growth there. Probably the 1 that we have seen growth the most over the last few years is in Mexico and Brazil is the POS volume, which is growing nicely, and Argentina has been more related to the wallet, which is also growing very strongly.
There's also online payment, but online payments then is growing at a lower pace that in-store, basically because we already have a larger share online than we have in store. And because in Latin America, e-commerce or all in payments is a relatively small fraction of total retail. The second one is -- I'm not sure I got it right. If you can repeat, that would be great as regarding the funding for Mercado Credito. So my understanding, for urea totes, it's on a dollar of origination I may mess this up. I'm sorry, goes through the syndication of the -- and then 50-50 first 100, you own the next 100 gets syndicated out. My understanding was you were trying to push more through the fatigues when credit was deteriorating, but now credit looks like it's improving. So I'm just trying to figure out, would you balance sheet more of Credito. So no, the strategy remains unchanged. We continue, given the potential size of our credit books to increase the amount of the gigs [ph], so that we can off balance sheet the incremental growth that should come through while still retaining a subordinate tranche, which has been very profitable for us so far.
The additional funding source that is becoming potentially more relevant going forward are the CDBs that Osvaldo mentioned in a previous question. So when we think of the capital structure around the credit business, there will be our own equity investments. The gigs or the warehouses that should be growing with relationship to the equity piece. And then the third piece is taking advantage of the CDBs that we can now distribute ourselves in our own digital wallets in addition to doing so through banking partnerships as we had been in the past as the third very relevant window in terms of capital structure for the credit business.
The CDBs in a way, start to emulate not from a regulatory perspective, but from a business perspective, what a savings account potentially looks like, although at a higher cost. But it's essentially allowing our own users to have a savings product that's CDB that at the same time is initial funding source for us. Perfect. Thank you, both. Thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Marvin Fong from BTIG. Your line is now open. Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. And congratulations also on the quarter. Two questions from me. So first one on Credito. Just at a high level, obviously, the profitability is become very strong, and you've gotten more conservative with your underwriting. Just curious on how you're thinking about the extension of credit and growing -- returning to growing the book a little bit more aggressively?
In other words, are you waiting for the macro environment to get a little more favorable? Or do you believe that Credito is in such a strong position that maybe you can start kind of leveraging that strength to extend credit a little more aggressively?
And then second question, I saw on the e-commerce side that you partnered with Carrefour for delivering groceries. Just curious if you could kind of expand a little bit more on your strategy with grocery. Should we take this as a sign that you made a definitive decision to proceed with grocery and partnerships and you're not interested in handling that on a 1P basis? Thank you. Hi, Marvin. Let me start with the first one. And with regards to the outlook from credit, I'd say that as we -- as you mentioned over the last couple of quarters, as we saw market conditions worsened, we decided to be more cautious on the risk we're willing to take. And also, we decided to price our lines more expensively to make sure we had a better spread to be on the safe side. What ended up happening where that collections were better than we expected, and we ended up with very healthy spreads.
Now we'll see when we deem that market conditions are improving. And when that is the case, probably then will be, again, more aggressive. And as we become more aggressive, probably we will allow for dynamically and flexible regarding how we see the market evolving.
Could you please repeat the second part of the question? I think I lost you. I believe you guys had entered into a distribution partnership on grocery with Carrefour in Brazil. I was just wondering if you could kind of expand on that and your -- how you're thinking about grocery right now? Great. So we have a 3P partnership with Carrefour, meaning that they will be a merchant on our platform. I think they can bring very necessary and welcome head assortment to the CPG and supermarket category for us. Ideally, they are a key partner in terms of groceries as we experiment with that part of the supermarket offering, which is always one of the most challenging ones. And the model is one where their inventory will be sent to our fulfillment centers, and we will be able to deliver that through fulfilled by MELI which is always -- from a consumer perspective, the best user experience, the one where we have greatest control over logistics and the entire end-to-end purchasing process.
So it's within the context of our continuous experimentation within supermarket. Again, I think we've continued to see improving economics within that subcategory, still a challenging category from a P&L perspective. It has huge potential in terms of repeat purchase behavior and loyalty of users. But on the flip side, I think for everyone, it's a challenging one from an economic perspective. And so there's a lot of experimentation and innovation going on there as we try to figure out what is the most appropriate model for our region, and with which partners it would make the most sense to do that. Great. Thanks so much, guys. Thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Joao Soares from Citi. Your line is now open. Thank you. Just a very quick one on my side. I was just hoping to get Pedro on margins overall. I mean 2022 was clearly a very presentation look at this fourth quarter. And so as you go into 2023, I mean there are a lot of moving parts to our advancing on the ad business clearly has a very robust margins and also -- but at the same time, we're talking about reaccelerating the 1P business, which even though has a fairly better economics. It's a business that in the past, it was a bit of a more detract. So I was just hoping to get your overall view just how should we think about margins for 2023? Thank you. Sure. So as you know, we don't guide, but I still think it's a valid question. So directionally, we remain very consistent in saying that we try to manage the financial model for consistent central annual increase in EBIT dollars, ideally also modest but consistent margin expansion. That depends a little bit on what happens in terms of mix shift, but we do try to manage the different businesses and the different sub business units to deliver margin expansion year-on-year-on-year going forward.
Yet at the same time, we still continue to see ourselves as a company that wants to deliver market share gains, continue consolidating its leadership position. And as you mentioned in your question, have a lot of bets on many different future growth engines that today are, in many cases, negative EBIT businesses that we continue to see and we are committed to. So as always, I think it's consistent sequential increase in EBIT dollars, ideally margin expansion, but don't necessarily assume that the kind of leverage we deliver in one year, you can linearly extrapolate to the next year.
I think if we do deliver on this consistency, when we look out three to five years, we have a very, very healthy P&L in our hands, primarily if many of these bets that today lose money begin to through scale and operational efficiencies become profitable business and then the mix in our portfolio between those that are early bets and don't have attractive EBIT generation capacity and those that do get increasingly skewed more and more towards more consolidated scaled out positive margin businesses. That's clear. Thank you. Thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Kaio Prato from UBS. Your line is now open. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking -- for asking question. I have one question about profitability as well, but specifically on the FinTech business. I know that you don't close exact numbers, but if you could please share with us how is the sort of the segment moving across your [Indiscernible] today is not all in the were not what is driving this? If you think the payments business was flat? And finally, your expectations going forward and if you could provide us some update in this merchant figure? Sure. So on a consolidated basis, and again, these are not reporting segments. So this is to give you directional understanding of the businesses on a consolidated basis. The credit portion within FinTech, we disclosed interest margins after losses. And I think we've discussed that the operational expenses there are relatively low given that there are low spend in acquisition. A lot of the distribution is done to our existing either Mercado Pago or MercadoLibre users. So the credit business is a very profitable business.
The online payments business which is the merchant acquisition business is also a profitable business with expanding and fairly attractive margin still very directionally 150 basis points of TPV.
The MPOS business, which is also a merchant acquisition business is a profitable business with slightly lower margins than online payments, but still positive and a strong contributor of overall EBIT. And then when we look at the franchise, we're trying to build in terms of the consumer financial services business.
So the digital wallet, the core digital banks, some of the savings text products, the consumer credit cards, those continue to be areas that do not have positive EBIT yet, but are very significant bets for the future and that have shown very consistent improvements on the economics over the last few years.
And then the final overlay on top of that, which is still fairly small in terms of volume, but very attractive from a margin perspective is the insurtech business. That continues to grow and is already on pace to deliver tens of millions of dollars of annualized EBIT. Thank you. Thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Neha Agarwala from HSBC. Your line is now open. Hi, thanks for taking my question. First question on your e-commerce business, which showed very strong trends during 2022 with strong market share gains also in some of the markets. What should we directionally expect in 2023? Any headwinds in the e-commerce business that we should be aware of or should be mindful of in any of the markets?
And my second question is on the credit book. So the credit book growth has almost all for the last two quarters. Are you seeing improved or stable asset quality, at least in the beginning of 2023, which could encourage you to start picking up originations in the first or second quarter of this year? Or are you still going to be in a conservative mode? And why you are being conservative in products? Are there any new products that you are thinking about to propel growth in the current environment? Thank you so much. So let me take the first one. I think in terms of significant headwinds that we anticipate for the commerce business with the exception of whatever happens at a macro level, and that's information that's available to everyone. I don't think we're honing in on anything. We've seen some consistent take rate improvements in the fourth quarter, a lot of that driven by advertising revenues and the incremental monetization on shipping and logistics that I referred to earlier. And those are levers that if we execute accordingly should continue to be present.
We did see some drag on take rate from reduced 1P sales in the fourth quarter of this year versus last year. And if anything, I've signaled that we feel we've hit a turning point in terms of the 1P business, and we can cautiously reaccelerate that again. And so that should also be incremental in terms of take rates. And as we aspire to continue gaining share, that should -- if we execute well again, maintain us on pace to continue to deliver strong GMV trends as well. With regards to the credit book, yes, we have -- we have seen good results in the last quarters, but again, we will wait until we see market conditions improving before we decide to be more aggressive again with regards to risk taking and to growth of the portfolio. We don't guide, and it's difficult to foresee exactly when that will happen. And when we see that happening, we will be more aggressive.
And in terms of new products, the one product we are pilot testing by now is car loans. It's still very, very, very small. We're just pilot testing it in Brazil. We believe that it's a pro interesting because it has a strong synergy with our marketplace. The one thing that maybe I would highlight here is, I recall when we entered the credit business, one of the understandable concerns that existed was how would we deal as a growth company where most businesses are focused on growth with something like credit where risk management and caution many times are necessary.
And if I look back at '22 and we need to reprove ourselves constantly in terms of our risk management capabilities, but I do think it's been very interesting in that the backdrop for credit has been extremely negative. And when you look at how we managed it the timing with which we slowed down originations and focused on higher-quality segments and the kind of results that you've seen, I think, really gives that team a very strong grade in terms of how they've manage risk within a very tough macro.
I think we've been through both a pandemic and now extremely challenging consumer credit environment, primarily in Brazil, and both of those have been managed from a risk perspective and a focus on profitability perspective, very, very successfully. And that's the way we'd like to continue to manage that going forward. Thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Deepak Mathivanan from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Pedro, many companies here in the U.S. are very focused on improving efficiencies this year. How do you feel about the productivity at the company level at MercadoLibre? And then how should we think about headcount additions for this year in your plans?
And then second question, on the competitive landscape in Brazil currently with all the recent developments, should we think about any strategy shifts on your side, particularly with the 1P business, given all these developments? Thanks so much. Sure. So I'll answer in reverse order. Our strategy does not change based on what is happening with competitors. I think our tactics do adapt at the margin. And as we mentioned earlier, we will lean into specific opportunities that may arise if market share becomes available given changes in market structure and competitive dynamics. But I wouldn't say our strategy changes one bit.
On your first point, I think we've had a lot of conversations internally about this in that MELI in a way is in an island within the tech world and that no layoffs. If anything, we've said we will continue to increase the size of our engineering teams, we see that as a key competitive advantage. And one where because we were disciplined throughout the pandemic, I don't think we over-hired or we overspent on capacity by and large. That puts us in a unique position now where we can continue to hire.
But having said that, I think the rate of hiring will slow down versus what it was over the last few years, but we will continue to grow the engineering team. And in terms of headcount across business and staff positions, again, there no downsizing necessary because we remain disciplined over the past few years.
But the speed of incremental hires will probably decelerate even more so than the engineering talent. And then logistics and customer service are much more variable costs, and those are input output driven. So the growth there will reflect the growth in transactions and GMV that are really the KPI in determining how fast those organizations need to grow. Thanks, Pedro. Thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Thank you so much. So Pedro, just kind of building on one of the comments you made earlier. Can you talk about the adoption levels for your fulfillment services in Mexico? And why it has charged ahead there relative to the other markets? Is the profile of the seller different? Or are there other factors or products at play? And conceptually, are there any impediments for Brazil and the other markets to get to Mexico's level? Thank you. So Mexico for the fourth quarter actually crossed the 70% mark for the first time ever in terms of the service mix within the different shipping types that we offer. So 70% of shipments in Mexico actually initiate in one of our fulfillment centers. I think there's a combination of market dynamics, merchant profiles and execution is always that has led Mexico to be so far ahead of the other markets.
Brazil, if I can round finally hit the 40% mark. So it has been growing over the past 4 quarters, at a slower pace, but continuing to grow and trend in the right direction. Chile is over 30%. Argentina and Colombia also continue to grow. So I don't think there are structural impediments to getting to Mexico levels or at least to continue to grow significantly. The pace at which we are able to grow the fulfillment service in the other markets clearly varies from geo to geo. If you consider that Chile was launched significantly after Brazil and is on its way to catch up to Brazil, I think is further indication of that. But no, we don't see any structural impediments to continue pushing the adoption of fulfillment. And the reason that, that is a desired outcome is because it delivers faster delivery times, greater control over the experience, higher Net Promoter Scores. Thank you. Thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from John Colantuoni from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. So as you get closer to clean comparison periods, can you give us your perspective on the runway for e-commerce adoption across your key geographies? Certainly, the pandemic helped close the gap to other regions. So I'm curious if recent trends in customer adoption and trial still point to a long runway for adoption?
And then secondly, sticking with customer behavior, can you just talk a little bit about how engagement and repeat rates of cohorts acquired in recent quarters compared to pre-pandemic cohorts? Thanks. So Latin America has been interesting in that. It doesn't seem to have had the effect as physical retail reopened of a return to physical retail to a point where the market began to shrink. The market has continued to grow. Obviously, it slowed down significant from pandemic type growth. But I think if you look at a Mexico or Brazil, which are the most advanced markets, we still expect market growth to be somewhere in the mid- to high teens. And we do strive, as always, to gain share on top of that.
So we still feel it's early days in terms of the shift from off-line to online retail. We think the pandemic accelerated that shift. And we also think that consumers have found in their online purchasing, a compelling enough value proposition that a lot of that gained consumer -- consumption has stayed online. And so we continue to be optimistic about the long-term prospects of e-commerce throughout the region.
In terms of cohorts, retention cohorts are certainly much higher than they were pre-pandemic. And frequency -- sorry, not frequency and average usage has been flattish over the last year or so, which means that it remains in line overall with where it went to throughout the pandemic. So we haven't been able to continue to grow unit usage since the pandemic, but we have been able to maintain it relatively in line with much better retention per user and higher engagement than pre-pandemic numbers. Very helpful. Thanks very much. Thank you. And now I would like to turn the call back over to Pedro, MercadoLibre's Chief Financial Officer, for closing remarks. Great. So thank you, everyone. I think we've concluded a phenomenal 2022 with a very strong fourth quarter. It was a year where we hit 111, over $100 billion of payments processed over $10 billion of revenue and over $1 billion of EBIT. So congratulations to all the MercadoLibre team for the phenomenal work and to our shareholders and stakeholders, rest assured that we're already back at work to ideally be able to deliver an equally successful 2023 on behalf of our consumers and our shareholders.
Thank you, and we look forward to updating you on things into the first quarter is over. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.","MercadoLibre's earnings conference call for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 . today, we will share our quarterly highlights on video . we'll begin our live Q&A session with our chief financial officer, Pedro Arnt .",1.0

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Due to some technical issues, we will begin this call with the Q&A segment. After the Q&A we will have the video available to play on this call. Thank you for your understanding. So at this time, we will conduct the question-and-answer session, as I mentioned. [Operator Instructions]
Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Ruben from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Hey, great. Thanks very much for the question. I'm interested on the commerce take rate. It was a strong quarter we see the increase of about 50 bps for the seller final value fees about 60 bps on the shipping fees. I'm curious if you could dig in a bit further on both of those items. Was there any change in in your pricing policy? Was it mix, anything maybe on the contra revenue line just trying to understand what drove the take rate expansion would be helpful, thank you One moment, please. Yes, Pedro, we can hear you now. Can you hear me now? Yes, we can, Pedro. Sorry. So we were just encouraging everyone to please take a look at the video after we're done with Q&A. And apologize for the technical difficulty.
Andrew, it's a little bit of the three things you mentioned. So we have began or continued to selectively change shipping prices on select routes and zones in different markets. And so the net revenue from shipping has improved as a consequence of those pricing actions.
Mix has been a driver of improving final value fees, as there's some mix shift towards higher take rate categories. And typically at the beginning of the year in the first quarter, we also carry out selective pricing on seller fees across different geos in the marketplace. Great, and as a quick follow up, you mentioned the pricing on select routes and zones in different markets. Is that more the core logistics fees or any change in how you've implemented some of the tests for fulfillment and warehousing specifically? Thanks again. Yeah, no. So this is driven more by passing on cost increases to transportation costs within our network, and less related to us beginning to ramp up the monetization on fulfillment. If anything, as I always said, the first sequential priority on fulfillment is to continue to drive incremental usage of the fulfillment service. We've seen some really solid pickup of fulfillment adoption throughout the first quarter, primarily in Brazil, exiting on a high note in terms of a historical high for Brazilian fulfillment penetration. So we continue to accomplish that first sequential goal.
The ramp up in monetization, we always said is probably the second one sequentially, once we've reached more Mexico like levels of fulfillment in the other markets. So the monetization improvements on logistics are not driven by incremental monetization on fulfillment services, but much more by price increases on transportation costs. Great, it's very clear. Thank you. Thank you, one moment while we prepare the next question. Our next question comes from Irma Sgarz from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Hi, thanks for taking my question. So the continued rise in your product and technology development expenses, leave relatively little doubt about your commitment to invest beyond innovation. But my question is other than adtech, are there any other specific new areas to which you're incrementally deploying more tech spend in 2023?
And then the second part to this question is, is related? I imagine you already use AI and machine learning across a number of products and functionalities. But with the advances, advances on these technologies over the last six months or so, are there any new areas of application and opportunities that you're particularly excited about and will they require either through the OpEx or the CapEx line, greater investment cycle into the future? Thank you. Hi, Irma. So on product development, a couple of important, I think, clarifications, yes, it continues to be the most significant line in terms of deleveraging. I think on super solid top line, when we look at margin expansion, we've been able to generate incremental margin across most of our cost lines. The two that haven't on a year-on-year basis are certain sales taxes, primarily in Brazil, and then 220 basis points from product development.
Bear in mind that the rate of incremental hiring has come down from about 4,000 engineers to 2,000. And so a significant portion of those 220 basis points are a consequence of the annual realisation of all the engineers that we hired last year, and not a continued acceleration in rate of engineers hirings. So for next year, we should begin to see a slowdown in the level of deleveraging from product development, unless we significantly ramp up hirings, again, which is currently not on the plans.
In terms of areas of of investment, it really is across the board. We see our product and our technology as a competitive advantage. And those engineers are really split across the multiple different products and services that we are either building out or improving constantly. So they're fairly evenly distributed among the existing businesses you're well aware of.
In terms of AI, I think as most companies, we do see some very relevant, short to midterm positive impact in terms of engineering productivity. And we are also increasing the amount of work being done on what elements of the consumer facing experiences we can deploy AI on. I think the focus right now is on some of the more obvious use cases, improving and streamlining customer service and interactions with reps, improving workflows for reps, through AI assisted workflow tools, and then deploying AI to help a better search and discovery in terms of better finding products on our website, and better understanding specific -- specifications of products, where existing LLM are quite efficient.
And then beyond that, I think there's a lot of work going on. And we hope to come up with other innovative forms of AI that we can place into the consumer facing experience, but the ones I just mentioned are the ones that we're currently working on the most. Great, thanks very much. Thank you. Please stand by while we prepare the next question. Our next question comes from Marcelo Santos from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the improved logistic economics you mentioned in the release. This is mostly because of pricing that you pass to or are you experiencing also benefits of scale or more efficiency like cost based improved economics? Thank you. Yeah, so it's not just driven by price increases. We continue to see improvements in terms of productivity across different portions of our network. So it's a combination of pricing and scale increases --in scale benefits. Perfect Thank you. Thank you. One moment, please while we prepare our next question. Great. Our next question is from Thiago Macruz from Itau BBA. Your line is now open. Thanks guys. And thank you for taking my question. And congrats on a great quarter. You've mentioned that the warranty be operation has reached a turning point in this Q1. Can you shed some light on the main differences that you're seeing the economics of the business today? And also, you're generating plenty of cash? Would it make sense to invest that more and accelerate the consolidation of the market chiefly in Brazil, where we now see a somewhat softer competitive environment? Thanks, guys. Great. So I think as we signaled over the past few quarters, we had slowed down the first party business, in large part because we had grown it initially very fast. And there was a significant amount of internal operations that we wanted to be able to fix, which would allow us to then reaccelerate that business with a healthy margin structure, and much better internal operations.
What you're beginning to see now are the initial phases of that turnaround. So we feel a lot more confident in how that business is being run, we're beginning to see margin improvements across different product lines in 1P, and hence you're seeing some of the acceleration. And going forward, if we continue to see these positive trends, you should continue to see the 1P business accelerating growth going forward, which should give us some interesting benefits across the categories where 1P can be an important competitive factor.
On your point of investing even more aggressively to consolidate market share, I think if you look at our 1P results, and you look at certain things like marketing spend certain couponing efforts, investment behind the logistics network, you will see that we did lean into the market, especially in Brazil, where there is more market share up for grabs short term.
The return on those investments was a very strong acceleration in top-line, which actually meant that margin wise, it was contributed from dollar perspective. So we do feel that we are investing more aggressively to try to more rapidly strengthen our leadership position. And we do see that reflected in market share numbers.
Investing even more probably gets us into areas where the return on those incremental investments don't make as much sense, thinking long term. And so I think we continue to manage the P&L in an aggressive way, striving first and foremost for market share gains and above market growth. But at the same time understanding that at the scale we have, we want that incremental market share to come in a way that's profitable. And that continues to be the way that we're managing those incremental investments across different markets. Makes sense. Thank you very much. Thank you. One moment, please while we compile our next question. Our next question is from Pedro Pinto from BBI. Your line is now open. Thank you, everybody for taking the question. I would like to hear from you. Addition of e-commerce across regions. As long as market share gains in Mexico in Brazil seems to be in good shape. Do you think it's time to increase focus in other regions such as Chile? So basically, I would like to know what are do you think of timing and may deliverables very strong? Yeah, great question. I think we continue to see a very attractive midterm opportunity in the Andean markets, Chile, Colombia, Peru. Chile has some very tough comps based on macro issues. In the previous years, a lot of money was put into consumer pockets that went in large into consumption. And so that means that the rate of acceleration in Chile has been significantly down and even negative over the last few quarters. And we're beginning to see that beginning to turn around. GMV growth was already slightly positive this quarter, and revenue growth rebounded and was much more positive than in previous quarters.
So we're confident that Chile should continue that turnaround and that improvement Chile not so long ago was one of our fastest-growing markets throughout the pandemic. And so we think that once the comp issues are behind us, there's a lot of potential from that market.
Peru is still quite small for us, we are increasing our customer acquisition and marketing spend there this year versus prior years, nothing that dramatically impact the consolidated P&L. But for the size of that market, that is a significant ramp-up in marketing spend over last year.
And hopefully, we see enough returns on that, but then we can continue to double down on Peru. And Colombia is potentially the market that's been most challenging for us. I think in general, that's true for all of e-commerce, but we still see that as an attractive market. And eventually, I think we will try to figure that out. I don't think it's a matter at this point of investing more. We actually have a P&L in Colombia that is not profitable, and that receives the right amount of investment. It's more a matter of waiting for the market to mature a little bit and for us to continue to improve on execution and product rollouts so that we can see better results coming out of that market. Okay. Thank you. Just one moment while we compile the next question. Our next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott from Autonomous. Your line is now open. Hello, thanks for taking the question. Wanted to ask one on the credit side. It looks like the IMAL is down quite a bit sequentially. And I know in the slides, you mentioned an element of seasonality around bad debt. But if we look at the bad debt, provisions, they're a bit higher than 4Q, but quite a bit lower than 2Q and 3Q when the IMAL was higher. So can you help us understand a bit better what's going on there? Is that a mix shift is pricing change? Is it about funding cost? What's driven that down? And how should we think about it going forward? Thank you. Hi, Jeffrey. Yes, IMAL is down from what I think was an exceptional high quarter, still 39% for the quarter. And I think it was -- came down for a combination of things. On the one hand, we had slightly lower revenue the fourth quarter typically is a quarter where we see a higher participation of merchant credits and it usually comes down in the first quarter.
Also in the first quarter, we increased the issuing credit cards, which initially there, you book the losses initially, but then most of the volume does not generate revenues because it gets paid in full. And that brings down a little bit IMAL also as you book the losses initially, that also increases the bad debt. And finally, as the portfolio rose in the quarter, is the third thing that impacts the change in the portfolio that impacts IMAL. That's why it came down. We're still comfortable with the 39% volume. And you mentioned accelerating in credit cards. What have you seen that given you confidence to do that? And how how much more potential is that to continue to ramp up growth in costs. We felt confident, we're always looking at cohorts and flow rates, and we felt comfortable that towards the -- I would say, in the second half of the first quarter, we were comfortable that we're willing to issue more cards so we should significantly more cards in the first quarter than we did in the fourth quarter of last year. And we'll see how conditions remain. But so far, we are comfortable with the rollway that we're seeing and with the latest segment of comps we have issued. Great, thanks very much. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And Jamie Friedman from Susquehanna International Group. Your line is now open. All right, thank you for your patience. We will be queuing our next question. Deepak Mathivanan, your call is now open from Wolfe Research. Great, thanks for taking questions. Great. Pedro, first question, as penetration gains were a little bit lower than we expected. I understand there is some lumpiness to it. But can you talk about the product road map in 2023 and kind of the efforts to accelerate the penetration.
And then second question, can you talk about the drivers of the credit book growth, particularly on the consumer side. What signals are you seeing in the market to enabling growing the book? And is there kind of like a level for IMAL merchants that we can expect you to hold as you sort of lean in and grow the book again. Thanks so much. Great. So on advertising, the business continues to grow very nicely. It grew at 62% year-on-year, which is very much in line with the growth rate over the past three quarters. This is dollar growth. So momentum is still quite strong.
GMV did accelerate this quarter versus prior quarter. So that makes it a tougher comp for the ad business given that we're dividing revenue by GMV on the penetration metric. If GMV growth had been similar to prior quarter, we would have had a 10 basis point increase Q-on-Q in advertising penetration or something along those lines.
And then potentially, bear in mind that Q1 is also seasonally less of a season for advertisers to invest as aggressively as in Q4. So the rollover on a sequential basis from Q4 to Q1 is not necessarily one where we should see significant penetration gains.
And then finally, a lot of the technology that's being launched over the last few quarters, as we've been saying, potentially takes some time before it gets fully adopted by advertisers. And so the next few quarters, we would expect to see increases once again in penetration, given that we'd like to see advertising revenues outpacing GMV growth.
Finally, if you look at the year-on-year penetration gains to strip out seasonality, those continue to be quite, quite encouraging. Deepak, with regards to credit, we saw -- we feel comfortable increasing origination mostly in Argentina and Mexico, mostly, I'd say, Mexico and Argentina in that order are to a lower degree in Brazil. And the reason was that we always continue having control groups and seeing if those are profitable, and we thought there was profitability. I was willing to take more risk and expand the number of consumers we're reaching out to in Mexico and Argentina, and we did so. And the case of Brazil, it was mostly the increase in origination was in the credit card business towards the second half of the quarter.
And in terms of merchant credits, it has remained stable from the quarter mostly. And you had a final question regarding IMAL. I'm not sure I got that one. Yeah. Look, Deepak, I think there is a growing number of credit products out there that could affect credit. So I think we're not giving any kind of directionality on where we think the interest margin after losses might trend. We'll report those back to you guys on a quarter-per-quarter basis.
Also because as we begin to see, as Osvaldo was just saying, an improvement in credit conditions in the credit cycle that potentially encourages us to start opening the spigot again in originations. And even within customer segments, we could see lower margin segments that when you risk adjust are actually very attractive to move into and will generate incremental dollars from credit, but won't necessarily be incremental in terms of IMAL.
So we'll keep you guys posted as this moves forward. I think the books are still very, very young. And you could see potential volatility in margin structures because of segment and product mix shifts that might occur going forward. Thanks so much, Pedro. Thank you. And one moment while we prepare the next question. Our next question comes from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Thank you, Pedro. So the Argentina unit growth has reverted back positive, but it's still a little bit unusual to see that number in the single digits. So I get that we can't grow high double digits forever. But can we talk about what you may be seeing from either a cyclical or a secular perspective that might be moving that growth around?
And second, that you probably seen the -- one of the mobile operating system owners release a savings account product, then I think it was able to gather a pretty large sum of deposits immediately on the release. So you're already pretty well on your way with the credit products, but does this event directional pro greater urgency on the asset management product development for you? Thanks. Stephen, thanks. Argentina, I would attribute the weakness in that business primarily to very volatile macro conditions. You're correct. I think it's a business that we've historically seen it perform well even in weaker macro as generally is the case for MELI. I think over the past few quarters, currency restrictions have made difficult to import goods.
So I don't see anything structural there. Argentina still has a level of e-commerce penetration of retail that is lower than Brazil, for example. It's a market where we have probably the strongest market share and is far from saturation. So that should be an attractive market for us mid and long term. And we will just have to navigate through the short-term volatility.
Bear in mind that also because structurally, it's a less competitive market. It's also a market where we are more focused on profitability than growth. And if you look at the bottom line results coming out of Argentina, those are still extremely, extremely strong. And then with regards to how do you call it, to the virtual account that offers a return. It's -- I would say it's very similar to what we have been offering for the last four or five years in all of our top three markets. And what has happened recently is with interest rates going up. There's a -- clearly, there's an incentive to do money out of savings accounts from banks, which usually pay and into money market accounts. And the ones we offer in each of the market has the advantage that they have instant availability and returns vary with local interest rates. But in Brazil, it's in the order of 13% in Argentina, given the incredibly high rates, it's in the order of 69% and in Mexico, it's in line with -- 6% or 5%.
So what we have seen is a significant increase in asset under management, which is growing over 100% year-over-year, and we believe that this flow is likely to continue. And so I believe that this is a product, the launch and the one we have that has a huge opportunity given that banks continue to pay zero over close to zero in most cases in Latin America in accounts. Thank you. Thank you. One while we prepare our next question. Our next question comes from Neha Agarwala from HSBC. Your line is now open. Hi, thank you or taking my question. I gathered that you are more open to accelerating gradually the pace of 1P. What impact should we see coming from that in terms of margin costs take rate? Anything that you can express about that, that would be very helpful. The impact of the 1P acceleration.
And my second question is on the credit business. There was a bit of acceleration in terms of credit origination. I understand it's mostly from Mexico and Argentina. But should we see a continued acceleration in the coming quarters as things are stabilizing in Brazil? Or would you still remain resilient and kind of maintain originations and grow selectively for the rest of the year? Thank you so much. So on 1P, the 1P business has been improving its margin structure across pretty much all categories, but continues to have a lower margin than the rest of our businesses. To be more precise, it continues to be negative in terms of EBIT margin. So a growth in the 1P business now should be instrumental in strengthening categories where we under-index in having a better selection for our consumers which are all long-term positive. It should help us continue to gain scale within 1P purchasing and logistics, which should continue to improve the margins within 1P until eventually turning positive, but short term, they're detrimental on margins.
In terms of take rate, it's the opposite story. Obviously, there, we book the full revenue base, and so it's a catalyst of accelerating revenue and improving take rates. But again, all in, we believe 1P is going to be critical for long-term success in certain specific categories. And so we think that it's very positive news that we're beginning to pick that business up again in terms of growth rates, given that we feel more comfortable about the user experience and the margin trajectory that we will be able to deliver going forward in our 1P operation. In terms of credit originations, I would say that our credit models, one of the most important things they do is to sort users in terms of increased risk. And so small sale I'd say, very well calibrated. And so whenever in a given cohort, we are seeing that we have good results, we're willing to go to the next one. But beyond that, what we have been doing is keep control groups whenever they want to start giving loans to a segment we are not giving loans in the past. And whenever we see there's profitability in that group, we are willing to expand that segment.
That has happened already is going on now with Argentina and Mexico. It is not yet the case in Brazil. Whenever we see that profitability starts to improve in those control rooms will be more willing to originate trade faster in Brazil. Understood. Thank you so much. Thank you. One moment while we prepare next question. Our next question comes from Robert Ford from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Thank you. And congratulations on the quarter. Pedro, can you discuss trends in terms of items per box coming from the distribution centers across your various markets? And as you enable the drop-off returns in your places or agencies, how is that driving new category trial and GMV growth versus areas without those return services. Thank you. Bob, items per order has had a very gradual trend up as fulfillment penetration continues to grow and as we get better at co-locating inventory, but the numbers have not been significant or material. It's been very, very slightly steeping up and to the right.
So I think as we continue to grow fulfillment penetration, like I said, we exited Q1 on a record high for Brazil. Hopefully, that allows to drive that number up. We're also going to be innovating significantly on network design on certain options for consumers at checkout that will allow them to bundle purchases into single deliveries or bundle greater numbers of delivery slots which should also help us drive up items per order, lower cost and to be able to give some of those cost improvements back to the consumers who select that slower option.
In terms of greater category trial as a consequence of offering better return options. I'll need to be in debt with you on the answer to that. We do see an improved return experience, and we do see increases in returns on the part of consumers, which are helping our NPS but I haven't seen the data that allows us to cross reference that to incremental category growth. So I don't know the answer to your question. No worries. Thanks, again. And congratulations on the quarter. Thank you. One moment please while we prepare our next question. Our next question comes from Trevor Young from Barclays. Your line is now open. Okay. Great. Just first one, dovetailing on that last one, innovating on the network design and so forth. It looks like CapEx is down Q-on-Q and it's below trend in recent quarters. Was there anything like timing related there? And should we expect that to rebound later in the year as maybe make some of those investments in innovating on the network design.
And then second question on market share gains in Brazil. Did that come from certain categories where competitors are maybe seeding some share? Or was it more broad-based than that? Thank you. Yeah. So the CapEx improvements do have an element of phasing there were certain investments in logistics that we initially had budgeted for the first quarter that had been pushed back into second, third and fourth quarter. So there is an element of phasing to that slowdown in CapEx. Our CapEx trajectory also will be somewhat volatile as new warehouses and new nodes come into play in different markets at different times depending on the specific network rollouts across the multiple geographies where we're scaling out MELI Logistics.
But specifically, Q1 did have phasing elements and the shipping related CapEx came in quite low, below $50 million for the quarter.
On market share gains, they've been consistent across multiple categories. I do think that, as we said, those share gains in part are because we leaned into the specific change in market structure and the relative balance sheet weakness of certain market participants. So a lot of that is coming from share that's being given up by other players, but it was fairly distributed across all categories.
So when we look at category per category market share, we're seeing ourselves as market share gainers across most categories. That's very helpful. Thanks. Thank you. One moment for our last question. Our last question comes from Jamie Friedman from Susquehanna International Group. Your line is now open. Hi. Thank you for stepping back in. So Pedro, Oswaldo, I wanted to ask in terms of the IMAL progression. I know you called out the typical Q4 to Q1 seasonality. Can you remind us how to think about IMAL, I know you don't give guidance, but how do you think about IMAL typical seasonality, say, into Q2? And as a follow up. Jamie. I'd say that probably there's more seasonality in the fourth quarter. Given that we usually give more loans to merchants in the fourth quarter. Then I would say there's any specific seasonality in general going from quarter-to-quarter. I think it will be, as we mentioned before, more related to what happens to the portfolio faster decide to growth in the segments and each of the markets. And then obviously, how delinquencies evolved. Okay. And then if I could just ask a high-level question about the regulatory environment, especially in Brazil, especially apropos of credit Credito and Mercado Pago. How would you describe it? Is it benign? Is the coast clear? Historically, the government has been very supportive, I think, of incubating Fintechs. Has that changed? Or how would you overall characterize the regulatory environment in Brazil relative to Fintech. I'd say that, in general, Brazil has been the one country where the Central Bank and the government has been the most pro competition and really, I would say, encouraging both banks and fintechs to compete on equal footing. And so most of the regulations we have seen in the past has been around that. PIX has been probably the most successful example, but there have been more recent impacts such as the caps on interchange fees lately on prepaid cards.
So I would say it has always been pro consumer and pro competition. I think that -- they have been very pragmatic and practical whenever we have pointed out that some of the things that we're posing were not practical. I think at least we have heard. Okay, perfect. Thank you for the content. Thank you. As I mentioned, that was our last question, as we prepare to play a video, which you can access on the company IR website. I would now like to turn it back to Pedro Arnt, MercadoLibre's Chief Financial Officer for closing remarks. Thank you, everyone. So incredibly strong start to the year, top line ahead of our expectations, very strong margin evolution. We're really pleased with how the business has gotten off to the start of the year. We're going to continue to invest throughout the remaining quarters in the year to continue to gain customer preference expand market share if we execute well. And hopefully, we'll see the kind of response from our users and consumers from all the hard work going on here at MELI as we did in the first quarter.
Apologies on the technical difficulty with the video. We do encourage you to take a look at it. It has some interesting product detail on the advertising product that I know has been the target of a lot of the questions on how we're improving the stack. So that should be up and available for you to take a look at, and we do encourage you to do so. And we look forward to speaking with you again when we report the next quarter.","the MercadoLibre Earnings conference call will begin with the Q&A segment . we will conduct the question-and-answer session, as I mentioned . it was a strong quarter we see the increase of about 50 bps for seller final value fees about 60 bps on the shipping fees .",0.0

Thank you for joining us. I am Richard Cathcart, Investor Relations Officer at Mercado Libre. Today, we will share our quarterly highlights on video, after which we will begin our live Q&A session with our Chief Financial Officer, Pedro Arnt; and Fintech President, Osvaldo Gimenez; and Commerce EVP, Ariel Szarfztejn.
Before we go on to discuss our results of the second quarter of 2023, I remind you that management may make, and this presentation may contain, forward-looking statements, so please refer to the disclaimer on screen, which will also be available in our earnings materials on our investor relations website.
Before turning to our quarterly results, we would like to highlight that our new Investor Relations website is live and has new resources, such as videos, podcasts and frequently asked questions to help investors better understand our business. We have also improved navigation around the site, making it easier to find our earnings and SEC documents.
With that, let's begin with a summary of our results. Hello everyone. I'm pleased to share with you that Mercado Libre continues to sustain its strong momentum over the last few quarters. Q2 '23 was once again a very, very solid quarter. Rapid top-line growth and strong margin expansion were broad-based across geographies and business units, showing the strengths of our business and the potential of our financial model as we continue to scale.
Let me begin with the financial highlights. Our revenue growth remains high despite our size, and this, combined with operational efficiency and scale, led to a big step-up in our income from operations margin. Income from operations more than doubled year-on-year, reaching a new quarterly record.
This quarterly result is a testament to the potential for solid margin expansion combined with above market rates of growth inherent in our performance. In the short run, not every quarter will look like this, there are still multiple growth vectors for us to invest behind, but it certainly points to the long term margin and cash upside we believe we can deliver.
Turning to the KPIs of our commerce business. In Q2, Mercado Libre’s GMV surpassed the 10 billion mark for the first time. This growth was driven mainly by Brazil and Mexico, which overtook Argentina to become our second largest commerce geography for the first time. Brazil and Mexico both delivered an acceleration of successful items growth compared to the previous quarter. As we continue to bolster MercadoLibre’s value proposition, our leadership position in the region has been going from strength to strength.
Other highlights in commerce include fulfillment penetration in Brazil, which is accelerating, reaching a new high and also a further pickup in growth of our first party business, which grew well ahead of overall GMV during Q2. On top of that momentum, our Advertising business remained strong, with revenue reaching the equivalent of 1.6% of GMV, driven by higher engagement with Product Ads.
Mercado Pago’s TPV growth remained strong as well. The acquiring business delivered higher TPV per device, as our move up market to larger SMBs continues to deliver successful results in both Brazil and Mexico.
On the digital account front, TPV and engagement with our more complete product stack also improved, as the KPIs indicated. Insurtech and asset management, newer and smaller businesses, are also gaining traction as these products scale and we improve the experience and product offering to our consumers.
Turning to credit, NIMAL continues to expand on the back of healthy spreads in Mexico, a good performance from the credit card in Brazil and overall broadly stable delinquency. We are, once again, pleased to share MercadoLibre’s strong results with our shareholders. We will continue to develop our value proposition, investing aggressively, yet with discipline and always focusing on long-term value creation.
Just before we go into the Q&A, Richard will share some more detailed business news with you. Thank you, and I look forward to reporting back to you in a quarter. Today we want to share a more detailed view of our fintech operations in Mexico. For Mercado Pago, Mexico represents an exciting opportunity. It is a growing country, with a large population that currently has lower adoption of financial services than other markets in Latin America, such as Brazil.
Over the last few quarters, we have been rolling out our fintech product stack in Mexico, positioning MercadoPago as one of the leaders in the development of the market for digital payments and other financial services. Our strategy is to serve both payers and merchants, focusing on users that are already within our ecosystem. As we do this, we build on the trust of Mercado Libre’s brand, and build on the user relationships and knowledge from the commerce business to better serve our fintech users.
Mercado Pago users in Mexico can open their digital account within minutes, for free. The money stored in the account generates interest at the benchmark rate through a partner and can be used at any time with our free debit card, money transfers and online payments. To get money into the account, users can transfer from other banks or use our money-in solution at physical stores, an important feature in an economy where cash is still dominant.
Another important characteristic of the Mexican market is remittances, a service used by millions of Mexicans every month. For Mercado Pago, this represents an opportunity to encourage the digitalization of cash, with transfer directly into the digital account. Mercado Pago offers these transfers through partnerships with two established and renowned players, and recently launched a third partnership with an exciting startup, Felix Pago.
Our consumer credit solutions are popular in Mexico and continue to perform well with our buy now, pay later product having higher penetration on the marketplace than our other geographies. This highlights the synergies of our ecosystem, with marketplace knowledge helping the underwriting of credit. We also offer consumer loans, with money deposited into the users account to fulfill day to day financial needs. The consumer credit book has increased in size significantly in the last 12 months and continues to perform well, with strong profitability and stable NPLs.
In the first half of 2023, we launched our credit card in Mexico to complement our consumer credit offer. This is an important product for the development of the market in Mexico, as it drives engagement, principality and digitalization of cash. This product is still at small scale, but we expect it to be a key piece of the Pago value proposition in Mexico in the long-term.
On top of that, this year we have expanded our insurance solutions, another important product with low penetration in Mexico. Like in other geographies, we began by offering extended warranties for items bought on Mercado Libre, followed by insurance for life, cellphones, personal accidents and digital account cover, building a complete product stack for consumers’ core needs.
In Q2, we expanded the extended warranty product to cross-border purchases for the first time. In an underbanked country like Mexico, our strategy has been to serve and develop both sides of the market payers and merchants to drive market development. By bringing more consumers to digital finance, we also drive adoption among merchants in the country.
That is why Mercado Pago offers complete payment solution to these merchants, combined with the fastest payment settlement in the market and competitive receivables discount rates. During 2023, we increased our focus on our smart POS in Mexico, aimed at larger merchants that generate higher TPV. Merchants also have access to online payment tools and are able to offer payments in installments to their buyers.
On top of these products, merchants can access credit lines through Mercado Pago, many for the first time ever, to grow and develop their businesses. Mexico is a market that is still at an early stage of development, but presents sizable opportunities for Mercado Pago and Mercado Libre. With a robust product offer, we firmly believe in the potential of our value proposition to Mexican individuals and merchants and we will continue to work to tailor our services to their needs.
As always, the best is yet to come. Thank you. We will now conduct the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Irma Sgarz of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. In your remarks, you state that you intend to use some of the headroom created by operating leverage to lean into certain areas of the business in the second half of this year. Can you just lay out for us which areas are a priority for the short and immediate near-term? And I would imagine that credit cards in 1P as you've previously noted are a top priorities here. But I'm curious where you are at regarding the lower value items or those items below the free shipping threshold. Specifically in light of the ongoing cross-border discussion and somewhat related to this in Mexico, you have a more sizable cross-border operation compared to other markets. Is this an operation that is margin accretive overall or for the Mexican market? And if so can the same model be applied in Brazil? So in general, we continue to see multiple opportunities for us to invest behind our users and growth. We've been extremely pleased with the market share gains we've been delivering across the Board over the last few quarters. And so it's important for us that we continue to carry out that balancing act between short-term margin expansion and long-term scale and overall size of the business.
So I'm not skirting the answer, but it really is, there are multiple growth vectors and multiple areas that we can choose to lean into in quarters where we feel where we're coming in very strong on bottom-line and have opportunity to accelerate growth even more. You've mentioned some of them, but there are multiple others. We've recently launched a new loyalty program. We continue to invest heavily in technology for our advertising business.
And really there are multiple vectors of growth and that's what we're trying to continue to be very consistent on, which is taking a long-term view and trying to capture as many opportunities as we can and continuing to maximize market share while delivering operational leverage over longer periods of time.
The CBT business in Mexico is performing very well. I think it's a very good example of how when we focus on cross-border trade and we build out the product. We can deliver strong results cross-border GMV in Mexico has been growing at about 2X the growth of non-cross border GMV, and it is a profitable business. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Ford of Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Pedro, can you talk about advertising and the operating leverage in Mexico specifically? There were some big gains there, and in the context of building that credit book, we thought the performance was all the more impressive.
And in the last week, you've changed the landing page for the cross-border business in Brazil. You've added new categories and have gotten up to about 4.2 million listings. How are you thinking about cross-border and the relevance of the value proposition following Remessa Conforme? And how long will the Remessa Conforme compliance certification process take in your view?
And then lastly, can you talk a little bit about Mercado Libre? How many titles are you launching with, how do the economics of the model work? And what have the initial changes in engagement been so far from the users in the early stages, both in terms of the marketplace as well as Mercado Pago? Thank you. Hi, Bob, this is Ariel here. Let me start with cross border in Brazil, which have been generating some discussions in the last few weeks. So, we've been competing against Asian players in Brazil for several years now. And moreover, the old scheme, and it's the way it's implemented, created some loopholes for companies who were supposedly importing B2C items at the zero import tax rate in the country. So, the way we think about it is that if anything, the new scheme will actually increase taxes for everyone.
I guess time will tell if the speeds improvements, that will be generated with the new model will actually increase demand or not, but we still think that the best case scenarios in terms of lead times will still be far from our same day and next day value proposition that we're currently offering in Brazil, but simultaneously the new scheme presents new opportunity for Mercado Libre as well our CBT business in the country is almost nonexistent.
So we think that we can actually build and scale a robust cross-border business, taking advantage of our own strengths, such as our traffic, the trust in our brands, our payments infrastructure, our local logistics, etc, etc. As Pedro was saying before, our cross-border business in Mexico is growing twice as much as our website, but if you look at what we are doing in cross-border in Chile and Colombia, where we also put some focus is growing triple digits in each of those countries.
So, we think we could build something around cross-border with the new scheme. We'll probably be putting some effort in there whenever our resources allow us to do so. And that's the way I guess it will play out. Regarding Mercado Libre, I think it's too early, we are just deploying our first version of the products, increasing the catalog. So not much to be sell on that one, not many numbers to share either. I guess Pedro, you want to take leverage in Mexico? Yes. So, the Mexican expansion in margin and this applies to Brazil as well, Brazil and Mexico both drove the lion's share of the growth in EBIT and margin expansion. And it's been remarkably consistent across multiple products, both in commerce and fintech. So with the exception of the 1P margin that contracted slightly, pretty much all other revenue streams are coming in with very solid cost management and strong growth in revenue. So, this wasn't driven solely by credit in Mexico nor in Brazil. I mean, I think that's important to point out. I just one follow-up if I could, and that is Ariel, how long do you think the Remessa Conforme compliance and certification process is going to take? I think it depends more on the government than on ourselves. So, it's hard to answer that question. We are ready and eager to engage in such a scheme. We think that, as I was saying before that, this could present an opportunity for us, but timing from a government perspective to adjust processes customs, et cetera, et cetera. It's hard to predict. Understood. Thank you so much. Bob, what we think here. Just one more thing. I think it's important. You asked on the model around play, the financial model. I think it's important to point out that, the upfront outlay on content is extremely controlled. Most of the contracts are structured primarily with a revenue share. Remember, this is an advertising video on demand platform. And so, we really are trying to build out solid technology product learn, but the outlays in terms of commitments on content are efficiently managed, and most of the economic model will work around rev share with the content owners. Super helpful. Thank you so much, Pedro. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Ruben of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Hi, thanks for the question, a couple of items on logistics here. We saw the 40 basis point increase in Brazil fulfillment penetration. Curious what drove the step change and what the bottlenecks are for increasing that figure further? And then when looking at the quarter, we see about an 80 basis point increase for shipping fees within the take rate. Curious what's driving that? How you are thinking about the fee structure? Thank you. So, regarding the first one on fulfillment, I see stronger demand from sellers in trying to engage with our fulfillment program. I think we have also improved our technology and product to streamline new cellular onboarding plus existing seller farming. So, we have the technology and tools to tell the sellers exactly what we think will sell in fulfillment and to help them to drive more inventory into our warehouses. So, the combination of the two is probably the key explanation behind the increase in fulfillment penetration. That was the first part.
The second one, Andrew, can you remind me? Yes, just around the impact in the quarter, we are seeing, the increase in shipping fees. Curious what's driving it? Thank you. Sure. When you look at market shipping take rate, you should bear in mind that, that's a combination of two things. On the one hand, it's how much we charge our buyers and sellers for logistics services, but on the other hand, you have contract costs, including their mainly distribution costs. So the 70 basis points improvement that you see in shipping take rates are a combination of both.
So we have always been disciplined and explicit in saying that we will try to trust pass the logistics inflation to our buyers or sellers, whenever it makes sense. And on the second hand, we have been also very effective in trying to get productivity improvements from our distribution operation as well. So the combination of the two is basically we are explaining the 70 basis points that you see in there. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Marcelo Santos of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Hi. Good evening to all. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first I wanted to ask about the Argentian peso exercise that you did the simulation that you put in the release. I wanted to understand, how you dealt with costs that might be denominated in pesos, but are effectively driven by U.S. dollar. For example, I don't know, I imagine developers probably, they earn money in pesos, but their salary somehow linked to the U.S. dollar. Did you just got the cost in peso whatever they were and converted and did the exercise or did you use some discretion to try to address this issue that maybe discussed will increase if there is a devaluation? That's the first question. And the second question is about the credit card in Brazil. Is this product already producing positive amount? Thank you. Let me take the first one. I think first of all, important to note the spirit of the disclosure, and we can get into more detail if necessary, is to clarify that when quantifying the impact of a devaluation in Argentina, it's not as simple as linearly devaluing revenues and costs from Argentina, because there are also Argentine denominated costs that don't appear in the Argentine segment, but appear in the other segments because we export a lot of services from Argentina. And that obviously has a positive impact on margins in other country segments because the revenues there are not Argentine peso denominated.
Your question about Argentine peso denominated costs, but that could potentially have an underlying, tie to U.S. dollars. I think that that's a third derivative that the model doesn't take into account. But I would disagree that this is a linear pass through. Salaries in Argentina are in Argentine pesos. Obviously Argentina is a high inflationary country because of the consistent devaluation of its currency. But a devaluation probably actually generates a benefit in terms of IT costs at least in the midterm. With regards to the credit card in Brazil, I would say that as you recall, during the second half of last year, we were more conservative in, in terms of credits, given, the macro environment. And we made good use of that time to rebuild our business models and we are very happy with how they have been evolving and therefore, I would say. From the last quarter of last year until now, we nearly tripled. We more than triple the, the number of cards we issued in a given quarter. We are excited about the results we're seen. It's marginally the new cohorts are creative, but it's still very early on in the game and we need to continue to continue growing. Marginally could you means that they're generating positive habits. Just want to understand if the contribution is positive or negative? Let's say marginal contribution, the marginal contribution is positive of the last cohort we have issued here. Still this is a small number. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan of Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. This is Zach on for Deepak. Just to follow up on the last line question, just, follow in and specifically on the Argentina macro, obviously it's very challenging. The unit growth is holding up relatively well, just de accelerated slightly. But just curious about how you're thinking about kind of going forward, the investments specifically in this country, in this area and how to think about kind of staffing levels? Is this an area where you're thinking you're reevaluating kind of the investment and staffing levels currently? Or are you kind of happy with where things stand? And then also just touching base on the inflationary trends, specifically on the logistics side in Brazil, kind of noted that you're passing through some of these costs onto consumers. Is that inflation pressured primarily on the labor or the partner side or both perhaps? And how do we think about the kind of pace of inflation kind of into the back half of the year? Is it accelerating decelerating or is it kind of relatively stable? And kind of expect the kind of pass-throughs to kind of continue going forward? Thanks. Let me take the last one first. I think you're better off asking a macro economist on inflationary expectations for the back half of the year. On Argentina, we continue to see tremendous potential in that market. If you look at what we've built in Pago, it's phenomenal. Our commerce position from a competitive position is extremely strong. And if anything, there is a greater possibility now than maybe two or three years ago that Argentina midterm might course correct.
So, we're definitely not considering anything like scaling down our commitment to the country or pulling out. If anything, we have a sense that that might be one of the areas where we can lean into it a little bit more in the back half of the year and accelerate unit growth even more. I think unit growth, if you compare to historical levels in Argentina has actually been anemic. Mexico, Brazil, Chile have been outperforming Argentina, so there might be an opportunity there to re-accelerate unit growth on the commerce side, on the fintech side, it's been absolutely firing on all cylinders. Regarding the first part of your second question, I would say inflation is coming from both. It's on the one hand coming from salaries, from operations, but it's also diesel and its usual inflation. So typically across every country in LATAM, we see logistics inflation being higher than average inflation in the country. And that has been the case in the past, half of the year, I'd say. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. So, it's really nice to see this meaningful jump in your first party GMB here even on a sequential basis. So, can you talk about the halo effect that you may hopefully be seeing in terms of the shopping behavior in the consumer? And secondarily, I mean, today it's consumer electronics, but where else can you look to plug some of the assortment gaps that you might have right now? And, if you can also talk about how has your thinking evolved in terms of greater or lower willingness to expand this business given the competitive environment? Thank you. Hey, Stephen, Ariel here. So yes, we definitely see this acceleration as a consequence of all the investments that we have been putting into the business for several years. So our logistics improvement, the user experience and our investments and technology, the assortment and selection expansion, our retail business, our efforts to assure ensure price competitiveness.
So I guess, all the levels combined are driving user behavior and more transactions in our platform, which linked to the brand performance and the way we think our customers love Mercado Libre are definitely generating the numbers that you see. In terms of assortment experience, I guess, we will continue to trying to build the biggest available selection in the market. That's part of our essence and we will continue doing so in the near future. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Maria Clara Infantozzi of Itau BBA. Please proceed with your question. Hello, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. My question relates to the 1P operation. You showed consistent growth in this quarter, with is improving profitability trend, but also still dilutive to margins. So I'd like to try to please elaborate on more details about when should we expect an improvement with better contributions margins for the 1P operations? And also, if it's possible, it would be like to hear your perception about the competitive landscape here in Brazil and in Mexico? Thank you. Okay. So on margin structure, 1P has actually been playing out very much in line, with the way we had anticipated in that as we gain scale, as we improve operational efficiencies and build out our organization, we actually see very significant margin improvement year-over-year and even sequentially. It's still not profitable, and that's a function of the fact that, it's still subscale versus some of our competitors.
And so, we need to continue to invest behind growing the business and the natural operational leverage will continue to kick in. When we can turn that business positive is probably not over the next few quarters. It's more of a mid-term objective of ours. But again, very pleased with the results this quarter, not only from a top-line perspective, but also how margins are improving as the business grows. On competition, I can hand it over to Arnt. So, I think Latin America has become one of the most intense competitive scenarios in the world probably. We have the big American player investing heavily in the region. We have Asian players who have local players to defend their position. So I guess we are all trying to serve the customers in different ways.
Actually, for us, I think our strategy has played well. If you were to look at third-party data, it seems that the case that we have been gaining market share, both in Mexico and in Brazil, even in this tough environment. So we hope to continue doing so, investing behind the business, and trying to make the maximum out of the investments that we have been putting together over the last few years. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Kaio Prato of UBS. Please proceed with your question. Hello, everyone. Good evening. Thank you for the opportunity to ask questions. I have two on my side please. The first is on the net interest margin after losses of the business. So this quarter, you disclosed the NIMAL which included the funding cost and was interested to see that even including the funding cost and NIMAL remains high. So if you compare the first quarter, your NIMAL was like 31% while we're only looking to NIMAL, it was 37% since that your funding costs is not that high.
So just to like, to understand how you calculate these funding costs here, if you include own funding costs and take all funding costs or just one of them? And how could that flow leads and then I'll follow up with my question. Sure, Kaio. So the funding cost is the blended average of the underlying cost on the credit book. So it's the cost of the physics and it's the cost of the debt that we take on to fund that and our equity participation. So, this includes the third-party funding cost as well like and then the… Yes, it includes the cost of third-party funding as well, indeed. Okay and the second question, create of the fintech business we are. So excluding the credit business, uh, the takeaway had a reduction of more than 10 points quarter to quarter. So in our side you can see a part of related to final fees, but in a quarter of a quarter basis. We basically didn't see major change in interest rates. So just would like to understand what were the main drivers here, if this was related to lower prices as well, and what can we expect going forward, especially in light of the quality expected especially in the Q4? So a couple of the key drivers on the compression of the fintech take rate there and they're fairly even distributed among these three drivers. So, there's compression on Argentine financing revenues. We've had less financed TPV as a percentage of overall revenues. And as the reference rates in Argentina have been going up, that's also tightened some of the profitability on Argentine financing.
In Argentina, the wallet business, which continues to perform incredibly well, but also saw some decrease intake rates through mix shift in the different monetizations on QR and the other transactional fees that we have in Argentina. And then the MPOS business in Brazil also drove roughly also a third of the take rate compression in fintech. That's a primarily less devices sold as we move more and more up market into larger merchants. We have merchants with higher TPV per merchant, but obviously they purchase less machines. And so, the revenues on the sales of machines as net new machine sales. Decelerates is the third driver of compression on the fintech take rate. And like I said, roughly each one of these three drivers have a similar magnitude on the fintech compression. And very in mind Kaio that for the last point Pedro mentioned, these machines are always sold at a loss. So lower revenues, but also lower cost. [Operator Instructions] One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous. Your line is now open. Could we talk a bit more about credit in Mexico, clearly at a very different market from Brazil in terms of the credit penetration of the consumer, the amount of existing credit relationships they're likely to have? How does that feed into the underwriting that you do? What opportunities does that create and what are the potential pitfalls of lending to people who've got less experience of taking credit before? Thank you. Hi, Geoffrey. So, definitely as you say, we see a huge opportunity in Mexico to start with, for our buy now pay later products within our platform. Mexico is the one country where we have by far the highest penetration. And beyond that overall in consumer originations, Mexico is already higher than the rest of the country. This stands for the first time ever, Mexico is higher than all other countries, for the first time ever, it's our largest consumer book for the third quarter in a row and continues to be the largest portfolio.
So, we are very excited overall with the opportunity. Our NPLs continue to be very good and continue to decrease. And what we see is an opportunity beyond our transaction on market leave and beyond consumer credit that's why we have got into credit card. We launched our credit card for friends and family earlier this year, and then we started to expand it. It's still very small, but we believe that we have a huge opportunity and that we can leverage our ecosystem, serve many of our users who supposed to other countries have in general less penetration of credit products. Some of them are not in current scoring worse, and therefore, we believe we have an opportunity to serve them very well. And any pitfalls with lending to people who just don't have as much of a credit history because credit's not been available to them before? We believe that it's our opportunity. As you know, our loans are typically very small to start with, and we have the information of transactions they have done on MercadoLibre. So I think that has been working very well since we started and we are to continue growing this. One moment for next question. Our next question comes from the line of Marvin Fong of BTIG. Please proceed with your question. Two questions for me. So I think, it's just begun, and then Brazil is in the process of a debt renegotiation program. I think it's already released some encouraging statistics. My question is what's sort of your view about this program? Do you think it could unlock new opportunities for credit and extending credit to more people? And do you have any specific plans to target prospective borrowers, as this program evolves? And then second question, you mentioned, you are launched a new loyalty program. I was just curious, what are some of the new features of the program and can you share any metrics about how more productive people in the loyalty program are versus users that are not in the loyalty program? Great. So on the Brazilian program to ease the burden of credit on consumers, I think, we began to see the first flow through to our own user base. It's probably early to tell, whether through open banking initiatives and other areas we will be able to target those users or not. In general, a conceptual answer is if it helps deleverage consumers in general, it probably generates a healthier consumer lending backdrop in a whole, but not too many deep insights to share with you at this point.
On loyalty, so, looking to announce changes to the program, simplified understanding of how the program works, continuous efforts to improve content that we can offer and to continue to sign more partnerships that give access to Mercado Libre loyalty users more and more benefits. We think that the fact that, we straddle both your financial life and your commercial life, gives us a unique opportunity to build a very differentiated loyalty program. We have some really strong content partnerships and content overlays that now have gotten complemented with MELI play.
And so we are continuing to focus on building out the loyalty program. The numbers of paid loyal users, so users who haven't necessarily been earning their way into the loyalty program, but are actually willing to pay for the program so that they can gain those benefits. It has been growing consistently quarter on quarter, which we think validates that we're building a very compelling user proposition and the data around the lift that we get in our users after they sign up for the program continues to be positive. We have shared some of those in previous calls.
So, stay tuned. You'll see a relaunch of the loyalty program soon, and it's a continuous effort to really turn that into a competitive advantage. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Neha Agarwala of HSBC. Please proceed with your question. Hi. Thank you for taking my question. My first question is regarding the Brazil GMV growth which remains strong. It -- a bit, sequentially, but it can be to remain strong. So what are the main drivers behind that? Do you continue to see some market share gain after America now? Or in general, do you think your value proposition and the assortment is benefiting the GMV growth and helping you to gain market share? So that's my first question.
My second question is regarding the average yield of your loan book. If we do not consider the provisions, if you just see the yield on your loan book that went up from in my calculation, 73% in last quarter annualized to 76%. And this is despite the strong growth that we have seen in credit cards, which are dilutive to short-term interest income. What has led to this increase in the yield? Has there been some repricing or growth in more consumer loans that has led to this increase in yield, if you could elaborate a bit on that?
And my last question is on customer deposits. Have you are you already taking customer deposits in Brazil and Mexico, or what is the strategy there? Is that something that you think could, you would like to do in the future? Thank you so much. Hey, Neha, Ariel here. So, today is MercadoLibre's 24th birthday and I'd like to think that the market share gains and the acceleration in growth that we are seeing in the business today is basically a consequence of everything we've been doing over this last 24 years. So, we think, and we like to think that we have the best value proposition and customer experience available in the market, and we'll continue putting our efforts behind building in the near future.
Great, happy birthday MercadoLibre It is 24 years since Marco started it in a garage, as everyone knows. On yields, two things, I think you're kind of hit on it. So we've continued to be fairly selective on who we're extending credit to. We haven't, um, expanded into higher risk segments, but we have slightly started to move into mid risk segments. We've also seen some upward pressures in terms of funding costs in some of our markets. And so that's also led to higher APRs. The combination of those yield improvements and significant improvements in bad debt is what has been driving the improvement in NIMAL on a sequential basis. And with regard to taking deposits, we do offer accounts which are remunerated in each of the three main markets in Brazil, in Mexico and Argentina. What we pay users is typically what we are able to get from those funds. So for example, in Brazil is close to CVI, which is close to 14% in Brazil is in Mexico, zero of 10%. And Argentina is at this point 80%. And this compares in many cases to savings accounts from banks, which pays zero.
And as a consequence of that, these deposit assets under management have been growing a lot in the last year. The growth for Brazil has been very high single digits, so, sorry, very high double digits. Not triple digit, but very high double digits in the case in Argentina is well into the triple digits part of that inflation. But even if you take inflation after the question, we have seen growth of 80% in terms of number of users using our creating accounts in Argentina.
And in and in Mexico, it's also a very good and very competitive product. I think we are paying the higher rates in the market, but it's still rather fairly new as compared to the one in Brazil or Argentina. So the volumes are not as high. But we do take deposits in all three countries for the volumes are not as high, but we do deposits in all country. If forma depending on what regulation permit in the case of Argentina, for example, and in the case of Mexico, many of those deposits are and then at the money market fund run by a third-party. And how much of your loan book would you say is now backed by customer deposits roughly? The only country where we can use the deposit to back credits is in Brazil. And it's something that we do marginally and we do it marginally because we have this tragedy at this stage to grow, the assets under management and therefore we are passing through most of the, nearly all of the returns we get from those deposits. So it, I say at this stage is marginal, and only do it when we take CDBs, which is our equivalent of CDs in. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of John Colantuoni of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Hi, this is Chris on John. Thanks for taking a question. Can you give us some more color on how the credit book performs by region in the second quarter? And then in terms of your plans to expand it, are you still feeling most comfortable with expanding primarily in Mexico and Argentina, or have you seen any green shoots in Brazil that could get you more comfortable with expanding beyond the credit card product there? Thank you. Hi, John. So I think that the credit books continues to perform very well across the board and we continue to see good NIMAL, which have improved. I think that we raise rates in expectation of higher default rates and these were lower.
So we have probably record highest NIMAL. And we have been able to grow the volume, as you mentioned both in Argentina and in Mexico. In Brazil, we are still below a year ago, which was probably our peak origination second quarter of last year. But we have been growing sequentially, our portfolio for the last several quarters and the fall rate continue to come down. So I think we are excited with the result and willing to continue growing the volume.
If you were to look at bad debt as a percentage of our portfolio, it has come down for last one, two, three, four, five quarters in a row. So since the second quarter of last year for last five quarters, we have been reducing the bad debt, in the last quarters, increasing the size of the portfolio. Although as I mentioned in the case of Brazil, it's still below what it was a year ago. [Operator Instructions] I am showing no further questions at this time, so I would like to turn the conference back to Pedro Arnt, MercadoLibre's, Chief Financial Officer for closing remarks. Thanks everyone. Great start of the year. Phenomenal first half, continue to gain share, showing the power of our operational model and to top it all off 24 years of working, clearly paying off.
So thanks for the interest and we look forward to updating you in a quarter. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

Thank you for joining us. Richard Cathcart, Investor Relations Officer at MercadoLibre.
Today, we will share our quarterly highlights on video, after which we will begin our live Q&A session with our CEO, Marcos Galperin; Chief Financial Officer, Martin de los Santos; Fintech President Osvaldo Gimenez; and Commerce EVP, Ariel Szarfsztejn.
Before we go on to discuss our results for the third quarter of 2023, I remind you that management may make in this presentation may contain statements. So please refer to the disclaimer on screen, which will also be available in our earnings materials on our Investor Relations website.
With that, let's begin with a summary of our results. Hello, everyone. I'm Martin de los Santos, MercadoLibre's CFO. For those of you who haven't met me, I have been at Meli since 2007, first as a Board Member, and since 2012 as part of the management team. For the past 7 years, I have led the credit business until last August, when I took the position of CFO. I look forward to meeting as many of you as possible in due course.
I'm pleased to report a strong set of results in my first quarter as CFO. With a strong successful third quarter across geographies, 2023 continues to show an attractive combination of growth and profitability, with a record in income from operations. With strong momentum across geographies in both commerce and fintech, Meli's revenues growth accelerated. Mexico was particularly strong, with revenue growing above 60% year-on-year, while Brazil also posted a [ great ] performance with around 40% growth. These 2 countries have again increased their contribution to our total revenues.
This strong business growth, combined with cost discipline led to OpEx and SG&A dilution as the business continues to scale. Income from operations more than doubled year-on-year for the fourth consecutive quarter, with margins expanding once again. Brazil was the largest contributor to our profit growth, representing a significant portion of it.
During Q3, in the Commerce business, we saw acceleration in GMV and items sold growth in the 3 main geographies where we operate, with higher items [indiscernible]. This higher user engagement comes from continued experience improvements, especially on the logistics front, where we reached 48% of [indiscernible] penetration and offered better delivery promises, improving conversions and further development of categories through technology. As a result, we have a record of 50 million buyers and market share gains, especially in Brazil and Mexico.
At Mercado Pago, off-platform TPV accelerated in all main countries. We saw an increased number of users and higher engagement metrics as we position Mercado Pago as a comprehensive financial service provider. For the digital accounts, we are particularly excited about the engagement, with more people using the remunerated account and other asset management solutions in Brazil and Argentina, and better NPS in Mexico from UX improvements.
In Payments, the highlights for Q3 has been online payment solutions represented strong growth across the region. The great business continues to perform within our expectations with very healthy spread levels. As we saw NPLs improving, particularly in Brazil, we have accelerated the originations in all of our products. During Q3, we issued over 1 million credit cards and surpassed $1 billion [ TPV ] for the first time. As our underwriting models continue to improve, we can tap into new opportunities, such as offering larger credit lines with longer durations to the best coppers of consumers.
Overall, in Q3, we achieved a combination of rapid growth, scale gains and margin improvements, showing the strength of our economic model. To deliver these results, we have invested in technology that provides a world-class user experience that enables us to be more efficient in terms of our cost structure. These results give us confidence to continue investing in future growth opportunities.
And now let me get back to Richard with business news. During Q3, MercadoLibre relaunched our loyalty program as Meli Mas, an important step to enhance our loyalty value proposition, with a simpler structure, more compelling shipping benefits and premium video and audio content. With Meli Mas, we now have a brand in which we can to raise awareness and increase engagement with Meli's ecosystem.
Meli Mas gives users access to a world-class content [indiscernible]. Free shipping above BRL 29 and 12 months with free music from Deezer, amongst other perks. Our content bundle for Meli Mas users includes Disney+ and STAR+ and special discounts to subscribe to HBO Max, Paramount Plus and Lions Gate Plus. Through Deezer, users are able to access a complete library of audio content and music, a service that we think users will be able to enjoy on a day-to-day basis. Users see the Meli Mas offering throughout our apps and website. where the value proposition becomes clear as they shop with us, with the Meli Mas logo clearly highlighted, building the brand of the loyalty program.
The shipping benefits are key to the program. Meli Mas uses cap-free shipping on millions of items above BRL 29, versus the standard free shipping threshold of BRL 79, if the product is in one of our fulfillment centers and chosen for delivery on the user's Meli delivery day. As consumers look for products on recovery rate, they will see the Meli Mas logo on the products that are eligible and they can filter that search for Meli Mas items.
As a new delivery option, loyalty users can choose a specific day of the week to receive all of their packages. This solution enables us to sell and deliver lower value items with the great experience that Meli is known for whilst maintaining cost discipline in our P&L. Users still have the option for same and next-day delivery if they want item delivered quickly if they are willing to pay for shipping on items below the free shipping threshold or for free for items above the threshold.
To access all of these benefits, users can subscribe or earn their way inorganically by engaging with Meli's ecosystem. Subscribing is quick and easy and users can choose between a credit card, automatic charge from their MercadoLibre [indiscernible] account, or a monthly invoice. So the subscription is accessible for different types of users. We're able to offer by the full benefits bundle for just the equivalent of 2 to 3 paid shipping charges. For users who earn points by shopping with MercadoLibre to get the Meli Mas membership, our credit card offers double points, enabling users to reach the loyalty status more quickly.
In August, we launched a big marketing campaign to raise awareness of the program, and initial results give us confidence that Meli Mas complements our value proposition, bringing extensive benefits to even more MercadoLibre users. We're confident in the program's long-term potential because, as always, at MercadoLibre, the best is yet to come. Thank you. At this time, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please stand by while we can file the Q&A roster.
And our first question this evening comes from Andrew Ruben from Morgan Stanley. Welcome again, Martin. Perhaps, Marcos, taking advantage of your joining today. It's been a period of strength for the business. We've seen a lot of the past year's investments flowing through to results. So as you look from here, say, over the next 3 to 5 years, I'd be curious to hear what the opportunities you see for Meli that you're personally most excited about still. Hey, Andrew. Good to be here. Yes, we are really happy with the way the business has been evolving the last 24 months, at least, really growing very nicely, gaining market share and lately also gaining scale and increasing margins. As you know, we don't guide, but there are many exciting things going on, particularly, obviously, AI. That hopefully will enable us to provide our users a better experience, enable us to launch innovative ideas, and also scale and gain efficiencies, whether it is in customer service, or whether it is in fraud prevention or whether it is in the way our developers, 15,000 developers, go about developing and performing quality control, et cetera. So obviously, looking forward for the next 3 years, I think that's a key thing to look into. Our next question comes from Irma Sgarz of Goldman Sachs. Congratulations on the results. Marcos, also taking advantage of you joining the call. If you're looking at the KPIs that determine compensation across the exact team or the leadership team, how do you think these will evolve from here, again, thinking maybe over a multiple year basis? And asking the same question maybe in a slightly different way, are there any incrementally new KPIs to watch for as you go into this next of growth and investment that you or the board feel should gain maybe perhaps more important to incentivize the right amount of investment versus risk taking? So obviously, we try to compensate our -- myself and the key employees based on long-term results, not in quarterly or even yearly -- actually, our long-term retention program is a 6-year program. And obviously, we are in a very dynamic environment and a very dynamic business. If you look at MercadoLibre years ago, both in terms of scale but also in the scope of things that we do and where we are today, extremely different companies.
And I expect that to be the case in the next 6 years, whether it is in fintech that we are moving into, insurance that is already a business that has gained relevance and scale, whether it is assets under management that is growing so strongly across all of our geographies, whether it's our credit card business that didn't exist a few years ago and it's a very sizable business, our overall credit business.
So obviously, and there are new businesses that are coming along and that we expect them to gain scale and scope. And as they do, obviously, they will have a an impact in our results and in our compensation and in the KPIs, whether it is Mercado Play, which is our advertising supported streaming operation or whether it's [ Clips ] which is our short videos launch, which -- both of which are really gaining really nice traction.
So obviously, there are many things that we're doing. And as they gain scale, they become important in terms of KPIs and also in terms of results and compensation. I don't know if that answers your question, Irma. And our next question comes from Marcelo Santos with JPMorgan. I wanted to discuss a bit the profitability and margin. It was a very strong print that you had this quarter, above the previous one. And in the previous one, you were indicating that you might give some back to reinvest in growth. But actually things improved from the previous quarter. So I wanted to understand what happened so that the improvement came? And how do you see this trade-off going forward? There's something new element that allowed the trade-off not to happen and you to grow and have margins at the same time. I just wanted to touch on this point. It's Martin here. Yes. In fact, we did have a great quarter in terms of profitability, reaching 18% EBITDA margin coming from last quarter of 16%.  I would say that most of the businesses and countries performed extremely well during the quarter, particularly the 3P marketplace that was the biggest contributor to margin improvements, but also the acquiring business, the credit business, as well as the advertising business, in that particular order, also contributed to margin improvement.
We look at by country by country, most of the improvement come from Brazil, where we improved 12 percentage points year-on-year, and Mexico  6 percentage points year-on-year. And also, we are gaining scale by growing as we did, we gained significant scale, and we were able to dilute part of our costs, which we obviously manage with a lot of discipline.
Having said that, we have been investing behind our business, which is the main goal. We think that we are in -- we operate in an industry where we have a lot of investment opportunities that we need to make sure that we continue to look at the long-term prospects of the business. So we'll continue to invest in logistics where we increased 6 percentage points [indiscernible] penetration. We also, in this particular quarter, as we launched Meli Mas, we invested behind the brand to promote the new loyalty program. We continue to invest in smaller countries like Chile and Colombia. We have a team of 15,000 developers that continue to build our product and we're investing on our own product.
So again, we are managing the business not to a particular target -- margin target,  but we're managing for the long term. But this quarter was a very good quarter, not only because we improved the margins, but also because we grew, we gained market share, in particular in Brazil and Mexico. And the next question comes from Maria Clara Infantozzi with Itau BBA. I'd like to start a bit about the credit business in Brazil. You mentioned that you just accelerated the penetration in the longer duration consumer products here. Can you please elaborate on that? Should we expect a shift in Meli's credit concession strategy in Brazil? And so far, how have you been receiving the evolution of the credit quality of those new cohorts, please? Yes, as we mentioned, we saw an increase in the spreads we are seeing in Brazil and, therefore, felt confident to increase the pace of origination in our consumer business there. And we are -- so far, we're happy with the results we are seeing, and we continue to accelerate the pace of originations. And we have also increased the pace of issuing credit cards in Brazil. For the same reason, we are encouraged by the results we are seeing and how every time we create [indiscernible] we have better credit scoring and better solutions. And it comes from Kaio Prato with UBS. My question is also on the FinTech business, please. You mentioned during the presentation the importance of the credit card strategy, to be the main financial provider of choice of your users. So in light of this, my question is, out of your almost 50 million unique FinTech users, how many clients see Mercado Pago as a principal digital account nowadays? If you have some percentage of principality that you can share. And how much do you think you can achieve in the future, please? Thank you. Kaio, we have not disclosed in the past principality. What we have disclosed, and this continues to be the case, is that when we look at all of our users in a given country, particularly in Brazil, which is the one country where we have more of our credit portfolio and more of our credit products launch, what we are seeing is a continuous increase in the amount of products that our users are using and in the availability, not only of consumer credit but also of credit cards. And these 2, together with asset under management, which is growing near triple digits in Brazil and Mexico and over triple digits in Argentina, are, I'd say, a key component of a user becoming principal.
So all of the metrics are going in the right direction. The other one is TPV generated both by a credit card and a debit card. But we have never disclosed a principality measure. Okay. And just to follow up, my last question on the credit card business. How are you seeing the discussion about the change in the framework of credit cards in Brazil nowadays? And what could be the impact on your side, not only in terms of potential P&L impact but also in terms of your appetite for further increased origination on credit card? Sure, Kaio. So I think that -- this is not the first time that this is discussed in Brazil. I think the jury is still out. There are many things that are being discussed. One of them is having a potential cap on interest rates. Other one is probably limiting to some degree [indiscernible] or interest-free interest rates. And the third one is probably putting a cap on the interchange each of those would affect us in different ways, still very early. Until we have the details, we are not able to tell. We believe that [indiscernible] is a key driver for consumption in Brazil and probably that should limit how much that is affected. Our next question comes from Scott Devitt with Wedbush. I had 2 questions. Maybe a different spin on the first question, which is, Marcos, back in 2019, this was like a little over a $2 billion revenue business, doing like $1.1 billion in gross profit. And you're approaching like 7x those levels now. So the growth through the pandemic, and comping the comps and everything else, it's almost unprecedented, and yet you're growing at rates that are similar to where you were growing back in 2019.
So I'm curious, as you think about like what's transpired over the last 4 years, if you can kind of frame how you think about the mainstream in e-commerce because of the pandemic and how that may have benefited a market like Latin America uniquely relative to other markets versus drivers of the business that were more company-specific like improvements in the e-commerce experience because of faster shipping times and things like that are the benefits of having a broader ecosystem with payments? Just how you think of the components or the build of how this business has gotten so big, so fast and just keeps growing at this pace. That's kind of the first question.
And then the second one, if you could just talk a bit more about the advertising business in the quarter. I didn't -- I may have missed it. I didn't see the absolute amount. But if you can just talk about how that's trending and how you're thinking about the ad business longer term. Thank you. Okay. Thank you, Scott. So yes, obviously, COVID was, in general, around the world, very good for e-commerce companies. The same thing happened in Latin America. We basically doubled during COVID, during those 2 years, 2021 and 2020. But unlike what happened in other parts of the world, we continue to grow at a very healthy rate once life resumed to normal. We're very happy about that. We think that we had done prior to 2019 a lot of things. We had invested a lot of money and efforts on mostly technology, so got us at the right time, in the right place. We were able to benefit, I think, more than other players in the region when that happened.
And since then, when we grew in scale, obviously, the power of the ecosystem is very strong, and we continue to add features and functionalities and products to this ecosystem, advertising being one of them. Financing on the credit cards being another one, insurance being another one. And more recently, all the content plays, whether it's our partnership with Disney and other great content providers that we are distributing through Meli Mas, or whether it's Mercado Play or whether it's our Clips.
So we continue to add features and functionalities and products and brands. And I think we have a -- we have created something that is pretty unique in the region and around the world, and each part strengthens the other. And we have a lot of scale. As you mentioned, we are 7 times the size we had a few years back. And more importantly, our growth rate is still very healthy, and we have a very strong balance sheet, and we intend to continue innovating, continue investing and continue focusing in the next 5 to 10 years and not in the next 3 to 4 quarters. And then Ariel can give you more background on advertising. Scott, Ariel here. So ads continue to grow well. We grew above 70% in revenue this quarter for the sixth consecutive quarter. with no major changes in strategy. We continue improving our product with feedback from advertising and promoting our solutions to different segments of sellers and brands. Product ads continues to be the main driver of growth, specifically the self-service sellers, but we are seeing more and more traction from other segments as well.
Overall, we had a quarter with 1.7% of penetration of ads as a percentage of GMV, but I think it's worth highlighting the case of Argentina. So structurally, given market dynamics, Argentina has a lower penetration. And if you were to factor in there the fact that inflation makes it even harder for advertisers to follow up our GMV growth, and also the effect of having a bit lower demand from advertising in Argentina because of structural context, more out of talks and some other effects, it's worth saying that if you were to take out Argentina of the equation, penetration of advertising in our GMV, would be roughly close to 2%. Our next question comes from [ Melissa Byun ] with Bank of America. It may actually be Bob Ford. Congratulations on the quarter. How much of the Brazilian GMV growth is coming from markets where you now have a distribution center and faster shipping within Brazil or before you were sending that from Sao Paulo or a more distant location? And then what percent of GMV is now being delivered on a Meli delivery day? And where do you expect that to stabilize as we move forward?
And then lastly, can you discuss your use of AI in search product recommendations and risk plays? Thank you. Bob, this is Ariel. Thanks for your questions. I think we don't typically disclose demand data based on geographic segmentations or even logistics methods. But I would say more and more we are trying to grow on both of the segments that you have highlighted in your first 2 questions. So we are being proactive in trying to gain traction and market share in some of the regions where our market share today is underrepresented. That means that we do see increased demand coming from areas that are more far away from our fulfillment center. Still the main capitals and cities of Brazil do concentrate a big share of our demand.
Kind of same thing happens with Meli Delivery Day. It's still super early days. So not many data or not much data to be shared on that regard. But I do I want to say that it's slowly gaining traction, of course, aided by the launch of Meli Mas in Brazil and in Mexico. So more and more, we are seeing consumers actively choosing the Meli Delivery Day as a way to receive the packages.
Last question in terms of AI and search, we are working on that. I mean we are putting a lot of effort into building solutions around AI. I think we don't have much to disclose as of now, but search, reviews, questions and answers, buy box and products, as Marcos was saying, copilot for our developer. We're looking at the broad range of AI uses for MercadoLibre to boost consumer demand and efficiency. And we're happy with the progress that we have so far, but not much to be said yet. And building on that, we have been using AI for a long time now for many, many years, both in terms of fraud prevention and credit scoring. Both 2 instances, they are pretty much use cases which are ideal for AI, because we have, in the case of fraud prevention, millions of transactions every day and with a clear outcome, either fraud or not fraud. So with the right variables, we can build a very strong model that has predicted and have really best-in-class fraud prevention. And with that knowledge and given the experience we have been building on credits, we have also been -- built our credit scoring models leveraging the AI. Makes a lot of sense, Osvaldo. It seems like with the larger data lakes, faster processing speeds, more sophisticated LLMs, it just gets better. And then, Ariel, just to follow up, can you comment a little bit in terms of where you do have consumers choosing a delivery day, are you seeing materially improvements -- or materially improved densities and improvements in terms of average shipping costs? Or is it still a little bit too early to discuss? Yes. So I think it is early to discuss. We are seeing some efficiencies in our operations driven by the fact that we can consolidate shipment and take advantage of some of our idleness when we operate, I think or density in distribution, I believe it's too early. So again, I'm sorry for this, but not many details to be shared. I would say the variables are moving in the direction that we expect, but too early to share numbers behind that. And our next question comes from Marvin Fong with BTIG. Congratulations on the great quarter. I'd like to ask maybe a 2-part question on cross-border. So in Mexico, I think your shareholder letter cited you grew very strongly there, which is interesting because I think [ Timo ] only recently entered the country, is also seeing some strong adoption. So could you just kind of discuss how you see the cross-border market in Mexico evolving? Is it that [ Timo's ] entry is actually growing the pie for everybody.
And the second part of the question is, how might this inform your strategy in Brazil, as I understand your cross-border penetrate -- or the mix relative to your GMV is very low, but that presents an opportunity for you? And then I have one other question. Thanks, Marvin. So I'd say before going into the details first and foremost. Over the last 24 years, we've been always competing with players from all over the world. So in a sense, we are used to having new entrants trying to get a pie of Latin America. We've seen [ Timo ] get into Mexico, in particular, in May, more or less. We've seen them making progress in app downloads and monthly active users. They seem to be spending a lot of money on marketing on social media, directed consumers, has been trying to download their app.
We are obviously monitoring that closely. But our data suggests that there is a bigger overlap between that business and the one with other cross-border platforms. Our business in the meantime continues to perform really well, as shown by the acceleration of items sold to 38%. Unit growth has been strong across the board, including categories where some of those players are focusing on, and all ASP ranges.
And our competitive advantages remain untouched, I would say, particularly logistics, which enables us to deliver fast shipping and payments, which allow us to provide attractive financing to our users.
So in the end, our playbook remains the same. We continue strengthening our business with more sellers, more brands, more assortment, more financing, faster delivery, while we also continue investing in improving our own cross-border trade capabilities. And also through Meli Mas, we think we are also now offering free shipping on lower ticket items, which was not the case in MercadoLibre up until 2 months ago.
Moving into the second part of the question, which is Brazil. I think [ Remesa Conforme ] is still too new. So it's hard to say. We have applied the program. We got accepted just a few weeks back. So not so much to share. But we remain confident, as I was saying, for Mexico, that the combination of fast deliveries, local payments and financing, a strong brand, buyer trust will continue to differentiate MercadoLibre versus our other companies.
And simultaneously, if the new regulation allows so, we will continue building capabilities as to be able to compete in cross-border in Brazil as we are doing it today in Mexico, in Chile and Colombia. And just my follow-up, a bigger picture question. I think it was a very strong quarter in terms of acquiring more fintech active users. And I was just curious beyond what you wrote in the shareholder letter, could you elaborate on what's driving that? Was it more internal initiatives? Or do you think it was some component just from the broader economy and whatnot? So just would love some color there. So I think there are several factors contributing to that. One of those is our remunerated account [indiscernible] both in Argentina and in Brazil, which is doing very well. What we pay our users depends on what the risk-free rate is in each of the countries. In Brazil it's around 13%; in Mexico around 10%. In Argentina, given recent spike in inflation and interest rate, it has been close to 100%. So this gives users a huge incentive to move out of banks with savings accounts, which [indiscernible] pay 0 or only pay after 30 days, and move their money into Mercado Pago. I think that has been part of the driver.
Another part of the driver, I think, has been, as we were saying, the increased availability and offering of credits that we're giving out, in that case, I would say it's mostly, in the case of -- in Brazil and in Mexico, not so in Argentina, where we have been cautious given this rate environment. And our next question comes from Trevor Young with Barclays. Great. On the Meli Mas subscription plans, is there any color that you can share on initial subscriber counts here in the first 4 -- 2 or 3 months, excuse me? Is that ramping as you expected? And then second question, can you give us an update on where we are in terms of logistics monetization? I realize you've indicated it will be gradual over a number of years, but just any update over the last few quarters would be helpful. Thanks all for your questions, Martin here. I think it's too early to tell. As Ari mentioned before, we launched this program a few months ago. We are seeing good engagement with the program as well as with the Meli Delivery Day, but it's too early to share numbers in terms of adoption. I think in the coming quarters, we'll be -- we will share more information. But we are excited about the program. Ari? Yes, Trevor. So on monetizing shipping, I think our Q3 results and our year-to-date results show that we have been able to pull levers to offset some of the headwinds that we have in shipping from higher inflation rates in the logistics environment and higher fulfillment penetration that has helped us keep our total net shipping costs over GMV broadly stable in 2023.
I mean we still think that we have plenty of opportunities to improve our net shipping costs by focusing on productivity, efficiency, scale benefits, et cetera. But we also want to incentivize more sellers to use our fulfillment solutions, particularly in Brazil.
So in all, there is potential to monetize fulfillment, specifically in the future if we decide to do so. But as we have always said, we are not in a rush to do that. We are always mindful of what monetization might imply for consumer prices and competition. And we are happy with the way we are managing our P&L in general. And our next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous. I wanted to touch on the off-line POS business in Brazil, it looks like fintech services take rates were down a little bit. We saw that you rolled out some pricing there that is cheaper for the merchant, but clearly, less beneficial for you, it looks, in terms of the MDRs that you're charging. And the publicly traded competitors, obviously, the stock prices are a fraction of what they were a couple of years ago. Can you just remind us, how does that off-line POS business fit with the rest of Meli? What is the synergy there?
And then if you're thinking out 5 years, 10 years, how is that going to fit into the rest of what you're doing? Does it still really make sense for that business to be a focus? Or is it something that could become smaller over time or maybe doesn't make sense to keep over time? We see the POS business, the in-store business as a big part of our fintech offering. We allow merchants to charge with Mercado Pago offline. Some are very small merchants, some are SMBs, and even some are larger merchants. And we have been able to provide this solution in, I'd say, in a very profitable way, and we continue to do so. The profitability behind our POS business has been very good throughout the quarter.
We have seen some -- have to make some changes as we move upmarket. Some of that is related to what we saw in terms of changing our go-to-market strategy. As we attract larger merchants, in some cases, what we do is we offer lower processing fees. But we get -- on the other hand, it's better for the merchant because they get lower fees, as you said. But it's good for us too, because what we see is higher activation rate and higher TPV per device. So not necessarily we're getting a lower margin in terms of margin on top of TPV, but we're getting a larger margin per device sold. And so I think that this continues to be very good for us.
I'd say I'd add to that on the POS front, in this quarter, we have been changing -- making some changes beyond pricing in terms of our go-to-market strategy, and we are very encouraged by the results we're seeing, again, in terms of activation and TPV per device. And the synergy with the rest of the business with this POS machine operation, where is that? So we are offering, I would say, on 2 sides. On the one hand, is many merchants, they sell online, they sell offline, through MercadoLibre they sell through the POS. So there's a synergy there in having pretty much all of their sales coming through Mercado Pago to them. .
On the other hand, many of these merchants, in some cases, are individuals, and we are able to cross-sell different products to them and offer more banking products to them basically. So we offer them -- it's not only the device we're giving them and the process we're giving them. We're offering them a credit where they invest in [indiscernible]. We have started to offer them a credit card to individuals based on the business they run. And so really is part of our banking solution, and there are many products we're offering to them. There's a good synergy between all of the rest of the banking products we offer. And our next question comes from Neha Agarwala with HSBC. Congratulations on the strong quarter. Just 2 quick questions. First, on the 1P business, we talked earlier in the year about some acceleration, gradual acceleration in the 1P business. How is that going? And what is the vision going forward? .
And my second question is on the credit quality. There was a little bit of an uptick for the early delinquencies. Could you explain to us where is that coming from? Despite some pickup in the loan growth, maybe Mexico is not doing as well. So if you could talk a little bit about the early delinquencies and about how the portfolio in Mexico is performing, that would be very helpful. This is Ariel. So 1P grew 58% year-over-year on a consolidated basis. If you were to look at this by country, Brazil actually grew considerably more than this. So the way we think about it is that 1P remains a strategic priority for us. We see this as a key lever to compete and gain market share in certain categories, consumer electronics being one of the clearest probably examples of that.
We are very happy with the transformation of our 1P business over the last 12 months. We've had major improvements in our ability to manage pricing, promotions, stocks with the help of technology. We have also seen significant improvements in the way we connect and relate with suppliers and the way we negotiate with them. We think that all these progress are structural gains that will put the business on strong footing for long-term growth and market share gains. So we remain optimistic and keep investing behind that business. Neha, and with regards to NPLs in Mexico, let me split that in 2. On the merchant side, NPLs have remained very flat. The spreads are very healthy. So very good results. And we have been able to increase origination.
And then on the consumer side, actually, they have increased a little bit, but by design. What happened is our spreads are very healthy we decided to take a little bit more risk and to increase the amount of origination, and that usually comes with slightly higher NPLs. But those have been priced in, in the rates we are offering. So spreads continue to be super healthy in Mexico. And that was part of the strategy, to grow faster, even though NPLs may increase, it's priced in already. Perfect. If I can follow up on the 1P. Could you give us some numbers regarding the penetration as a percentage of GMV, where it was at the end of last year where it is now currently, just to get an understanding of the pace of growth? Thank you so much. Yes. So penetration keeps improving, increasing, particularly in Brazil, we're in the low or mid-single digits, around 3% or 4% penetration. Again, we are extremely happy with the progress that we've made so far, and we'll keep investing in growing the business, while continue also improving our profitability, which has been the case this quarter. Stand by for our next question. And it comes from Joao Soares with Citi. I have 2 questions here. One, the first one, I just wanted to hear a little bit about Black Friday preparations. We've been hearing a lot of news how excited the company is, and maybe talk a little bit about any expectations in terms of the winning categories here. So any granularity in terms of our expectations?
And the second question is talking a little bit about the 1P, just to follow up on that. In regards to profitability, how that -- you talked about in the press release about improving profitability. So just wanted to hear a little bit about where we are right now and where do you think we could be? I know the company doesn't guide, but any qualitative message on this would be appreciated. Yes. This is Ariel. So Black Friday penetration keeps us busy for sure. We are extremely excited with the way our company has been performing, and we think and are expecting to have a great big season. All of our teams, commercial, marketing, shipping, they are all preparing the work has to continue with the inertia that we had this quarter and this year and having a great event, both in Black Friday, Christmas, et cetera.
We know this is a relevant moment for our consumers, and we want to be there to satisfy their needs.
Regarding profitability, as I was mentioning before, we see very strong profitability improvements, particularly in Brazil. I think we are getting smarter in the way we buy. So having better negotiations, which give us better terms. We are getting better at managing inventory. So our days of stock are getting better and hence, our working capital as well. We are getting also smarter in the way we price the items we sell. And we are also working a lot in taxation efficiency, which is key to compete in Brazil.
So again, we are moving and pulling all the levers as to make this a strategic and profitable business for the company. We are yet not there, but we'll continue to be working in that direction. [Operator Instructions] Our next question, that comes from Deepak Mathivanan from Wolfe Research. A couple of questions. So first, can you give some additional color on the improved loyalty program? What are you seeing in the early days in terms of frequency, average spend compared to a nonmember from the program. I know it's in early stages, but any color there would be great.
And then the second one, the Central Bank interest rate is coming down in Brazil consistently. We just saw another cut today. Can you remind us the implications of this to your business on profitability? I guess, I mean we can wait for the Q to see the financing revenues. But wondering if there is a way you can help us the benefits to EBIT from the dynamic in the last few months. Thank you so much. Deepak, Ariel here. So we don't disclose specific data on Meli Mas yet. But I would say, on the one hand, our old loyalty program, L6, already generated an increase in frequency and GMV per buyer whenever they decided to subscribe to our program. We are seeing the same or an even better trend with the new subscribers who are joining our Meli Mas program and also with the existing subscribers who are getting used to the new benefits and the new value proposition of our program.
So in general terms, we are excited with the engagement that we see in the platform. Again, too early to be seen. Communications has just started. Our product keeps evolving. So we have many, many things to continue working on as to make customers even more aware of all the benefits and the way they can interact with that program. So, excited, but I don't know, hopefully, we'll be able to share more details in the next call. And with regards to interest rates coming down in Brazil. It tends to be good for us. for, I'd say, for several reasons. Mostly on the marketplace where interest rates are lower, we tend to see more transactions on those transactions where we charge our interest rate. And then for what we offer as [indiscernible] then the price tends to be -- the cost tends to be lower for us, so profitability improves.
And then on the fintech side, I would say it's also positive but closer to neutral because many times what happens is competitive pressures make that we have to pass those savings to merchants. That has been the case when rates increase and will probably be the case as we decrease. So overall, it's positive for us. Our last question comes from [ William Kang ] with Susquehanna International. Thanks so much for squeezing me in here at the last minute. I just wanted to quickly ask on credit. So last quarter, I think there were comments about expanding lending into mid-risk segments, no higher risk segments just yet. So I just wanted to ask what were you seeing there? Were there any surprises or adjustments that you encountered? Actually, that is exactly what we're doing. We have been increasing originations in Brazil, both on the consumer credit side and on the credit card side. On the consumer credit, probably what's happening is, to some degree, we are -- remember, up until a year ago, we were issuing more credit, then we became more restrictive. So you don't yet see this impact in terms of the total portfolio. But originations are up, and we are expanding, as you said, into the mid-risk segment.
And also on the credit card front, we have been able to expand our offering, and that's where we are issuing more cards by -- also by addressing this mid-risk segment and incorporating more information from third parties into our models. And this concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn it back now to Martin de los Santos, Chief Financial Officer for MercadoLibre. Thanks, everybody, for your questions. I'm looking forward to reporting back to you next year with our fourth quarter results. Good night. Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may now disconnect.","MercadoLibre's earnings conference call for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 . today, we will share our quarterly highlights on video . we will begin our live Q&A session with our CEO, Marcos Galperin .",1.0

Thank you for joining us. I'm Richard Cathcart, MercadoLibre's Investor Relations Officer. Today, we will share our quarterly highlights on video, after which we will begin our live Q&A session with our CEO, Marcos Galperin; Chief Financial Officer; Martin de los Santos; FinTech President, Osvaldo Gimenez; and Commerce EVP, Ariel Szarfsztejn.Before we go on to discuss our results for the fourth quarter of 2023, I remind you that management may make or refer to and this presentation may contain forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. So please refer to the disclaimer on screen, which will also be available in our earnings materials on our Investor Relations website.With that, let's begin with a summary of our results. Hello, everyone. I'm delighted to share that MercadoLibre delivered solid results in Q4, marking a strong conclusion to an outstanding year. Overall, 2023 highlighted the strength of our financial model and its future potential, as well as the powerful impact of compounding of several years of investment in technology. For our Commerce business, it was a year of accelerated growth and market share gains in most countries. We achieved this by continuing to make improvements in the value proposition to buyers and sellers in our marketplace.I would like to highlight 3 important initiatives that contributed to our success in Commerce. We continue to invest in having the widest product performance in order to offer the best buyer experience to consumers. A key contributor to this was the acceleration of our first-party business, particularly in Brazil, where it grew by 81% in 2023. We continue expanding our logistics network with record fulfillment penetration of almost 50%, which provided an improved user experience to our buyers. This resulted in faster shipping and fewer late deliveries, particularly around the Christmas season.Our Ads business continues to deliver impressive results, growing revenues at an accelerated pace. During 2023, we onboarded almost 50,000 new advertisers who appreciate the value of promoting their products on our pan-regional platform. On the FinTech front, Mercado Pago maintained strong momentum as users and merchants continue to adopt our services.In Acquiring business, we delivered solid TPV growth and gained market share in most countries where we operate, both in online as well as in- store payments. We made improvements in approval rates and deployed new features that enabled us to move up market, enhancing the value proposition to SMBs. In FinTech services, we have expanded our product offering and made improvements to user experience.The increased engagement with our products resulted in Mercado Pago achieving the milestone of surpassing for the first time 50 million active users in a single quarter. The credit business continues to be an important piece of our FinTech strategy, and it delivered another quarter of strong results with accelerated growth and solid spreads as we continue to cautiously manage risk.During Q4, MELI delivered strong financial results. Revenues grew by 42%, accelerating both in FinTech, as well as Commerce, due to the strong execution during the peak season and investments we made throughout the year. For the quarter, we delivered 13.4% EBIT margin, excluding one-off expenses from previous years, as explained in the letter to shareholders. This represents margin improvement from Q4 of 2022, while we continue to invest in building our logistic infrastructure, supporting our Meli+ loyalty program, as well as expanding our credit card offering.Following our strong financial performance in 2023, it's a good time to reflect on the journey over the past 6 years. During that time frame, we multiplied our revenues by 10x, while achieving significant improvements in profitability, culminating in nearly $2 billion of operating income in 2023. In recent years, we have increased our investment in technology, which enabled us to launch multiple products and services and make significant improvements in user experience. We have grown our development team by more than 10,000 in the last 3 years alone and currently have 16,000 engineers, who are constantly working to create the best experience for our users. We remain committed to our technology-led strategy in order to continue delivering sustainable results for MELI.We entered 2024 with optimism about our growth opportunities and confidence in our capacity to continue to execute on our strategy.Now, back to Richard to share some product initiatives from 2023. As a technology company with more than 15,000 developers, launching new products and features is at the heart of our business, as we continue to innovate. Innovation is about new products and businesses, but it's also about being attentive to and passionate about detail, and solving multiple small customer pain points that compound into a great customer experience. 2023 was no different. We've launched several new products and services, such as the Meli+ loyalty program, MELI Delivery Day, credit card for consumers in Mexico and for businesses in Brazil, amongst many other things. We've also vastly improved our core products with several new experiences that build onto our value proposition, as we continue to strive to offer our users the best experience. Today, we want to share some of this year's highlights.In Commerce, we continue to look at the specific needs of each vertical to improve the user experience, as we believe this will drive offline consumption online. In 2023, we considerably improved the navigation in fashion, apparel and sports, with standardized filters across brands and sellers. This enables consumers to find what they need more quickly. On the product page, users can also see the More Like This section to find similar items to a product that the user has clicked on, rather than simply going back to the search results. This feature is powered by artificial intelligence.AI-based features are already an integral part of the MELI experience, with many innovations launched in 2023, including a summary of customer reviews on the product pages that concentrates the main feedback from buyers of that product. On beauty product pages, a summary of product functions and characteristics is automatically created to facilitate buyers' choices. Push notifications about items left unpurchased in shopping carts are now highly personalized and remind users why they may have chosen to buy a particular product. We have also added an AI feature that helps sellers to respond to questions by preparing answers that sellers can send immediately or edit quickly. To deliver a better experience for our sellers, we launched a new version of the seller hub, where they can see all of the promotional campaigns available for them to participate in. A new pricing tool also enables sellers to easily compare prices with competitors and / or similar products and receive insights and recommendations on how to boost the sales.In 2023, we also relaunched our Ads tech stack. An automated buying platform was launched for display ads, accompanied by live reports and unique insight analysis. We enhanced our bidding algorithm for product ads and introduced new placements on search and product pages that give more visibility to sponsored products. Our brand ads solution was also launched as a mid-funnel campaign option to enhance consideration for brands. Our platform also now includes a feature for agencies to be able to manage different brands through the platform. Brands, sellers and official stores can delegate certain products, or even the whole assortment, to a specific agency. The agencies are now able to manage all accounts delegated to them in one place. And to expand the possibilities given to advertisers, a new tool of custom audiences was launched and later expanded, enabling advertisers to use filters to create an infinite combination of audiences for their campaigns. Finally in advertising, MELI Play was launched as an ads-based streaming platform. Through a revenue share model with studios, we are able to offer free content to our users across the region, enabling us to explore a new revenue stream for Ads.In Logistics, most of the technological improvements were behind the scenes and were crucial in helping us to maintain costs broadly stable as a percentage of GMV, whilst expanding fulfillment penetration. We optimized routes from first to last mile, fulfillment center processes and demand prediction. On the UX front, buyers are now notified that their package is being delivered and can follow it through their app. And for sellers that adopt fulfillment, an enhanced tool to manage inventory brings more technology to the process, flagging products that need to be replenished, how many units should be sent to us, among other things.At Mercado Pago, we continue to innovate as we consolidate our position as one of the region's leading FinTechs. In the Acquiring business, the launch of the Mercado Pago Tap brings a free POS option to merchants by turning their cellphones into a tool to receive payments via NFC technology. We have also improved the pairing process of mobile POS devices with merchants' cellphones and worked behind the scenes to reduce processing times, which had a positive impact on NPS and helped to improve the experience for merchants and buyers. With more personalization in the Mercado Pago app, our seller homepage now prioritizes the features that merchants most need on a day-to-day basis.In FinTech Services, we continued to search for ways to facilitate financial inclusion. We expanded our credit card offer to Mexico and launched our collateralized credit card solution in Brazil, where the user receives credit limits equivalent to the value of funds deposited into their accounts. These products enable consumers to start building a credit score and take advantage of the possibilities that a credit card brings for many for the first time ever. Innovations in credit enabled us to attract new users. For merchants, we now offer a business credit card, using open finance to contribute to scoring. For consumers in our lower risk cohorts, the new product enables them to offer larger, longer duration loans in our app, personalizing the loan to their needs and expanding the use cases of our credit product.As our product stack expands, we have focused on facilitating a simplified navigation around all of the different products available on Mercado Pago. Our digital account homepage combines the most used features such as transfers, credit limits, investment positions and insurance, adapting to the user's profile. We have seen increased traffic to all of our key digital account products as a results. Digital account users in Brazil can now see a summary of their monthly activity on a personalized report, an enhancement that brings more information to the user about their finances. The report also highlights new offerings that may be useful to the user such as our certificates of deposit and investment funds, alongside credit products and our remunerated accounts.All of the innovations offered by MercadoLibre and Mercado Pago continue to have a deep intrinsic impact in Latin America by generating economic and financial inclusion for entrepreneurs and individuals. A recent report, in partnership with Euromonitor, shows that MercadoLibre is the main source of income for 1.8 million families in the region, and that for 54% of users in the region, Mercado Pago was the first digital payment method available to them.This was just a snapshot of the innovations delivered by our teams in 2023. In 2024, our users can expect even more because, as always at MercadoLibre, best is yet to come. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Ruben of Morgan Stanley. I'd like to dig in a bit on the logistics network. We see that the net shipping fees and some of the shipping COGS, looks like it was a bit more of a drag than in recent quarters. So I was wondering if you could help with what changed sequentially, whether it was more seasonality or if there's been, let's say, sequential changes in investment areas such as shipping campaigns or DC builds in the quarter. And then, perhaps zooming out a bit on the logistics network, how you think about the state of the network, where you are for shipping speed, shipping fees, and how you think about the intensity of investment in those areas for the year ahead versus '23? Any color there would be very helpful. [Audio Gap]Compared to last year, lower delay rates, more fulfillment penetration, particularly in Brazil, and more free shipping coming from Meli+, together with a network that has expanded over the year and particularly in Q3. So, going to your specific question about margin compression or sequential margin compression, we also experienced some cost pressures during Q4 that you will see reverted in early Q1. And basically, those headwinds in Q4 come mainly for the following reasons. Number one, this is the first quarter in which Meli+ has been fully operating, and that means that we have increased the level of free shipping offered in Brazil and Mexico. As I think we've discussed before, Meli+ is a strategic and long-term investment that we think will continue increasing loyalty and driving incremental orders and GMV. So it's a conscious investment on our part.Second, I think the growth of 1P in our business, whose GMV was 50% higher Q-over-Q in dollars, also acts as a headwind, basically because there are no sellers paying for shipping revenues, given that we are the sellers in the case of 1P. I think that going to point number three, in previous quarters, we flagged that some of the shipping gains in terms of take rate were due to the negotiated [ performance ] of cost increases from our suppliers after already having passed through higher prices to seller at the start of the year, and those costs are now hitting our P&L as we were expecting. And on the fourth, I think Argentina also added some pressure as we decided not to fully pass inflation through to our prices on the spot in an environment with accelerated inflation and a lot of uncertainty in the market. Of course, then you have peak season, which is the biggest component of the sequential compression of shipping costs. There is a ramp-up in capacity as to be able to attend demand coming from our buyers. There is also an increase in unit costs coming from labor hours and vans and truck drivers, et cetera. And that is the biggest component of the sequential compression, which you will see probably reverted in early Q1 in 2024.Finally, and just to wrap up on the first part of the question, it's also important to note that we were expecting most of these increases in costs, and that is one of the reasons why we decided to increase our flat fees, so the charge that we make to the sellers when they sell items below the free shipping threshold. If you recall, we increased that fee in Brazil approximately in July or August, and with the same in late Q3 in Mexico. And this is one of the levers we have used to manage our shipping P&L as well, and it's a good example of how we manage the profit and loss of the company in a consolidated manner and not on a line-by-line basis.So, to your second part of the question, I think, as we've been saying many times, in the long run, there will be opportunities for us to continue monetizing our logistics network. We are not desperate for that. We think long term, not only in monetization, but also in remaining competitive in terms of prices to our buyers and to our sellers, and we are conscious on how to execute around that opportunity. Our next question comes from the line of Irma Sgarz of Goldman Sachs. I have 2 very quick questions. Firstly, on Mexico, sequentially, the margin was a little bit lower into the fourth quarter, which is obviously to be expected, given the seasonality. But 1P, I think, plays less of a role here. So I was wondering if you could just elaborate on the drivers here. I imagine like some of the capacity -- logistics capacity ramp-up has to do with that. But is there anything else that we should be mindful of?And then, on the Commerce take rate, this builds a little bit on the earlier question, but we also noticed that there was a sequential decline quarter-over-quarter. And is this just basically sort of a reflection of -- and I'm excluding 1P here. But is that just mostly really a reflection of category mix and logistics? And is there anything else at play that we should -- in revenues and shipping revenue dynamics that you just described that we should be mindful of? Especially as we look into 2024 and think about this line, [ whether ] there should be further compression coming into the Commerce take rate. And maybe, sorry, if you can also add to that the influence at lower funding cost of rates that should be positive for the take rate, but I don't think we saw much of an effect, if I'm not mistaken. So if you could just also squeeze that in. Ariel here again. So on Mexico, sequential compression, I think you are spot on with some of your hypotheses, and it relates to what I was explaining before. So, everything that I just described about operating in peak season with building capacity before the events and increase in unit cost, it's actually more complex in Mexico for 2 reasons. On the one hand, in Mexico, during Q4, we opened 3 fulfillment centers and 1 cross-docking station, big cross-docking station. As we've been pointing out over the last few quarters, we have a capacity constraint there that we need to fix. And of course, whenever you open new warehouses such as these ones, the ramp-up process is a bit costly, and that's part of what has happened over the quarter. Secondly, our existing warehouses were operating at maximum capacity. And that also put some extra pressure in terms of productivity for our fulfillment operations. So in the end, there's nothing that we were surprised about. We are managing the cost and the performance of the network. But we think we are in good shape for the future. So, no comments on the second part of the question on some things that you should expect or that we should call out there. Irma, it's Martin here. Regarding the funding costs being lower, it should benefit the credit business, of course, because it lowers the cost of funding for that operation. So, that should improve NIMAL, and it also should help us on the -- on both the Commerce side, as well as the FinTech side, because it lowers the cost of discounting coupons. So, that should result in improvements in margins. So, probably -- let me build on that, Martin. Probably, you will see more of an impact with regards to -- on the marketplace, where the fee we charge for including installments is fixed. On the FinTech side of business -- on the Acquiring side of business, many times when the funding cost is lower, we end up passing some of those savings to consumers, and that is not as straightforward in the marketplace. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Ford of Bank of America. Congratulations on the quarter. I was curious, how should we think about service transfer pricing and the recurring tax impact on profitability? And when it comes to advertising, how should we think about ad penetration rates in 2024 and the receptiveness of the product stack with larger display advertisers, now that they've had time to really understand the product and maybe build their budgets coming into this year? Bob, I think you're referring to the withholding -- the incremental withholding tax that we started booking this quarter, as we explained on the shareholders letter. I think if you -- obviously, it's a big charge, and this is the reason why we excluded it from the results -- [ the same ] results because it generated a big distortion in Q4 results. Just to put in perspective, the full charge of roughly $350 million, only 6% of that corresponds to this particular quarter. The way to look at that is by roughly, I would say, $20 million incremental cost per quarter will result for this incremental tax that we're going to be starting to provision from now on. To complement that, keep in mind that the $350 million of one-off charge were fully funded because throughout the last 10 years, we're funding a judiciary account with those amounts. So if in the event that we lose this case -- we will continue disputing it. In the event that we lose it, it will not have a material cash impact on our results. So, in summary, I think it's about $20 million per quarter, the impact going forward. Bob, this is Ariel. So, going back to your question on advertising, I think I'll start by saying that we are extremely pleased with the Ads results from the quarter. Our revenues grew 72% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis. It's the seventh consecutive quarter going above 70%, and that's driven mainly by Brazil and Mexico. I think, as we mentioned in our shareholder letter, we added 53,000 new advertisers this year. And this is a great achievement and shows how strong the level of interest in our product it is today, and we expect to build on that in the coming quarters.On the sequential penetration, I think while Ads continue to grow at a very fast pace, GMV accelerated at an even faster pace this quarter. And it is the case that Ads revenue does not necessarily follow one-to-one the growth pattern of our GMV. Particularly during Q4, our GMV accelerated from 59% growth in Q3 to 79% in Q4. And it's worth maybe highlighting the case of Argentina, which represents 20% of our GMV but only around 10% of our Ads revenue. And that's the main offender for sequential penetration. In such a high inflation context, the lack of stocks in the seller hands disincentivized some of the Ads investments. And simultaneously, advertisers were not necessarily updating their investment amounts, together with their item prices. And for that, we did already deploy some features that automatically update us budget whenever they are -- there is an inflationary context in item prices. So, as I was saying before, we remain extremely confident in our product stack, and we see ample opportunities for growth in the coming years.Regarding display, it's been not so long for our current product format to be live, and we are going through the learning curve in terms of go-to-market strategies, as well as the brands that are still learning about branding possibilities in MercadoLibre. So we believe in the product that we have, in the value proposition we are offering with display ads as an awareness tool for one of the largest audiences in Latin America. But we need to be patient, and we think that we can continue building on the product we have to gain even more traction and make a display an even bigger business for MercadoLibre and for our sellers. Our next question comes from the line of Kaio Prato of UBS. So I have one question on the credit portfolio, please. I saw your origination was much higher this quarter. And you mentioned that your own credit card is one of the most used in your platform, I think among the 5 most used. So I just would like to have a sense about how much of this origination is coming from the credit card and how are you seeing the contribution specifically of the credit card in our GMV today? In other words, what's the level of GMV penetration today versus 1 year ago? And finally, what makes you comfortable with the credit card origination today? Because we are already seeing some spike in short-term NPLs, which is attributed to these product. Kaio, let me start by the end, and then I'll go back to the first questions. With regards to what makes us more comfortable, we first launched credit cards in Brazil 3 years ago, and we have been iterating -- the models we use to score credit, we have done many iterations [indiscernible] every year. And each iteration we do, we get better results. We saw the credit situation overall in Brazil worse than 1.5 years ago, 2 years ago. And so, we were more cautious. And now, throughout last year, we started feeling more and more comfortable, and we have been increasing the amount of origination in Brazil. And also, we launched a credit card in Mexico. And we've been, I would say, aggressive in rolling it up. When we look at, as we say, in the shareholder letters, when we look at total payment volume for our credit card, year-over-year, it has grown well above 100%. So we have been aggressive with regards to that.And in terms of portfolio, there has been high origination. We have not disclosed the origination amount, but we have disclosed the total portfolio. And you can see how the chunk coming from the credit card is growing. It has reached $1.2 billion, which is over -- nearly 100% growth versus a year ago. And on top of that, I would say that the credit card is growing in exactly the way we expected it to grow. We are expanding in the lower segments and also starting to have a little more traction in the higher segments. And the penetration we see in the marketplace is growing in Brazil and in Mexico. And most importantly, when we look at the total penetration of credits in the marketplace, which adds our consumer loans, and our credit card is growing significantly. So it's not that we are cannibalizing consumer loans with the credit card, which has probably a lower profitability per transaction, but rather that we are adding to that number. Okay. Can you share the level of penetration nowadays in your platform? I would say this is -- we have not disclosed the precise level. But we can disclose that this is the largest means of payment we have today in Mexico. Credit, I mean, not total payments. All of the credit products available, our own credit -- and credit card is the largest one. Our next question comes from the line of [ Maria Infantes ]. Pardon me, [ Maria Clara Infantes ]. So I would like to explore the profitability of the 1P operations. In the release, you mentioned that you achieved better profitability trends despite the seasonality of the business in the fourth quarter. So can you please give us more granularity on how the contribution margin of the business has been evolving lately? Do you feel that the accelerated growth of the category has been allowing you to have better negotiation terms with suppliers? And how do you feel about the growth potential of the channel going forward? How far are we from reaching an optimum profitability level in the division? Yes, we have made significant progress in the 1P business throughout the year, and we feel that we are in much more sustainable footing today than we were maybe a year ago. As you say, we made improvements on margins. We look at -- our product purchase margin has improved a few percentage points in 2023, and we expect to continue improving that. That gave us confidence to grow our business, and we did grow it in Q4 by 60% year-on-year in dollars and 85% in local currency, taking advantage of the -- obviously, the peak season that we had on [ El Buen Fin ] in Mexico, as well as Black Friday. So we are making significant progress. As I mentioned, we -- one way of looking at the 1P business is -- obviously, we don't share the actual profitability. I can give you some guidance in terms of how we're doing. If you were to look at the 1P business, now, it is profitable before considering fixed costs and including all variable costs, that is shipping, as well as financing. So one way to look at it is, the more volume we have, the better we dilute the fixed cost of that business. So we are at a point where we feel that we can scale the business. That should start to contribute to lower deficit that we have in terms of EBIT. Finally, we think we have plenty of room to continue to attach more advertising into that business, and that creates a big opportunity to continue improving profitability of 1P. Ariel here. Just to complement Martin, so we continue to think that 1P is strategic in order for us to sustain our competitive position to gain market share, and more importantly, to satisfy customer demand through better selection and price competitiveness. So we continue to be strategic in deciding which categories and products we serve with 1P, while simultaneously optimizing our consolidated P&L. So while we don't have a specific target regarding 1P penetration for the future, we are encouraged by the progress we've made in terms of profitability, in terms of supplier relationships and operating processes. And the more confident we feel about that, the more confident -- the more probability that we could scale in the future. And the bigger we get, the more benefits of scale we will capture, as Martin was saying just before.Having said that, there is seasonality in terms of category demand and the role that 1P plays in the different categories. Particularly, consumer electronics was a high demand category during peak season, and it's one category where 1P plays an even more strategic role for us. So to wrap up, we have many initiatives in place to continue improving our retail business, both in terms of economics, as well as in terms of selection, price management and supplier relationship, and we'll continue to work on that. Our next question comes from the line of Trevor Young of Barclays. First one, just to build on the earlier question on advertising, can you remind us where we are in terms of penetration on a geographic basis? I think to your earlier comments, advertising may be remaining softer in Argentina and perhaps stronger in Mexico and Brazil. Just any numbers to help kind of frame the progression there, particularly as the GMV growth in Argentina is probably optically making that ad penetration look weaker. And then secondly, in Argentina, items growth accelerating for the second straight quarter, up 22%, I think. How much of that is related to kind of the worsening inflation dynamic in that market and more of that pull-forward of consumption versus maybe some improvement in consumer demand? And just appreciate that you don't give any guidance, but at a high level, do you think that degree of unit growth is durable? Trevor, Ariel here. I think we don't disclose specific numbers in terms of penetration by country, but we have shared that while the overall Ads revenue penetration as percentage of GMV was 1.6% in Q4, if you were to exclude Argentina from that equation, you would get something like 1.9%. So Argentina is definitely a big detractor in terms of measuring Ads revenue as a percentage of GMV. Yes. On the successful items sold that you mentioned in Argentina, just like you said, we saw the first half of the year where items were flat year-on-year, mainly because of the recession that we faced in the first half of 2023. Then at the second half, as the government put more money in people's pocket, we saw a pickup in volume, both in terms of GMV and items sold, which increased 12% in Q3 and accelerated to 21% in Q4. And that's -- part of that is inflation [indiscernible] advanced purchases ahead of expected devaluation towards the end of the year, which eventually happened in December with the new government. And towards the second half of December, we saw a slowdown of those volumes. But that's correct, your assumption about our consumption. Our next question comes from the line of Joao Soares of Citi. Yes. Just one question on my end. I just wanted to get -- I'm just trying to understand the different moving parts for your operating profit margin, thinking about 2024. I think you mentioned that we should see some reversion in terms of the logistics cost pressure already in the first quarter. And of course, we have structural growth. The 1P business, of course, affected by -- naturally, there's going to be seasonality, but on a more -- on a year, we should see an increase in penetration of the 1P. So I just want to try to understand different moving parts, also taking into consideration that you're growing, again, your credit portfolio within credit cards, which should come with increase in provisions. So I know it's -- I don't want to see forward-looking statements, but just trying to understand what should we have in mind for different moving parts for your operating profit margin. Thank you, Joao, for your question. First of all, I'll discuss margins. Let me clarify that all the numbers I will be discussing contemplate the adjustment for the $351 million of one-offs. Given the size of it, we felt that it was easier to explain and taking those -- that one-off out and obviously including the appropriate cost corresponding to this particular quarter. I would say that if you look at margins on a year-on-year basis and excluding the one-off that I mentioned before, we improved margins by 270 basis points because of expanding the business and basically growing the business and diluting our fixed costs, while at the same time, we continue to invest behind the many growth opportunities. One of them is credit card, as you mentioned, but also fulfillment and several other things that we're doing at the company. This is something that we plan to continue. We think that we run a business that should scale very nicely in the long term. I will continue to focus on managing costs very efficiently. And as we continue to grow the business, we should be able to continue scaling in the long term. Q4, in particular, is a quarter with seasonality in terms of lower margins because of the investments that we make in Commerce, particularly behind the special events of Black Friday and El Buen Fin. Furthermore, in Q4, we intensified certain investments, as Ari mentioned before, as a fulfillment 1P and free shipping. If you were to look at the sequential compressions of margins, we had roughly 4.5 points of compressions in margin. That compression comes mainly from 1P and shipping, which affects our cost of goods sold.In terms of our 1P business, 2/3 of the compression comes from the 1P business, as Ari mentioned. The revenues from 1P grew from 9% to 12% of total revenues. You can see that in our disclosures. And as you know, 1P has a different margin structure than 3P because almost 100% of the GMV is booked as revenues compared to just the take rate of the 3P business. So although there was pressure on the margin, the incremental negative impact on EBIT due to 1P was only $20 million during the Q. On the other hand, we generated more than $220 million incremental GMV from 1P, which resulted in market share gains of almost 10 percentage points of consumer electronics category, as Ari was mentioning before.The other part of the compression comes from shipping. As Ari mentioned, there is a seasonality factor in shipping during Q4, which comes with higher costs associated with peak season. It happened this quarter, and we expect this trend to revert back to normal in the following quarters. And then finally, investments that we're making -- we have been flagging over the last few quarters to the market, investments on a value proposition, which includes the launching of more fulfillment centers. We launched 3 -- we implemented 3 new fulfillment centers this quarter. The increased adoption of Meli+, which resulted in higher levels of free shipping. When you put all those together, that explains the compression that you see quarter-on-quarter. Let me add to that, your question regarding credit portfolio and provisions. Throughout this year, we have been able to expand our credit portfolio and furthermore gain share in credit cards. And despite that, we have been able to increase our net interest margin after losses and also decrease NPLs, which [ appears ] 30% for the first time in quite some time. So again, we don't guide it, but we are confident with how the credit business is evolving. Our next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan of Wolfe Research. I apologize if this was asked already, but one big picture question and then kind of one tactical one. So if you think about logistics, what are the big initiatives for 2024? Maybe with respect to expanding the fulfillment centers or the middle mile and last mile operations, how should we think about the CapEx levels as we kind of progress through the year? And then, the second one on competition. E-commerce players from China have caused pretty significant shifts and move into the U.S., and it is anticipated in several LatAm markets. Can you share any color on your thoughts and how you're positioning the business for any sort of like a potential competitive intensity growing? Deepak, this is Ariel. So in terms of logistics, I think -- I mean, we don't guide, and you know we don't disclose future numbers in terms of performance, et cetera. But just to reiterate what I said and Martin tried to explain, so most of the sequential compression on logistics was coming from peak season costs, which have been reverting during early Q1. So that's important. Having said that, we have many, many projects on hand to execute during 2024, none of which we think should drastically change the way we manage our P&L. We will invest in faster deliveries. We will continue investing in slower deliveries simultaneously. We will continue testing more automation and robotics as we have been doing so over the last few years. We will continue working with our technology team. We have thousands of developers fully dedicated to improving the processes and the experience of our customers with logistics and the way we operate inside our warehouses and cross-docking stations. So, all in all, we will focus in becoming more efficient, in serving our customers better, in improving our delivery promises and execution, and to support the business of the marketplace with more categories and better services.Regarding the Asian competition, I'd say we've seen Temu, in particular, more present in Mexico over the last few months. But still, as you can see from our results, we grew 32% year-over-year in items sold in Mexico. So we are extremely pleased with how we are executing in the countries. All categories in Mexico are showing good year-over-year GMV growth. While we see some of the Asian players focused on apparel and home and mostly focused on low-ASP items, we see our growth in those segments extremely healthy. So in the end, we are confident that our competitive advantages, particularly logistics and payments, remain strong. We have a unique logistics network. We have a unique buy now, pay later, and credit card offering in Brazil, in Mexico, et cetera, which we think will continue helping us drive our business and our market share gains in those markets.So, to wrap up, in the past several years, we have been successful in competing against Asian players who were executing strategies similar to the ones that current players are executing. So we expect to continue doing so in the future, building on our strengths and successfully competing against whoever is operating in each of the markets where we are. Just on your question on CapEx, obviously, we don't guide future expenditures. But this year, 2023 was roughly $500 million invested on CapEx, which was fully funded with our own cash flow generation. Our next question comes from the line of Marcelo Santos of JPMorgan. My first question is about Meli+. Is Meli+ a net negative in terms of P&L? I understand it has recurring benefits and has a lot of loyalty benefits. But when you think about the P&L impact, is it negative now? And should it remain negative in the future? That's the first question.And the second question is, did you also see the seasonal -- this peak costs last year? Or was there something that you had stronger this year because you're running at fuller capacity? Thank you for your question. The first part of the question was related to Meli+. Okay, sorry. Meli+ -- we don't look at Meli+ as an individual P&L. We look at this as a way to generate incrementality in our marketplace. So if you break it down between content, content is basically cost-neutral because we pass on the benefits that we get. Basically the cost that we pay for the content, we pass it on to our consumers. And then the shipping, obviously, we'll provide more free shipping, but that generates incremental volume that then in turn should finance that operation. In the short term, we are investing behind these initiatives. Of course, we're also investing in advertising. But it shouldn't be looked at as an individual P&L and more so as part -- a critical part of our strategy for Commerce.And then regarding the peak season, if we saw a particular peak -- a special peak in terms of cost, yes, probably this quarter, the incrementality of cost due to peak season was a little bit higher than we saw last year. But again, as Ari mentioned, this is something that will revert in the following quarters. And it was expected to have a peak -- incremental cost during peak season. Our next question comes from the line of Soomit Datta of New Street Research. Just one at this stage, please. On Argentina and the FinTech business, as we kind of contemplate entering a recessionary environment in Argentina, how should we think about the FinTech business? The e-commerce business is a bit more kind of logical to me in that sort of environment in terms of thinking about consumer demand, et cetera, units sold. But just on the FinTech side, it's not clear to me kind of what the drivers will be exactly under that scenario. So if you could kind of help me with that, that would be great. I would say, let me try to split the question between the different businesses we have. With regards to Acquiring, I would say, it's a business that also is very much independent of there being a recession or not. Obviously, the volumes are impacted, but we are growing so much by gaining share and the impact tends to be -- could be smaller. Let us not get into what could happen in the future, but it's a business that people still continue to sell and process payments. So what can vary a little bit is basically the growth rate, but no more than that. Where we've been more cautious is on the FinTech services side of the business, on issuing credit. We don't have yet a credit card in Argentina, and we have been more cautious throughout the fourth quarter, even before the elections, knowing that there could be a devaluation and there could be increased NPLs, and that's why we were already more cautious towards the end of last year. And most of the volume growth you saw is coming from Mexico and Brazil and not from Argentina. And then we'll see what happens with the other FinTech service products. What we're seeing today is an inflation there in Q4. And even today, it has peaked and is higher than it was, and that is a further incentive, and we have seen that for people to bring money from their bank into the Mercado Pago account, which is currently remunerating [ 8% ] year-on-year, and it's a huge advantage versus 0% at most banks. So we saw, throughout the fourth quarter, an increase in asset under management. You don't see that in total numbers because the devaluation at the end of the year, but in local currency, we grew assets in our account by 6x year-over-year. So I would say that I'm comfortable with the impact we saw towards the end of last year. We cannot predict what -- we don't forecast what will happen in the future. And if I may complement, the credit business in Argentina continues to have the lowest NPLs compared to all other markets, and it continues to be extremely profitable in terms of [indiscernible]. Our next question comes from the line of Neha Agarwala of HSBC. A quick one. I noticed that the ticket size for your credit card loans across the segments have been coming off. Is this a conscious decision? Or is this a trend based on the demand that you're seeing from your clients? And any color on the credit uptake in Mexico, what kind of products are working in Mexico, wow is the response on the credit card, that would be very helpful. Let me start with the first part of the question, and then take on the second one. The first one, I would say, with regards to the credit card loans, they have been falling. It has been totally been a conscious decision. What we have been doing is reaching out to more consumers who did not have a credit card in the past with micro lines, where we say that it's typically BRL 400 or BRL 200 lines, so it's really small lines, and also with what we call warrantied cards, where we ask people to deposit BRL 100 or BRL 200 or BRL 300 in their account and offer a card that is warrantied by the amount. So definitely, that has been part of our strategy in order to be -- for many of these people, the first time they get a credit card.And with regards to -- you mentioned credit uptake in Mexico. I would say that basically we have been growing a lot. First, the credit card, which is the latest product we launched and has been a quite successful launch. And when you look at the combined volume we are loaning to consumers, adding the consumer loans to the credit cards, that business has also been growing nicely. Just in terms of the asset quality trends that you are seeing in Mexico? Sorry, could you repeat the question, please? Asset quality trends for your -- both the consumer lending and the credit card book in Mexico? Is it better than Brazil? Has it been improving? Or are you cautious there? It has been -- remained fairly stable. The profitability has continued to be good. Our next question comes from the line of Marvin Fong of BTIG. Two, if I may. First, I think maybe you touched on this earlier, but the FinTech take rate, I think there was some compression there, part of which was related to financing costs. And I think in prior quarters, we had thought that perhaps the take rate would fall kind of in step with your funding costs. So are you seeing some spread compression there? And any thought about how we should think about that going forward?And then second question, just to touch again on the credit portfolio, the consumer loan balance fell a little bit quarter-over-quarter. So was that a function of what you were saying about Argentina and pausing there? Or was there some currency issues or any kind of highlight there? Is it sort of you're focusing more on a credit card and maybe the consumer book won't have as much growth for the time being? I would say on the FinTech take rate, part of the impact is larger portion of our credit book coming from credit cards, which have -- the portion of those loans that are interest-bearing are lower than in the other kind of loans. That has some impact to that. Also on the other part of the FinTech business, when you look at our Acquiring business, as we move into SMBs, they typically have lower -- slightly lower take rate, albeit with significantly larger volume. I'd say those are to impact -- they have had an impact on the overall take rate.And the second one, you mentioned, if I got it right, was if there was an impact in the credit portfolio because of the Argentina devaluation, right? It's sort of a part of the question. I was just noticing the consumer loans kind of fell very slightly quarter-over-quarter. And I was hypothesis that perhaps there might be some currency impact. Or just -- or is there something else behind that? Yes, there was some impact for 2 reasons. The first one is, in the fourth quarter, before the elections, we were more conservative in issuing credit in Argentina. And the second one is more direct, which is the currency devaluation. Since we take the portfolios at the end of the quarter, the devaluation happened throughout December, and therefore the loans portfolio we're showing in Argentina is devalued already. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Martin de los Santos, CFO, for any closing remarks. Well, thank you, everybody. As we mentioned, we are super excited with the results of the quarter and we're closing a great 2023. And we look forward to seeing you when we present results for Q1 of 2024. Thank you very much. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.","MercadoLibre's earnings conference call for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 . today, we will share our quarterly highlights on video . we will begin our live Q&A session with our CEO, Marcos Galperin, chief financial officer, Martin de los Santos .",0.0

I'm Richard Cathcart, Mercado Libre Investor Relations Officer. Today, we will share our quarterly highlights on video, after which we will begin our live Q&A session with our management team.
Before we go on to discuss our results for the first quarter of 2024, I remind you that management may make or refer to and is present may contain forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. So please refer to the disclaimer on screen, which will also be available in our earnings materials on our Investor Relations website. With that, let's begin with a summary of our results. Hello, everyone. I'm pleased to report another quarter of solid results with excellent operational and financial performance in Brazil and Mexico.  Both countries focus GMV growth, approximately 30% year-on-year as we carry over a strong momentum from Q4. This above market growth is being driven by several factors, to improvement of user experience minimized as a highlight, our investment in chip infrastructure, which are driving faster growth in specific target regions and a well-executed marketing campaign that is leveraging on the awareness we generated in Q4 around peak season.
In addition, our advertising business continues to grow and which regular levels of GMV penetration in all of the markets where we operate. Mercado Pago also had a solid performance in Mexico and Brazil. Some of the highlights being the acquiring business growing at accelerated rate sequentially in both countries. We had a solid credit growth portfolio surpassing the $4.4 million and growing strongly from last year and a strong quarter for Mercado Pago credit card. -- we issued 1.5 million cars during this quarter. The TPV reached $1.9 billion, growing 133% from last year. In summary, in Q1, we delivered a strong operational performance in commerce and fintech both in Brazil and Mexico, which has offset the negative impact of a weak macro in Argentina, and the peso devaluation in the.
Before turning to our financial performance in more detail, I'd like to highlight that there are a couple of reporting updates that have taken effect in this quarter. Investors can find a summary of the impacts on our financials. In this quarter, shareholders letter and a full reconciliation in our earnings presentation.
My comments today will refer to the numbers that are comparable to the figures we reported in Q1 last year. Consolidated revenues grew at a fast pace on the back of the strong operational momentum I mentioned earlier. Brazil and Mexico, had an outstanding quarter and the revenues growth was sufficient to offset the impact of headwinds in Argentina. Income from operations grew strongly year-on-year, once again, with large expansion being driven by Mexico and Brazil. This reflects the combination of growth, scale and cost efficiency that drives operational leverage. And our long-term ambition is to continue delivering both growth and profit, and we are confident in our ability to achieve that.
Net income grew at a faster pace than income from operation as lower FX losses in Argentina were partially offset by lower operational income in that country. Furthermore, the reporting updates I mentioned earlier, have a broadly neutral impact on me.
Overall, we are very pleased with the performance of the business in Q1 despite the headwind from Argentina. And this is a great way to Mercado Libre 25th anniversary. Now I'll pass over to Richard for more on the solid foundations we have built over the past 25 years, looking ahead for the next 25 years of Mercado Libre. In 2024, Mercado Libre will celebrate its 25th anniversary.  And we look back on the progress we've made in the democratizing, commerce and financial services in Latin America. Today, Meli is the leading technology company in the region and a major tech company globally, and is being recognized for its innovation, growth and impact in the region. In addition to business growth and impact, Mercado Libre has a consistent track record of generating shareholder value since our IPO in 2007. We look forward to the next 25 years with great confidence and optimism as we still see plenty of opportunities to continue to grow and fulfill our mission in a region that provides us with a large addressable market. In Latin America, e-commerce is far from mature and financial services are ripe for disruption.
We are the leading e-commerce platform in the region, which has significant potential for growth from new buyer and higher frequency as engagement and penetration of retail rise most extensive delivery network in the region and by offering the widest assortment and the best UX, we have become a natural destination for buyers and sellers. This drives a uniquely powerful and self-reinforcing network effect as sellers invest to maximize their sales by capitalizing on our traffic, while buyers receive an ever-improving value prop, which drives more traffic and growth.
We're also building 1 of the largest retail media platforms in the region, which leverages our extensive first-party data to offer advertisers unique audience targeting capabilities and complete full funnel strategy. We are challenging the status quo in financial services and by offering a wide array of easy-to-use services for individuals and merchants in large markets underserved by incumbents we have become 1 of the region's leading fintechs. Our ecosystem is our competitor or in fintech services. Its data is uniquely rich and enables us to cross-sell. It's also enabled us to have a better view of credit risk and operate a business, which matches the lowest cost to serve in the region. We have built a highly profitable acquiring business on the back of the technology and know-how developed for our marketplace. We are 1 of the largest fintech in this market and are well placed for market share gains across the region.
We are also building Melimize with the ambition of being the largest and most valued loyalty in the region by leveraging our ecosystem to offer unique benefits is at the heart of everything we do. And having 1 of the largest teams of engineers in the region ensures nonstop innovation and product development.
We have a diversified mix of revenue with ample opportunities for growth monetization.  Our scale, financial discipline and tech growth mentality, mean we have low-cost structures with solid and sustainable profitability. Mercado Libre's powerful intrinsic impact on the people we serve encourages entrepreneurship financial inclusion. We are proud of the achievements over the last 25 years, but our mission is far from complete.  As a leader in an e-commerce market that is far from mature and 1 of the leaders in the financial services market that is ripe for disruption, we are confident and optimistic in our future growth. as we look forward to the next 25 years we are confident that the best is yet to come.[Operator Instructions] Joining us for the Q&A are Martin de los Santos, CFO, Osvaldo Gimenez, FinTech President; and Ariel Szarfsztejn, Commerce President;  please wait while we compile our Q&A roster. Our first question comes from Andrew Ruben with Morgan Stanley. Congratulations on the 25 years. It's helpful on the table you provide in the release that breaks down the peso-denominated and non-peso EBIT. Just thinking about the Argentina business, the units down 5%. It didn't strike us as a major decline, but you had a big hit on EBIT. So was hoping you could walk us through the situation during the quarter where you had mismatch between revenue and costs. And perhaps if you could, even how the business evolved on a month-over-month basis within given how fast moving the Argentina macro situation has been. Andrew, are you -- thank you for your question. This is Martin. Yes. As you know, we -- in Argentina, we faced 2 things happening. The evaluation of Argentina, which reduced the size of our business. And as you know, Argentina is high margin -- EBIT margin business operation. And then we have the macro situation that obviously puts some pressure in terms of consumption. We've seen reduced volume and demand even though, as you know, we manage a marketplace, which is very resilient to this type of situation. So I think we outperformed the consumption in general in the country, but we did suffer some loss of volume in Argentina in the commerce side of the business.
In terms of cost mismatch, I think we saw some inflation in terms of our shipping cost in Argentina. There was some pressure on that line of our P&L. And then to wrap up the situation in the country. On the fintech side, the business performed extremely well. We continue to have a very strong brand in Argentina, growing 64% year-on-year. We doubled the number of users for investment products, the acquiring business in Argentina growing 300% more than inflation and then active users also running at 31% year-on-year. So  overall, I think that's what you can -- you see in terms of operating income. And then when you go below operating income, as the double effect -- exchange rate situation in Argentina has been normalizing. We see significantly lower FX losses in Argentina -- so that's compensated in the net income line of the P&L. So overall, I would say that Argentina was a headwind in terms of EBIT partially compensated at the net income level because of the lower FX and lower taxes that we paid this quarter in Argentina. But obviously, we had an extraordinary quarter in Brazil and Mexico that I'm sure will go in more detail later on the call. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Bob Ford with Bank of America. Happy anniversary and congratulations on a great quarter. Can you quantify the impact from the shift of Easter on the marketplace as well as Pago and Brazil and Mexico? And then in Argentina, what percent of GMV is done by sellers with less than 10,000 that is if I look at TC do per month? And how much would that -- would the proposed tax cuts represent to those smaller sellers in terms of GMV. And what do you need before you're willing to turn the key on interoperability in Argentina in terms of economics, security or any other issues? . Bob, it's Martin here. Let me take the first part. I think you were asking about the effect of Easter on our volume. But as you know, we always see a reduced volume on those days because typically, in our countries, it's 4 consecutive holiday days. I mean this quarter, in particular, was a little bit stronger because last year, Easter fell on Q2 and this year fell in Q1. So if you look at the numbers for March, there were affected by those 4 days. So there was a little bit of loss of volume, which will eventually reverse next quarter because the opposite happens that will play in favor of April probably. So that's in terms of the... Is that fair... Given the -- is that the way we should talk about it -- we only source the month-by-month numbers. But I'd say in March, we probably lost 5 or 6 percentage points in a particular month. We'll see what happens in ever when we announced . Bob, let me answer the part of the interparty question in Argentina. So as you know, we built a QR code network that is extremely successful in Argentina, -- and a few years back, we were required to interoperate in account-to-account transactions, which we have been doing for a few years -- 2 or 3 years now, and that is working very well. And now what -- there's a mandate that we need to also interoperate for credit card transactions which are a minor part of our transactions in Argentina and the majority are account to account. So this is a minor part of that volume is credit card transactions. And the way we built the network is there was not a -- when we built it a few years back, there was not a standard for transactions. We do those transactions in a way with our process as online payment transactions. And so to be able to interoperate, we need 2 things. On the 1 hand, there's a technical requirement that those transactions need to be tokenized for the network to be secure. And on the other hand, is we need to agree on commercial terms with the counterparties, which are likely to be -- will be banks and other wallets. We are in that process. We  have already on our side, we are able to process to tokenized transactions, but we have not yet received those. And meanwhile, we are negotiating with the banks about if there will be some sort of interchange or fee for the wallets involved in these interoperable transactions. Bob, I think to answer your last question regarding Argentina, obviously, we are observing and analyzing the reform that's going on right now to see what the impact would be on our on our merchants. And then the number of merchants, I think you are referring to smaller margins is a number that we don't disclose specifically. Again, congratulations. . Our next question comes from Marcelo Santos with JPMorgan. I wanted to ask you about the profitability of Argentina. There was a very steep decline in the EBIT contribution of Argentina versus what you reported last year. I just wanted to understand, is this kind of a new ongoing level, a new level for Argentina, given this new currency reality? Or was there something more like one-off in this quarter that could be reversed in the next couple of quarters? Just because Today, Argentina is the way you disclose almost the same profitability as the rest, why it used to be much more profitable. So I just wanted to understand that. Thank you. . Martin here, Marcelo. Thank you for your question. I think we mentioned before, Argentina had some tough macro situation. The devaluation also didn't help because when you look at the revenue books of Argentina, because of the valuation by definition, strong relative to the other countries. Also had some tough macro and demand issues that affected, in particular, the commerce side of the business. But then also Brazil and Mexico grew extraordinarily high -- sorry, high rate. Just to put it in perspective, the EBIT of Argentina decreased year-on-year, as you mentioned, but the EBIT outside of Argentina grew by 185 percentage points. So almost double the EBIT coming from other countries. So as a result of that,  you can see the current -- the share of EBIT coming from Argentina now is at 19% compared to a year ago, that was about 60%. So I think Argentina again, the devaluation is behind us. That we see macro effect in Q1, and we'll have to see how the rest of the year plays out. But again, we think that in terms of the EBIT contribution is a little bit normalized for the other reasons that I mentioned earlier today. That as we have the exchange rate higher than it used to be with the devaluation is more normalized because it's lower FX losses, but on a net income level, the variance is not so high, okay? So -- so I will focus a lot more on net income as the main metric to evaluate the results of Mercado Libre. As we have been saying in the past, we were mentioning that there was a little bit of a distortion in the EBIT because of the  FX in Argentina now is behind. So I think in terms of the FX distortion, I could say that it's something that is a new normal, and now we have numbers that are more normalized in terms of EBIT results. And your next question comes from Irma Sgarz with Goldman Sachs. I'd like to ask about Melimize and logistics. Thank you for the use for commentary in the shareholder letter. Now as you get further into the rollout of the Mellimise program. Where are you in terms of logistics network efficiency gains from the uplift to overall volume and units per shipment?  Other costs from greater free shipping subsidies that you provide there now more than offset by those efficiencies? Or will that take more time as you adjust the flow of the network and the overall engagement still rises. I'd also be curious if there's any notable differences in take-up and engagement with that program between Brazil and Mexico. Irma, Martin here. Yes, we have seen very good adoption of Melimise both in terms of adopting the many delivery date for those members that -- those users are enrolled into the Melimise program. But also, we have seen incremental engagement and volume on our platform. So the results that we are expecting in terms of growth driven by Melimise. We are seeing them there, and we are super excited with those results. Obviously, that increases a little bit the cost of our shipping operations. We estimate that year-on-year, have the number here to share with you. It does put some pressure on margin. I think it adds 20 basis points as a percentage of GMV of cost, but it's more than compensated that incremental volume that we're generating through Melimise. And then in terms of your first part of the question, optimization, we think we are still at very early stages of optimizing Melimise. Remember, minimize comes with Meli delivery date which is on a week that the user chooses to get their products. So as we continue to scale the Melimise, we will be able to lower cost of shipping by optimizing the way we  group certain products and the way we optimize the delivery cost of getting the products to our users. So it's early stages, but very optimistic and very encouraged by the results of engagement and adoption so far. Yes. That's very exciting. And may I just ask about also the reacceleration in TPV growth in Brazil. You highlighted new devices and -- and we know that you've been shifting up a market, but I was hoping to just get a bit more detail on the drivers of this acceleration and the direction of the incremental margin that comes attached to the revenues on this? So there were 2 components to the acceleration of TPV in Brazil. I would say the most relevant one, the more relevant 1 is online payment we have been able to -- I think there are several quarters in a row now where we have been able to accelerate the growth of online payments in Brazil, mostly by adding several larger merchants, big merchants and increasing the share of wallet we do with them. And there are several drivers for this, but definitely better performance and better approval rates.  We are very encouraged by how we see these operations continuing. And then on the point-of-sale business, as we mentioned in prior calls, we have been changing a go-to-market strategy, and that is having a good effect, and we are seeing that  business growing at an accelerated rate on a quarter-on-quarter basis. So both -- mostly online payments, but also to some degree, the point-of-sale business are accelerating in Brazil. . And just to complement that, in terms of monetization, as we disclosed on the investor presentation, you can see that we continue to increase the cross-selling of credit to our acquiring users. So that continues to improve the profitability of that business. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous. The change in Mercado Envios from agent to principal, the accounting impacts of that are all very clear. So thank you for that. But from a business point of view, what was the objective there? What does this mean in practice for the -- what does it mean in practice on the business side? And why you're doing it? Why you made this change in terms of conditions. Geoffrey, this is Ariel here. So we see the process on the opposite. So over the last 4 or 5 years, we've been switching from operating purely with national post offices and carriers across Latin America into building our own logistics network. And basically, that process has already occurred. So -- what we've done now is adjusted our terms and conditions, bearing ourselves the responsibility for the execution, which is something we've been already doing. So there's nothing new in terms of the way we operate. I think that process has occurred already, and we are just now adjusting contractually and formally the way we've been operating for quite some time. Okay. So it sort of reflects kind of you taking the risk rather than a national postal service taking the risk? Say that again? . So essentially, you're taking the risk on the shipping rather than the national postal service in the different countries, and that's why you've made this change. . We already had the risk. So this is what we've been doing since we launched our own last mile operation in 2019 since which have been taking over warehouses operations, our line costs, et cetera, et cetera. So nothing new, no risk profile changes. Right now, it's just formalizing something that has been happening already. I would say that there's no change operationally. There's no incremental risk. This is just an accounting adjustment that we make. And it reflects better the way the business is running. . Our next question comes from Neha Agarwala with HSBC. Just quickly on the credit business. We saw a continued decline in the 90-day NPL, but there was an increase in the early which you mentioned is partly because of the shift in the mix of business cohorts. Could you please elaborate on that as to why they have increased? And what do you mean by a shift to riskier cohorts. Thank you so much. So there were 2 components to the increase in early delinquencies. On the 1 hand, as you mentioned, we have been taking more risk going to riskier segments. And the reason we are doing that is because our models are better at forecasting risk and correctly evaluating the risk of each user. And therefore, we are also pricing this accordingly. And so even though there are higher NPL these credits have been priced with an adequate spread. So it's not a source of concern there. And the other factor that happened was the last week of March, the last week of the quarter ended with 4 days that were either weekend or holidays. And therefore, collections were typically lower than typical. Because in the last 4 days of the month, there was an invoice that we had been due in those days that was passed over to the following months, and there was a small effect for the fact that -- Good Friday and Thursday were the last 2 nonworking days of month. If I can ask the question, when I look at your average interest rate, and this is excluding the increase in provisions, there has been a drop of about 800 basis points quarter-on-quarter on the average interest rate for your loan book. I understand part of that is probably driven by the expansion in the credit card portfolio. But given the fact that you're moving into riskier cohorts, which are priced accordingly,  why such a sharp decline quarter-on-quarter? . It's Martin here. I think -- well, firstly, when we compare year-on-year, the NIM margins, I think is what you're referring to is improving despite the fact that we have a larger share of credit cards, which, as you know, is lower. On a sequential basis, typically Q1 -- actually, let's put the way, Q4 tends to be a good quarter for credits because a very strong collections because of the 13 months in the quarter and the year. So Q4 is a good month for collection. Q3 is seasonally a lower month for collections. So that's normal. It's something that is expected, in addition to 2 other things happening.  Speed in terms of growth of our credit card portfolio is also contributing to that and also the fact that we accelerated originations of other products, and that generates more provisions upfront. Remember, we provision 100% of the losses upfront when we originate. So we have a Q like Q1, where we accelerated sequentially originations, that tends to put pressure on margin.  Like Oswaldo mentioned, there's nothing to worry about. We continue to have very strong EBIT margin animal margin at 31.5 percentage points. So it's something that is under control and as expected. Your outlook on the credit business changed or modified slightly in the last month given that we are now looking at probably a higher for longer kind of rate scenario in both Brazil and Mexico. . Sorry, Neha, could you repeat the question, please? with your outlook in terms of picking up in originations in both Brazil and Mexico, has that changed over the last month given that we are probably now looking for a higher for longer rate scenario in both countries? No, it hasn't. We continue to have the same strategy as we have in the past, which is to continue to cautiously increase our credit book as we feel more confident in terms of our underwriting capabilities, as Osvaldo mentioned. And then also, we are focusing a lot on growing our credit card, which is a critical product for or fintech strategy because it has many benefits in addition to the credit card users that pick on -- start using the credit card, use most of our other fintech products to bring their salaries into our account. They might take a loan, they might gain insurance stating the debit card and so on. So it's an important part of our strategy. With regards to interest rates being a little bit higher expectations than be higher.  Relatively very small factor when compared to the spreads we have. Just to complement that, the fact that our loans are typically short maturity allow us to adjust very rapidly to changing interest environment. So. Our next question comes from Maria Clara with Itau. I wanted to explore the portal of monetization of logistics services ahead even that you showed consistent improvement in the average is delivery and also accelerated penetration for another quarter. So does the company intend to start being more vocal on charging for the procurement services. How far are we from such a scenario. Thank you. Maria Clara, Ariel here. Thanks for your question. I think there's no change in strategy for us. As we've been saying over the last few quarters, we know that there's an opportunity in the long run to increase our monetization on our shipping infrastructure. For now, we remain focused on a capturing the most out of the efficiencies potential that we have, which means continue driving productivity gains and reducing costs; b, I would say, getting sellers to operate with our network, particularly continue improving our fulfillment penetration, which has been going up consistently and three, being disciplined regarding passing through inflation increases. But we know we have another lever for the longer term as we continue monetizing. We just don't think it's the right time. Our next question comes from Marvin Fong with BTIG. Congratulations on 25 years. So a couple of questions. I'd like to get a little more detail on origination side. I believe it was about the same growth rate as last quarter in dollar terms. But just curious if how much Argentina factored into that. So perhaps you can give us some detail by country. Like how originations performed, did accelerate versus last quarter? And then second question, just on Meli delivery days. I believe you gave us some disclosure about how many of your shipments are generated by that channel. Just curious if you could give us an idea, is that all a significant money favor for you guys? Or is it really just designed to kind of lower stress on the network, but it's not particularly saving on cost. And additionally, just maybe some idea of where that percentage can go over time? And Marvin, in terms of origination, most of the acceleration is coming from Brazil, where we are very comfortable with how our models are performing, and we see increased demand for loans. In Argentina, we continue to be cautious we have accelerated versus last quarter. We have grown versus last quarter, but we are at a rate which is significantly low in dollar terms, significantly lower than what it was prior to the elections. And in Mexico, we are growing on a year-on-year basis, but the origination was similar to that of prior quarter. And I would add to that, that we had a devaluation in the middle. So that also affects the growth rates in Argentina when you compare year-on-year basis. But we'll continue to have a very healthy book in Argentina is probably the lowest NPLs at the reasons, but we are cautious, as Osvaldo mentioned. Marvin, Ariel here. Regarding Mali Delivery Day, I think for the first time in our investor presentation, we have provided you with some details on slow shipment share. So you can see that -- more than 5% of our shipments were delivered with a slow method.  Most of which is coming from Meli Delivery Day, which basically means that we saw a good adoption of MDD whenever buyers were using the Melimize offering to get free shipping in low ASP items. To your question on economics, I think we are seeing savings coming from that delivery model as more and more, we can consolidate items in the same box and the same delivery route,  but still, we think that there's ample room for the program to continue scaling and driving costs down even more through more density in routes, more items per box or even incremental transactions that could be delivered in the same delivery as well. So good progress so far. We are excited with the results that we've seen, but the opportunity there is also relevant. Our next question comes from Craig Mauer with FT Partners. Happy anniversary. I wanted to ask about the ad penetration rate that moved up from 1.6% to 1.9%. Was this related to the GMV coming down Argentina? Or was this an actual improvement in adoption? . Ariel here again. So we had a very strong quarter in ad. As you said, penetration went up 30 basis points Q-on-Q and revenues grew 64% in dollars year-over-year, almost 100% in constant currency. I think the increase in penetration is definitely not coming only from Argentina. We saw a consistent increase in penetration across every country and Mexico actually presented the highest growth, both in terms of dollars and in terms of revenues as a percentage of GMV. So overall, excited what happened this quarter and more importantly, convinced that the opportunity we have in front of us remains to be big, and we have many levers to continue capturing that. Can you just remind if there's any seasonality in that number that we should be watching out for? . No, we don't think there's a specific reason on seasonality. We made several product improvements, both  in terms of the algorithms that we use for the bidding processes, we made changes in our placements in our sales results. So many moving parts that did help us get some acceleration there. And our next question comes from Kai Prado with UBS. Good evening. Hello, everyone. Thanks for the opportunity for questions. I have 2 here on my side, please. First, 2 questions on the fintech, okay. First, on the accounting reclassification that you made this quarter, if you could explain the rationale behind this change and why did you decide to do this now? And the second is related to Mexico. If you could please help us understand the strategy behind the Fintech business there, specifically on the banking business. Is your plan is to compete with the fintechs that are growing there or if this should be much more financial for the Marketplace business. Because looking to the financial ether,  see they're not having a make lines to make the business much more difficult than in Brazil, for instance. You need some partners public for investments, lending for us would like to understand. And our view on this and if you are planning any other way to your license there as well. Martin here. In terms of the reporting update, as we explained in the investor letter, what we did is basically, in the past, we had the interest income and cost from the whole operation below EBIT as we -- the Mercado Pago business evolved from being a wallet to being more of a digital banking business, A lot of the business was the float that we had on that particular operation, which we brought above within EBIT right now. So we now recognize the interest that we generated as revenue and the cost that we generate as cost of goods sold. And that's better reflection, better reporting in terms of the nature of our business. And in fact, this is the way we have been managing our business for quite a while. So I think this is an improvement in terms of disclosures  and this is the reason why we did this at this point. Building on Martin's comment, definitely the time value of money has been an integral part of how we price our fintech services. Everything we do from acquiring from when we pay sellers and even more so now with a larger offering in terms of fintech services. So we believe that this reflects better how we look at the business and how this business is really a financial business. With regard to the second question about Mexico and our strategy, our strategy is to be the largest fintech in Mexico. We will offer a full-fledged solution of products from -- acquired on the 1 hand, to fintech services on the other one. There, we for a long time now, we have been able to offer our wallet. And on top of that, we have been doing quite for several years and a for several years. Last year ago, 3 quarters ago, we launched our credit card, which is growing very, very strongly, and we work together with a third party to offer remunerated account, which is basically a money market. But are money is available 24/7 in the Mercado Pago account. So we have a full offering, and we believe there's a huge opportunity that Mexico right now is going through a transformation similar to the 1 -- the market underwent in Brazil in the last 5 or 10 years where our financial inclusion will increase a lot. With access to pay, we increased a lot, and we have a huge opportunity to be the leaders in this market. . Okay. This is clear. Any plans for a potential upgrade in your license in Mexico. Yes. Today, we are working with license that we are able to do what we have to do. We regularly reevaluate whether in the future, we might need license. And if so, once we do anything, we will let you know. Our next question comes from Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna International Group. I wanted to ask a question about Argentina. So it looked like FX-neutral growth in Argentina came in slower than inflation. And I think in your prepared remarks, attributed that to reduced consumer demand. So I'm just trying to gauge that. Is that trend something that you are contemplating to continue? Because in the past, the pattern has been that Argentina revenue would consistently outgrow inflation. So -- is this a new reality that we need to consider? . Martin here. I think we can talk about this quarter in which we saw a recession in Argentina slowdown in consumption, as you clearly mentioned, growth was high in nominal terms but below inflation. And in fact, in dollar terms, was also decreased from last year. As we are monitoring the situation in the country, and we'll deal with the macro situation as it goes through in the year. But as I mentioned earlier, we operate a marketplace that is very resilient to these type of situations. We have seen state of ads in the past not in Argentina, but in other markets and will come out strong. We have a very strong brand, and we'll continue to manage the country as it is on the fintech side of the business. As I mentioned earlier, we are performing extremely well in Argentina, given the market conditions.  On the commerce side, we are outperforming the general retail industry. Let me complement on the fintech side. I'd say we have seen some deceleration in the point-of-sale business. However, the QR code, the wallet continues to grow very strongly and above inflation, and we have been cautious on the credit side. And... And then if I could just follow up, switching gears on the Slide 18, and I apologize if you answered this, but I might have missed it. But the gross margin compression of 3.9% related to the change in shipping conditions, terms and conditions, what was that about? . Yes. I think that's the fact that the margin is decreased because we have higher rates. So what we try to do in that space is try to explain to try to normalize the change that we include to better understand the results of this quarter. So because we had roughly $300 million more revenues that we will have had not made this change, that effectively increases the denominator. So that reduces the margin, and this is what we adjusted there. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn it back to Martin de los Santos, CFO. Thanks, everybody, for joining. As we mentioned, we are very excited about the first quarter of our 25th year, particularly with the results that we saw in Mexico and Brazil, which we saw tremendous growth, both in terms of fintech and commerce with also improving profitability. As we mentioned, the EBIT margin of Brazil and Mexico combined doubled year-on-year  and that's the result of the commerce business doing very well in terms of ads, shipping efficiencies, business that continues to improve profitability. And then the fintech business in Brazil and Mexico is also thriving, growing credit portfolio, growing very nicely and improving profitability as well as acquiring business performing extremely well. And then as we continue to grow, we also gain operational leverage that is going through our P&L. As we mentioned on the bottom line in terms of net income, very strong net income growth year-on-year. So again, very excited about the results and looking forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program.

Thank you for joining us. I am Richard Cathcart, MercadoLibre's Investor Relations Officer. Today, we will share our quarterly highlights on video, after which we will begin our live Q&A session with our CFO, Martin de los Santos, our Fintech President as well as Humans; and our commerce President, Ariel Szarfsztejn.
Before we go on to discuss our results for the second quarter of 2024. I remind you that management make or referred to and this presentation may contain forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. So please refer to the disclaimer on screen, which will also be available in our earnings materials on our Investor Relations website. Tomorrow, August 2, 2024, marks 25 years since we founded MercadoLibre with the mission of democratizing commerce and financial services in Latin America. Over those 25 years, we have built a sustainable company that provides millions of small and medium-sized businesses with the tools they need to compete with larger players. We have enabled the shift to online retail by providing tens of millions of consumers with world-class levels of service. And we have included millions of people into the financial system across the region for the first time. These are notable achievements, but there are also just a baseline from which we think about our even bigger ambitions to deliver on our mission at an even greater scale. We are as optimistic as ever about the opportunity that are ahead of us, and we're excited to pursue them with a culture of entrepreneurship, excellence and innovation that has served us well for the last 25 years. This is, therefore, a great moment to reaffirm our belief that the best is yet to come.
Now I will pass it on to Martin for more information on the second quarter of 2024. Thank you, Marcos. Hello, everyone. I am pleased to highlight MercadoLibre's outstanding performance in the second quarter of 2024, with strong growth across our key business units as well as solid bottom line financial results. In commerce, we saw the highest growth sold items and unique buyers in 2021, with both metrics accelerating sequentially. GMV performed well across geographies particularly in Brazil, for the 36% growth marks the highest level also in 2021. In Mexico, we maintained our momentum with successful hot sale once again. And in Argentina, we saw a positive growth in terms of items sold, reverting the negative growth that we saw during Q1. This growth is a result of our commitment to improving the user experience through innovation and technology and the investments we continue to make in our key strategic initiatives such as fulfillment and minimize.
In FinTech services, we saw strong growth in monthly active users, which surpassed the 50 million mark for the first time. And we also saw solid engagement metrics demonstrating the traction that Mercado Pago has within our users. We continue to see a very positive adoption of our remunerated accounts in all of our major markets, resulting in strong growth of asset under management. Our consumer and merchant grade books continue to scale while delivering strong profitability. During the quarter, we issued 1.6 million new credit cards and the TPV grew by 3x compared to last year. The credit card is a critical component of our fintech value proposition, and we feel confident about scaling this product as a result of the improved accuracy of the underwriting model.
Acquiring TPV grew also very strongly in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. And this was a result of the move-up market strategy that we're implementing that enables us to reach larger merchants and also the continuous investment that we'll make in the online payment segment. Our consolidated financial results for the second quarter reflect the strong performance of our commerce and FinTech operations with revenues of $5.1 billion, growing above 40% year-on-year. We delivered income from operation of $726 million and net income of $531 million, resulting in net income margin of 10.5%, which is the highest in the last 8 years. For more information on our results, please refer to our shareholders' letter.
Now I would pass it on to Richard for more business news. Our logistics network plays a major role in enabling e-commerce in the region and driving more off-line retail online. It has become a key competitive advantage for MercadoLibre. Innovation is a foundation of the success of our logistics network and we are pleased to share some of our most recent innovations today. During the second quarter of 2024 MercadoLibre launched a fulfillment center in Texas in the USA. This is the first fulfillment center outside of Latin America, and it was open to expand the assortment of products we offer to Mexican consumers by plugging U.S. sellers into our ecosystem. This is complementary to our existing cross-border business from China into Mexico.
We are offering a great shipping service for our U.S.-based assortment. Buyers are receiving their packages from the U.S.A. within a couple of days in the North of Mexico we've done approximately 3 days in Mexico City. Shipping is free, and we also offer interest-free installments. In June 2024, we took another major step in our innovation journey with the launch of robotics in our distribution center in Cajamar just outside the city of Sao Paulo. A total of more than 300 robots will have arrive by the end of the year with 100 of those already up and running. These robots will collaborate with the human workforce and will handle tasks such as transporting shelves containing products from storage area. This optimizes processing time by 20%. It also enables us to automate repetitive tasks like product sorting whilst reducing the distance that our workforce has to walk around the distribution center. It also increases total storage capacity by up to 15% per square meter.
These robots operate autonomously, handling up to 20,000 items and 2,500 shelves per day returning to charge stations when their batteries are low. This ongoing investment in technology and innovation reflects our commitment to creating an increasingly efficient logistics network. By building greater flexibility into our logistics operations, we have developed slow shipments, which offer additional shipping options for buyers and efficiencies for MercadoLibre. Slow shipments occur when a buyer chooses a slower shipping option than would be otherwise available to them because it may be more convenient or in some circumstances, it may come with a lower shipping cost. This enables us to take advantage of moments of able capacity in 2 key cost areas of our network.
Firstly, the processing in our fulfillment centers and secondly, the line haul trucks that travel between cities. With slow shipments, the shipping window becomes larger and more flexible for MercadoLibre, which means we can choose the moment of greater idlers to process products in our fulfillment centers and ship them between cities and line hauls to maximize network capacity utilization. MELI Delivery Day is another innovation which has slightly different benefits to slow shipping. The main efficiency built into the MDD model is in the last mile, where several deliveries at a single address on a single drop means that last mile vans can drop more packages at fewer addresses.  This helps us to dilute our last mile costs.
Innovation and efficiency will continue to be key to the success of our shipping operations. For a more detailed discussion, check how the podcast on our Investor Relations website with the Head of Costa. From cross-border in Texas, the robotics in Sao Paulo and MDD across Brazil, Mexico and Chile, we continue to innovate, and we'll continue to do so because, as always, at MercadoLibre the best is yet to come. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Andrew Ruben of Morgan Stanley. So considering where you are the 25-year and congratulations for that. Can you talk about where we are in the interplay between commerce and fintech, it's a quarter we see the acceleration in GMV, also a number of fintech operating metrics picking up. So I'm curious how much you'd say is independent business drivers versus the 2 sides feeding each other. I'd be interested in the strategic update and maybe just honing in on the same topic near term, you have the Brazil GMV accelerating to the 36% ex FX. You also called out the higher remunerated account. We see growth in the credit business. So how much of that pickup would you attribute to these fintech initiatives versus something more commerce specific? Andrew, Martin here. Thanks for your question. Obviously, as we have been saying over the years, being part of an ecosystem is both in the fintech side to commerce and vice versa, right? So I think in this particular quarter, credit a good example to that. Our credit is fueling growth on our commerce side as we provide better payment solutions for users. Also, it's very beneficial to the fintech value proposition like we have or credit cards very strongly this quarter. And in terms of growth in both on commerce side, we are very satisfied with growth that we've seen in Brazil. I mean this is the second consecutive quarter, which we accelerate in Brazil.
We are sustaining very solid growth rates in Mexico, gaining market share in both markets and also seeing a very strong recovery in Argentina both on commerce as well as on fintech side. So I think, for the most part, our strategy continues to perform extremely well, just like you said, 25 years after our -- are beginning our company, we continue to grow at rates of really start-up rates, and we are super excited not only for what we have done so far over the past 25 years, but more importantly, to the many growth opportunities that we have ahead of us. Let me complement that. I think that Andre both businesses, we have always said that both businesses are very synergistic. We continue to believe that, and we have many, many examples of that. One is, for example, in order to grow how we can deploy products on the marketplace both to drive the growth of the marketplace, for example, in Mexico, a significant part of our GMV is paid either with Mercado Pago, with store balance of Mercado Pago or credit offered by us or by our own credit card on the 1 hand.
On the other hand, how we can, for example, offer insurance products in the marketplace and grow the number of policies we sell. Both businesses that have been extremely synergistic. We have a huge user base on the marketplace and also on Mercado Pago and when we drive users from 1 platform to the other one. I think that we are very excited with that, that continues to work very well. The next question comes from the line of Irma Sgarz of Goldman Sachs. Congratulations also on 25th birthday tomorrow. You had a great quarter again in terms of operating leverage. And yet I can think of several items that can still contribute or unleash higher margins from here like scaling ads incrementally lower increases in provisioning, efficiencies in logistics, as you laid out. But before we all get ahead of our skis, are there any perhaps items or headwinds or areas of investment that we should think through especially into the back half of this year, perhaps related to carrier cost adjustments or higher deposit rates in Mexico, any marketing campaigns just to sort of level set expectations here a little bit in terms of what we should keep an eye on. Irma, it's Martin here. Let me talk about this quarter. I think we -- as you mentioned, we had a very strong quarter in terms of both EBIT results, but more importantly, net income, as you know, net income after the devaluation of Argentina has become a more -- probably more relevant metric to look at, and we grew it by 100% year-on-year, and we delivered 10.5% of margin. In terms of the EBIT margin, specifically, you see on a comparable basis, you see a contraction this quarter. Most of that contraction is roughly 120 basis points of contraction. Most of it comes from bad debt provisioning and as you know, as we accelerated our credit book origination, we provisioned expected losses upfront and that generates some pressure on margin, but we feel comfortable with that as we see very good performance in terms of NPLs and NIMAL margins continue to be very solid and with good profitability.
So we are okay with scaling the book by increasing our credit card book as well. We issued more than 1.5 -- 1.6 million cards this quarter. We're in a credit card TPV by 3x compared to last year. So we should come with that kind of pressure on margins. In addition to that, we continue to invest in the strategic initiatives. We increased that penetration of fulfillment by 6 percentage points year-on-year we increased the penetration of shipping -- free shipping also by 6 percentage points. So investments will continue to be, as we have been saying for several quarters at a similar pace, and there will be no change in our investors -- investment strategy. We'll continue to invest in our investment strategic initiatives, minimize free shipping, credit and so on. The next question comes from the line of Robert Ford of Bank of America. Sorry about that. Happy birthday and congratulations on the quarter. I just had a few questions. And the first was, could you talk a little bit about Meli Más and MDD and how that's contributing to conversion and the acceleration you're seeing in GMV as well as the seller promotional tools that you call out today and particularly the ones that are resonating with consumers. And then how do you expect the end of tax withholding requirements for small businesses on their digital transactions to impact Pago in the marketplace in Argentina? And what's the timing for that?
And then the third one I had was we understand you've taken over 100,000 square meters of distribution space and areas. And we were curious as to the role that you envision for that space, particularly when it comes to centralizing inventory for Brazilian air cargo or processing cross-border transactions into Brazil. And where do you open up capacity in the rest of the network with the addition of that space and what is it at all? And then how should we think about the implications of a Mexican banking license in terms of product enablers, funding and then the various frictions, whether they be regulatory tax or something else?
And then lastly, and I apologize for all this. In the press release, you mentioned some downstream benefits of your more aggressive remuneration strategies and AUM strategies. And I was wondering if you could expand on those, please and that was it. Bob, Ariel here. So I think on Meli Más, we are going through the same trajectory that we've been seeing over the last few quarters. Meli Más is successfully generating incremental engagement and incremental GMV. So users who enroll in the program have higher frequency, higher GMV lower churn compared to the previous program engagement KPIs are looking good. And to your point on MELI Delivery Day, we see adoption of MDD trending upwards. So general terms, we are extremely satisfied with the impact that the program is having in our business and particularly in the satisfaction of our users and we pretend to continue increasing the user base of sub scripter. And Ariel in terms of the MDD adoption coinciding with more packages per week or yet at a time? Yes. So in every single market, we see consumers choosing to get data packages from -- with MDD trending upwards. And within MDD we see consolidation also going up. In terms of capacity and distribution centers, I think you mentioned a couple of things that are different. So we did move our air cart in Sao Paulo. We just needed more space to deal with the volume that we are applying. But more on a general view, I think, as Martin was mentioning in the previous answer, we will continue building the capacity, linked the growth of our business and the increase in penetration of fulfillment, and that is true for every single market.
This quarter or these few quarters, in particular, we have been expanding capacity in Mexico. At some point, we will continue expanding capacity in Brazil and the rest of the market as well, nothing changing or directionally radical with the way we've been operating so far. But in the end, we are compounding the growth of MercadoLibre as a whole with the increase in fulfillment penetration. I will let Osvaldo complement. Sorry, I was just going to ask you that facility is domestically oriented. Is that fair? Yes, we are not doing any international flights from Brazil to other countries, nor from any country of Latin America into another one. The only international connection that we do is from Texas into Mexico, which is not going through air. Bob, let me cover the 2 questions related to FinTech. One of them was how do we expect the end of tax footholding requirements in Argentina to impact Mercado Pago, and we are very excited about that. Today, electronic payments in Argentina had a drawback versus cash payments because were perceptions and taxes we need to rehold on behalf of the local IRS from every seller. So that was a detractor for further adoption of electronic payments in general and the lot of past Congress recently removed that at a federal level, not at a state level, but at a federal level. This, however, has not yet been implemented by the local IRS. So we need that to happen and then we will make the implementation.
But that really will be a positive on all kinds of electronic payment. If I recall correctly, the second question was regarding implications of the Mexican banking license and I would say that, that is something that we believe there's a huge opportunity in Mexico to compete and further deploy financial services and that by having a banking license, we will be able to add products to -- a stack of products. And for example, let people be able to collect salary season than the Mercado Pago accounituxin. And so we believe that the opportunity we see in the country is huge. We have been already growing our credit book very significantly. This will be a process that will be long, typically around 2 years, but it depends on the regulator. But we believe that we will continue growing our footprint in Mexico throughout that period. For example, recently, we increased the rate we have paying to the depositors in [indiscernible], and we are very excited with the results we are seeing. And that's what triggered my question with respect to the benefits of -- the downstream benefits of those AUM strategies. Could you expand a little bit on that further. Yes. The reason for [indiscernible] it really drives principality. We see that the 2 main drivers of principalities where people put their savings first. And together with that, where they get most of the credit. So we are driving those 2 up significantly. By having a very competitive [indiscernible] and also be aggressive deploying our credit card strategy in Mexico. So these are not just opportunistic depositors taking advantage of the 15% rate. You're seeing some real adoption of the rest of the ecosystem. Yes. Yes, Bob, we'll probably go to the next question and we can go into more detail on this on. But yes, the short answer is yes, it contributes to that. The next question comes from the line of Marcelo Santos of JPMorgan. I have 2 on my side. The first is, given that you launched your distribution center in Texas, could you please comment a bit on your broader ambition on cross-border, how relevant this could be, where this like -- where do you think this could be in a couple of years? And the second question is regarding the net shipping. So dividing -- getting their shipping revenue, minus shipping cost divided by GMV, we see that it improved a lot on a quarter-over-quarter basis. If you could please dissect the drivers that led to the sequential improvement for 1 quarter to other. And if you see further room for more efficiency there. Marcelo, this is Ariel. So let me start with your first question related to cross-border. I think we've always said that cross-border is still a huge opportunity for MercadoLibre in general. Today, almost 15% of the GMV that we have in Mexico is coming from cross-border, mostly Chinese. But I would say that in the rest of Latin America, our cross-border business is still small, and we think we have an opportunity to generate some value there. Specifically about Texas, our introductory video was mentioning, we think that we can complement the selection that we have in Mexico from local Mexican sellers with inventory coming from North American sellers.
And that is particularly relevant considering that there are certain thesis of that selection that we cannot get locally in Mexico or we cannot find at the right price. So in the end, our North American strategy is to complement the offering that we have in Mexico and be able to serve our consumers better. And eventually thinking about the strategic impact, we think this can be relevant. We think this could be multi-country in the future, but it's too early to tell. But signs of that operation are really, really positive. We see consumers getting extremely engaged with the products that we are offering, and we see our sellers from the U.S., also very satisfied with the sell-out that they have in the inventory that they are bringing to our warehouse.
Going to the second part of your question about shipping margins and cost. I would say that we are pleased with the results that we are seeing from our logistics operation. So in terms of discipline with which we are managing the operation itself, but also with our ability to manage the -- our P&L while continuing to invest behind our strategic priorities. This quarter, as you were saying, we saw an expansion in shipping margin. That expansion is mostly coming from our ability to drive efficiencies in our operations, and that happened even with some headwinds coming from Mexico where we are operating at max capacity and where we have an extremely strong hot sale season.
I would say, broadly speaking, we continue committed to running shipping with a very disciplined P&L. And you can see that clearly when you look back into a longer-term picture, right? So if you go back to 2019, you can see that our net shipping costs remained broadly flat or even improving, if you were to add our flat fee revenues into that one. And in that same period, we moved fulfillment penetration from 6% into 50%. We moved preshipping up 30 percentage points. We increased our square meters by 5x, all this across the region. So again, shipping is a key driver and a key strategic priority for MercadoLibre, and we are committed to executing what we need while managing costs and revenues with strong discipline. The next question comes from the line of Maria Clara Infantozzi from Itaú. It's about your view on the implementation of GenAI in the ad business. So this has been a key topic of discussion in the earnings calls of some these -- during this test base. And can you please share your thoughts on the topic is now in the front and which opportunities of improvement in business do you foresee with the implementation of GenAI. And if I may add, can you please comment on how the AI business has been affecting your recommendation in time? . Maria Clara, this is Martin. I mean as you use -- can you mute the line on the other side please, we are hearing some noise. Thank you. Yes, as you mentioned, we have been -- put a lot of resources into AI and GenAI throughout the company, really. We don't have a centralized department of AI, but all of our different business units. And clearly, the IT team have been focusing on trying to find opportunities to improve our efficiency and deploy AI solutions, both in the way we manage the business as well consumer-facing. And some examples of that are on the commerce side, obviously, we are using AI to help us with recommendations, as you mentioned, but more important than that on reviews, for instance, that in the past, you have to -- if you were to review a product, you have to go through many different views, now we can consolidate that into a more efficient way of communicating the qualities, the prospects of a particular product pictures, as you know, our pictures that publish might not be the quality that we are expecting from our merchants, and we can improve those with answers from sellers is another good example in the past, if you were to buy something at 2 AM in the morning, you'll have to wait until the next day to get an answer that obviously affected significantly the conversion of the product.
Now we can respond right away with using GenAI models. On the -- obviously, on the developer side, we have 16,000 developers, which are also using AI tools to improve productivity and that also generating some improvements and efficiencies in the way we deploy products throughout the company. And I think 1 of the most important projects that we have is on CX, customer experience and customer support by which we are also applying AI tools that will help us to not only respond more efficiently in terms of cost, but also be more accurate in terms of the way we manage those  issues. These are some examples, but there are many others. Osvaldo maybe also you can complement. Yes. The only thing I was going to add, you asked about search and where you're seeing technical and bedding to power search that technical -- turn search into something more semantic. So it's easier to try to send the users to what they're looking for. The next question comes from the line of Kaio Da Prato of UBS. So 2 quick on my side, please. With all these good trends that we are seeing in the fintech business, I was wondering if you can share some idea about the profitability of the fintech business in your 3 main countries, Brazil, Mexican Argentina? And what levels do you think you can achieve in each of them? Just an idea of how it has been evolving over time? Would it be really helpful here. And additionally, you are mentioning that you would like to become the #1 digital bank in Mexico. What do you think are your competitive advantages against the digital players in Mexico today as since that now you are with similar offerings compared to most of them nowadays. We don't share a lot of details regarding specific profitability in each of the 3 countries. Let me share with you that we are extremely, we are profitable in all 3 countries, in the 3 largest markets in Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. In the case of Brazil and Mexico is driven mostly on the fintech services side, driven mostly by our credit book and acquiring is profitable in all 3 markets. In the case of Argentina, the importance of credit is less relevant than in the other markets, but we have such a strong position as a wallet leveraging the payments every day users make that makes up for a lower credit volume at this point. And we are very profitable in all 3 markets.
So the second question was that we have claimed that we are applying for license and that will be -- we want to be the #1 digital bank in Mexico. We believe we have several competitive advantages. First of all, we already have a large user base given the importance of, on the 1 hand, the marketplace. And on the other hand, our Acquiring business, which is very developed in Mexico. And furthermore, we have been doing aggressively. First, initially, our consumer credit book there for several years, but also recently, our credit card, and we are very excited with the kind of growth we are seeing. And we believe that this synergy we have between the marketplace acquiring business and the Fintech services businesses is something that nobody else has. So we believe we have a very strong position in Mexico. The next question comes from the line of João Soares of Citi. Congratulations on the results. Two quick ones on my side. The first one, is I wanted to dig a little bit deeper into the GMV performance in Brazil. We usually have a big pricing which is going to be more challenging. And actually, you had right, of these [indiscernible]. And not only do we see an acceleration, we saw volumes driving acceleration. So I just wanted to understand. I realize there's no single bullet here at Super Bowl, but what you attribute this to? How much attribute this to -- I mean, I just want to go at some point what are the main points that we would attribute this acceleration to it would be interesting to hear. And we also saw a good development of the ad penetration right now at 2%, right? So I just wanted to hear your thoughts on the broader retail media adoption. How much of this comes from the view involving your own capabilities? And also, any thoughts on the profitability on this business will also be interesting to hear. João, this is Ariel. So thank you for your question on still I think it's a good thing. The fact that I am getting kind of the similar question on why we grew so much in Brazil quarter, but we must be doing some positive on that one. So the answer to your question is that there is no silver bullet the performance. So it's not something specific that I can attribute that growth too. I would say several strategies and actions were executed across the business from improvements in selection, expanding our 3P selection complemented with more 1P, which is helping us strengthen MercadoLibre's position as they go to place to buy in Brazil, improvement in pricing, we are getting more and more obsessed with our price competitiveness.
We continue also improving our shipping offering with faster deliveries, slower deliveries, more fulfillment, more free shipping. As we said in the past, we are putting a lot of effort in the averaging Brazil into regions, into categories, into different type of users as to find the right solution to push for growth in each of those segments, product and experience continues to be a key priority for us. We continue to deploy innovation in beauty, we deploy virtual trials we are expanding our compatibilities in out-of-park trading in consumer electronic presales. I mean we continue to improve our experience more and more.
I think we also developed over time a good muscle to quickly identify and adjust our promotional calendars and marketing efforts as to capitalize the opportunities that appear in the market at every single point of time, and that's also helpful. And last but not least, as Osvaldo was saying before with the first question, our payments ecosystem. So Blue Money including Buy Now Pay Later, credit card, account money continues to gain share in our checkout, and that's definitely helping us increase conversion. So in summary, I would say that what you see today is probably the compounded effect of 25 years investing fully focused in Latin America.
So the second part of your question related to advertising. So I would say, again, another good quarter or a great quarter for us. Our penetration reached percent of GMV which is 40 basis points improvement year-over-year. The revenues grew 51% year-over-year in dollar terms, that's the eighth consecutive quarter with a growth rate above 30% particularly, we saw a great performance coming from cross-border sellers from 1P brands and that product continues to represent the majority of the business. I would also add to the ad thing, that a big milestone for us. The next question comes from the line of Jamie Friedman of Susquehanna International Group. Congratulations on the 25th. I just wanted to briefly get your summary message about credit quality because I realize there's a lot of different inputs here. But the NIMAL did deteriorate on a year-over-year basis, about 500 basis points, though admittedly, it was roughly flat sequentially. The provision -- that's Page 10. And then on Page 19, the bad debt provision, which I realize is also a function of growth math but that also increased about 300 basis points sequentially. So I know there's a lot of detail, but if you could just give us like the overall message about how you're thinking about credit quality, that would be helpful. . Sorry, we just got -- we dropped, our line got dropped, if you can give us or bear with me for a second please. We are trying to dial-in once again. Okay. If you could please, Ariel if you listen to the last part of the answer from us, but we can move on to the next question, if needed, we can go in more detail on that. Please go ahead, please. So I was just asking -- this is Jamie Friedman at Susquehanna. I was just asking for the 1 liner on credit quality. On Page 10, the NIMAL, though they were roughly flat sequentially. They did deteriorate about 500 basis points year-over-year. On Page 19, a 300 basis point increase in the bad debt provision. I realized that as growth math. But I noticed a lot of detail, but if you could just share us the 1 liners how you're thinking about credit quality, that would be helpful. Absolutely. NIMAL was slightly down, but that compression was, I would say, fully explained by the growth of the credit card portfolio as percentage of the total portfolio. So it's mostly a change of mix. The credit card factory has a lower NIMAL because we will provision upfront but only a small portion of the portfolio generates revenue initially. Having said that, we are very excited with the evolution of all of our credit portfolios we are seeing very good results in the earlier cohorts of the credit cards. We continue to see that the improvement in our scoring malls and shortening of the payback period for each cohort, that's why we have been growing the credit card portfolio. And beyond that, also the credit card is obviously strategically very, very, very important. .
And then when -- the second part of the question is regarding, if I understood correctly regarding the NPL evolution. Again, we are comfortable with the results we are seeing are the spreads we have are very, very healthy. And I think overall, we are comfortable with the credit portfolio. Yes. And going back to NIMAL just to complement, we don't disclose specific NIMAL portfolio for countries, but as Osvaldo mentioned, this is a mixed issue. If you were to look at individual product portfolios, NIMAL are stable or improving year-on-year. So that's why we feel comfortable accelerating growth. Our credit book reached $4.9 billion, growing 51% year-on-year on the back of very strong profitability results. The next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous. There's clearly lots of growth, lots of acceleration, lots of positives in the numbers. Can you tell us what has been the biggest positive surprise for you over the last year. If you wound back to 12 months ago, you could see the numbers that you've just printed, which part of the business is it, which has exceeded your expectations. Geoffrey, I think if you look at the results over the past year, we are super excited about all parts of our business. I mean on commerce side, as Ari mentioned, we are growing Brazil 36% on the back of -- 30% last quarter and sustained growth in Mexico. This is the third consecutive quarter by which grew 30% year-on-year. So gaining market share in both markets, also very positively surprised about the turnaround of Argentina. We had a tough quarter, last quarter in Q1, and we regained growth once again on the commerce side of Argentina. Our fulfillment infrastructure continues to be deployed and great gain in penetration, which results in much better user experience.
A number of users have been growing a number of buyers as well as monthly active users on the fintech side of the business. Then on the fintech side, we have tremendous opportunity ahead of us in Mexico. Assets under management are performing very well throughout the region. Our credit books as like Osvaldo mentioned earlier, performing very well, and we accelerated growth in the past 2 quarters. So very excited about all of our businesses and in particular, also the new businesses that are growing, Mercado Play, which is starting relatively new, showing some positive signs. So far, Meli Más, which we launched a year ago, performing very well. So we are very excited about both the commerce as well as the FinTech side of the business. Okay. It sounds like the answer to that is everything. I'm tempted to ask you to pick one, but I won't just to follow up, the new customers, the monthly active user group, who are those people? Are they people who have not used ecom before? Or are they coming from competitors, where are the new users coming from? Just to be fair with you, it's true that the answer was broad because we're really excited about the performance of the business. I think if I had to highlight 1 is probably the surprise of continuing to gain market share in Brazil for several quarters. For more than a year now, every quarter, we continue to grow at a faster rate than the market at a very large scale. So that's obviously something that we are very proud and very positively surprised. If I were to pinpoint something on the fintech side, I'll say that several quarters ago, we restructured how our team is organized with a strong focus on fintech services and since then, we have seen very strong growth, both in Brazil and Mexico, not only in number of users, but in the frequency, the use of products how, for example, [indiscernible] has grown and credit cards have grown. So I'd say the increased focus we put on fintech services clearly is paying off, and that is really according to the expectations we have. . The next question comes from the line of Craig Mauer of FT Partners. Again, congratulations on your 25th. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But I wanted to ask you a follow-up to Geoff's question on market share, if you could characterize for us where you think market share is for MercadoLibre and in each of the main markets? And how that's progressed year-on-year, that would be helpful. Yes. As you know, market shares are a lot of information -- public information that it's not that accurate. I mean the reason why we believe we are gaining market share is because we are growing at a very rapid pace most likely for sure, above market. But in terms of specific market share numbers, those are numbers that we don't share, but it's public information. I'm sure you can get. What we can say is that at a growth rate of 36% year-on-year in Brazil and 30% in Mexico, we are gaining share for sure. The final question comes from the line of Marvin Fong of BTIG. Congratulations as well on the anniversary as well as the strong quarter. I would just like to turn to the topic of the Brazil macro environment in terms of -- it looks like inflation is kind of ticking up and the Central Bank is pausing. So just with respect to your fintech business, 2 parts on this. Does it factor at all or how does that trajectory factor at all into your willingness to lean into acquiring more -- expanding more credit and acquiring more borrowers in that country? And then secondly, how might it affect your spreads. I think in the second quarter, you had some positive gross margin impact from credit spreads and credit funding. Just any thoughts on how you might pass or not pass on interest rate funding cost to your customers? Marvin, so mostly the decision of how to expand our credit books, our credit offerings is principally related to how we are seeing payments evolving, how we see the malls evolving and as long as we continue to see that our malls are working well and NPLs are coming down. We will continue being aggressive with expansion of credit. Our trades typically are very short, and therefore, we are very flexible to adjust to any change in interest rate policy that may come. And with regards to credit spreads and funding, I would say that today, we have spreads that are very healthy. We are in the -- we're always looking for ways to continue growing the book we have.
And in some cases, that will imply working with very positive spreads, but smaller than the 1 we have now because there's an opportunity to continue further expanding upmarket where in order to reach those customers would need to be even more competitive with vis-a-vis traditional banks. And just to complement on macro. I mean we've been operating in Latin America for 25 years, and we've seen many different macro situations, and we believe that in our industry, both on commerce and fintech a lot more important, stronger the secular trend of people moving online, both to commerce online as well as to bring their finances, digitalize their finances. So we are a lot more focused on continuing to improve our products, continue to offer faster shipping, better assortment on the commerce side, business credit book, as Osvaldo mentioned, and macro should not affect our performance or growth in the future, at least what we're seeing so far in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn it back over to Martin de los Santos for closing remarks. Well, thank you, everybody, for joining. Once again, very excited about the results of the quarter, but more importantly, about the future of MercadoLibre, celebrating our 25th year tomorrow. But we're looking ahead, we see -- we continue to see as many as big opportunities as we saw 25 years ago. So again, looking forward to the second half of the year and to reporting to you in 3 months. Thanks again. Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.","MercadoLibre's earnings conference call for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 . today, we will share our quarterly highlights on video . we will begin our live Q&A session with our CFO, Martin de los Santos and our commerce president, Ariel Szarfsztejn .",1.0
