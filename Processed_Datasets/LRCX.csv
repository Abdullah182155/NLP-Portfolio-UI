At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Satya Kumar, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Yes, thank you and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the Lam Research Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Martin Anstice, Chief Executive Officer; and Doug Bettinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
During today's call, we will share our outlook on the business environment; review our financial results for the December 2017 quarter, and our outlook for the March 2018 quarter. The press release detailing our financial results was distributed a little after 1:00 P.M. Pacific Time this afternoon. It can also be found on the Investor Relations section of the company's website along with the presentation slides that accompany today's call.
Today's presentation and Q&A includes forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the Risk Factor disclosures of our SEC public filings. Please see accompanying slide in the presentation for additional information.
Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation between the GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release.
This call is scheduled to last until 3:00 P.M. Pacific Time. And as always, we ask that you limit your questions to one per firm with a brief follow-up, so that we can accommodate as many questions as possible. As a reminder, the replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website.
With that, let me hand the call over to Martin. Thank you, Satya, and thank you everyone for joining us today. I will now provide an overview of December quarter results, summarize calendar 2017 relative to the multiyear outperformance opportunity for Lam, and provide a first outlook for 2018. As previously noted, we plan a comprehensive Investor Analyst events in a few weeks and so our prepared comments today are crafted in that context.
The December quarter was a strong conclusion to an extraordinary year with record performance for Lam reported in shipments, revenues, and non-GAAP EPS. As noted in our earnings release, that positive momentum is expected to continue into calendar 2018 with our March quarter guidance indicating mid-point shipments at $3.175 billion and revenues at $2.85 billion, both levels of strategic relevance and levels of business not previously seen in our history. While scaling the company at essentially a 50% pace in calendar 2017 was not our expectation one year ago, competitive business model flexibility and a commitment from our employees to the success of our customers was everything about how we responded to the incremental opportunities presented.
Without the tremendous effort of the team, and the supports of our customers and partners globally, these accomplishments would not be possible. It is my privilege to acknowledge this great work and express my personal gratitude. At the same time, it's important to reinforce the prominence of our culture and values and specifically our focus on increasing customer trust and codependency through the delivery of enabling technology, productivity, and speed now and in the years ahead.
As an established multi-product and services company delivering results on wafer to the semiconductor industry through complex systems engineering innovation, our primary objective is to promote our customer success through an increased proportion of their spending that we actively compete for and through differentiation to win and sustain more of that business over time.
In 2017, our reported shipments were approximately 21% of WFE versus 18.5% in the prior year and that compares with 14.2% in the first full-year after the Lam Novellus merger in 2013.
Reflecting on 2017, Lam delivered a remarkable sixth consecutive calendar year of growth and industry outperformance, a by-product of high quality strategies and execution jointly with our customers. Over that period, Lam has grown shipments by a cumulative annual growth rate of 24% approximately three times the rate of WFE growth.
In 2017, through a commitment to invest more in our future and to sustain the economic success for our customers and suppliers in partnership with Lam, we grew our shipments by approximately 50% well above WFE growth of 30% and reported record non-GAAP earnings per share of over $13 almost double the prior year.
With fundamental industry trends that we believe provides a platform for sustainable semiconductor ecosystem investments and growth, we remain focused on making the necessary investments in our company to increase the probability of achieving our long-term vision and we plan for another expansion in the proportion of WFE that we actively compete for and win in 2018, said differently, we plan for continued outperformance.
2017 recorded more than two percentage points of shipments based share gains across the equipment segments that we serve. Our market share performance was broad-based with strengths coming from areas that are most critical to the success of our customers with a focus on technology enablements across the full suites of industry inflections anticipated as relevant for our customers for the next five to 10 years.
We had very strong momentum in atomic layer deposition products which has been a focus area for new product introductions for several years. We more than tripled our shipments of ALD products in 2017. We had record shipments in dielectric etch with more than a tripling of the installed base to over 1,000 process modules for our Flex G Series products which address the most challenging aspects of 3D NAND scaling. We had a record year for conductor etch with application wins across foundry and NAND markets.
We strengthened our position in tungsten CVD and ALD as well as electrical deposition. We had a strong year for clean products with a 50% growth in our EOS clean product installed base.
As you know, broadening our customer base has been a key part of our strategy in the last decade and we are pleased to see it deliver results, with record shipments in logic for the year. Strength here was driven both by ramp of etch application wins at leading edge Logic as well as trailing edge Logic shipments to a broad set of customers for IoT applications. There should be no question about the fundamental relevance of the Lam product portfolio in etch and deposition to the device architecture and manufacturing processes planned by our customers broadly now and in the long-term.
We have much more comprehensive engagements across all device segments than ever before creating a platform of learning and optionality that enhances our competitive differentiation and the quality of our earnings. Increased strategic relevance to our customer success creates expectations and also significant opportunity for the company not least relative to the performance of more than 50,000 Lam processed chambers in the global semiconductor installed base today.
Our Customer Service Business Group grew profitable revenues in 2017 faster than the pace of our installed base growth. More importantly, they took us to the over the delivery of a portfolio of productivity solutions that we believe created more value for the customer and enhanced competitiveness of Lam than in any prior year.
Over the last decade, Lam has transitioned from an edge company highly levered to memory customers to a multi-product and services company with broader customer exposure across all device segments. That transition speaks to the quality of technology leadership. It speaks to cycles of learning and also business momentum.
As device performance is increasingly driven by adoption of new structures and new materials, as the traditional scaling solutions are limited by physics or economics in high volume manufacturing, enhancing our edge clean and deposition portfolio with disruptive and value creating technology is a strong focus. Illustratively, shipments for new memory solutions which have extremely demanding requirements more than tripled for Lam in 2017.
Our strategy for differentiation extends well beyond technology enablement for unit process and co-optimized or integrated products. Our fundamentally collaborative culture and values create an unmatched potential as a participants in the semiconductor ecosystem we are committed to harness the holistic value of Lam for the benefit of all stakeholders.
Now turning to the overall equipment spending trends of 2017 and our expectations for 2018. We believe that WFE investments in 2017 ended at a little over $47 billion which was up approximately 30% from the prior year. Slightly more than half of the investments made in 2017 were for memory and were weighted primarily towards NAND flash. Semiconductors are fundamental to enabling the generation, transmission, storage, and analysis of increasing quantities of data which has the potential to transform every segments of the global economy.
We remain optimistic about the potential for continued global economic stability and growth. We anticipate healthy demand for semiconductors across the full spectrum of consumer and enterprise markets.
We expect year-over-year growth in overall WFE in 2018 in the low-double-digit percentages led by DRAM and logic investments and supported by the fundamental demand drivers for silicon and the confidence we have in the continued motivation for investment discipline by all key market participants. We still anticipate that approximately 85% of the year-over-year spending growth is memory based.
Preliminarily, we plan for double-digit growth in overall memory WFE in 2018 with a greater balance between DRAM and NAND spending that was true in calendar 2017. Sustained to slightly increased investments in NAND overall is the year-over-year headline for 2018. More of the incremental growth is from DRAM where supply and demand balance tightened last year. Importantly, in DRAM, technology trends are resulting in meaningfully higher levels of investments required to drive similar levels of bit supply growth compared to historical levels.
We do expect a modest market demand led expansion of the wafer starts per month installed base in DRAM particularly supporting data center, content expansion, and we are aligned to the consensus view on bit growth in both markets.
On the demand side, NAND continues to be increasingly qualified into the data center and density not units increases; continue to be the important driver for clients mobile and PC devices.
We continue to see Lam's addressable markets, net of customer yields and productivity in NANDs growing faster than NANDs WFE as customers' transition from 64 layers to 96 layer investments starting late in 2018 and into 2019.
We expect growth in non-memory CapEx led primarily by Logic investments in both leading edge 10-nanometer as well as trailing edge 28-nanometer and above investments offset by flat to slightly lower investments in leading edge foundry from reuse among other strategies.
As I headlined, 2018 looks to be a very solid year of demand led equipment investments by our customers within the exciting context of increased prominence of silicon as a foundation of global innovation and presence enhanced opportunity for Lam.
Now I would like to touch briefly on the topic of capital allocation in light of the passage of recent U.S. tax reform legislation. Doug, will address more details later, but at a high level, the guiding principles for capital allocation at Lam remain unchanged.
First and foremost, invest in the long-term profitable growth of Lam, deliver increased optionality to create value from the strengths of Lam with accretive investments in our core and non-core markets, then return excess cash to our shareholders through strategies that include sustaining and growing dividends over time and excess capital redistribution to shareholders as appropriate.
We are obviously inspired by our opportunity and proud of our operational execution to-date.
On this last subject of tax, it is worth emphasizing that we implemented a comprehensive global strategy in 2003, as such, we have compelling value created from this recent legislative action. Illustratively, strategic optionality is accelerated with cash available to U.S. operations increasing from $1 billion to $5 billion. In the hypothetical events of 100% U.S. repatriation, we saved $1 billion of cash from the tax rates previously applicable.
85% of our gross cash balances are now available for repatriation and that represents $25 per share or 12% of the Lam share price currently. How much and when we repatriate and plans for capital allocation are framed by a broad set of strategic choices, which we will discuss in our upcoming Investor and Analyst Meeting.
Unrelated, you will have seen another announcement today about Lam leadership, specifically the promotion of Tim Archer, our Chief Operating Officer to the position of President and Chief Operating Officer. This promotion is recognition of Tim's contributions so far on the journey of Lam and it is a commentary on the partnership that we continue to share.
Except for some tweaks in emphasis, our fundamental responsibilities will remain unchanged, our commitment and passion for seeing Lam realize its full potential only strengthens. The full complement of global leaders at Lam have made possible our vision. Tim and I both look forward to the challenges and opportunities in the years ahead.
In conclusion, we're optimistic about our opportunity, our strategies, and the potential for continued outperformance for Lam. We look forward to sharing more aspects of our vision with you in March.
With that, let me turn the call over to Doug. Okay, great. Thank you, Martin. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today.
We ended calendar year 2017 with strong performance exceeding the midpoint of our guidance for the December quarter on all of our financial metrics. In addition to the milestones that Martin mentioned during his scripted remarks, during calendar year 2017, we generated over $2 billion in cash from operations, that was an increase of 37% compared to calendar year 2016, and we returned $2.193 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases as well as dividends.
We're very pleased with what we've achieved this quarter as well as this calendar year. Shipments continued at a healthy level in the December quarter totaling $2,000,632 which was a little above the midpoint of our guidance. Memory shipments increased in the quarter with the combined memory segment representing 77% of total system shipments and that compares with 66% in the previous quarter.
Customers continue to ramp NAND and other non-volatile memory technologies which made up 53% of the system shipments. This was up from the 49% level that we saw in the September quarter.
The NAND investments were directed towards meeting increased bit demand through a combination of capacity additions, 2D to 3D conversions, as well as 3D installed base layer count growth.
DRAM shipments made up 24% of the system shipments and this was up from 17% in prior quarter. This was the highest dollar value of DRAM system shipments since the March 2015 quarter. Strong DRAM pricing supports these investments which continue to be largely directed towards 1X Nanometer convergence.
December quarter foundry shipments were 15% of system shipments, down from 21% in the prior quarter. Foundry spending was primarily directed towards 7-nanometer pilot capability as well as 10-nanometer volume production projects.
And finally, the logic and other segment accounted for 8% of system shipments that was down compared with 13% in the last quarter.
Revenues for the quarter came in at $2.581 billion above the midpoint of guidance and up 4% from the previous record high level that we saw in the September quarter.
Gross margin came in at 47.6%. As I always mentioned you should expect to see some quarter-to-quarter variability in gross margins due to multiple factors such as product mix, customer concentration, and overall business volumes.
Operating expenses in December quarter increased to $449 million coming in at 17.4% of revenue that compares with 17.7% in September. Approximately 63% of the OpEx spend in the quarter was allocated to R&D which was around the same ratio as we've held for the calendar year.
While we continue to see opportunities to further leverage OpEx, we will continue to increase our funding of strategic R&D programs to maintain our technology as well as productivity leadership. These investments are critical to meeting our commitments to customers and to our objective of growing the company at a faster pace than the industry.
The growth and the size of our served available markets and the market share gains that Martin mentioned are the result of investments we've made and work that we've done over the course of the last several years.
Operating income in the December quarter was $779 million, which was up from $733 million in the prior quarter. Operating margin came in at 30.2%, up compared to 29.6% in the September quarter and again a little above the midpoint of the guided range.
Our tax rate for the quarter was approximately negative 1% down compared to 14% last quarter. The primary reason for the reduction in the non-GAAP tax rate is a reduced statutory U.S. rate combined with a delayed implementation of U.S. tax and foreign earnings. This is attributed to the application of the recently enacted tax changes for a non-calendar year filing. The new tax law applies to tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, which for Lam will be in the second half of 2018 onwards.
Excluded from the non-GAAP tax rate is a one-time charge of $757 million. This is primarily made up of tax on accumulated foreign earnings to be repatriated.
The cash tax payments will be made over the next eight years. The tax rate in the mid-single-digits for the first half of 2018 and mid-teens in the second half of 2018 would be reasonable for you to include in your models.
Based on a share count of about 182 million shares, earnings per share for the December quarter totaled $4.34 above the high-end of our guided range. The biggest contributor to the earnings per share being above the range was the favorable impact on the tax rate.
Without the impact of the tax rate change, we would have been approximately $0.10 above the midpoint of guidance. The share count includes approximately 18 million shares of dilutive impact on a non-GAAP basis from the 2018 and 2041 convertible notes.
And I just mentioned with the increase in our stock price, we've continued to receive requests for early conversions of both the 2018 and 2041 convertible notes. Conversions that settled in December quarter totaled $44 million of which $32 million related to the 2018 convert and $12 million to the 2041 bond. To-date, we've also received requests for conversions totaling $175 million that will settle in the March quarter.
And I will remind you dilution schedules for the updated notional amounts in the 2018 and 2041 convertible notes are available on our Investor Relations website to help you with your modeling.
We continue to execute on our capital return program. As you may recall, we announced in November, a new $2 billion buyback authorization. In the December quarter, we spent approximately $1.1 billion on share repurchases largely through an accelerated share repurchase program. And we paid out $73 million in dividends to our shareholders. Consistent with our prior comments we're committed to growing the dividend over time and in November we also announced an 11% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share which was payable earlier this month.
Now we move to the balance sheet. During December quarter we initiated a $1.25 billion commercial paper program and as of the end of the December quarter we had $800 million outstanding. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments including restricted cash of about $6 billion. Approximately $5 billion of the $6 billion was domiciled outside of the United States. This is the amount that comes more flexibly available with tax reform.
Cash from operations was $29 million, down from $858 million in the September quarter. The low cash generation during the quarter was a result of the timing of certain receivables as well as a growth in inventory to support the strong shipments we see in the March quarter. And I would just mention we collected approximately $700 million at the end of December which was after our fiscal quarter had closed.
Day sales outstanding increased to 80 days versus 56 last quarter. Inventory turns came in at 3.6 compared to 4 in the prior quarter and I just mentioned I expect the March quarter will be a very strong cash generating quarter.
Deferred revenue at the end of a quarter were $1.114 billion which was up from $938 million last quarter. This number excludes $289 million in shipments to customers in Japan which will revenue in future quarters. And I just remind you that these Japan shipments remain as inventory carrying cost on the balance sheet.
I should mention that we will be adopting the new revenue recognition standard ASC 606 starting in the second half of calendar year 2018 to coincide with the start of our fiscal year 2019. I have more to tell you about this as we get closer to the second half of the year.
Company non-cash expenses during the quarter include the following: $42 million for equity compensation, $41 million for amortization, and $39 million for depreciation.
Capital expenditures were $85 million which was up from $60 million in the September quarter. This growth was driven by factory and lab expansions as well as lab tool investments.
CapEx for the year came in at $224 million. We do expect to see a further increase in CapEx in calendar year 2018, as we continue to expand our manufacturing network and support growth in strategic R&D programs.
We ended the quarter with approximately 10,200 regular full time employees. Majority the headcount was added in the factory and field to support the growth of our business. As Martin mentioned in his remarks, company is enjoying significant business momentum heading into the March quarter.
Our non-GAAP guidance for the quarter is as follows: we're expecting shipments of $3.175 billion plus or minus $125 million. We're forecasting revenue of $2.850 billion again plus or minus $125 million. We're forecasting gross margin of 46% plus or minus one percentage point. I do expect to see a stronger gross margin percentage in the June quarter as compared to March.
We're forecasting operating margins of 29% plus or minus one percentage point and finally, we forecast earnings per share of $4.35 plus or minus $0.15 based on a share count of approximately 181 million shares.
Before moving to Q&A, I'd like to provide an update on our plans for Analyst Day. We will be hosting this event on Tuesday, March 6, in New York City. We will be providing additional details regarding the event logistics in the next week or so.
And for 2018, we continue to be pleased with the positive momentum in our business and the progress we're making towards our ongoing business objectives. We remain optimistic in the strong demand for our products and services and we look forward to sharing a comprehensive update on the company's plans at our Analyst Day in March.
Operator that concludes my prepared remarks. Please open up the call for questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions].
And we'll take our first question from C. J. Muse with Evercore. Please go ahead. Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, I was hoping you could provide some help around that the cost down efforts in the NAND market. And so as you think about moving from single-stack to multi-stack QLC perhaps some other techniques that you're helping your customers met with. We would love to hear how you think about the bit guys and their ability to drive down their costs such that the hard disk drive market becomes achievable to penetrate? That would be very helpful. My, that's a comprehensive question, C.J. So maybe I should start with our assumption that we communicated in the Analyst Meeting a year ago. We actually when we articulated our perspective on the opportunity for Lam and we gave this reference to $70 billion of investments. Our assumption was actually that SSD would not be disruptive to hard disk drives. Our assumption was that the demand for storage and memory in the world would essentially be serviced by this new mode of nonvolatile memory, all these new product with nonvolatile memory. And then hard disk drives would just kind of be kind of caped out that was the modeling assumption that we presented to you.
So to the extent the scenario plays out in the way you articulate it, you should presume that's kind of upside to the commentary of the company because of what I just said. Obviously NAND is probably the poster child for a market with elasticity of demand. And the industry has universally adopted a new technology and it is scaling that new technology in terms of playing the 3D transitions and layer counts.
And when our customers make investments they make it because they have performance enhancements on device and they have cost roadmaps that creates opportunities for incremental demand to get kind of created. So there's an awful lot I could say about the subject, the headlines that I hope everybody retains here is we think the world of silicon and we think the world of nonvolatile memory specifically has tremendous opportunity in the years ahead as a byproduct of this innovation that's emerged around the value of data in the world. And the good use of Lam from a lot of hard work and a lot of partnerships with our customers we position the portfolio of products and a product pipeline that's focused on enabling that roadmap. That's helpful. Appreciate, it. And I guess as a follow-up as you think about your 1.7 times outperformance in 2017 and it looks like mix is going to be there for you again in 2018 would love to hear your thoughts in terms of how whether you can rank order or not, how you think about perhaps gains in share and logic service growth and other areas where you're seeing increased patterning that will drive faster than expected industry growth for you guys we'd love to hear thoughts on that? Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate the question C.J. and maybe I can just restate something I said in my prepared remarks because it's a very important disclosure from the company relative to our focus, our definition of success, and our priority. And I share that because I have some anxiety that the investment community gets trapped in fairly incomplete disclosure from the totality of the industry on market share hence our focus.
So our focus is the following. Our primary objective is to promote our customer success through an increased proportion of their spending that we actively compete for and through differentiation to win and sustain more of that business over time. That means that our focus at a product line level and a business unit level and a segment level has to be on the share that we have but what really counts is where that share is and our focus is on the most critical applications, that most value to applications for our customers, and the sustainability of that share through the economics that were associated with it.
And the most basic measure of performance for any company in any market is the one that I characterized and we will continue to answer these questions on market share by a focus around that kind of basis. And our headline for last year was 21% of WFE against 18.5% in prior year against 14.2% in the year, the first year after bringing Lam and Novellus together. So momentum is really good. The technology inflections still have tremendous opportunity for us, more or less the headlines that we communicated in NAND flash at the Analyst Meeting are only I would say a little better one-year on and we'll spend more time talking about that in a few weeks.
And in the world of patterning, I think the headlines that we communicated in our Analyst Meeting a year ago are as valid today as they were then. And that includes the various scenarios of adoption of EUV and that includes the various technology advancements that have played out since that time in multi-patterning process flow. Thanks C.J. And we'll take our next question from Romit Shah with Nomura. Please go ahead. Yes, thank you and congratulations. The March shipment numbers obviously a very big number and I feel like there could be some skepticism around that shipment number and how strong it is and whether or not that's really sustainable and so I was hoping you could comment on just if we look throughout the year and just triangulate between the outperformance you delivered in 2017 and your outlook for low-double-digit WFE growth this year it would seem like the March shipment guidance is a number that you could sustain throughout the year, I wanted to get your feedback on that? Yes, I mean we're obviously we're not in the game of guiding every quarter of the year or even the year with any specificity but to the spirit of your question, I hope there isn't skepticism around the quarter itself because I hope at this point we've got a track record of actually delivering on the kind of quarters commitments relative to sustainability. Obviously this is all about fundamental demand and if you sign up for if you sign up for the conventions that I described in my prepared comments, the convention that silicon has established itself quite differently in terms of potential and work data, then you would sign up for sustainability of investment.
Now you might get ebbs and flows one quarter after another or one month but the fundamental headline that we believe in and we're investing to create value in is a scenario of sustained and disciplined investment by our customers at a more discrete level just to put some more substance on it for you, our expectation is that relative calendar 2018 we see it is not perfectly but a reasonably balanced year for the industry and for the company both.
And I would say that we see memory could be slightly first half biased and foundry could be slightly second half biased, with Logic as fairly neutral in the year. And as was proven last year, everything I just said to be entirely wrong and probably is precisely wrong but it's the best we have for you today in terms of trying to give you some color around quarter-to-quarter or half-to-half. I appreciate it. I'm curious just as my follow-up how China plays into your forecast for this year because there's obviously a lot going on between domestic and global and memory and foundry is how does China play into your outlook? Yes. So the China -- obviously for the domestic community and the global players that are investing there is a big deal and the headlines in terms of new fab projects are exactly the same today as they were three months ago when I detailed them the only incremental disclosure today obviously is there are more projects that we're tracking.
But when we look at WFE investments in calendar 2018, we think that the domestic community combines all segments, so the domestic community in China DRAM, flash, and logic foundry, probably invest slightly less than $5 billion which is a little less than 10% of global WFE and the way we've described it to you and that's up between $1 billion and $2 billion maybe $1.5 billion compared to that kind of the 2017.
So it's an increasingly important component of spending, it's a big focus for us in terms of building infrastructure, supporting our customer success, and their visions and putting in place qualified people to support them.
One last piece of data relative to our shipments when we look at the Lam shipments in China two-thirds of the shipment dollars will be probably for the global players investing their one-third for the domestic community. And we'll take our next question from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Please go ahead. Well thanks for taking my question. I want to go back to some of the structural changes especially with 3D NAND. I want to get your view how we should think about migration from 64 to 96 and in that context with the new fab and a change in layout have any impact in architecture especially as the 3D NAND could lead to higher manufacturing cycle time. So perhaps a new clean room could help with that versus converting existing planar NAND. Is there anything or any changes between these two sort of variables that we should add to our thesis? Yes, I mean I don't know I would characterize the kind of line layout complexities from 64 to 96 much differently I would from the other versions that have preceded this and I don't think I would characterize it as more challenging or complex than a planar to 3D conversion.
But I think your question is a very important one and you know there are I would say fairly dynamic customer plans around how best they service the opportunities in the marketplace that they see and we would expect to continue to see this portfolio of investments from clean Greenfields to the planar to 3D scaling and 3D scaling vertically itself.
We are as we've said number of times we're agnostic actually in terms of the opportunity between the planar 3D conversion and the new fab addition from a business perspective and I would expect based on what I know today that somewhere in the range of two-thirds of the investment by the industry is conversion related and maybe a third is additions. But that's a proxy that will change for sure as discrete opportunities for sure for customers and as they optimize their plans. Sure. And then and just quickly as a follow-up as we think about the longer-term, how should we think about the service component especially with some of the new areas like ALD would that carry different service attach rate versus the rest and I know Analyst Day is coming up but is there anything you can share with us? Yes, probably it's a way to the Analyst Meeting and there are some very important headlines I think for the company around the pace of growth in excess of the installed base and the product portfolio and the segments that we're growing are part of that story, the emphasis that we're investing in around advanced services is part of that story and I think there's something quite unique about where we are in the ecosystem that presents opportunity as well. So it's definitely an increasingly valuable annuity to the company and it's an increasingly important part of creating and delivering value to our customers. And we will take our next question from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Great, thank you. I wonder if you could characterize the service and supplies business and it seems like that's been consistently holding the same proportion of your overall revenue. Is how is that business kind of growing as fast as the systems business and how sustainable do you think that growth is? It's actually been growing faster than the installed base which is a kind of a statement of the breadth of the product and services portfolio that we're making available to our customers and we're investing and creating and dialogues around our social intelligence and machine learning are as relevant inside of our company and is relevant in terms of developing products and services for our customers, as it is for our customers and ensuring their customers and the consumers.
So don't disconnect the AI and the big data analytics headlines from the realities of our company as well. So it's a broadening portfolio, it's growing fast in installed base and in a periods where we've had extraordinary growth in our systems business, it's a testament to the strengths of our Customer Service Business Group that we have we're able to say what we're saying and preserve in essence the same percentage of revenues coming from that business.
Now what that means in terms of modeling purposes, if you happen to choose best, you're going to model less growth in calendar 2018 than was true in 2017 which is essentially what we've guided. Then the value of that installed base business kind of goes up over time. So I think it’s a great commentary on value, sustainability, and quality of earnings. And Joe I always tell you it's my favorite part about the company's business model is just it's an annuity that just keeps going, keeps growing, keeps generating enormous amounts of cash it's a great part of what we do. And we'll take our next question from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Great, thanks for taking the question, and congrats on the results. And Martin, I had a question on UV. I guess as we approach the timing of insertion particularly in the foundry space and you learn more about the recipe that your customer might follow. Has your view on your opportunity set, as it relates to patterning changed over the past six or 12 months or has it remained kind of the same? It's remained the same. Okay, fair enough. And the second one on the tax rate, Doug, I think you guided fiscal year second half the tax rate to kind of the mid-teens. Should we consider that rate as the new normal for the company or should we expect some variability going forward post tax put planning or whatever maybe. Yes, Toshi, if I was modeling out beyond the second half of 2018 I'd probably keep it pretty steady with what I gave you which is mid-teens for the second half. But it always changes a little bit depending on where the geographic distribution of our business ebbs and flows, so it's not going to be precisely that, but that would be the best planning horizon or the planning number that I'll give you. And just to remind make sure everybody heard first half of calendar 2018 mid-single-digits, second half, mid-teens. And we'll take our next question from Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse. Farhan, I think you are on mute. Hello, can you hear me? Yes, we can hear you now. Go ahead. So my first question is on memory and NAND DRAM. What level of bit growth do you expect from the CapEx outlook that you have for the year? I think we kind of signed up for the consensus on bit growth. So the low 20s for DRAM and mid to high 40s for NAND for calendar 2018 and obviously the server phone content in DRAM is a decent kind of content headline and the same is true for the Smartphone bit growth for NAND. And I think one of the illustrative headlines that we should all be conscious of is the average Smartphone today is got maybe 4 gigs of NAND content and the best phones have 256 -- 40 I'm sorry I should have said 40 gigs of content and the best one is 256.
So when you think about applications innovation and you think about the content headlines not the unit headlines that's one of the most fundamental drivers for the business prospectively. Got it. And then one question on the services you have very strong growth in your systems business this year. Does that mean that we should see much stronger growth in your services business over next year, one year as these systems come off warranty? Well, I'll say the objective of the company, as we said many, many times is to grow the service business the spares and service and upgrades business faster than we do the installed base. And you're right to say there are warranties and so when warranty periods end and you roll into that space and we try to position for very, very strong market share and sustainability. So I would tend to lean towards a very positive answer to your question. And we'll take our next question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Good afternoon and congratulations on the well executed quarter and the outstanding performance in 2017. You guys have given great leverage on the OpEx with the scale and the revenue growth. If we assume that WFE is sustainable above 40, 45 billion plus kind of going forward, seems like 28% to 30% up margin plus or minus seems sustainable. So more and more investors are focused on free cash flow and free cash flow margin so how should we think about the sustainable free cash flow margin at say the 28% to 30% operating margin level? Yes, Harlan, we're front-running an update to the model which we will give you in early March. But generally speaking we would expect operating cash flow to be close to operating income.
Now if you look at what happened in the last year the business grew so rapidly that we actually did less well than that because the consumption of working capital as the business scaled up we needed to build more inventory, receivables grew along with the level of revenue so we didn't do quite as well as that. But on a ongoing basis assuming kind of a steady state of business shipments and revenue that's about where we should be. Our CapEx is nominally 3% to 4% of revenues so that's your free cash flow answer there. Got it. Thanks for the insights there. And shipments are up 40% in December versus the year ago quarter versus two years ago there will be up strongly again in March. Obviously my congrats to the operations, logistics, and manufacturing teams but just given the significant strength in the [indiscernible] are customer lead times increasing and anyway to quantify the increase? Yes, way to qualify everything but we don't disclose lead times for obvious competitive reasons in respect for the roadmaps of our customers. But what I will tell you is obviously it takes a lot of work to do what we're doing it's much more difficult. And I think for an industry. I think we've for those of us that have participated in the scale of growth that we have, we've all been very challenged by that scale of growth.
But I would say that from a benchmarking perspective as best I can tell which is why I spoke to kind of flexible business model and commitment from employees in my prepared comments, we've executed as well if not better than most or maybe all. So it's a big focus, it's get more difficult and certainly 50% growth here is a quite extraordinary challenges for operations and also field resources. Yes, I'm always amazed Harlan when I sit for the quarterly business reviews with the supply chain, the global operations team, as well as the field, just how well they're executing. It's been actually quite amazing when you see how it's all happened. We'll take our next question from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Well thanks for taking my question. My question is the first question is on DRAM. There has been a lot of chatters that the strong DRAM that the market expects and what you alluded to for next year could be because of capital intensity of DRAM going up but it could also be yields on suboptimal what is your view on that? Well my basic view is I don't think customers spend money if a yield is suboptimal. I think that's a very important kind of test for them making their investments and I guess that's all relative. I mean we have characterized obviously today that the relative investments the industry has to make are a little higher for a bit outs in the context of the technology conversions that are playing out today in this year compared to last year and the year before.
But I would also make the point that it's still an investment that is dominated by conversion. And it is still an investment that is made with extraordinary discipline by our customers managing supply and demand balance. And I would also say that the capital intensity data point is actually a lot less than the points in history that have triggered kind of corrections so I think if you look at kind of memory today, the capital intensity for the last four years including the outlook for calendar 2018 is not even two-thirds of the level seen in 2007, so it's a dramatically different profile of risk. Okay, that's helpful. My follow-up question is if you look at your forecast for WFE, what are some of the biggest swing factors in your forecast that can move above or below your forecast of low-teens; just want to see if I can get something out you to be more precisely wrong? No, Sidney, I appreciate that and good luck with that. Well I mean macro positive negative is always there and always will be -- this is a pretty extraordinary time for the industry I think holistically because there's an irony here of consolidated participants and a diversified kind of statement of demand. So I guess may be more difficult not more easy to forecast the future at a device to my level. You have an industry that is I think singularly invested and try to take advantage of this opportunity and contribute to broader tech economy and broader innovation. And so, it's all about creating incremental demand and the memory, storage, datacenter, AI, Big Data Analytics advanced process, I mean it's all relevant.
Right, I mean we live in a world where devices and silicon that support connectivity are critical to the roadmap. Devices that create the capacity to store efficiently and cost effectively all that collected data are critical. And the high performance computing that is relevant to take all of that data and do something with it that creates value either in an enterprise or in a consumer context has to kind of show up.
So I think it's a very integrated system which is perhaps why I answer the question may be less precisely than you would like me to because I think we live in a world where this is much less about discrete segments of a semiconductor industry as we traditionally described it and much more about the integration of technologies from a chip integration point of view, from an embedded memory and logic solutions perspective, we live in the world of systems, designed systems architecture and it all has to be there and all is part of answering this question around incremental opportunity or incremental risk. We will take our next question from Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Please go ahead. Yes thanks for taking that question. Martin, I appreciate the comments on the positioning for 2018's memory spending and DRAM starting to catch-up and balance with NAND. Could you extend your view a little bit further and comment on maybe the multi-year trend for DRAM, I know the company's typically been comfortable talking about longer-term such as your five-year NAND spending piece. So could you give us a longer term look with what you see at DRAM? I thought you started with NAND and you ended with DRAM. He kind of boomeranged. Which one do you want to talk about? DRAM. NAND was simply used as an example of -- Okay, okay. Kind of in the past for the longer-term deals. The first thing I'd say it's a content story not a unit story. I don't think we're going to stand up and say hey we got this great view that all of a sudden PC units and software units take off again because I don't think that's the headline.
It's all about content and there are two drivers of bit growth in DRAM one of them is the server which is the most comprehensive demand driver and the second is expansion of phone contents. And we are, I would say, I'd probably be stronger than conservatively optimistic I'd say we're optimistic about those long-term trends and we think they're fundamental to answering the questions about investments in silicon capacity and the investment we make in a business. That's helpful and then the follow-up I'll shoot it over to Doug. Doug as you look at the company and the flexibility that you have now with cash, can you talk about what that means for debt levels and capital structure and if we should expect that that would stay at current levels or if there's potential for whatever reason for debt to rise from here as a percent of your capital structure. Thank you. Yes, Craig. I'm going to decline to answer that one but I will promise you that when we get to the March Analyst Day we will have lots more to tell you as you might appreciate all the tax changes are kind of late breaking we're talking internally about it debating some things. We'll have more to tell you know in our remarks from and I'm going to punt on this one for now. Can I take a swing at another one then? Yes, go ahead. Okay, I'll pop it back to Martin. Martin, this is more of a -- maybe I'll have better success more of a qualitative question. I'm interested in knowing the degree to which your discussions with customers have changed over the last few years as capital intensity is stepped up dramatically and as there's more signs that industry is on a steadier growth profile rather than boom/bust what's changed with the duration of the discussion the way that you may be collaborating across different types of technologies etcetera. Yes, I mean actually maybe that last kind of sub question is actually a great response. I mean I think the scale and scope of technical challenges and business challenges for everybody in this ecosystem is much more difficult today than was true five years ago. And the companies that I think excel and sustain in the long-term have attributes of partnership and collaboration and codependency that are quite fundamental and that's why almost every single quarter I see something like culture and values because that's a fundamental elements of competitive differentiation.
If you are not trusted if you are not legitimately collaborative, if you are not sincerely invested in the success of your customers then your opportunity to sustain your business is limited. And it does conclude out question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Satya for any additional or closing remarks. Yes, thank you once again for joining us. And we look forward to seeing you at our March Analyst Day in New York. We'll be sending you more details shortly on that. Thank you. And once again that does conclude today's presentation.

As a reminder, the replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website. Due to some technical difficulties, our presentation today will be audio-only and the slides accompanying today’s presentations have been posted on our website separately from the webcast.
With that, let me hand the call over to Martin. Again, thank you all for joining us today. As reported, Lam delivered strong financial results for the March 2018 quarter, with revenue, gross margin dollars and EPS all at record levels and above the midpoint of guidance. In addition, we completed our first ever quarter with over $3 billion in shipments. Including the June quarter outlook, Lam will deliver revenue growth on a year-over-year basis in 23 out of the last 24 quarters, which is a testament to both the successful scaling of our company and a multiyear environment of demand led and more sustainable customer investments. I would like to take this moment to thank our customers, our employees and our partners for the opportunity they provide us for their trust and contributions made, without which the performance of Lam would not be possible. I will keep my comments brief today given that we provided a comprehensive update on our vision, strategy and objectives at our recent Investor Day.
Cost effective scaling of semiconductor device performance remains critical to addressing opportunities provided by the transition to the data economy and now is substantially more diverse in scope than traditional shrink. In this context, our focus is on systematically strengthening the competitiveness and relevance of Lam’s product portfolio to the success of our customers. Broadly recognized, etch and deposition technologies are now foundational and permanent features in the current roadmap of vertical scaling, multi-patterning, advanced packaging and advanced transistor architectures. These inflections have resulted in substantial growth in our serviceable addressable market, or SAM and reiterating a headline of the recent Investor Day, we are on track to grow our SAM to over 40% of wafer fabrication equipment spending by 2021.
As an acknowledged leader in etch and deposition markets, we have an opportunity to capture a greater proportion of our customers spending by delivering unit process excellence, leveraging our multi-product capabilities and engaging in closer collaboration within the semi-ecosystem. We are making substantial comprehensive and disciplined investments in R&D to fund innovation that is intended to extend the differentiation of our products and services portfolio and we continue to prudently scale the infrastructure of the company to support our 2021 objectives.
Customer equipment selection decisions in the March 2018 quarter were consistent with expectations in the context of our long-term objectives. Irrespectively, we secured additional wins in dielectric etch one for a high aspect ratio DRAM application and another for NAND flash, both at leading memory manufacturers. We also won a new nonvolatile memory application with an advanced etch capability harnessing value from our unit process excellence and unmatched collaboration between Lam etch and deposition business units. We see solid momentum with our deposition portfolio and we are pleased recently to celebrate our 500 VECTOR Strata PECVD product shipments. This platform continues to offer industry leading productivity and film property control that together creates custom enablements and competitive differentiation for Lam creating value and enhancing codependency in multi-stack deposition applications in 3D NAND for example.
Our systems business is augmented by our installed base business where we have been focused on enhancing the breadths and competitiveness of our products and services as a means of further enabling our customer’s success. Customer support business unit revenue growth continued to outperform that’s of our installed base growth in the March quarter and we achieved key customer penetrations within our reliance and advanced services business. At our recent Investor Day we provided several metrics of our long-term growth not only to illustrate the value of this annuity like business, but more importantly to emphasize the integral role it plays in value creation, value capture and increasing codependency with our customers.
Now, turning to the macro and wafer fabrication equipment, WFE spending environments, expectations for global economic growth remains strong and are healthy. We believe that content growth remains a powerful multiyear driver of demand in the data economy. Context for multiyear customer investments is not simply a byproduct of market efficiency from consolidation and disciplines operational execution through the semiconductor supply chain, it is more fundamentally endorsed by the evergreen verticals of climate change, education, food and water, healthcare, security and transportation that together define the opportunity for silicon based artificial intelligence, AI technologies and applications and services innovation globally. In the smartphone end markets innovative data intensive services will increasingly be deployed leveraging AI and using a range of enabling artificial and virtual reality technologies.
The deployment of 5G networks will improve the quality of these services, but to deliver the best user experience the smartphones themselves will require a combination of higher screen resolution, faster refresh cycles and lower power. This will drive the need for nearly 2x the DRAM contents in smartphones relative to the current global average. Additionally, density increases associated with higher layer counts in 3D NANDs create the opportunity for terabyte level storage in smartphones within the next few years. For 2018 WFE investments by our customers remain prudent and demand led. Since our update in January WFE continues to track up low double-digits in 2018 compared to 2017 with slightly higher DRAM mix and slightly lower logic investments compared to our earlier baseline.
For NAND and nonvolatile memory broadly the totality of our perspective would be that long-term demand drivers are compelling. Customer investments in 2018 appear essentially equivalents to those of 2017 and considering the impacts of customer specific to our moving plans this year spending we expect will be first half biased. For Lam aggregating all customer segments, we currently anticipate a first half second half shipments waiting at the low 50s high 40s level in 2018. We expect relatively balanced revenues through the year. As always this prospective account will likely change as our customers seek ways to exploit their competitive advantage and market timing later in the year. It seems that the perpetual bull-bear debate surrounds the sustainability of memory based investments. In that context, we think it is worthy to note that associated with the emergence of cloud and collectivity, the 7-year cumulative annual growth rate for memory WFE is 15%, 10x greater than the comparable foundry logic WFE CAGR.
Combined with the concentration to etch and deposition technologies, a strong memory business in the new data economy is a sustainable asset and not a liability from our perspective. In addition and perhaps still somewhat underappreciated is the strengthening of Lam business, the diversification of Lam business into foundry and logic. In only the 24-month period ending December 2018, we expect Lam shipments in these segments to grow 2x faster than the pace of the underlying foundry logic WFE. In short, we feel that’s the historic strength of Lam has never been more valuable. Further, the historic relative weakness of Lam is becoming much stronger.
In closing, we target outperforming overall industry growth again in calendar year 2018 and we are focused on successfully executing to our near and long-term objectives growing some and increasing market share with an enhanced product and services portfolio. Strong March quarter performance is consistent with our expectations and we remain pleased with the company’s execution in financials in an overall healthy industry environment.
With that, I will turn the call over to Doug. Okay, great. Thank you, Martin. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We are very pleased with our results for the March quarter delivering record levels in shipments, revenue and operating income dollars. Each of these items grew double-digit percentage sequentially from the December quarter. Execution from the company continues to remain very strong. Shipments for the quarter came in at $3.135 billion, which was up 19% sequentially and within the guided range. Shipments were up 30% year-over-year. Timing of shipments to certain new customer projects was a primary factor in our shipment profile coming in slightly below the midpoint.
As we expected, memory shipments continued to grow in the quarter, with the combined memory segment making up 84% of total system shipments and that compares to 77% in the previous quarter. Our overall nonvolatile memory shipments remain very strong representing approximately 57% of system shipments compared to 53% last quarter. DRAM shipments represented 27% of system shipments, which was up from 24% on prior quarter. The NAND and DRAM markets continue to benefit from density growth as we transition to the new data enabled economy.
The Foundry segment was down accounting for 10% of system shipments relative to 15% of system payments in December. The logic and other segment contribute 6% of both system shipments compared to 8% in the prior quarter. And we would point out we expect that both foundry and logic shipments will be stronger as we go through the remainder of this year. We delivered record revenue of $2.892 billion in the March quarter, which was an increase of 12% from December and above the midpoint of our guidance.
Gross margin for the period came in at 46.8%, which was down 80 basis points sequentially, but towards the higher end of our guided range. And as we shared before, our actual gross margins are a function of several factors such as business volumes, product mix and customer concentration and we expect to see variability on a quarter-to-quarter basis.
Operating expenses in the quarter grew to $486 million, but decreased 60 basis points on a percentage basis to 16.8% of revenues. On a dollar basis, R&D spending and SG&A both increased sequentially and we continue to have approximately 63% of our spending allocated to R&D. Investments in R&D are fundamental to driving long-term value creation for all of our stakeholders within the S&P 500 sectors the semiconductor and equipment group flagged the highest in the percentage of R&D spend on average for the last several years. Our strong R&D investment strategy is central to maintaining our technology leadership as we position the company to benefit from the multiple technology inflections and to deliver the growth that we have highlighted during our Investor Day in March.
Operating income in the March quarter came in at a record level of $867 million, which was up over 11% from the prior quarter. Operating margin came in at the high end of our guidance at 30% due to the stronger gross margin performance and slightly better operating expenses than we expected. Excluded from non-GAAP earnings are approximately $47 million in losses from the sale of investments in anticipation of cash repatriation under the recent U.S. tax reform. We are essentially liquidating our fixed income portfolio to enable the cash to come to the United States. The tax rate for the quarter was 1%. We expect the tax rate to be in the mid single-digit percentage range for the first half of calendar 2018 of high single-digit percentage for the June quarter. I will just remind you in the longer run a tax rate in the middle teens remains the right level for you to include in your models.
Based on the share count of approximately 178 million shares, earnings per share for the March quarter were $4.79, above the high end of our guidance, excuse me. The primary drivers of this upside versus our guidance were higher revenue, higher profitability, lower taxes and the lower share count. The share count includes dilution from the 2018 and 2041 convertible notes with the total dilutive impact being approximately 13 million shares on a non-GAAP basis. Total conversions that settled in the March quarter were 228 million with 193 million related to the 2041 bond and the remainder related to the 2018 convertible note. The dilution schedules for the 2018 and 2041 convertible notes are available on our Investor Relations website for your reference.
And just a reminder at our Analyst Day in March, we announced the plan to return at least 50% of our free cash flow to stockholders over the next 5 years. This included a plan to increase quarterly dividends by 120% to $1.10 and an additional $2 billion share repurchase authorization for a total of $4 billion authorized since November of last year. At the end of the quarter, we had completed approximately 25% of the current $4 billion share repurchase authorization. This was primary executed through an accelerated share repurchase program that is still ongoing. We are planning to complete our authorization over the next 12 months to 18 months in tandem with the expected timing of our cash repatriation. During the quarter we paid roughly $80 million in dividends.
So now let me switch to the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments including restricted cash increased during the quarter to $6.7 billion compared to $6 billion at the end of the December quarter. Approximately 87% of this total cash is still offshore. We do expect to be able to move some portion of the offshore cash to the United States during the June quarter. Cash from operations was slightly over $1 billion, up from $29 million in December. Cash generation was partially offset by our capital return programs and capital expenditures. Day sales outstanding decreased by 14 days to 66 days. You may recall me talking last quarter about the timing of certain collections falling just outside of the December quarter. All of those were collected in the March quarter. Inventory turns remained roughly consistent the prior quarter at 3.7x. And as we mentioned in our December quarter earnings call adoption of the ASC 606 new revenue recognition standard will start in the September quarter for Lam. We will provide additional clarity on the impact of the standard in our next earnings call, but I wanted to highlight that adoption of ASC 606 will make our revenue more closely aligned with the timing of shipments.
Company non-cash expenses included approximately $41 million each for equity comp, amortization and depreciation. Capital expenditures were $49 million, which was down from $85 million in the December quarter. And as a reminder, we expect CapEx in 2018 will be higher versus 2017 levels to support manufacturing network expansion and growth in strategic R&D investments. We exited the quarter with approximately 10,600 regular full-time employees. The headcount additions were primarily in the factory and field with other additions in R&D.
By looking ahead, we would like to provide our non-GAAP guidance for the June quarter. We are expecting shipments of $3 billion plus or minus $150 million. We expect continued strength in memory and slight growth in both foundry and logic. We’re forecasting revenue of $3.100 billion plus or minus $150 million, gross margin of 47.5% plus or minus 1 percentage point, operating margins of 31% plus or minus 1 percentage point, and finally, earnings per share of $5 plus or minus $0.20 based on the share count of approximately 178 million shares. We are pleased with our performance in the March quarter and with the guidance we have just shared for the June quarter, we anticipate our shipments to be biased to the first half primarily due to heavier first half NAND spending by our customers, we expect comparatively more balanced to our revenues half-on-half. Overall, we continue to execute well by having the right products, making the right investments at the right time to take advantage of the technology inflections driving the transition to the new data economy.
That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from CJ Muse with Evercore. Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, clearly a lot of debate around sustainability of memory and I was hoping maybe you could help out on the DRAM side. As you think about shrinking at the next node, what kind of bit growth are you seeing overall for the industry and what kind of new greenfield capacity do you think is required each and every year as we proceed from here? That’s a very precise question, CJ, each and every year. So, I mean, I think the headlines that you have just highlighted with your question is that where at an inflection relative to the economics of DRAM in two respects, one of them is the cost of the investments it costs more for bit density today than it did 5 years ago. But on the other side of that coin, the value proposition associated with what our customers are selling and what they are ultimately getting paid for those devices is dramatically different as well and to the point that we tried to make in our investor meeting, while it’s true to say that our customers have never spent more money, it’s also true to say that in many respects they have never spent a smaller proportion of their profits. And so when we look at bit density per wafer out, it is obviously lower today than it was 5 years ago, but pricing stability in DRAM appears there. Profits for sure are healthy in the memory community. Last time, I looked most of our customers were reporting 40% to 50% operating income levels. And I think when we look at the spending, the best of our ability is to figure out, CJ, it looks disciplined, it looks balanced and it looks healthy in the context of how customers are executing with a prudent investment in additions and significant investment in conversions. Very helpful. And as my follow-up, I guess, Doug, can you kind of walk through how you are expecting mix in gross margin to be impacted by mix as we move into the second half of the calendar year? CJ, we don’t really give guidance one quarter at a time, but what I would suggest to you is as I always do in my scripted remarks, gross margin will move around quarter-to-quarter depending on business volumes, product mix, customer concentration. If I looked at the last, I don’t know year or two, we have bounced around between 46% and 47% and that’s kind of what we have got baked into the financial model, so that’s probably a good signpost used relative to how to think about it C.J. Very helpful. Thank you. Thanks C.J. Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Thanks for taking my question. First one, Doug I think you mentioned on shipments some timing of shipments came out of March, went into June if you could had to quantify that. And then as we look into June you are guiding to some small decline in shipments quarter-to-quarter which I believe is somewhat different than the seasonal norm if you could provide any color around that would be also useful? Yes. Vivek, I mean quite honestly, we missed the midpoint in guidance by $40 million which honestly is four or five tools when you think about in the grand text of what’s happening with our numbers, so as always you have got things that shipped and they moved around every quarter. And I am not really going to comment on any specific customer, but it was a pretty modest variance in terms of how to think about them. I think on the seasonality components of the question, one of the themes of the investor meeting was the irony of consolidating kind of customer base, but a more diversified demand portfolio. And in transitions away from kind of simple units to a density and the role that enterprise and clouds and data center has in the construct of this marketplace, I am not sure any of us would agree what the headlines of seasonality are. I am not sure I could articulate as the guidance only being in this industry close 20 years I wouldn’t be able to describe to you what seasonality is today, because it’s a dramatically different profile of demand for IC and the discipline of our customers is very different today than it was 10 years ago. Alright. And the follow-up, Martin our foundry contribution, only about 10% in march, I think probably one of the lowest levels we have seen, how do you think about that the contribution on a quantitative basis as we move throughout the rest of the year and especially the pipeline ahead of some of the node migrations that your foundry customers are going to go through? Thank you. Yes. I mean the foundry headline for company is awesome. I mean it could be better, it can more awesome, but we have made a significant amount of progress in the last of couple years and I talked about in my compared comments that’s not only do I think we have foundational strengths from the memory presence in the company, but the diversification of foundry and logic is the strength, but perhaps it’s a little underappreciated. The objective we have running the company is to ship products to customers when they ask for them not early, not late and so when you see these quarterly kind of movements it really is nothing more than a customer’s request. And frankly I mean we would love to live in the world of perfectly calm and predictable and unknown variable world if we don’t, so we do the best we can to ship to customers when they ask for it. So there really is no headline associated with the 10% number that you referred to for the foundry other than that just happened to be the schedule of the customers request compared in contrast with December and compared to contrast with the June quarter. So the strength what we characterized is real we believe sustainable and we are working hard to make it even more valuable going forward. And Vivek we expect foundry will grow as we go through the year as well and just to reiterate the comment I had in my script. Got it. Thank you very much. Thanks Vivek. And your next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Great. Thanks very much for taking the question. Martin, I was hoping you could provide an update on China, I think there have been a couple of media reports recently about some of your customers winning real business for the first time and some of your customers planning on ramping capacity later this year and to 2019, so it does feel like we are getting closer to a decently sized ramp if you will. So, I guess the question is what are you seeing in terms of bookings today and what are your expectations over the next 12 months to 18 months? Yes. Actually, I think our expectation today is almost exactly the same to the expectation that we started the year with, maybe even had almost a year ago. I mean we believe in the vision that’s being articulated and we see our customers investing to build competency, capability and know how to go execute that vision. And indeed we are aware that the customers kind of reported real end customer business and outlet that presumably legitimizes this. So, going back to where we started this conversation in earlier in the year, we expect a couple of billion dollars of incremental WFE this year in China and that represents 10%, 12% or so of the overall WFE kind of marketplace. So, the bulk of the industry is still outside of China and obviously included in China or at least the global company investments as well as the domestic community. So, I would say it continues to appear like there is steady progress. Okay, great. And then as my follow-up I was hoping you guys can talk a little bit about the ALD opportunity longer term I think you touched on the subject briefly at your Investor Day, but if you could remind us how you use size the opportunities at longer term, if you can talk a little bit about the competitive landscape there? That would be helpful as well. Thank you. Yes. I mean, I think we have obviously articulated not just for deposition business unit, but also for the etch business unit, the importance of control and repeatability and opening our process windows for our customers and atomic level processing is an important part of delivering that. There are other significant challenges for our customers, not least aspect ratios, but atomic level processing is increasingly relevant to the success of the company and the success of the customers. So, it’s big investments. It’s one of the biggest areas of competitive momentum. We don’t actually characterize in any detail the proportion of WFE that we think is directly assignable because that we obviously have competitive sensitivity to that, but I think we got fundamental differentiation on technology and productivity and the engagement with the customer is comprehensive. And I am pretty pleased with the momentum we have. Thank you. Your next question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura Instinet. Yes, thank you. Martin, I definitely appreciate your comments around just DRAM spending looking balanced and disciplined, but seeing that shipments here over 30% sequentially and 50% year-on-year, I mean, obviously realized that higher cost per bit is a factor, but at what level do you become concerned that your DRAM customers are adding too much capacity? I would say I would be concerned that our customers are adding a few much capacity if the analytics in our company in terms of end use demand concluded that there was a dramatic imbalance and we have no evidence of that. I mean, we are trying to articulate and our prospective may not be the best that’s a choice obviously that you have to make, but we do our best to analyze kind of end markets. And when we look at bit mind and bit consensus and then the construct of the market and isolate, for example, a 45% servr bit growth assumption in DRAM and that impact on investment levels and then to the best of our abilities understands, bit per wafer and the investment choices for customers between conversions and additions. We end up in the same place that our customers are articulating plans. And so it’s left to do with how big the number is in my opinion and much more to do with whether it correlates to the statement of demand. As well as affordability, Romit, as you know, I mean, DRAM revenue and profits are all-time record levels. Yes, got it and helpful. Thanks for that. And then could you also just talk about what’s happening in logic you have – or at least my understanding is you have a very strong position at 10-nanometer, certainly a better position than you did at the previous node and we have seen revenues in this category run up last year, you had a very strong Q3, but shipments down the last couple of quarters and I think you mentioned that logic was a little weaker than you anticipated in the first quarter? Yes. I don’t know that it’s particularly material in the long-term. Again, I go back to my answer to the earlier question in foundries, I mean, all we try to do if I am very correct and honest is ship product to customers let me ask for it, not earlier and not late and that’s our focus and that’s priorities. So, you are going to see up and down as customers adjust schedules and most of the time we get that light fairly well to our midpoint guidance and we almost always get it correct in our range, in fact, I think always in our range. So, I mean, I don’t think we are doing that job a signaling here. But it’s just a matter of the timing of investments by customers and that goes up and down and we just roll on truly. But focus of the company to where you started is making sure that we have a product portfolio that’s more relevant to our logic and foundry customers and to making sure that we are gaining more market share and in the microprocessors and foundry both hopefully we have been effectively communicating pretty positive market share in the last couple of years. And Romit the only other thing I would add on that is I do think probably when you look at the logic shipments for the course of 2018 it will go up from where it is in March. Okay, helpful. Thank you. Thank you. Your next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Well, good afternoon and great job on the quarter of the execution. As a follow-up to the prior questions on DRAM, maybe a different way of asking the question is to see if the team can help us quantify some of the reviews, overall DRAM industry capacity has been trending about 1.1 million wafers products per month and relatively flattish for the past several years, the market has been getting nervous in the amount of announced DRAM CapEx spend announcement of new fiber expansion product or projects, but a lot of it I think is just to offset capacity declines and technology conversion and just to maintain a stable bit supply output, so wanted to get your views on how much you see total industry capacity going this year? So I 100% agree with what you articulated in terms of the rationale for investments whether tradition or conversion, I mean it’s for demand and it’s the consequence of capital intensity relative to the incremental bits of various kind of nodes transitions. So I mean not exactly the same place, we are in exactly the same place that you articulated in your question. Unfortunately in a world of very few customers today it’s almost impossible for an equipment company to answer directly the question that you just asked. It’s too competitively sensitive for our customers. So we do respect I have to ask you to ask them, but what I will say is we do see a modest increase in capacity in DRAM associated with the driver of demand to the consensus of the kind of low to mid-20 bit growth number that everybody seems to kind of talk about these days. And it seems like it’s perfectly relevant to the choices that our customers are making. So unfortunately, quantification has to come from them and that’s what I can tell you is it appears modest and balanced and rational. Great. Thanks for the insights there Martin. Doug a question for you, great job on the strong free cash flow almost I think 35% free cash flow margins in the March quarter, although you did tell us that you are going to play some catch up here versus the weaker December quarter, but at the high level, going back to last earnings call and Analyst Day, we will just assume that you can maintain operating margins in sort of the 30%, 31% plus range this year, we would anticipate free cash flow margins for the full calendar year in the range of about 26% to 27% for the full year is that kind of the right way to think about it? Yes. That’s the right way to think about it Harlan. I mean CapEx in the model in terms of how we think about it is 3% to 4% of revenue typically so yes, that’s what’s company had it in the model we gave in March. Great, alright. Thank you very much. Thanks Harlan. Thank you. Our next question comes from Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse. Thanks for taking my question. Doug, we saw a lot of volatility in the share prices in the March quarter, so a bit surprised that we didn’t see more significant buybacks, can you just talk about what are some of the variables that you think about in terms of buying back the shares, is there any constraints that stopped you from buying more? The primary thing Frahan relative to the $4 billion authorization is just availability of cash domestically, 87% of the cash that the company has still is domicile outside the United States. It takes time to move that around. We have taken step one of that in terms of beginning to liquidate the portfolio, but there is administrative paperwork to dividend things up and down, the tax structure to get the cash and that’s the primary thing that we need to have. We need the cash before we can buy significant stock and that will come over the next 12 months with almost all of the cash will be available by the end of year. So I think in the context of the questions were certainly important to emphasize kind of the long-term vision for the company that we talked about at the investor meeting which is kind of redistribution of 50% of free cash flow generated over the long-term and nothing new to say today. So, it’s a transactional moment in time, but a bit longer term commitments adding us the important message. Got it. And then one question on the non-CapEx at the beginning, you had talked about non-CapEx being kind of modestly up this year and DRAM being up more significant. If I look at your March quarter shipments up a lot and I was just wondering if your outlook in NAND has changed in any way in terms of the overall CapEx spending this year? Not really. It’s more or less the same today as it was kind of 3 months ago kind of what you are seeing is first half bias, which Doug talked about in his prepared comments more or less the investments that we expected is the one that seems to be playing out. And any 1 month or any 1 week or any one quarter that can go left or right a little bit, but pretty much where we expected it to be and no fundamental message is in terms of kind of bit growth that are different from the consensus and maybe the only incremental thing I would say is our expectations of investments this year which kind of lead to approximately a similar level of shipped capacity not yet qualified at the end of ‘18 to the level that existed in ‘17, which obviously definitely means the same level of discipline at the end of the beginning that existed at the beginning of the year. Got it. Thank you. That’s all I have. Thanks, Farhan. Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Great. Thank you. Can I ask a slightly annoying question I guess that people are asking me as well? You said on the last call that you thought that the shipment levels would be relatively balanced through the year, they are down a little bit in Q2, they are going to be down a little bit in the second half, is that just at the noise level, I realized these are very small changes? Has anything changed in terms of the way you see the pattern that you see through the year? Not really. And I don’t want to sound dismissive about the short-term, but again in context whether it’s in the context of the answer to the shipments kind of midpoint question or the difference between what we said last time and what we said this time and I think it’s the same message in slightly different words and none of it changes in our opinion the long-term opportunity and the importance of investing for long-term and the potential that we described in the investor meeting. So, from the inside out, this is transactional noise more than anything fundamental and if that changes we will tell you, but that’s about it right now. Great. That’s what I thought. Thank you so much. Thanks, Joe. Thank you. Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Hi, thank you. I had two questions guys. First on China trade, well actually both of them on China trade. First of all, is there the potential is there any President for the government to restrict exports of equipment into China? Well, we have lived in that world before. And it wasn’t I would say a fundamental restriction it just made the process of doing business in China a more bureaucratic. We have to file for licenses and so on and so forth. So, there is President for U.S. export restrictions of technology, not so much into semiconductor, but into semiconductor when there was a dual use that the defense department or the commerce department we are trying to manage. Maybe if I take the essence of your question and go somewhere beyond it’s precisely to kind of the conversation of our tariffs. We don’t see an impact today on our business or on our customers’ business or on our industry that would cause us to say that there is a new kind of long-term message. But we are attentive to two very important things. If tariffs starts to be disruptive to consumer confidence that has an impact in the global economy and it will eventually impact semiconductors and in turn equipments and we are attentive to domestic equipment company agendas as well. And I am not seeing that today, but if things got a little bit tit for tat, then there are obviously risks at a minimum that we need to be attentive to, but the end of the day, there is the fundamental value proposition that comes from every equipment company that’s 30 years or 40 years old and we win business and we enable based on our expertise competency and know-how. So, I am not seeing kind of risks today, but we are attentive to the other two things that we have just – that I just described attentive to consumer confidence changes and attentive to domestic equipment company agendas. Got it. Thank you. And then just this, it seems to be a school of thought that maybe this could accelerate the pace of the build out of some of these indigenous projects, I mean they seem pretty rational and pretty return focused, but have you seen any signs that they may want to pull forward some of the timelines because of some potential down the road for this to evolve into something that is bigger than it is today? No. Great. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you. Our next question comes from Edwin Mok with Needham & Company. Great. Thanks for taking my question. So first my questions is on our foundry just to clarify your comment, you said that foundry CapEx you expect to be largely in line will it tell you something, is that correct, we will see more conversion from 10 nanometer to 7 nanometer, I would expect maybe slight decline in foundry. And then kind of looking beyond this year kind of based on how will you guys look at demand and the foundry capacity, do you see a scenario of what a foundry spending can potentially grow beyond this year? I think we started the year with a kind of flat to slightly down kind of concrete for foundry year-over-year and no change today. And I think if I heard the second part of your question it relates to whether there is upsides, did I get it correct? Yes. These are just – is there upside probably laid on this year or going into 2018 there is some speculation…? I would say maybe I mean we are doing our best to articulate what we think is likely to happen. And there maybe is interwoven in this conversation around advanced computes as the components of this value proposition in AI and data economy and it serves in the purpose to have a great cloud with great storage and great memory without great competition. So, if the value proposition accelerates, then I think it is an industry-wide opportunity. But in the context of the pilot line timings that we understand with our customers for 5 nanometer, the investments in 7 nanometer and 10 nanometer plans, the outlook that we have described is the best we have to offer right now. I see, okay, great. I think that’s all I have. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Yes, two follow-ups. You mentioned your revenue for the second half of the current year is more balanced with the first half and we have the revenues for the first half, does that suggest that we should assume a quarterly revenue that has provided you the free handle for the September and December quarter? Yes. Mehdi necessarily relative balance could be plus or minus 51.9 something like that, it’s – and I have given you guidance for every quarter through the rest of the year right now. Alright, okay. Martin described shipments low-50s, high-40s half-on-half, my comment was revenue would be a little bit more balanced in comparing that. Sure. In terms of the guidance, I wanted to go back to some of your commentary from the Analyst Day and obviously we have been debating sustainability of the memory spend since your shipment hit the $1 billion target and now we are at the $3 billion and sustainability of memory spend keeps coming up, in the mean time revenues are actually diversifying you have recently started to highlight the services mix and especially with the new tools for non-customers is the higher services content and if you really believe in a new paradigm shift why can’t you help us to better model and kind of shift away from these seasonality where if I take your shipment for the March quarter and analyze it, that would suggest shipment up, well over 20% for the year and perhaps maybe some additional color on the revenue mix could better help us and move away from this seasonality that is being just lingering? I am not sure exactly what you are referring to the seasonality, but I mean at the end of the day shipments and revenue mix will be exactly the same, one is timing shipments sometimes happen sooner than revenues. So at the end of the day, it all normalizes to the same thing which is why we give you the shipment probably the way we do. If I can add just one more thing, I would say if I mean for anybody on the call at any point in time listening to Lam Research, if you have recommendations on specific disclosure that you think would be helpful if we feel like we can do it in the context of respecting our customers and if we can do it in the context of preserving competitive advantage, we have every motivation to do that. So, we are doing the best we can to articulate an outlook in an opportunity and risk and so on and so forth. And if you have specific recommendations, please make the most line and we will do the best we can. Does your shipment represent services and parts or is it just a system? When I gave you the color on the percentages every quarter, Mehdi, I specifically say system shipment, so it’s system. Right. If you are going to realize the $1 billion of incremental revenue from services that won’t be captured by shipment and that’s what could become the difference looking forward? Potentially, yes, Mehdi. Alright. Just I think the suggestion with the customer with the guide? We will consider. We will think about how we can give you better understanding on what’s going on the services which I think at the end of the day is what you are asking for right. Yes. Alright. We will think about it offline if you want to share with us what would be helpful too. That would help us think about it. Thanks. Thanks, Mehdi. Thank you. Our next question comes from Atif Malik with Citigroup. Yes, hi, thanks for taking my question. Just want to go back to the shipment mix and you made point of expectations on the timing of the projects, can you share with us if there is one end-market that’s responsible for this $40 million shortfall, is it more foundry or is it more NAND? Atif, as you can appreciate, we have a very small set of customers and we are giving more color than just timing of certain projects – with certain customer projects is probably the best we can do for you. Okay. And then as a follow-up just broadly speaking can you share with us your expectations on the timing off the 92, 96 layer 3D NAND for the industry versus the 64-layer NAND migration, when should we expect the majority of the NAND makers moving to 92, 96 layer NAND? Thank you. I think the best we can do is refer you back to the flash memory summit presentation we made last year, which to the best of my recollection details all of our assumptions in terms of phases of development for NAND flash and rather be selective to ones and risking being inconsistent with that, I’d ask you to kind of go back to that disclosure. And if there is the remaining question then, please follow-up with Satya. Thanks, Atif. Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel. Thank you very much. Mart, maybe first off in terms of foundry logic commentary you detailed, given a lot of the noise out there surrounding EUV, can you detail from a Lam perspective – what applications and what new areas do you see etch and deposition that are helping you grow that serve the available market in spite of I guess some of the air concerns about EUV reducing the capital intensity of those two processes? Well, I guess, at the very basic level we have attempted for the last several years to articulate a set of assumptions, which I think are generally consistent with the assumptions that our customers communicate and the assumptions that ASML would communicate around adoption of EUV and using those assumptions we have attempted to communicate this through the 5-nanometer transition, our SAM increases in etch and deposition. So, I would say the first part of answering the question is we have articulated to the best of our ability increasing SAM through 5-nanometer and we will see what integration scheme show up a 3 before answering that question. In addition to that, the company is making a very specific set of investments and you have seen one of them quite publicly or maybe two of them quite publicly, but I will pick one of them now and that’s the world of advanced equipment process control. So we have articulated incremental SAM that we are targeting for the purposes of delivering more control and process and more a repeatability or uniformity so on and so forth. And that is directly relevant to foundry and microprocessor opportunity for the company as well and I am not going to go into details, but we have 3 or 4 pretty significant SAM expansion objectives above and beyond the inflections we have been talking about for the last several years and that’s all obviously incorporated in the long-term financial models that we presented a few weeks ago. Alright. Thanks for asking that. And Doug, as a follow-up, I know you probably won’t say that visibility has significantly increased, but just based on customer projects and timing of them, it seems like your equipment industry as a whole is getting much better visibility than they have ever gotten. Your balance sheet metrics in the procurement and everything you have done seems to be reacting very well. What changes have you made that has allowed you to adjust to I guess maybe increase visibility as well as the higher demand levels? I mean all the technology inflections you have seen happened over the last several years, Patrick that required our customers to have very advanced conversations those are well in advance of when they need certain capability, because we need to develop the equipment quite honestly. So, I don’t think that’s new. It’s been happening over the last several years and it’s enabled us to plan our company to be able to support where we are at today. So, the conversation is very deep and rich when you are enabling the customer’s roadmap in the way that we are. Right, thank you. Thanks, Patrick. Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Ellis with B. Riley FBR. Thanks for taking the question. I appreciate all the color on the call so far, guys. I just wanted to ask a question to get some longer term context around the full year shipment commentary. I think if I look back over the last 2 years there have been years when we have looked for a half-on-half profile that would be down in the second half and yet the year played out and it wound up being up. So as you look at the risks on both sides, can you just recap the upside risk to that shipment outlook as well as the downside risk? Thank you. I guess, I am not sure it’s bigger. I mean at the end of the day, if you believe the statements that we are making around discipline and demand led investments, then the kind of known commodities at this point in time relates to the capital intensity of any one technology node or any one kind of device architecture. So, I don’t think there is kind of too many risks or opportunities relative to people’s understanding of kind of cost consequence of a DRAM or a 3D NAND transition. Individual customer plans in a short-term can create artificial kind of disruption I would say in terms of WFE. In the long-term, I don’t think it’s all, because if one customer decreases and other one likely increases, if one increases and other one slightly decreases, so you kind of see kind of customer risks and opportunities. And if your window of focus is a quarter, then that will be disruptive to you if your window of focus is the year, it’s irrelevant, because it’s a dynamic kind of marketplace. I do think – and I would extend the customer conversation into a regional conversation, something like China. Right, I mean, I think our hypothesis still remains that with any of the regions of the world, including China that the investment will be demand based and rationale. So, I do think where there is still a significant amount of variability in plans is kind of how people choose to go execute and you can change the WFE investment profile quite materially through the choices you make around new capacity additions versus plaintiff to 3D transitions versus 3D transition scaling versus that maybe modifying a DRAM line to flash line or vice-versa. So – yes and even some of these strategies and that will sound maybe quite transactional, but it can have a fairly significant impact. So, we do our best to try and get a dialogue with customers to understand where they are going to head. I would say the simplest headline to your answer is if demand is stronger or weaker, it has – for ICs associated with these AI transitions and value propositions of the data economy, whether you will see it in the calendar year was debatable, but you will see it over a couple of year period in a positive or negative direction. And the rest of it I think is more operational execution as customers try to optimize their fabs, their line layouts and they try to optimize their use of cash. That’s helpful. Thanks, Martin. And that concludes today’s question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks. Yes, that’s all the time we have for the call today. Thank you for joining us. That does conclude today’s presentation.

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Odette Go, Treasurer for Lam Research. Please go ahead, ma'am. Thank you. Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the Lam Research quarterly earnings conference call. With me today are Martin Anstice, Chief Executive Officer, and Doug Bettinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
During today's call, we will share our outlook on the business environment, review our financial results for the June 2018 quarter, and our outlook for the September 2018 quarter. The press release detailing our financial results was distributed a little after 1:00 PM Pacific Time this afternoon. It can be also found on the Investor Relations section of the company's website along with the presentation slides that accompany today's call.
Today's presentation and Q&A includes forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the Risk Factor disclosures of our SEC public filings. Please see accompanying slides in the presentation for additional information.
Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release. This call is scheduled to last until 3:00 PM Pacific Time. And as always, we ask that you limit your questions to one per firm with a brief follow-up so we can accommodate as many questions as possible. As a reminder, the replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website.
With that, let me hand the call over to Martin. Good afternoon. I've firmly established that Lam is the priority of contributing to the success of our customers through the increased strategic relevance of our product and services portfolio. Ultimately, this focus is measured by our financial performance and the June quarter financial results were outstanding. Worthy of note, we achieved the milestone of revenues exceeding $3 billion and non-GAAP operating income of approximately $1 billion.
Short-term performance is not simply our goal, however. We have delivered and we aspire to continue to reward our stakeholders with multi-year industry outperformance measured by competing for and winning a greater proportion of our customers' investments; greater in quantity and greater in quality through the degree of codependency and annuity.
In this context, we also concluded the strongest fiscal year in our history by delivering approximately $11 billion in revenues, representing growth of almost 40%, $3.4 billion in non-GAAP operating income, and $2.7 billion in cash from operations.
At this point of our journey, I would like to thank our customers, our employees, and our partners for their active support and confidence in the company. Our intense focus on technology and productivity leadership, operational execution, and a genuine model of collaboration, we believe, are together the essential foundations for an exciting long-term future.
Well-published at this point, customer equipment investment spending has softened near term as industry participants continue to strive for discipline and sustainability in their businesses. While it is true to say that the short-term headlines reflect themselves in lower calendar Q3 guidance than we were anticipating earlier, we consider the change a strong, positive long-term influence.
We offer the following perspectives. While not true for every customer, the segments of memory and foundry have both seen, although for different reasons, some reduction in equipment's demand short-term, but the largest single adjustments occurred in DRAM.
We now plan overall 2018 WFE up year-over-year in the single-digit range. We expect the September quarter to be the low point of our calendar year. We remain optimistic about our mid-term and long-term opportunity and continue to target Lam's outperformance this year and long-term.
With the comprehensiveness of our disclosure earlier this year in our Investor and Analyst Meeting combined with the abundance of disclosure from other industry participants on the increasing role of silicon, the increasing role of data, and the acceleration of innovation in the cognitive computing environment, there's not so much more to add currently.
Bottom line, our customers have inspirational ambition and we exist to support them. Arguably, there's not been a more exciting time in our industry in decades and the intensity of focus at Lam to mitigate risks and maximize strategic opportunities combined, we believe, to create a compelling editorial.
While it is true to say that our customers have never invested more absolute dollars in their future, with the recent device ASP trends, they are investing a lower proportion of their annual profits and in any point of the last 15 years. That is the new industry and new value proposition headline that we have cited on several occasions now.
We noted last quarter that we expected low double-digit WFE growth in 2018 and a first half, second half shipments allocation in the low 50s, high 40s, with revenues a little more balanced. We now expect single-digit WFE growth, with the adjustments reflecting themselves primarily in the September quarter. Having previously anticipated a first half, second half reduction in memory WFE of between 20% and 25%, we now expect a larger reduction, with the long-term demands trends intact.
To fully understand our September business volume trajectory, the following headlines that underpin our belief in the extraordinary value proposition of memory strength long-term are important. We have the confidence in the long-term value and opportunity because memory and storage is increasingly prominent in the computer and systems integration roadmaps of the industry with fundamental and broadening demand drivers.
Analytically, that reflects itself in the trailing seven-year cumulative growth rate for memory WFE, which is approximately 10 times greater than the equivalent logic foundry CAGR.
Similarly, since 2013, memory WFE as a percentage of total WFE has trended from 40% to 60%, with the corresponding etch and deposition memory markets growing faster and to a higher level. This is our SAM expansion commentary. Considering these data points and the approximate 25% contribution from our installed base business, our September quarter guidance should be quite intuitive.
Turning to some of the business headlines of the company this quarter. There should now be a greater awareness to the earnings quality delivered from our installed base business, the so-called annuity of Lam, and that is where I would like to concentrate my prepared remarks here today.
You will remember our objective to create value for customers through productivity solutions and the development of advanced services to facilitate improved value capture for Lam and growth at a pace faster than the growth of our installed base units.
Our installed base business has grown more than 2 times faster than our installed base unit growth this year, with our worldwide process chamber counts now approximately 55,000 units.
In a world where our customers' focus appropriately seeks optimal asset utilization, our reliance in reuse business recorded first half 2018 growth of approximately 50% year-over-year. This is a commentary on the broadening of our product offerings and the demand for more than more IoT and MEMS silicon capacity. As a reminder, our SAM expansion focus has three foundations today: first, fully realizing the opportunities of multi-patterning and 3D device scaling over multiple years.
Second, broadening our systems applications, and films capabilities where there is opportunity and unmet customer need, and third, increasing value creation from advanced productivity services.
On this last point, the portfolio is now quite comprehensive and harnesses the technologies of big data that we helped create. Customer engagements are now extensive, ranging from demo and evaluation to fab wide adoption. We are pleased with our progress and excited by the opportunity to increase customer value to codependency, at the same time increasing the quality of Lam Research earnings.
For the systems businesses of etch and deposition, our investments in SAM expansion, market share defense and penetration, and disruptive technologies continues at pace and we're pleased with the comprehensiveness and the complements of our technology and product roadmaps to the expectations of customers and the competitive dynamic.
In closing, this is a year characterized by the following. First, the increased prominence of silicon and in turn, the equipment industry in the creation of value for the global economy. Two, rational, disciplined spending by our customers at the highest level in history, supported by the highest revenues in profits in their industry. Three, unmatched outperformance opportunity, we believe, for Lam.
To emphasize a few key points. September P&L guidance for Lam is impacted by four things: first, the relative strength of memory and the strength of Lam in memory; second, the actions by some customers in recent weeks to adjust their short-term investment plans; and third, the implementation of new revenue recognition rules and the specifics of customer delivery and acceptance dates leading up to the new accounting policy adoption; and fourth, the variability of our operating expense cost structure without compromising our long-term focus.
Current knowledge indicates September will be the low points of our year and more importantly, the long-term trends of our industry and company, we believe, are as compelling as ever. On this last point, we look forward to sharing more of our long-term opportunities at the August 7 Flash Memory Summit conference where Rick Gottscho, our CTO, Doug, and myself will be hosting a reception.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Doug. Great. Thank you, Martin. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today on what I know is a very busy earnings day.
The June quarter results represented a solid conclusion to the 2018 fiscal year. For the quarter, we exceeded the midpoint of our guidance for all financial metrics. For the fiscal year, we delivered record levels of shipments, revenues, cash from operations, gross margin dollars, operating income dollars as well as earnings per share. We're obviously very pleased with what we achieved this quarter and this fiscal year.
Shipments for the quarter were again at the $3 billion mark at $3.028 billion, which was slightly above the midpoint of our guidance. For fiscal year 2018, shipments were $11.176 billion, which was a 30% increase compared to fiscal year 2017. Memory shipments continued to be strong in June, with the combined memory segment making up 80% of total system shipments.
Our overall non-volatile memory shipments remain strong, representing approximately 55% of the system shipments compared to 57% last quarter. DRAM shipments represented 25% of system shipments, down from 27% in the prior quarter. The foundry segment was up, accounting for 13% of system shipments relative to 10% in March. And finally, the logic and other segment contributed 7% of system shipments, just a little bit above the prior quarter's 6%.
We delivered record revenues of $3.126 billion in the June quarter, an increase of 8% from March and again slightly above the midpoint of guidance. For the fiscal year, revenues came in at $11.077 billion, which was an increase of 38% from fiscal year 2017. Our installed base business contributed approximately 25% of our revenues in the fiscal year.
Gross margin for the June quarter came in at 48%, which was up 120 basis points sequentially and the highest level in over a decade. As we shared before, our actual gross margins are a function of several factors such as business volumes, product mix, and customer concentration and you should expect to see variability quarter to quarter.
Operating expenses in the quarter grew to $507 million, but decreased 60 basis points on a sequential basis to 16.2% of revenues. On a dollar basis, R&D spending grew while SG&A spending slightly declined as compared with the March quarter. R&D comprised nearly 65% of our total spending. We continue to believe that disciplined R&D investments will increase our likelihood of achieving our future revenue growth objectives.
Operating income in the June quarter came in at a record level of $994 million, up about 15% from the prior quarter. Operating margin came in close to the high end of guidance at 31.8% primarily due to the stronger gross margin performance.
The non-GAAP tax rate for the June quarter was 6.7%, in line with the guidance we provided at the beginning of the quarter. We expect the tax rate in the low to middle teens for the remainder of calendar year 2018. In the longer run, a tax rate in the middle teens remains the right level to include in your modeling and there will be fluctuations around this quarter to quarter.
Based on a share count of approximately 175 million shares, earnings per share for the June quarter came in at $5.31, above the high end of our guided range. Primary drivers of the upside versus our guidance was the improved profitability and a little bit lower share count.
The share count includes dilution from the 2018 warrants and 2041 convertible notes, with the total dilutive impact being about 13 million shares on a non-GAAP basis. In the June quarter, our 2018 convertible note, which had a remaining balance of $172 million, matured and was settled in cash and stock. But dilution schedules for the remaining 2041 convertible notes is available on our Investor Relations website for your reference.
For the June quarter, we had $6 million in early conversions for the 2041 notes. The remaining balance of the 2041 notes is $327 million and I do expect we will continue to see requests for early redemptions.
In the June quarter, we spent $1.3 billion on share repurchases. With that, we have completed almost 60% of the current $4 billion authorization and we repurchased approximately 12 million shares. We're planning to complete the remainder of the authorization over the next nine months in tandem with the expected timing of our cash repatriation. During the quarter, we be paid roughly $80 million in dividends and we also declared a quarterly dividend of $1.10 per share that will be paid in the September quarter.
Let me now turn to the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments including our restricted cash decreased in the quarter to $5.2 billion compared with $6.7 billion at the end of the March quarter, largely due to our capital return activities as well as debt repayment. In addition to retiring the 2018 convert, we also paid down approximately $640 million of commercial paper. Approximately 80% of the total $5.2 billion cash balance was offshore at the end of the quarter. Cash from operations for the June quarter was approximately $718 million, which was down slightly from over $1 billion in the March quarter.
DSO decreased by three days to 63 days. Inventory turns came in at 3.5 times compared to 3.7 times in the prior quarter. And for the fiscal year, the company has generated $2.7 billion in cash from operations. Company noncash expenses included approximately $47 million for equity comp, $40 million for amortization, and $45 million for depreciation. Capital expenditures were $80 million, which is up from $49 million in the March quarter. And as a reminder, we expect CapEx in 2018 to be higher compared to 2017 to support manufacturing network expansion and growth in our strategic R&D programs.
We exited the quarter with approximately 10,900 regular full-time employees. And as we previously noted, we are adopting ASC 606, the new revenue recognition standard effective in fiscal 2019 which for Lam begins in the September quarter. Under ASC 606, we generally will record revenue at the time of shipment rather than at the time of customer acceptance. Under our prior accounting methodology for more than a decade, our results have shown revenue recognition lag in shipments. However, with this new accounting change, a change in shipments will essentially be equivalent to the change in revenues and adjustments in customer spending activity will have a quicker impact on our revenues and profits generally within the same quarter.
Because revenues will become more closely correlated to shipments, shipments will cease to have value as a leading indicator. As a result, we have decided to discontinue reporting shipments. With the implementation of the new revenue recognition policy coinciding with some of our customers trimming their near term investment plans, most notably in NAND, you will see the impacts right away in our next quarter's results.
Looking ahead, I'd like to provide a non-GAAP guidance for the September quarter. We are expecting revenues of $2.3 billion, plus or minus $150 million. We're expecting a meaningful downtick in memory spending in the September quarter.
Gross margin of 46%, plus or minus 1 percentage point; operating margins of 26%, plus or minus 1 percentage point; and finally, earnings per share of $3.20, plus or minus $0.20 based on a share count of approximately 163 million shares.
As we sit here today, we believe the September quarter marks a near-term trough for our business. Ticking back on our messaging at our March Analyst Day, we remain very optimistic on our longer term growth prospects. We continue to believe that we have competitively differentiated products and disciplined investments that will continue to drive Lam's outperformance into the future.
That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, Martin and I would now like to open up the call for questions. Thank you. And we'll take our first question from C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess a two-part question in one. Can you speak to how you're expecting the ramp of the recovery and into December? And then I guess more importantly, given this extremely rational behavior by your memory customers, how does that, I guess, make you think about the health of this industry overall and also the impact for your vision for WFE into 2019 all things equal? Thank you. Obviously, the first part of the question, C.J., we're not going to guide December specifically in this meeting. But as Doug and I both said in our prepared comments, we do expect September to be the low point and we'll be on a positive trajectory in December. And we'll report, I guess, at that time the magnitude of it but we would not have commented if we didn't think it was material.
On the second point, I mean, it's a terrific commentary on the maturity of the industry. That the corrections happened at the pace they do and I mean, this is a pretty amazing industry at this point. If you look at kind of memory companies, their revenues are up. I think they're going to be up maybe 25% this year. After they were up 60% last year, which is a $100 billion DRAM business probably this year and the profitability levels of memory companies today are trending 40% to 50% operating income.
So there's some really nice headlines in terms of discipline and some really nice headlines in terms of profitability and sustainability and their business is a different business today. And if you kind of – if you went even higher than the memory statements and opines on the semiconductor industry holistically, in the five years 2014 to 2018 inclusive, semiconductor revenues are up by about $125 billion, if you believe in that $450 billion or a $460 billion revenue for calendar 2018. In that same timeframe, there has been an increase in wafer fabrication equipment investments by probably $18 billion in the low to the high end of that period. That means the incremental capital intensity of that 15%, I mean, that is an incredible level of efficiency of spending and a great commentary, I think, on sustainability in light of probably the most exciting set of demand drivers and the most diverse set of demand drivers we've had in a decade. Great. Thanks, C.J. Next question, please. And next, we'll go to Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Thank you very much. I had two. I guess first thing, Doug. I wanted to ask what the guidance would have been net of ASC 606. Yeah. I'm not going to give you a specific number, Tim, but I will tell you at the end of every quarter and the 10-Q, you'll see for the next year old way and new way. I'm not going to get into guiding it because lots can change around it and I'm going to just stick to the current accounting rules. But you will be able to see it at the end of every quarter, Tim. Okay, awesome. Thanks. And then Martin, you made a comment when you were talking about service that it's up 50% year-over-year. Was that just a particular piece of the service business? Or were you talking about service as a whole? I kind of attempted to deliver two messages on the installed base business. The first one is the growth of the entire installed base business which is spares and service and upgrades and training and the reliance in reuse business and that was the 2 times faster in the six months of this year than the pace of growth of the installed base units.
The second reference, which is the 50% reference you just spoke to, related to our reliance and reuse business. So I was focusing on one segment for reasons that hopefully are quite obvious. Tim, as I was thinking about, maybe just a little color on the rev rec thing so we don't continue to get questions on it. I mean, guys, think about it in the right way. At the end of the day, this is just all timing, right? Shipments always turn into revenue, they never don't. That always happens. And so, holistically thinking about this change, it's meaningless at the end of the day. It's purely timing. It has no impact on cash flow. It has no impact on how we manage or think about the business and in the long-term, it really doesn't matter. And I guess, Doug, just to that point, so the shipments basically would have been about 2.3. That's kind of how to think of it, right? What I said was revenue and shipments are going to be much more closely correlated and we're going to stop guiding shipments as a result because it's not as useful as a leading indicator as it used to be. So we're not going to be talking about shipments anymore, Tim. Okay. Awesome. Thanks so much. Thanks, Tim. And next, we'll go to Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I'm just wondering if you could comment on the breadth of the spending base as you look into the second half. Memory companies are driving 60% gross margins and 50% operating margin profitability so very strong. Logic and foundry guys also strong profitably levels so I guess profitably is a proxy for the health of the fundamental environment. So there's really no red flags which would cause your customer base to downshift on your tech migration and capacity plans. So it seems like what you're seeing in the September quarter is more of a project shift, seems to be more maybe customer-specific and maybe limited to one or two customers. Is that kind of the right way to think about it? It's definitely not all customers. I mean, there are some pretty kind of selective adjustments. It's a combination of a push from September to December and a combination of some movement from the second half of this year to the first half of next year.
But I mean, everything embedded in your question, Harlan, I think we would endorse. I mean, there is a fundamental commentary of health measured by profitability and growth of the semiconductor industry as it has completely redefined it's kind of purpose and value proposition in this broader kind of data economy and ecosystem. And the long-term drivers are quite compelling. So individual companies make individual corrections. That will always be the case, and you've seen some come together in ways you haven't seen that in the past so it's a good thing, pretty short-term. We expect September to be our low point. Great. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks, Harlan. And our next question comes from Krish Shankar with Cowen. Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I had two of them. First one was on – thanks for the clarity on the December guidance or I should say September being the downtick. Is there a way to quantify what is driving the recovery in December? Is it DRAM, NAND or is it both of them? Well, I mean, the interesting thing about the world we live in now, the value proposition that's available in the world of technology requires connectivity, it requires cloud memory and storage, and it requires computes. So there's always going to be some kind of ebbs and flows between one segment and another. But the value proposition requires investments in all.
And I think that's the fundamental headline that people should internalize. And what we've tried to do is supplement that headline with the commentary on the importance of memory in that ecosystem and the role that memory plays as an embedded component of systems and even eventually in the world of computes.
And I gave some statistics today that I'm not sure fully internalized but the CAGR of memory investment compared to the CAGR of logic and foundry investment has no comparison almost in the last five to seven years. And that's the strength of our company in many respects. So that's why we speak to unmatched opportunity because we think it's a very balanced investment and the strength of our company from a product portfolio point of view and a segments exposure creates something that's unmatched. Got you, got you. That's very helpful and if I could just have a follow-up for Doug. On the September quarter, is there a way you can give some color on the segment mix between DRAM, NAND, and foundry? And also historically, your services has been roughly, say, 25% of revenues. How much do you think it's going to be as a percentage of total revenues in the September quarter? Thank you. Yes. Krish, I'm not going to give you the exact percentage except to say that when business ticks down a little bit, the installed base really doesn't. And so it's probably going to be a little bit higher in the September quarter but I'm not going to quantify it for you. And then relative to the -- what's going on in September by segment, we don't typically get into the detail. We do that backward-looking but not necessarily forward-looking. But what you heard both Martin and I say is relative softness in memory, so you could assume there's probably some stuff going on there. Okay. Thanks, Doug. Thanks, Martin. Yeah. Thanks, Krish. And next, from Goldman Sachs, we'll hear from Toshiya Hari. Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. Martin, you talked about 2018 WFE being up in kind of the single-digit range. As a housekeeping question, what are your updated expectations for DRAM, NAND, logic and foundry, respectively? As a housekeeping response, we didn't disclose that before and I'm not going to kind of increment the disclosure today. Obviously, I think common knowledge at this point, the memory bias is first half, and the logic foundry is much closer to flattish, right? So you've got that as a kind of broad reference on WFE and that's where I would sit responding to the question, specifically. Maybe I could kind of provide some quality to statements as well that are helpful in response to the question.
The adjustments we've seen from customers in DRAM, I would say, have avoided overinvestments. That's a nice, simple way to kind of characterize it and we still believe from the analytics that we can form, it's still a tight marketplace. In NAND flash, the pace of the adjustments that we have seen have been moderating. They've been slowing, hence, the commentary that we're giving today around September and then expansion of the company again in December. Great. And then as a follow-up, just wanted again an update on what you're seeing in China. Obviously, the political landscape is unstable, to say the least. Don't know if that really impacts what your customers do in China but I'm just curious, your outlook on CapEx in China both for the back half of this year and more importantly, longer term, if that's changed at all. Yeah. I don't have the crystal ball, obviously, to kind of opine on the political dynamic and how various elements of this conversation play out. But our assumption today around the execution of our plans is the same as it always has been. We see legitimacy in the ambition and we see investments in capacity in China that are synchronized to the demand for units out of fabs and I would make that statement on a global basis and I would make it in regards to China as well.
Obviously, tariff-based conversations can and do impact the operations of companies like Lam and so left unattended, tariffs create incremental cost structures for us and we make the impact immaterial by modifying kind of our supply chain. We have to take actions to mitigate that risk and there's no material exposure embedded in our forecast for tariffs.
Relative to long-term China, if the environment of export control it is what it is today, the plans of customers will execute. If it changes, then we have to kind of revisit the assumptions at that point in time. We don't see evidence today of planned changes, so nothing to report. But I would say we're attentive to the very same things that you are and we can control only so much of this conversation. So – and we'll be on the same boat as everybody else if and when things change, I guess. Yeah. Thanks for the color. Yeah. Our next question will come from John Pitzer at Credit Suisse. Hey, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Martin, if you kind of look at your growth over the last several years, there's been multiple components to it, but market share gain has been a meaningful driver of your growth profile. I'm just kind of curious as you look towards the 9x layer NAND and then 1y, 1x, 1z in DRAM, how are you thinking about your share potential from here? It is kind of a shorter term message and a long-term message. The shorter one is we are in for a busy second half because the decisions of the second half, have a – I think a three times greater in the impact than the ones at the first half. So, the second half is a busy period for the company.
The objective of the company, I hope, is well understood. We are investing to increase our relevance to the success of the customers and gain market share in etch and deposition, in memory, and in logic foundry. And we've put together multiple years' worth of momentum that we intend to build upon. We don't win everything, we don't defend everything, but we've demonstrated over a multiple years that we win more than we don't and that's the objective kind of going forward.
The best reference still is the long-term models that we gave, that's the call out market share references. And the last thing I would say is when you think about the holistic growth opportunities of Lam, let's remember market share is $1 billion component of a $3 billion reference. So we're seeking $1 billion of SAM expansion, we're seeking $1 billion of growth from market share and we're seeking $1 billion of growth in the space of the installed base business of the company. So it's kind of one element of three and all are very important and all are being invested in. That's helpful, Martin. And then as you think about kind of the recovery into the December quarter, obviously, if your memory customers are more profitable of recovery becomes easier and so there is clearly a price element embedded in the recovery. But I'm just kind of curious to what extent could it be somewhat ASP independent on the memory side? It's just the timing of when these technology transitions your customers are working on begin to inflect again. Yes. I mean, I think the profitability levels and the revenue levels, it eliminates the limitations on investments, but I don't think profitability levels on their own drive investment. I think demand for chips and elasticity of demand from pricing and attachment rates drive demand for investment. So I think profits have taken off the table the limitations, but certain points in our history have limited investment so there's much more flexibility for our customers today than ever before. But I think our customers hold themselves accountable to investing capacity when they have chips to sell. And that's a great commentary on health of an industry. Helpful. Thank you, guys. Thank you. Thanks, John. And next, we have Atif Malik with Citi. Thank you for taking my question. Martin, historically, when we have seen a weakness over your memory customers, they have all happened at the same time or maybe one after another. What's different this time? I mean, you talked about not all customers are changing their plans and why should we believe others won't follow the leaders? Well, I've tried to articulate again not just in memory, but broadly in the industry, how I think the industry is different today than it was through kind of 10 years ago. And one of the differences is that I see very significant customers in leadership positions with very clear segment and market focus that has some differences with very clear strategies and very clear opportunities and risks and limitations on strategies.
And our customers, and I'll use 3D NAND as a great example, there was a -- I think a four-year separation between the first adopter on 3D NAND technology to the last of the four. And that's illustrative of how their strategies are quite unique. And that's not a good or bad. It's just a statement of uniqueness optimized in their minds to the opportunities in the marketplace to be successful growing a business. So I think customers -- they are all attempting to pursue the right ambition, which is profitable market share, not just market share, and we have the same aspiration. But there is, for sure, a uniqueness of a device targeting in the marketplace, market segmentation. There's also uniqueness of clean room capacity, there is also uniqueness of investment coming online from a timing point of view. And there's uniqueness in terms of the installed base roadmaps of these companies. And so, all of that means, I believe, that the power of the customer is greater than the power of the segment when it comes to analyzing the direction of the industry. Great. And Doug, fairly aggressive share repurchase here, 60% through. Is there any consideration of annuity purchase program? At the end of the quarter, we were still only 60% on the way through. We need to get a little closer to the end before we'd start thinking about what's next after. But the framework, again, is pretty simple for answering that question, right? I mean, the priority is investing the profitable growth of the company and when we have cash that is excess to that need, return it to our shareholders. And we've operated with that philosophy for probably at least a decade, maybe more. And it's the guidance under any conditions going forward. Yeah. We're obviously going to continue the program. We talked about that. I'll remind you the Analyst Day commentary about 50% of cash, but still how we're thinking about the framework. Thanks, Atif. Then our next question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Thanks for taking my question. If you go back to June quarter, when did you start seeing the weakness in orders or shipments? I guess it's more orders than shipments, and so shipment for the June quarter was above expectation. I'm just trying to reconcile the timing because your other competitors in the equipment space seems to be seeing that a little earlier than you did. I think you got two problems with the question and the answer I could give you. The first problem is none of us have any idea of the assumptions and the original disclosure of the companies that you're talking about, and so any reference is kind of hard to interpret. I'm not going to get into specifics on dates, but the changes are fairly recent. Okay. Maybe a follow-up question is that related to ASC 606, I know you talked about the product side. But is there any impact on your service revenue as well? There are some multi-year service contracts and others like that? No. To a much lesser extent, service looks very similar; old rules, new rules. Okay. Thanks. Thanks, Sidney. And next, we'll hear from Patrick Ho with Stifel, Nicolaus. Thank you very much. Most of my questions have been answered, so just one question for you, Doug. In terms of the installed base business that continues to grow for you guys, you've always talked about how it's very accretive to your operating margins. As that business grows, how do you balance the investments needed to continue to grow that business and I guess streamline those operations to have it continue to drop the bottom line? Yeah. I don't think I've ever said, Patrick. It's really accretive. It's maybe a little bit up the operating income line but it's not wildly different. And some of the things we're doing to try to drive growth in that business are the advanced services you hear us talk about, setting objectives around growing faster than the installed base, driving new programs to help solve some of the problems customers have inside of the fab in unique ways that we know how to do given our familiarity with our own equipment. Yeah. And from an investment point of view, I mean, I wouldn't characterize that we run the installed base part of the company any differently than we do the systems piece. I mean, we do our best to anticipate and identify opportunities and risks. We do our best to invest timely and proactively to be successful, and we do our best to make sure that when there are changes in business levels, the cost structure of the company in the short-term is appropriately responsive without kind of compromising that long-term view. And so it's the same gig for every business unit and every element of the portfolio of the company. Thank you. Thanks, Patrick. And our next question is from Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson. Yes, good afternoon. To getting back to the memory side of the business, curious if there was any difference in your view of the bit growth for either the NAND or the DRAM market. Not really. And no difference, frankly, from the view that's opined by most of the market participants. I mean, we've got an assumption of the low 20s for bit supply in DRAM and we've got an assumption of the low 40s for NAND. So I think that's kind of genuinely consistent with what folks are talking about.
From a transition point of view, maybe a little bit more to help you out. I mean, our assumption is that the kind of 1x, 1y investment levels in DRAM will represent somewhere around the 50% level, plus or minus kind of 5 points or 10 points by the end of the calendar year. And we're assuming by the end of the calendar year that the 3D capable parts of the NAND installed base is a little over the 1 million wafer stat per month level. And obviously, it exists in various forms. So 3D isn't all Generation 4 or Generation 5. It's the full portfolio but we're well on the way to making that the primary output technology of non-volatile memory. Okay, great. And then Doug, when you look at the margin in your guidance still remains fairly healthy, are there any one-time or mix benefits in the quarter or are those expected margins based on the revenue? Nothing I'd specifically point to, Tom. And business goes up, it goes down a little bit. We do have fixed costs so that's probably a piece of what's going on. But there's also a product mix, a customer mix component. There's always a lot of things that move around quarter by quarter. And the best profitability metric for the company forward-looking is the long-term model again. Yes. That's right. Great. Thank you. Thanks, Tom. Yeah. And next, from RBC Capital Markets, we'll hear from Mitch Steves. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just had one in terms of kind of a modeling question if I look out for fiscal year 2019 essentially. Just your margins have improved both on the gross margin and operating margin front of the last several years. Is there any reason that shouldn't continue or how do we think about by and large the operating margin profile for the next year or so? Yes. Mitch, what I'd point you to is we put out in March an update to the long-term model, kind of looking at that, looking at revenue levels, looking at where we've been in recent history and correlating the two data points, I think, is the best guidance I can give you to answer the question. Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Thanks, Mitch. And next, we'll hear from Edwin Mok with Needham & Company. Great. Thanks for taking my question. So I actually have a question around foundry. If I look at the numbers, it's been down quite a bit in fiscal 2018 versus 2017. I think we have heard it from other people so I'm not surprised that it's down. But just curious in the context of the September guidance, it's down mostly or not all in memory. Do you actually expect your foundry revenue to continue to grow sequentially? Or how do you think about that in 3Q or in the calendar second half of the year? Well, I mean, from a marketplace point of view as I mentioned a few moments ago, there's much more stability at WFE and foundry logic combined first half and second half than is true in memory. And the specific purchasing decision timings for etch and deposition are, I think, kind of well understood at this point in time. They're a little later in the flow because of shorter lead times perhaps than the lithography investments at this point in time. And we have objectives to gain share obviously from 10 to 7 and in turn to 5.
And this year is largely a year of 7 nanometer build-outs and 5 pilots with, as you I think well understand, a pretty broad set of participation at the 28 nanometer level. And we don't have any new headlines today on the EUV. It's exactly the same as it was when we spoke in our Analyst Meeting. So it's a nice opportunity for the company, it continues to be a big focus and yeah, that's, I guess, the best I can share. Okay. Actually, that's very helpful. And then Doug, just on the guidance. If I – my background math tells me your OpEx is down around 10% on the September quarter. Is that all just from call it the leverage or the model or is there any call it programs that you might be delaying that may come back in December? We just wanted to understand how we think about that. What I'd tell you relative to R&D programs is nothing is delayed. Everything is going forward at the same pace that it always has been. We're not – if there's a near-term move around in the business, we're not messing around with any of that. I think I talked maybe a year or so ago about you are going to see more variability quarter-to-quarter in our spend modulated by profit levels.
Our variable compensation varies with the level of profit of the business. And so as profitably varies, spending varies along with it. And as we look at a softening in business for the quarter, we're very aggressively managing discretionary-type spending, things like travel and entertainment and whatnot just to be responsive to the level of the business. So it's a combination of all of those things. But I appreciate you asking the question and recognizing the efforts of the company that respond to balancing short-term and long-term because it's really hard to do. It takes a lot of time and effort to create the guidance that you've just spoken to. So thank you for recognizing it. No, thanks for answering my question. That's all I have. Yeah. And next, we'll take a question from Weston Twigg with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Hi. Yeah, thanks for taking my question. First, I just wanted to take a stab at -- C.J. at the beginning had asked your views on 2019 demand. And I don't need a number, but I'm just wondering at this point, do you think you could be -- see a similar level of overall with WFE next year? Or up or down, do you have a directional indication based on your conversations with customers? Yeah. I mean, I think there's a number of kind of industry participant statements in the marketplace today of equivalency are slightly up. I've seen being kind of the $100 billion references over a couple of years. And I don't have a basis to kind of disagree with those.
To more specifically speak to something of substance from Lam, I would say as well as having the expectation that December is higher than September, our expectation is that the first half of next year is a stronger half than the second half of this year. And the order of magnitude, we'll speak to over time.
But we feel really good about the health of the industry as I've tried to speak to. We feel kind of really good about the value propositions that our customers are seeking, the discipline throughout the ecosystem, and the opportunity for the company. And so while at some level it all feels like a pretty kind of negative moment in the history of our industry when we get these episodes, it's really good because it's a commentary on timeliness of response and discipline and health. And what should not get lost in this conversation is the fact that if you didn't believe us and you just thought that December EPS would be the same as the September EPS, we have growth in non-GAAP earnings of like 20% year-over-year.
And in most of the companies I've ever had an experience of working with, that's not such a bad number, right? So and adjustments exists in the context of some pretty nice growth for the industry and for the company and obviously, for our customers, that's even more true. So we feel pretty good. Okay. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, I think I heard you definitely say weakness in memory in Q3 or in September. But, Martin, I think I heard you say it was more of a DRAM shift. And then I thought I heard Doug say there was more trimming in NAND. And I was just wondering if you could clarify what's the bigger driver of the downtick in September and that helps us understand the rebound a little bit better, I think. Yeah. So I was kind of conscious of that potential risk as well as I listened to it. So what Doug was speaking to was kind of like the absolute kind of dollars comparison between the output of the company in the June quarter as compared to September and he's right to say the biggest change there is NAND. What I was speaking to was the prominence of the adjustments in the last kind of month or so. And DRAM was the biggest adjustments in the next month or so, so that's how you reconcile the two statements. Helpful. Thank you. Thank you much. Thanks, Wes. And there are no further questions in the queue. I'll turn the call back over to our speakers for closing comments. That concludes our call. Thank you very much, everyone, for joining, and have a good afternoon. That concludes today's conference call. We thank you for joining.",today's earnings conference call will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified . this call is scheduled to last until 3:00 PM Pacific Time . we will share our outlook on the business environment and review our financial results for the June 2018 quarter .,1.0

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Miss. Tina Correia, Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations and Communications. Please go ahead. Thank you and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to the Lam Research Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Martin Anstice, Chief Executive Officer; and Doug Bettinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
During today’s call, we will share our outlook on the business environment and review our financial results for the September 2018 quarter and our outlook for the December 2018 quarter. The press release detailing our financial results was distributed a little after 1’o clock p.m. Pacific Time this afternoon. It can be also found on the Investor Relations section of the company’s website along with the presentation slides that accompany today’s call. Today’s presentation and Q&A includes forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factors disclosures of our SEC public filings. Please see accompanying slides in the presentation for additional information.
Today’s discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in today’s earnings press release. This call is scheduled to last until 3’o clock p.m. Pacific Time. As a reminder, the replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website.
With that, let me hand the call over to Martin. Thank you, Tina, and thank you all for joining us today. Lam delivered results stronger than targeted for the September quarter with revenues gross margin and EPS all exceeding the midpoint of our guidance. In addition consistent with the commentary made during our last earnings call, we are forecasting the December quarter up sequentially and we would still characterize based on engagements with our customers in our markets and outlook for the first half of 2019 that is somewhat stronger than the second half of 2018.
In aggregate there has been more semiconductor capital investment volatility both upside and downside in 2017 and 2018 than in the recent prior years and that is only extenuated by broader macro headlines such as trade, tariffs and interest rates. Despite this context, we remain very excited by the long-term drivers for data economy enablement from the world of silicon and the complements of our products and services portfolio to the technology roadmap of the industry. In our opinion, next generation device and systems architectures, the expansion of the materials in chip design and manufacturing creates compelling opportunities for our strength in etch and deposition. We remain committed to invest and innovate for the success of our customers and our company.
As always the performance of Lam is defined by customer trust and employee commitments to our vision and values. We sincerely appreciate that partnership the opportunity created and the numerous contributions made. Since our July update, current year WFE expectations continue to track up slightly year-over-year although to a modestly reduced extent. At a segment level 2018, WFE looks a little stronger in logic, a little weaker in NAND and foundry to the assumptions we made three months back. With customer and Lam performance consistent with our December quarter revenue guidance provided today, calendar 2018 would represents a healthy revenue growth year of 14% for the company with profit performance marginally stronger versus the calendar year 2017 benchmark.
In deposition, we continue to see evidence of Lam’s growing strategic relevance to the success of our customers with key penetrations of new films for patterning, new specialty applications for 3D NAND and deeper partnership models emerging for 3D NAND applications. In etch perhaps our most critical area of focus in 3D NAND is the continued enablement of customers increasingly challenging technology roadmaps where we continue to strengthen our leading capabilities in high aspect ratio applications. Our solutions are invested in customers’ vision for continued 3D NAND scaling targeted to accelerate demand elasticity in their markets for the next several years. Combined etch and deposition market share penetration and defense activity is a net positive so far for Lam in calendar 2018.
Fundamental to the quality and sustainability of Lam earnings is the performance delivered by our Customer Support Business Group. Our installed base business has grown year-to-date at a pace more than two times faster than our installed base unit growth during the same period. Our worldwide process chamber counts now exceed 55,000 units compared to 36,000 units at the end of 2014 and this is the foundation for ongoing spares, service and upgrade revenues. We are increasingly focused on value creation for our customers through investments made in equipment intelligence products. We are providing performance enhancement in areas such as tool analytics, preventive maintenance and chamber matching to enhance productivity for our customers and create opportunity for Lam.
In addition driven by our customers aspirations of better asset utilization in addressing the non-leading edge and also the emergence of new IoT and MEMS silicon opportunities, our reliance business recorded calendar year-to-date growth of more than 35% versus the same period in 2017, a good illustration we believe of Lam’s ability to be flexible in addressing the full scope of our market opportunities. In closing, the September quarter and our outlook on December are largely as we shared with you last earnings call and should deliver more than $3 billion in cash from operations this year. We remain focused on investing in our profitable growth objectives at the same time delivering value through a balanced cash redistribution to shareholders.
In this regard incorporating December 2018 quarter guidance provided today, year-over-year operating expenses increased by 9% with 75% of that growth focused on R&D and our fully diluted quarterly share count reduces by approximately 10% end of year 2018 versus end of year 2017. We anticipate a healthy long-term opportunity for our customers and our company both with continued attention placed on strategies intended to deliver targeted returns on the investments that each market participant makes.
With that I’ll turn the call over to Doug. Great, thank you, Martin. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. Lam executed well in the September quarter with our results exceeding the midpoint of guidance for all of our financial metrics. Operating margin and earnings per share were at the high end of the guidance range provided demonstrating what I think is discipline in our spending during a decline in industry capital equipment investments. We’re pleased with our execution and ability to respond to the challenging business environment.
As a reminder to everybody, we adopted ASC 606 in the September quarter, which is the first quarter of our 2019 fiscal year. Under 606 we generally record revenue at the time of shipment rather than at the time of customer acceptance. With this new standard, we are no longer providing shipment numbers. Our market segment disclosures will be based on the composition of our revenue numbers for the quarter and we’ll do that now as well as into the future.
So let me get into that. Memory revenue continued to be strong with the combined memory segment making up 77% of total system revenue. Our overall non-volatile memory revenue remained strong representing approximately 51% of the system revenue and that’s despite the anticipated reduction of spending in nearly every one of our NAND customers. DRAM represented 26% of system revenue. DRAM spending in the quarter continued to be focused on conversions to both the 1x and 1y nanometer node.
The foundry segment was stronger in the quarter accounting for 17% of system revenue. And finally, the logic and other segment contributed 6% of system revenue, pretty much consistent throughout calendar 2018. We continue to see strength in the China region with 25% of our revenue being generated there. The strength in China came from both foundry as well as memory. Nearly two thirds of the revenue in September came from domestic Chinese customers. We delivered revenues of $2,331 million in the September quarter, a decrease of 25% from June and slightly above the midpoint of our guidance.
Gross margin for the quarter came in at 46.4%. And as we’ve shared before, our actual gross are a function of several factors, such as business volumes, product mix and customer concentration and you should expect to see variability quarter-to-quarter. Operating expenses in the quarter were down to $451 million, which was a decrease of $57 million from the June quarter. R&D comprised nearly two thirds of our total spending consistent with the composition of the June quarter operating expenses.
We continue to maintain a higher concentration of spending in R&D as we believe that discipline R&D investments are critical to achieving our future revenue growth. One thing I’d like to mention to help you with your future P&L modeling. When we get to the March quarter of next year, we will have an extra work week in our fiscal quarter. This occurs approximately every six years due to our fiscal calendar cutoff. March spending will be higher as a result of the extra work week. So, keep that in mind as you put your March models together please.
Operating income in the September quarter came in at $630 million. Operating margin came in at the top of the guidance range of 27% primarily due to stronger gross margin performance as well as flexibility in our spending in a quarter of lower business volumes. The non-GAAP tax rate for the September quarter was 11.9% in line with the guidance provided last quarter.
In the longer run, tax rate in the low- to middle-teens is a right level to include in your models. And I will point out that you will see fluctuations around this quarter-to-quarter. Based on share count, we’re approximately 165 million shares. Earnings per share for the September quarter were $3.36, again at the high end of a guided range. The primary driver of the upside versus our guidance was stronger profitability. The share count includes dilution from the 2041 convertible notes and the 2018 warrants that are still outstanding.
The total dilutive impact for each – for both of these, excuse me, was approximately eight million shares. And I’ll remind you the dilution schedules for the remaining 2041 convertible notes is available on our Investor Relations website for your reference. In the September quarter, we had about $80 million in early conversions of the 2041 notes. Remaining balance of the 2041 notes is $248 million.
We continue to execute on our capital return program. In the September quarter, we committed approximately $1.7 billion towards share repurchases deploying all of our current Board authorization from a dollar perspective. Our repurchases were executed largely through accelerated share repurchase programs that will cover repurchases until the March quarter of 2019. For dividends following the declaration of $1.10 per share the last quarter, we paid out $174 million in dividends to our shareholders.
Let me now shift to the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash, decreased in the quarter to $3.9 billion and that compares with $5.2 billion at the end of the June quarter, the change largely due to our capital return activities. We continue to make progress bringing our cash on shore. Cash from operations for the September quarter remained strong at $720 million, which was roughly flat with the $718 million we generated in the June quarter.
DSO increased by nine days to 72 days, which is related to the linearity of revenue during the quarter.
Inventory was roughly flat in dollar terms, while inventory turns declined to 2.7 times. This compares to 3.5 times in the prior quarter. We do expect to see turns improve in the December quarter.
Company noncash expenses included approximately $50 million for equity comp, $36 million for amortization and $44 million for depreciation.
Capital expenditures were $56 million, which was down from $80 million in the June quarter. For the calendar year, we expect CapEx in 2018 will be flat to slightly higher, compared to 2017 levels. CapEx this year is going towards investment in manufacturing expansion for our installed base business, as well as strategic R&D investments. We exited the quarter with approximately 11,000 regular full time employees, which was relatively consistent with the June quarter.
So now looking ahead, I’d like to provide our non-GAAP guidance for the December quarter. We are expecting revenue of $2.5 billion plus or minus $150 million. We’re expecting a modest uptick in customer spending across multiple segments, gross margin of 46% plus or minus one percentage point, operating margins of 27.5% plus or minus one percentage point. And finally, earnings per share of $3.65 plus or minus $0.20 based on a share count of approximately 163 million shares.
Consistent with our prior comments we forecast that September quarter marks a near-term trough for our business. While near-term forecasts are subject to change we remain optimistic on our longer term growth prospects that we highlighted during our investor event back in March. We continue to prioritize disciplined investments that drive competitively differentiated products, as well as Lam’s out performance opportunity into the future.
That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions. Thank you. At this time, we will open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question from C. J. Muse with Evercore. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I guess first question is, as you think about your first half, outlook for calendar 2019 definitely coming in stronger, I think, than many of us thought. Can you walk through, I guess, what you’re seeing in terms of tools versus service? And then if there’s anything that we should be thinking about that is perhaps maybe Lam specific or timing of say image sensors coming in, we would love to kind of hear your thoughts on that front. Yes needless to say we’re much more qualified to speak to our business than we are kind of like the overall kind of WFE headlines. So, when we think about kind of calendar 2019, obviously there has been some continuous, I would say, muting of investment expectations primarily in NAND flash since our last earnings call. We’re looking at 14 new projects next year, fab projects next year. And I would expect honestly in the second half 2018 to first half 2019 comparison, that our revenue levels will be incrementally higher in DRAM logic other including image sensors to your points and also foundry. I would expect NAND to be down half, over half, second half 2018, compared to first half 2019.
Relative to the proportion of our kind of revenue headlines that is the spares and services, the installed base business, obviously it’s a very important part of the economics of the company. And we’ve given some color today on the pace of growth of that business by referencing the installed base and the annuity that comes with it and it’s an important part of the value proposition here. But I would say our headlines for first half WFE are through the systems’ headlines for the markets and the customers that we have. So hopefully that helps C. J. Very helpful. And if I could ask a follow-up, you’ve always done a great job of managing OpEx. And given, I guess, the increased volatility Doug, how are you thinking about incremental margins from here? I think targeted model is roughly 40%. Is that still the right kind of model up or down depending on the revenue run rate? Well C. J. I think you rewrote our model. Our model is 32% to 33% in the longer term. Yes you see you’re too used to C. J. these memory companies with 40% to 50% operating income, that it tainted you. Yeah. But, C. J. to more directly ask you question, at these revenue levels kind of high 20s, you just saw us print 27 and guide 27.5, and as things recover and get stronger, you’ll see us kind of inch our way towards that low 30s level. That’s the right way to be thinking about things. There will be variability in spending. And one of the things I’ve purposefully pointed out is the March quarter is a 14-week quarter, so there’s an extra work week in there. And I’ll remind you that in the first half of the year you get certain spending coming back in like payroll taxes and things like that. So don’t forget those things as you’re modeling the next couple of quarters. But hopefully that answered your question. Very helpful, thank you. Thanks C. J. Thank you. We’ll take our next question from John Pitzer with Crédit Suisse. Yes, good afternoon guys. Congratulations on the solid results. I guess Doug my first question really kind of an accounting question around 606 and deferred revenue, there was a big draw down in the September quarter, sequentially in deferred revenue. How does that line sort of transition over time? Under 606 will that eventually get a zero? How quickly will you get there? And is there going to be uptick in December sort of revenue guidance, a function of just deferred revenue coming down off the balance sheet? Yes so briefly I’ll go through it John and you can ask me more if you to understand a little more. I mean basically what happened is we crossed into the new fiscal year is there was a bucket of deferred revenue that just fell straight to retained earnings. So that just fell off and is largely why our deferred revenue went down so much quarter-on-quarter. You’ll continue to see deferred revenue though, John, for first of a kind tools, and certain BPA accrual type things that isn’t completely delivered yet, it’ll bounce around a little bit.
And generally the way I think about the difference between 605 and 606 is, it’s all just timing. We’re still shipping tools, we’re still collecting cash, all of that is happening in the same timeframe that otherwise would have. In some quarters 606 revenue recognition will be higher than 605, in some quarters I would expect it’ll flip and go the other way. But at the end of the day this is all just timing and what really matters in my mind is when cash is coming into the company and as I think you saw, we had a really strong cash collection quarter at $720 million. Does that help John? That’s helpful, it does. And then maybe for my follow-up to Martin, Martin, I think, one of the investor concerns out there is, as the industry transitioned from planer to 3D NAND and the rush to get there by your customers just created kind of a once in a lifetime type kind of bulge in NAND CapEx that’s not repeatable. I’m kind of curious as we go through this soft period in NAND, has your view of capital intensity, your SAM or the rate at which your customers are making these transitions changed. And are you still have the mindset that 32 to 64 was probably the most efficient transmission for the industry and as we go from here things get more difficult. Any color there would be helpful. Yes. I mean lot of questions here. So at a fundamental level no real change in our long-term outlook and that’s a commentary on capital intensity needed for the industry. And we floated at $70 billion reference at the Flash Summit conference a year back, I think maybe repeated again this year actually, so two years in a row same message. I’m not sure we’ve ever really offered an opinion about efficiency of one node or another, but I would certainly align to the fact that’s the challenges gets more complex over time as aspect ratios increase, which is a big part of the opportunity for us. That’s where we’re strong and differentiated.
So I think that trends well. And we don’t see the opportunity for 3D NAND as a once in a lifetime gig or a one time event, right? Clearly there were some transitional investments associated with playing a capacity to 3D, there are also investments associated with one generation 3D to next and we did a pine in earlier disclosure that over the next five years I think we expect about 1 million wafer starts per month of incremental capacity to get brought to the system associated with the long-term outlook for nonvolatile memory in this world of data.
So from an industry point of view more or less the same. And I guess the one thing I didn’t say is independent of what your view is, good or bad, you should recognize that the segments of action deposition are entirely central and fundamental to that transition. And so, if everybody does well or everybody has opportunity, we should have more and if nobody does so well we should outperform. So that’s an important headline as well. Helpful. Thanks guys. Yes. Thanks John. Thank you. We’ll take our next question from Krish Shankar with Cowen and Company. Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Few of them, first one, Martin, if you look at this downturn clearly or this downdraft clearly led by memory. Looks like the CapEx for the WFE cuts have been in retaliation to pricing declines. So from your vantage point, do you think pricing is a key metric to look for to see when it trough and if so, do you think WFE trials for memory along with pricing? And do you have any view on when it’ll happen? And I have a follow-up? Well, I mean, I think that’s a very important question and quite a complicated one. Clearly there’s a relationship of pricing to investment levels. And I would say that in two ways. The first one is, ASPs should reflect supply and demand balance of capacity. So to the extent the prices are going up or going down, there’s an implied message around the need to add capacity or the needs to kind of reign in capacity. So, that’s been the world we’ve lived in for many, many, many years.
What’s a little different today is that pricing is not actually a great leading indicator right now of the customer’s ability to afford to make investments. So back to my rather amusing response to Tim’s earlier question, when the memory companies are making 40% to 50% profits when DRAM is $100 billion business, when flash has grown in the way that it has the sustainability of investments is clearly enabled in ways that wasn’t true three or five years ago.
Now having said all of that, I think our customer spends money adding capacity when they have demand from their customers to ship devices. So I don’t think people get carried away at any level these days. So it’s a bit more complicated than it used to be. Pricing is relevant to help you understand supply and demand, but it’s not so relevant in assessing sustainability and the customer’s ability to make capacity or technology related investments. So good luck with your modeling, I guess. Got it, got it. That’s really helpful, Martin. And then just a follow-up, clearly, everyone understand the long-term upside potential for Lam and the industry and WFE bond. I’m just trying to frame the downside. If you look at the first shoot of drop with NAND followed by DRAM, do you worry that things will get worse before they get better? Or do you think they’re kind of a dropping at these levels? Well, we are – if anything, we’re super consistent, right? So my approach has always been to describe what I see and we’ve done that. And we’ll always do that. Good or bad, we’ll tell how we see it. And so, we’ve offered perspective that says December is stronger than September and we expect the first half of next year to be stronger than the second half of this year. And of course we might be wrong. And you have to kind of judge the confidence level of our disclosure and kind of move forward, I guess. So best I can offer you. Got it. Thanks Martin. Thanks for the insight. Thank you. Thanks Krish. Thank you. We’ll take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Thanks so much. I had two, I guess the first question Martin is, if I just hold your wafer fab equipment share and now I’m putting everything in there. But if I just calculate your WFE share for this year and for the last year, it’s up a little bit this year. So if I just hold that into the first half of next year, you’re still annualizing if I give you say, $5 billion worth of revenue in the calendar first half, which was just up a little bit half on half, that would imply that we’re still analyzing to like high 40’s to close to $50 billion WFE. So, I guess the question is, who really knows about the calendar second half? But would you sort of endorse a number close to $50 billion for 2019 WFE? Technically it’s too early for us to answer that question. It’s pretty customary that we have a response to that in the January earnings call. But fair question, I don’t have the crystal ball, so I can’t answer it with the same level of confidence, so I can answer the near-term questions. But a very interview question might be how do I feel today about the $100 billion two year reference that’s been floated around for the last kind of few months. It’s not a bad reference. We’re trending a tweak below that right now to our analytics. But we’ve trended a little above it at times and a little below and I can’t really tell you what the variability is around it. But that would probably be the best I could give you at this point in time. Awesome. Thank you. And then Doug, it was a pretty big repo this quarter and I understand that it’s going to sort of play out through the end of March. But I’m curious if you can help us on share count for December and March as this kind of flows through. And then also how you think about when you’re going to kind of re-up for the repo, how you kind of think about that? Thank you. Yes, I mean, Tim it’s always an ongoing conversation at a board level. We described when we first launched this current authorization at 12 to 18 month timeframe, maybe we’ve gotten through it a little sooner. I did purposefully point out that those ASRs are going to execute kind over a six month timeframe or not out of the market even though all the cash got deployed. When I have something to update you on, I’ll update you relative to what we’re going to do in the future. Obviously it’s something we’re going to be talking about, but I don’t have anything to tell you today. But just on the share count though, how it actually plays out, how it actually plays through for December and March. Thanks. Yes. I just guided you that December number of 163 million. I didn’t give you anything for March and we only guide one quarter at a time, Tim, so. Okay. Awesome, Doug. Thanks so much. Yes. Thank you. Thank you. We’ll take our next question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. We were at the Flash Memory Summit when the Lam team had its investor event and we also had the opportunity to hear from some of the existing NAND leaders in the market as well as some potential entrants from China who seemed to be making some progress and talked about increasing their manufacturing footprint next year. We’ve also heard the same thing from some of the China domestic DRAM suppliers, albeit at lower levels of production activity. Do you think that China domestic memory starts to become a bigger part of your memory WFE mix looking into next year? Yes. Yes, probably does, Harlan, yes. Both NAND and DRAM, you think? Yes, probably. As you observed from Flash Memory, the NAND guys in China were a little more visible, maybe a little more confident there. But I think they’re both going to increment… But I don’t think our fundamental view on China is any different today than it was for the last couple of years. I mean, it’s clearly an ambitious, but in our opinion, quite rational strategic agenda. And as each quarter passes there’s more substance to what they’re doing and we don’t have anything more to add than what I think they’re speaking to in the public markets on their. And obviously independent of all of that the long-term market participants are also investing for next-generation device architectures and market share growth and so on and so forth. So, I mean, it’s a global system and that’s what we respond to. But I think it’s likely that the investment level in China increases in absolutes and proportional terms next year per Doug’s response. Great, thanks. I just had a quick follow-up. It’s pretty amazing, the amount of supply side, disciplined and focused on profitability and free cash flow by your memory customers and clearly they want to maintain strong profitability levels by modulating supply. If I look at the last time there was a strong focus on sort of reign in supply that was kind of 2016. It took about two quarters of strong equipment spending declines before we did see a positive response in memory placing fundamentals and economics for your customers. Is that how the Lam team still thinks about it as well i.e. that supply discipline in the second half of this year potentially positively impacts supply dynamics and maybe stronger possibility in the first half of next year for your customers? Wow. I’m not showing that, but I’ll answer that. I mean I would say everything moves faster. So, I think our customers adjust faster and therefore that’s probably true on the upside as much as it is on the downside. We’re a big part of feeding variability along with other market participants for the economics of their business. And I think they take actions anticipating risks as much as ever and that’s a lot more than would be true five or 10 years ago when action would get taken when there was a clear problem statement. So yes, there are supply and demand imbalances that are getting adjusted too. There’s also proactive actions to manage the risk of that. So that’s a good thing I think in the long-term. Yes. I mean it kind of gets to this – it gets to the message that the secular headlines for us feel like they’re more important than stronger than the cyclical launch, but you have to make your own decision I guess. Thanks, Harlan. Thanks for the insights. Thank you. Thank you. I’ll take our next question from Joe Moore [Morgan Stanley]. Great. Thank you. Following up on that last question. I guess, I was surprised at how strong China was in the September quarter and I think you talked about two thirds of that being from domestics, that seems like a pretty big deviation. Is there anything we should be aware of there and how much of that is kind of memory versus you’re sort of the foundry customers, who you’ve seen more frequently? Yes. I mean Joe, I’ve pointed it out, because it was an uptick from the local guys and I want them to let you know that. I don’t know you’re going to see that every single quarter in fact, I know you won’t. And interestingly, when I look at kind of who the customers are, and I won’t name them by name that there was relative balance between foundry as well as memory. And logic actually… Actually in logic, you’re right, Martin. So, it was – it was a strong quarter for us in China and it was a balanced quarter. I mean, my take on this thing answer is, we tend to talk about collectively two or three – two or three core domestic participants in China. Reality is, there are kind of six or seven. Yes, there’s more. And some of them are active at 300, some of them are interactive at 200 millimeter, some of them are active at leading edge technologies and some less leading edge, but there’s a fairly meaningful population that doesn’t maybe get fully internalized. Great. Thank you very much. Thanks, Joe. Thank you. We’ll take our next question from Romit Shah with Nomura Instinet. Yes, thank you. I guess just, as outsiders that all the data points on memory equipment CapEx and fundamentals to seemingly seemed all bad during the quarter and yet you exhausted your entire buyback and you’re reiterating your expectations for growth in December. So, is it fair Martin, just to sort of sum up this report by saying that maybe, your business is more diversified than we realized and you’re confident in September being the bottom. And the question really is just sort of the shape of the recovery from here being either U or V-shaped? Well, I think we’ve been talking to the subject of diversification now for, it’s kind of three or four years. No question we’re more diversified today than we were. I think we’ve tried to reinforce that message even more than talking about share gains in foundry and share gains in logic by speaking to the SAM expansion headlines. And in the last kind of the year or so, we’ve segwayed into the installed base business of the company, which is not only a great asset relative to creating an opportunity for competitive differentiation in the core systems products of the company, it’s a source of revenue and profit growth at a rate that is faster than the pace of growing our installed base.
I mean there’s a massive difference between 55,000 process chambers and 36,000 process chambers relative to the annuity. So that’s all kind of in the mix as well. So, the business is more or less as we had anticipated slightly muted to the expectations of three months ago. But not that much different, I mean, I actually think our calendar 18 WFE number is 98% or 99% exactly what it was three months ago. So, I mean, that’s kind of basic headline there and we’ve expressed an outlook for the first half of next year and we’re not going to put numbers on it now. We’ll kind of deal with that in January. So that will be the time when we or you become some obvious disclosure from the Lam. Okay. thanks for that. And just on the buyback you’ve exhausted it. So do we have to wait till the next conference call to hear about the size and scope of the next authorization? Well, even though the cash like I said, Romit, the cash got all committed. We’re still in the market through these structured products, so… Okay. And that was purposeful, right, taken a view of pricing, where things were at and wanting to get on with it. But the way this generally works is Martin and I all agree, here is what we think we should do. We’ll go on and we’ll have a conversation with the board and the board will have opinions. So, we’ll modify it and when we have a decision, we will communicate it to you and we’re not at that point yet. Okay. Thank you. Yes. Thanks, Romit. Thank you. We’ll take our next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Thanks for taking my question. Martin, maybe a question on your services business. If say, hypothetically WFE goes down 5% or 10% next year, what does that imply for your services business? Can you still keep it flat or even grow it? Just what is just the conceptual sensitivity to WFE? Well, in the calendar year, there’s not so much sensitivity, because in general, when we ship a system to customer, it has a 12-month warranty, so it’s kind of on our dime during that period. The single biggest influence over the size of the installed base businesses, the number of kind of units in the installed base for which we disclosed and then the utilization of fabs. So if you – if we show up in the worlds with the WFE reduction that you’ve just characterized and there is no change in utilization of the installed base, then there’s no consequence. If the utilization of the installed base goes up, you’re likely to see accelerated growth and if the installed base utilization goes down, you see a contraction and spares of service business in the industry. So, our assumption is in the context of customers have done a really good job kind of managing this issue, utilizations will run pretty high and we have no reason to be anxious about a dip in our installed base revenues.
In an independent world, as spoken to you for some time now, a little bit here today in prepared comments, we are perpetually building a portfolio of installed base productivity related products and service offerings and invested in contributing more to the success of our customers and creating opportunity for Lam. So, there’s some things in our control and some things that are out of our control. Got it. And as a follow-up from what you see today, do you think memory CapEx overall is up or down next year and when do you typically get visibility around what the spending environment will be? Perfectly normal timing where it will give you more color on next year would be in next quarter’s earnings call. It’s just a little bit too early for us to give on the specificity you’re asking for. Thank you. Yes. Thank you. Thank you. We’ll take our next question from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Yes. Thank you so much. Martin, you’ve talked about logic revenue being up in the first half of 2019 relative to the second half of 2018. Is the big driver there basically your key customers CapEx budget going up or is it more due to your positioning improving from say 14 to 10 nanometer or is it both? It’s both. It’s a little bit of both. Okay. And then kind of related to that, if you were to – in terms of magnitude, you guided DRAM, logic and foundry all power for over half. If you had to rank order those three in terms of the magnitude increase from the second half to the first half, is that something that you guys can do? I haven’t written down on a piece of paper in front of me and now decided like that – I’d like to tell you. So, rank order without any numbers, I would say logic and it’s kind of other logic, which includes, the image sensor opportunities and the legacy stuff, it’s probably the fastest-growing. And DRAM is the slowest-growing and foundries probably in the middle. That would be kind of – and I’m not speaking to kind of industry level here, I’m just characterizing the revenue kind of outlook for Lam, and as I said, NAND’s contractions, so that will be our rank order. Okay. Yes. It’s like pretty early to be having those conversations. So, take it for what it’s worth at this point. Sure. As a quick follow-up, I just had a question on market share. Martin, clearly, if you’re growing your business 14% this year, you’re gaining a bit of share. In your prepared remarks, you’ve talked about some of your net wins, both in dep and etch. Is it fair to say in relation to your long-term model, where you’ve attached $1 billion incremental revenue for market share gains? Are you tracking in line or ahead of that plan or how would you describe, where you stand today relative to the long-term plans? Was never linear as it’s a tough question to answer. But a couple of data points. So, when we talk about kind of penetration defense activities this year, we’re actually talking more about the economics that will play out a year from now or maybe even in 2020, right, because there’s a leading a timeframe on DTOR decisions and PTOR decisions and you might remember that in the last earnings call, I think I made referenced to the fact that there were tons of decisions in relative terms in the second half of this year compared to the first half of this year.
So, that’s kind of a loss still ahead of us. So, fair game for you to ask the same question to me to try and answer it in January. So far, again, we don’t – we never think though that we defend everything, but we have a net positive to forward-looking kind of economics from the penetrations and defenses in the first nine months of this year. So pretty, pretty pleased. Thank you. Thanks, Toshiya. Thank you. We’ll take our next question from Patrick Ho with Stifel. Thank you very much. Martin, first off, just I guess follow-up on some of your comments on named capital intensity, but looking at it from the DRAM front, as the industry continues to push the 1X, 1Y, eventually to 1Z, we’re seeing a lot of new fab projects in DRAM. Do you believe these capital intensity trends are also impacting DRAM and this could provide a little bit of, I guess, sustainability on some of the equipment spending trends that we’re seeing today? I think it’s all about kind of the economics on the revenue of the customer honestly. I think what we’ve seen in the last couple of years is, obviously, an emergence of significant discipline, managing supply and demand, and there has been an ASP consequence, but more than that, we’ve seen a transition away from units to content and density in a broader set of demand drivers. And that has allowed our customers to kind of reset the value of the bits that they’re selling to their customers. So, the average bit is worth kind of more by virtue of the value that’s created in this kind of broader cognitive computing environments. And so if there continues to be discipline and if our customers continue to be successful getting paid for the enabled ones in their industry, the fact that from one generation to the next, the DRAM cost transitions are kind of less significant compared to the baseline of five to 10 years ago. It’s much less relevance, right?
I mean clearly when no transitions deliver less than they did in history, there’s a lot of intensity by the customer and there’s a lot of intensity by Lam and our peer companies. I’m sure to try and continue to improve the productivity of the DRAM installed base, because we have a collective interest in that. But I think the bigger question to answer relative to DRAM capital intensity is the revenue side of it, not the cost side of it. But as I said three times today, in my – go ahead? As my follow-up question for Doug, in terms of the services and spare parts business, you mentioned that you have a little bit of the CapEx spend; the increase is incrementally going into that business segment. How much can you leverage, I guess your existing workforce in terms of growing that business on the labor side of things, or is that an area where you’ll also have to increase OpEx to keep up with the fast pace of growth in that business? Patrick, it’s a different physical factor in a different location. So, there’s not a lot of leverage from a labor standpoint and we have to invest in manufacturing, the parts for manufacturing. So, it’s all goodness at the end of the day, it’s supporting a higher installed base and we got to make investments for that. Great. Thank you. Thanks, Patrick. [Operator Instructions]. We’ll take our next question from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I just had a quick one on kind of nano-secular technology. Is there any of your customers that have already started working on that or is that something that it’s told to come next year? Unfortunately, our customers have to answer that question. Okay. Got it. And then secondly, on the DRAM side, do you guys see any, I guess – I guess, when would you guys think that the pricing would stabilize in DRAM in general, or do you guys have no view right now? Well, we have a view, but I think the view of our customers again, is worth a lot more than ours. I mean it’s all about supply and demand, and our customers have taken action, I would argue proactively as much as reactively. And so everything moves pretty fast these days. So again, customer’s disclosure is worth a lot more than ours on ASPs of devices. Got it. Thank you. Thanks, Mitch. Thank you. We’ll take our next question from Weston Twigg with KeyBanc. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First, I’m just wondering if you’re seeing any change in customer behavior related to trade work insurance whether that’s in terms of the conversations you’re having with them or the visibility that they’re providing or commitments regarding new fab capacity heading into 2019. Any color would be helpful? Yes. To the best of my knowledge, nothing’s really changing directly related to that, although I’ve kind of heard a few statements and read a few things quoted about customers’ kind of referencing terrorists or the costs of terrorists when it comes to the pace at which they’re making investments. In fact, I think I read one today out of Taiwan. So, I’m sure it’s not irrelevant. I mean, to the extent that a company has more of costs, because of terrorists and we probably all do at some level. There is a consequence of that and there is a reprioritization of things in the company. So, not irrelevance, but hard for us to kind of directly correlates. I’m just conscious that I’m seeing statements and I’m hearing some things. And so it’s in the mix of the outlook that we’ve described today. Okay. That’s very helpful. And then my follow-up question is just on DRAM strength in the first half that you mentioned, is there a strength from – more from some of the pushouts you’re seeing from this half, is it related to new capacity or is it more just ongoing conversion activity? It’s mostly as originally planned. I don’t think it’s a massive kind of statements. So, there are not so many industry participants in any segment these days. So, you probably got a sense of who is chasing who and who is investing where for what purpose. So, I think it was pretty much originally as consistent with plan. Okay. Thank you very much. Thanks, Weston. Operator, we’ll take one more question please. Thank you. We’ll take our next question from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Yes. Thanks for squeezing me in. Doug, going back to your commentary by the extra week in the march quarter, which is leading to higher expenses, should I also assume that your revenue would be positively impacted for an extra week? Well, technically we have an extra week to shift product, Mehdi, I don’t know that it’s going to meaningfully move the revenue number. I do know definitively, it will impact the expenses. we’ll give you the hard guide when we did get the end of the quarter though. Okay. And then just – I just want to go back to your comment about the deferred revenue. And if I just do a simple math, I get to shipment down 35% on a sequential basis. Is that – does that make sense to you? Mehdi, we’re not getting shipment anymore. We’re not talking about shipment anymore. No. this is for the September quarter. This is for the September quarter. Yes, yes. We’re done talking about shipments publicly; revenue is all we’re going to be describing now. You can do analytics on whatever you want to get shipments, but at the end of the day, given the change in the revenue recognition timing, revenue is what we’re going to be talking about. Okay, that’s great. Just a follow-up on your services, given the increased installed system, are these service contracts long enough to actually have an impact on your backlog? Does that help you with better visibility? Yes. So, if that’s the case and assuming that services is becoming a larger part of your revenue mix, why not offer a longer guide on the revenues rather than just referring to WFE? We’ll think about it, Mehdi. I mean at the end of the day, we tried to describe what we think is important for you to understand what’s going on in the business. There’s still just a large amount of the business in any one quarter that’s turns based. And to me, backlog isn’t that meaningful, for services, it’s certainly as just Martin said. So, we’ll give you some thought. Because just the growth in installed system is very compelling, but it still hasn’t made a difference to how you guide and I’m just wondering what is the disconnect here? I’m not – I’m not sure that’s actually true. I think for the last couple of quarters you have perspective some times quantitative and some times qualitative on the progression for a couple of quarters including today. So, it’s pretty hard to do what we’re doing and as many people characterize that we don’t have the visibility to say what we currently say as those to do. So take it for what it’s worth, we’re doing the best we can. Thanks, Mehdi. Thank you. And speakers, as we have no more questions, I’ll turn it back to you. Okay. With that, we’ll conclude the call. Thank you, operator.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Tina Correa, Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Please go ahead ma’am. Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the Lam Research quarterly earnings conference call. With me today are Tim Archer, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Doug Bettinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
During today’s call, we will share our overview on the business environment and review our financial results for the December 2018 quarter and our outlook for the March 2019 quarter. The press release detailing our financial results was distributed a little after 1 o’clock p.m. Pacific Time this afternoon. The release can also be found on the Investor Relations section of the company’s website along with the presentation slides that accompany today’s call.
Today’s presentation and Q&A includes forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factors disclosures of our SEC public filings. Please see accompanying slides in the presentation for additional information. Today’s discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial results can be found in today’s earnings press release. This call is scheduled to last until 3 o’clock p.m. Pacific Time. A replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website.
With that, let me hand the call over to Tim. Thank you all for joining us today. It’s good to be here with you on my first earnings call as Lam’s CEO. I have met many of you before Lam events, but I recognize there are some on the call that may not know me quite as well. So I’d like to start by briefly recapping how my experience at Lam and Novellus over the last 24 years has shaped my perspective on what it takes to compete and win in this business over the long term.
I have been fortunate to have opportunities that expanded the company’s operations from being embedded as a process engineer inside the development fab of one of our leading customers to heading our technology organization in Japan to leading product groups through periods of key technology inflections to managing our worldwide sales organization. Most recently, I has been charged with driving company-wide business results as the CEO of Lam since the time of the merger with Novellus.
During this period, from calendar 2013 to 2018, we grew revenue by 2.7 times and increased earnings per share two times faster than the increase in revenue. From my experiences I believe in the critical importance of building deep and lasting customer collaborations founded on mutual trust. I am committed to continuously investing in a pipeline of differentiated products that help our customers address their most difficult technology and productivity challenges.
And as we see in the current environment, I value having a flexible operating model that enables us to respond rapidly to market changes to ensure we deliver on our commitments to our customers as well as our shareholders. I believe we are still in the early stages of a long-term secular growth story for the industry and particularly for Lam. What you can expect to see from my leadership as CEO is increased focus on leveraging our core strength to deliver technology and productivity solutions to the fastest growing segments of the semiconductor equipment market, which in the long-term we believe are those tied to the enablement of the emerging data economy. I am very proud of what our company has accomplished in recent years and I am honoured to have the opportunity to lead Lam to an even greater future.
Before I continue, I want to provide an update on the investigation we announced in connection with Martin’s departure. As you know from our December press release, our board formed an independent special committee to lead a thorough investigation into allegations of misconduct and conduct inconsistent with our core values. That investigation is now substantially complete and there have been no other personal actions and none have been recommended by the special committee. Core values have always been a foundation of Lam’s success and I am committed to a culture of trust, respect and open communication built around an environment in which our employees feel free to speak up on workplace issues.
To reinforce this culture, the special committee has recommended that we review our policies, practices and training related to workplace conduct and increased our communications on these topics. To reiterate what we said in December, the alleged misconduct did not call into question the integrity of the company’s financial systems or controls, and the special committee’s investigation has confirmed this.
Now turning to our view on the business. In line with our prior guidance, we delivered a solid December quarter despite a more challenging environment. We also completed the strongest calendar year in the history of the company with $10.871 billion in revenues, a 14% year-on-year increase at the same time we delivered growth in EPS of 27% and an increase in operating cash flows of more than 50% from the prior calendar year. I would like to thank our customers, our employees and our partners for their support and contribution to these results.
From Lam’s perspective, industry performance for calendar 2018 came in largely as we have communicated in our prior earnings call. Overall, WFE was in line with our expectations of single-digit growth at approximately $50 billion with an increase in memory and a year-on-year decline in non-memory spending. Entering 2019, industry fundamentals have weakened, particularly within memory segments as customers continue to reign in both NAND and DRAM spending. At this point, 2019 WFE is looking to be down in the mid to high-teens range. For NAND, 2019 offers what we believe is a solid long-term setup for the industry as the supply bit growth rate is expected to decline throughout the year. NAND demand should continue to benefit from content increase in consumer and enterprise applications and we began to see initial signs of demand elasticity in the client SSD markets as we exited the 2018.
In DRAM, while near-term dynamics remaining challenging, customer behaviour remains rationale and industry profitability characteristics remain compelling. We believe customers are making prudent adjustments to capacity in response to the overall demand environment they are seeing. We expect DRAM WFE spend correction to extend through 2019 with supply growth fall into the mid-teens as we exit the year.
Non-memory segments are expected to grow in 2019 and with the continued rise in the importance of 3D architectures, technology innovation for transistor, interconnect and advanced packaging applications remains a critical priority for us as we grow our strategic relevance with our customers in this segment. In aggregate, we feel confident that we’re operating in a rational industry environment, one that is well positioned to deliver attractive long-term growth and opportunity.
With that as context, we are executing to the growth strategy that I described during our Investor Day earlier last year. Our strategy focuses along three primary vectors: expanding the size of our served available markets, gaining market share in the segments in which we compete and increasing the recurring revenue stream we derived from our installed base. Etch and deposition processes are central to the success of our customers technology roadmaps and we continue to make substantial, comprehensive, yet disciplined investments in R&D to fund the innovation required to create differentiated solutions and long-term value.
In the December quarter, we continued to build on our leadership position in both NAND and DRAM for critical applications with key penetrations for high aspect ratio Etch, and 3D NAND dielectric stack deposition applications. Furthermore, we continued to extend our high aspect ratio Etch leadership into non-memory segments with critical wins for metal interconnect and spacer applications at a leading logic customer. In atomic layer deposition film quality, repeatability and productivity are fundamental elements of differentiation for Lam.
During the quarter, we gained momentum in both DRAM and NAND with new application wins. While we are pleased with these wins in critical applications, we are committed to strengthening the performance of our product portfolio across the board. Our R&D investments are squarely focused on achieving our vision of best-in-class products everywhere we compete.
Turning now to revenue derived from our expanding installed base, our customer support business group delivered another record year. Installed base revenue growth exceeded installed base unit growth again in 2018 with installed base units in the field ending the year at roughly 56,000 chambers. We closed out the year on a high note, signing with a key customer, the single largest installed base deal in our history. Our focus with CSBG is to provide innovative products and services, which create value for customers over the entire life cycle of tool ownership. We partner closely with customers as we help them extract increased technical capability and higher productivity from existing assets. And in return, we are building a strong recurring revenue stream for Lam.
2019 is shaping up to be another solid year for our customer support business group and our progress remains aligned with the long-term growth objectives communicated to the investment community early last year. In closing, the business environment is more challenging than just a few quarters ago, but we are committed to delivering on our multidimensional growth strategy and at the same time responding to near-term revenue trends through a strong focus on operational efficiency. Lam has a proven track record of execution and we believe we are fundamentally well positioned in the right segments of the market.
The new $5 billion share buyback program we announced earlier today in our press release reflects our continued confidence in Lam’s long-term opportunities. Doug will provide details on the program in his comments.
Additionally, I’d like to mention that I’ll be on the road in the coming weeks and look forward to meeting with many of you. I will also be participating in the Goldman Sachs Technology Conference in San Francisco on February 13. Thanks. And now, here’s Doug. Excuse me. Thanks Tim. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. Lam delivered solid performance in the December quarter with our results exceeding the midpoint of guidance for all financial metrics.
Operating margin and earnings per share exceeded the high end of the guidance range provided, mainly due to our proactive management of our operating expenses.
Overall memory revenue increased slightly from the September quarter with the combined Memory segment making up 79% of total system revenue. NAND volume and memory revenue drove the increase in the Memory segment and it represented approximately 55% of system revenue. NAND investments were driven primarily by conversions to higher layer cut wafers.
DRAM represented 24% of system revenue in the December quarter, which was roughly flat with the prior quarter. The majority of spending in all of memory was targeted at conversions. The foundry segment declined quarter-over-quarter, accounting for 13% of system revenue, mainly due to reduced China foundry investments. You may recall on the September call, I spoke about how strong that was and it declined somewhat in December. The logic and other segment was up slightly, contributing 8% of system revenue.
From an industry perspective, Tim discussed our view of 2019 WFE. Currently, we believe WFE spending is weighted to the first half of 2019, driven by Foundry and Logic investments. We believe memory investments will be meaningfully lower in 2019 while the combined Foundry and Logic will be up. Our assumption based on our customer interactions is that there is not a significant recovery in memory spending throughout 2019. We expect the year in memory will be mainly driven by node conversions to lower our customers’ cost per bit. DRAM spending will be primarily on conversions to 1y and a little bit of 1z and NAND converting to 96-Layer devices.
Let me now turn to our P&L performance. We delivered revenues of $2.523 billion in the December quarter. This was up sequentially by 8% from September and was slightly above the midpoint of our guidance.
Gross margin for the quarter came in at 46.3%. As I always do, I’ll remind you, our actual gross margins are a function of several factors such as business volume, product mix and customer concentration. And we expect to see variability quarter-to-quarter.
Operating expenses in the quarter came in at $440 million, slightly down from the operating expense level in the September quarter. Worth noting, I think, we decreased our operating expenses for the first half of 2018 to the second half by approximately $100 million as we managed spending relative to the software business environment.
R&D comprised nearly two thirds of our total spending, consistent with the composition of spending in the previous two quarters. We’ve maintained a high percentage of our OpEx and R&D to support the long-term growth objectives for the company.
Operating income in the December quarter was $728 million. Operating margin came in over the guidance range at 28.8%, mainly as a result of the reduced spending within the quarter as well as gross margin that came in slightly above the midpoint of our guided range.
The non-GAAP tax rate for the December quarter came in at 10%, which was slightly lower than the long-term rate. This was due to discrete tax benefits realized relative to statute of limitations explorations within the quarter. In the longer run, the tax rate in the low to middle teens is the right range for you to continue to include in your models. And there will be fluctuations in the tax rate from quarter-to-quarter.
Based on a share count of approximately 162 million shares, earnings per share for the December quarter came in at $3.87, which exceeded our guidance range. The share count includes dilution from the 2041 convertible notes, and the dilutive impact was approximately six million shares in the December quarter. I’ll remind you that the dilution schedule for the 2041 convertible notes is available on our Investor Relations website for your reference. I’d also point out that the 2018 warrants mature during the December quarter.
We continue to execute on our capital return program. For the December quarter, we paid out $168 million in dividends. Related to the share buyback, in January of 2019, we completed our previous $4 billion share buyback authorization, repurchasing over 23 million shares in total. Additionally, as Tim mentioned and that we noted in the press release we issued today, our board has approved a new authorization to repurchase up to $5 billion of our common stock. Today’s capital return announcement is consistent with our current plan of returning at least 50% of free cash flow to stockholders. And in summary, for the calendar 2018 year, we returned $3 billion share buybacks and over $500 million in dividends, which along with the new authorization that was announced today, continues to demonstrate our commitment to shareholder return.
Our cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash, was flat with the September quarter at $3.9 billion. During the December quarter, our cash from operations came in at $642 million, which was offset by pay down on our commercial paper program of approximately $360 million as well as the dividends that I have previously mentioned.
For the 2018 calendar year, our cash from operations was over $3 billion. This was consistent with what I mentioned in the last earnings call.
DSO during the quarter decreased by five days to 67 days. Our inventory levels decreased, and consistent with our expectations, inventory turns increased to 3.2 times, which was an improvement from 2.7 times in the prior quarter.
Company noncash expenses included approximately $39 million for equity comp, $36 million for amortization and $46 million for depreciation.
Capital expenditures came in at $106 million in the December quarter, which was an increase of $56 million from September. Due to the timing of certain projects, December quarter CapEx was a little bit on the high side of what we expected. I expect that as we go into calendar 2019, CapEx will be somewhat lower than the 2018 level.
As we noted in the last quarter, our CapEx investments are focused on manufacturing expansion for our installed base business as well as strategic R&D investments.
We exited the quarter with approximately 10,950 regular full time employees, which was relatively flat with September quarter. I think it’s worth noting that we maintain flexibility in managing our cost by adjusting our temporary workforce for short-term changes in business conditions. We reduced our temporary headcount by over 700 people since the peak levels we were carrying earlier this year.
So now looking ahead, I’d like to provide our non-GAAP guidance for the March quarter. We are expecting revenue of $2,400,000,000 plus or minus a $150 million. We’re forecasting gross margin of 44.5% plus or minus one percentage point. Gross margins will decline sequentially due to customer concentration, product mix and lower factory volumes. And as I just mentioned, as we sit here today, we expect the gross margin percentage will be at a low point in March relative to the rest of calendar year 2019. We’re forecasting operating margins of 25% plus or minus one percentage point. And finally, earnings per share of $3.40 plus or minus $0.20 based on the share count of approximately 159 million shares.
And I just remind you that in the March quarter, we have an extra work week in the fiscal quarter, which happens approximately every six years due to the fiscal calendar cutoff. March spending is expected to be higher in cost of goods sold as well as operating expenses as a result of the extra work week. I’ll also remind you that the March quarter has seasonal impacts due to payroll taxes that go up in the beginning of the year. Both of these things are included in our stated guidance.
For 2019, first half business view is lower than our prior outlook, given the recent announcements of reductions that you’ve seen from commentary from others in the technology space. With this current environment, we continue to exercise and discipline in our spending, and we’re focused on prioritizing investments to support Lam’s SAM expansion, market share gains and installed base growth.
Operator that concludes my prepared remarks, Tim and I will now like to open up the call for questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we’ll take our first question today from C. J. Muse with Evercore. Yes good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, first question. As you think about WFE levels in the 4Q and 1Q time frame, can you share with us what you think the implied forward – growth rate is for both DRAM and NAND? C. J. it’s Doug. I think, generally speaking, as Tim mentioned, we expect bit growth as we go through 2019 to decline as we go through the year as customers adjust their spending. Overall, I think 2018 ended from a NAND standpoint in the low-40s. DRAM, I think, is low-20s. And we expect that to decline as we go through 2019, Tim, as customers adjust their spending levels. Tim, would you add anything? No, I think that’s – the comment is we, at this point, see us ending the year below what Lam has said about the long-term sustainable demand growth rates. So I think that, it’s why we’re pretty optimistic about the setup exiting 2019. I guess, if I could clarify the question. If you look at order run rates today, what is the implied bit growth that would come online, say, three, four quarters from now? I think you’ve done analysis on that where I think Q4 DRAM, we’re tracking maybe up 10%. If spending just stayed at those levels, is there any analysis you can share there with us on both DRAM and NAND? Yes, Tim. I don’t have specific numbers for you except what we describe, which is as we go through the year, it’s going to decline as customers adjust their spending level. Okay. And as a follow-up, I’m trying to do a little bit more work here and better understand your leverage to technology versus capacity buys, in particular, as it relates on the 3D NAND site in high aspect ratio etch. So can you walk through what percentage of overall etch spend or etch is in 3D, particularly as we scale up the layer counts? Yes, Tim. We haven’t given hard numbers on that. But as I think as customers invest in conversions, they spend less money but they spend more as a percentage on etch and deposition. We describe that consistently in the past, and that’s very much what we see happening this year. But I think if the question was the percentage of high aspect ratio applications where Lam’s position is very strong, it’s increasing node by node. And that’s just based on the fact that it takes longer in general to complete those etches. And that’s, obviously, our task to make those continuously faster. But it is increasing at each technology node. Thanks, C. J. Okay, thanks. Next we’ll hear from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Thank you. Doug and Tim, I had a question just about the trajectory of the year. So if I take the WFE you guys are guiding to like 42 for this year, it looks like your product WFE share, you don’t tell us what services are. But it looks like your product WFE share is somewhere in the low-15s the past couple of years. So if I could just assume that they flat, which I wonder that it will given that UV’s ramping, that implies that revenue kind of like is flat throughout the rest of the year from this level. Is that the wrong way to think about it? Thanks. Tim, I think what we try to describe in short. Yes, Tim, I’m getting confused who I’m talking to. I think as the year sets up, we expect the first half of the year is going to be weighted towards Foundry and Logic. It will be stronger in the first half from the second half. And memory is may be a little bit stronger in the second half than the first half. We don’t see a significant recovery occurring on memory, I would point that out. But I think, as you know, we tend to be very, very strong in memory. So with memory down year-on-year, our share likely trends along with that. That’s not a statement around any application, win or loss. It’s just a statement of who’s spending money. Tim, would you add anything? Yes. I think internally in the company, I don’t think your thinking is too far off. And we look at the most important measures of success for us this year. And it’s how we’re doing on the applications that we want to make sure that we own when the spending does pick up. And as long as we’re doing that, then the precise timing of when spending comes back in NAND is less important to us. So it’s really our focus. Got it. And then Doug, I had a question on deferred revenue. It was down about $130 million again. So it sounds like shipments were more like maybe $2.4 billion for the fourth quarter. So my question is how much more can you draw down deferred revenue? Because obviously, it sounds like if you give a shipments in March, it will be lower than $2.4 billion. But where does that number – where does that $493 million worth of deferred revenue? Where does that bottom out? Thanks. Yes, I think I’ve described it, Tim, in the past. It’s going to bounce around $100 million quarter-on-quarter. I think some quarters, it will be down as you’re seeing now. Some quarters, I think, it will also be up. I don’t know that it meaningfully changes from the level where it’s at right now. But it will very depend on the percentage of new tools we’re shipping, how strong the business with certain customers is, certain regions of the world is little bit different. I don’t view it as going to zero at any point, Tim. But it will bounce around plus or minus $100 million, it is how I would be thinking about it. Okay, got it. So Doug, so I mean shipments are about equal to revenue for March, is that right? Yes. I’m not guiding shipments anymore, Tim. What I said was it will be plus or minus $100 million quarter-by-quarter. Some quarters will be down. Some quarters will be up. It’s all just timing, quite honestly. Got it, okay. Thanks. Yes, thanks, Tim. We’ll now hear from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for let me ask the question. Doug, maybe another way to ask Tim’s question. I was intrigued that you commented that March quarter should be the bottom in gross margin for the year. I’m just kind of curious, is that because you expect March to be the low point in revenue? Are there mix drivers that helped gross margin going forward? I always say, John, there’s a variety of different things that impact gross margin. I usually mentioned three things. Overall business volume is a component. But as I think, we have a highly variable cost structure. This isn’t a big fixed cost business. This isn’t like our customers. We’re highly variable in our cost. Tool mix is important. Not all of our tools have the same gross margin. And sometimes, that mix will be beneficial sequentially. Sometimes, it will be negative. And then customer concentration, when you get the bigger customer spending more or it’s that more concentrated customers, you might have a little bit of margin headwinds. All of those things are important to think about relative to the trend in gross margin, and all of those are relevant to the comment I had about March being a low point. That’s helpful. And then maybe kind of a follow-up to CJ’s question, just relative – appreciate the fact that in this volatile environment, your willingness to give us a view on the full year on WFE being down mid-to-high teens. I’m just kind of curious when you look at your SAM and whether that be some incremental share gains on the Logic front at 10 or some incremental SAM gains as we go from 64 to 96 and/or 1x to 1y to 1z. Do you think your SAM outperforms, performs in line or underperforms the overall WFE this year, Tim? I think if we – taking all those things into account you just said, I would think that we feel that our SAM actually underperforms to be a few this year. And that’s primarily because of the heavy concentration of our SAM in 3D NAND as you know. And so I think that should be the expectation if the year plays out as we have described, which is no material increase in 3D NAND or NAND spending through the year. Helpful, thanks, guys. Yes. Thanks, Joh. Krish Sankar with Cowen has our next question. Yes. Hi, thanks for taking my question. I had two of them. First one, Doug and Tim, just on the reconcile what you said in the front of WFE year versus what ASML said, is it fair to assume is it because the back half is mainly concentrated on EUV from the foundry side? And then I had a follow-up, too. I think there is a few things, and I will let Doug jump in here with his comments as well. But when you look at ASML’s comments and as best we understand them kind of talking about the recovery in DRAM in the second half of the year, that’s not necessarily inconsistent with us exiting the year with a better setup for the first half. And I think that you have to think about the way the tools come in into new – into fabs and new projects.
Our experiences that litho and metrology tools usually lead etch and deposition tools sometimes by as much as a quarter or so. So that made those statements maybe not inconsistent, and that’s kind of why we’re thinking about it. I mean, I guess, our view, everybody in this environment will have a slightly different view in spending to come back. But we’re wanting to state at this point that our best view from conversations with customers is no material increase in memory spending throughout 2019. Yes. I don’t have anything to really add, Krish. I think as Tim said, litho usually leads our stuff. And we’ll tell you what we’re seeing right now. We could have it wrong. But when we parsed what we heard from ASML, I didn’t really feel inconsistent to us. Got it, got it. Actually, that’s very helpful, Tim and Doug. As a follow-up question, when you talk to your memory customers, I’m kind of curious how do they look at CapEx? Are they waiting for their pricing/margins to bottom before they start getting comfortable about buying semi cap equipment? Or is it going to be in tandem? Or does one lead the other? And as a subset to that, which thing is going to recover first from here onwards in NAND or DRAM? Thank you. Well. It’s a tough question. I mean I think that actually, when they’re going to spend is a question better asked to them. I mean, exactly what metrics they’re looking at. I guess, if we look at which of the two, NAND or DRAM might recover earlier, I mean I guess, if we look back, we saw NAND correction starting earlier in 2018 than DRAM did. And so we’re – I guess, at the end of the day, it’s all about demand. But we see both of them tracking as we get to the end of the year, well below what we think are the long-term demand growth bit rates. So either one could recover. Neither one could recover. I mean that’s – it’s not a great view, but we think that in both cases, the market sets up for investment in either one as we exit the year. Well, what I would tell you, my personal view, Krish. It will recover at some point. That I know for sure. And the trend we see relative to spending in the year that we just described suggests to what Tim and I that they’re going to need to invest relative to long-term bit demand. We just don’t necessarily see it happening in 2019 quite yet, at least not in a meaningful way. Got it. Thanks, Tim. Thanks, Doug. Thanks, Krish. Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question and thanks for the detail and outlook for 2019. But can you guys just true us up on your prior view first half of 2019 versus the second half of last year? Relative to the weak spending environment, how are you seeing the first half of this year relative to last year second half? Yes. Harlan, what I tried to described in my remarks is first half of 2019 now looks weaker than it previously did. And I’m not going to give quantification of it because then I’d essentially be guiding you for two quarters. We’re going to get back to our normal practice of guiding one quarter at a time. But given the well-understood weakness of smartphones and inventory adjustments in some of our customers as well as the cloud guys, it’s somewhat weaker than it was when we describe it last time. Great, appreciate the insights there. And given the view on WFE being down kind of mid to high-teens this year, at the same time, the team had a strong shipment growth the last couple of years. You were driving – I was looking at it first half of last year, you guys were driving like 25% year-over-year shipment growth. Many of these tools are coming off warranty and on to service contracts this year. So this should be a tailwind for the team. So how should we think about the installed base business trajectory relative to your WFE outlook? Well, I guess, I’ll try to cover some of that in my opening remarks. But clearly, we feel very good about our installed base business on two dimensions. One, the strengths of Lam’s business over the last several years has caused our overall installed base to grow. So there is more tools for which we can sell things. And two, we’ve been investing in that business to create new products and services. Some in the areas of vis-à-vis the data economy, using data to make our tools more productive for customers. And those products and services are getting traction, and this will be another strong year for CSBG for our installed base business. So that’s a focus of mine, and I think it provides a very important revenue stream for the company long-term. Yes, thanks for the insights. Yes. Thanks, Harlan. Our next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Great, thank you. On that topic of installed base business, I wonder if you guys have considered providing sort of better disclosure around that? It seems like that will go a long way towards understanding the sustainability of that business versus the other parts of the business. Yes, I guess, we haven’t really accomplished our objective very well, Joe. We’ve been talking a lot more about it more recently than we have. We’re providing you with tools kind of the installed base on a consistent basis and I will try to make it easy to understand everything we talked about in the past. Relative to segment reporting, we’re not going to do that. We don’t need too, because we’re not tripping the roles up there. And from a competitive standpoint, we don’t necessarily want to have an out quite as visible unless we have to. But it is a meaningful part of how we generate profit. It’s a meaningful part of how we generate cash for sure. And we’re trying to talk more about it, so you understand it. I mean, Tim talked quite a bit about it. So we’ll keep trying to do a better job, Joe. Great, that’s helpful. And then I guess, in terms of the buyback and the pace of the buyback and 50% of free cash, what’s your assessment of the right amount of cash to have on the balance sheet? And do you need to have any? Can you be leveraged? How do you think long-term about what the balance sheet should look like? Yes, it’s a good question, Joe. I haven’t communicated specific numbers. We need a certain amount of cash. We like to be able to fund a certain amount of R&D and CapEx and so forth. We’re carrying more cash today than we need to run the company. What we decide to do relative to that, I think, we’ll evolve over time. But I don’t have a hard and fast number that I’m going to share with you necessarily. We certainly could have more debt on the balance sheet know if we chose to do that. And the pace of the buyback, I think we’re going to be opportunistic. I’m not going to communicate a timeframe and I will let you know quarter-by-quarter on how we’re thinking about it and what we’re doing. Very helpful. Thank you. Yes, thanks, Joe. Patrick Ho with Stifel has our next question. Thank you very much. Maybe first question in terms of the installed base business, I think in your last Analyst Day, you talked about $1 billion incremental opportunity. Over the next three to five years, how do you see the revenue growth rate? Is this a 10% type of growth business? Or do you see a higher to get to that incremental billion dollars you talked about? Well, I guess – yes, so you recall the billion-dollar number. I mean, as I mentioned, we’re on – we feel we are on track for that trajectory. At the Investor Day, we said that the installed base business was approximately 25% of our total revenue. And so, I guess, with that information, you kind of healthy growth rate. It’s a business that is definitely growing. Our objective is to have the installed base business itself grow faster than the rate of growth at the installed base. And now again, we provide information this year with the installed base growing from approximately 50,000 chambers to an ending – year ending 56,000 chambers at the end of last year. So maybe with those, you can triangulate the numbers. We can also maybe do it for you and get back to you. Yes. Patrick, how I think about it and Tim described it the way I think about it, which is on a normalized rate, it’s been about 25% of the company’s business. If you recall back at the Investor Day, Tim described three growth vectors, each about the same size. So if you think about installed base, it’s a third of the growth and normalized at 25% of the business, so you can triangulate that way relative to the growth at that. It will grow faster than the installed base for sure. Now in the year like 2019, if it shapes up the way perhaps, it’s going to with WFE down as much. It will be more than 25%, obviously. I think one important point since we’re talking about installed base business. I just mentioned, I think it can sometimes get lost in terms of how we are driving this business faster than the installed base itself is growing. And it all comes down to investing in the creation of new products and services. Things that help the customer relocate tools for new applications, extend the technology for those toolsets the new applications, higher productivity, higher throughput from owned assets. And as we’ve seen in many ways, the lagging node business gets stronger and more heavily utilized. We find a lot of installed base business for tools that have been around and out in the field for quite a number of years. We have just lot of interest in getting new products and services for that fleet. So it’s a pretty attractive business. Great. That’s also very helpful. Go ahead. If you can do one more, if you got it, Patrick. Real quick on the DRAM on the memory side of things, we know that capital intensity trends increase on the 3D NAND side of things with the layer count. How do you see the transition for etch and deposition as you go from 1x to 1y and eventually to 1z? Our SAM continues to grow as we step through that. That’s all about self-aligned patterning and that is very etch and deposition SAM, Patrick. Yes. And actually, these technology nodes also create new opportunities for films. I mean I spoke a little bit about our effort in atomic layer deposition. As you step from 1x to 1y to 1z, there are new applications being created for atomic layer deposition for instance that wouldn’t have existed in prior nodes. And so we’re looking at it both from growth in our existing applications as well as our ability to win new ones also. Thank you. Yes, thanks, Patrick. We’ll now hear from Atif Malik with Citi. Hi, thanks for taking my question. First, quick clarification on the last earnings call, you guys expected DRAM up in first half this year versus second half last year and NAND down. Is it fair to say that you’re seeing both the DRAM and NAND down in first half of this year versus second half last year? Yes. We’re not going to provide segment level color on the quarterly guide except we gave a little color on how we see WFE setting up in that [indiscernible] like, which is foundry logic is first half weighted. Memory, probably a little bit stronger than the second half. Got it. And then can you just talk about what you seeing with respect to domestic spending in China? If I recall correctly, you have talked about China domestic was $5 billion in spending last year. What could it be in the $42 billion to $43 billion WFE this year? Yes. Actually, we did say that we saw 2018 was going to come in at about a $5 billion range. I think when all is said and done, it may have come in a little bit lower than that but pretty close. We actually see 2019 shaping up to be a bit stronger. And if we look actually at the SAM and share position that we hold where the money will be spent this year NAND’s China domestic business should be up. Thanks. Thanks Atif. Tom Diffely with D. A. Davidson Companies has our next question. Yes, good afternoon. Maybe just a quick end market question, you know after three or four quarters of the price declines in the NAND market, are you seeing evidence of the elasticity of demand that we’ve been talking about for a couple of years? Yes, I had a very small comment in my opening remarks about the fact that we believe we have seen some demand elasticity at the end of last year and it was primarily driven by an uptick that we’ve seen in the adoption rate of SSDs into client. And there was some data to show the percentage of laptops or client devices with the SSD in the lower price ranges had a material uptick. And so it’s just one data point, but we do think that as prices have come down we’re starting to see increased demand. Okay. And given that when you look at kind of the long-term view, the next two to five years, do you still – or do you view NAND market as the real big opportunity for you versus the DRAM market knowing that both our strong? Both for us without doubt. Our SAM position if you think may be just the world we’ve gone through, the transition from 2D to 3D NAND, we had a very meaningful increase in the intensity of etch and deposition in that space. And when you think about also end-demand, we see NAND outpacing all other markets. And so that’s why when I talk about our focus on applications that we want to hold continuously in that critical space in the NAND area.
Now, of course, we want to do well in all markets, but NAND is our biggest opportunity going forward and in the long term. Just, add-on from me Tom, independent of where things are at in 2019, I’m extraordinarily optimistic on the opportunity for both NAND as well as DRAM going forward. Again, Tim alluded to the data economy. We talked about that extensively at the Investor Day. All of that stuff is still completely intact. It doesn’t mean it will happen every single year, it won’t. But data is exploding in society. It is not useful unless you can store it and you need a low latency memory to do anything in computer architectures. Memory is critically enabling for all of that and none of that has changed. Great. Thank you very much. Thanks Tom. Our next question comes from Quinn Bolton with Needham and Company. Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. Just want to come back on your prepared comments. You mentioned share gains and high aspect ratio at 3D NAND deposition and ALD wins in both NAND and DRAM. Can those share gains help offset some of the SAM underperformance you see in 2019 or do you really think that that we need to see the memory markets recovering before you see the full benefit of those share gains? Well simple answer is no. They cannot offset the magnitude of decline that we see this year. But the other aspect that is one of timing. Typically, the types of applications and wins I was speaking to, we focus on critical application wins, usually one to two nodes before that node ever ends up ramping. And so in the majority of those cases those would be entering production sometime next year or the following either. And that’s why the start of like – those are the applications once you win it you kind of know that your businesses is pretty well locked in for the foreseeable future. Just a quick follow-up on the China domestic is that fairly well balanced between memory and foundry logic or just one segment lead the other end in 2019? It’s fairly well balanced. Quinn, I mean, memory is probably somewhat stronger than foundry logic, but there’s a broad base set of customers that are spending it’s not just one or two. Great, thank you. Thanks Quinn. Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank has our next question. Well thanks for taking my question. I will start off with a clarification you said revenue will be first halfway weighted in 2019. Is that an expectation for your revenue or is it for the industry? No, it was a statement Sidney around WFE. I didn’t say anything relative to Lams revenue. It was a statement on WFE. Okay, great. And then my question, it looks like from three months ago to now the change is primarily coming from the DRAM side CapEx slowing down. Would you say the NAND side is also incrementally weaker or do you think there’s more stability there and then NAND CapEx everyday you start cutting earlier? Well, we haven’t, so far Sidney in the past, given you any color on the full year of 2019 this is first time we’re making statements on the full year or so I’m not sure I can’t even say anything about trajectory what we thought before because we hadn’t done all the full analytic work that we’ve now have done on 2019. All right, maybe just a housekeeping one. Your operating expense is obviously much lower than what you guided for the December quarter, understanding March is an extra week, should we think about June quarter kind of go back to the December level or is it just something higher than that? Yes, I’m not going to guide it beyond the current quarter Sidney, everything else equal, flattish to maybe slightly down if you just take the one week out, but we’ll give you the hard guidance when we get to earnings in the quarter. Okay. All right, thank you very much. Yes. Thanks Sydney. We’ll hear now from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I just had one on kind of your commentary in the back half in memory dynamics. So I guess what is the reason why there wouldn’t be a significant increase in investment when you move to 96-Layer technology? Is that because the majority of the WFE spend or the increase in memory spend is because of the planar NAND transition or 3D NAND transition or is it because there’s something special about 96 and makes it a lower investment cycle? No, there’s nothing special about 96 what we see happening, Mitch primarily is node conversions in both DRAM as well as 3D NAND and so that’s the way to be thinking about it. It’s a heavy focus of spending on node conversions which – that’s a very cost effective way for our customers to invest because they just need to upgrade essentially etch and deposition equipment or add into the process flow. Tim, would you add anything? No, I think that’s fair obviously it’s heavily driven by the ratio of node conversions to greenfield ads. On a greenfield basis, last year I showed a chart that described our increase in opportunity at 96-Layer and fundamentally on a greenfield basis, it’s significantly higher as you go to 96. So the dynamic of the conversion versus greenfield ads that’s Doug speaking to. Perfect. Thank you. Yes, thanks Mitch. Operator, we’re going to do one more. So now our final question will come from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho Bank. Hi guys, good quarter. Just on your 2019, just wondering, when you look at 96-Layer 3D NAND, what do you – how do you see capital intensity at 64 versus 96? If you do a greenfield-to-greenfield wafer, our capital intensity goes up, you’ve got a longer process flow, you’ve more tools and the process flow goes up. I don’t think we’ve quantified it. The good part for our business is when you do that conversion, all you’re really adding is etch and deposition equipment, you’re making the stack bigger and the etch becomes a little bit more challenging to do and so it takes longer. Okay. And just as you talk about a little bit more softness in memory spending through the year have you seen – are you seeing any push out on either the 96 layer three 3D NAND or 1Y transition in DRAM side? Thanks. From a timing standpoint, no, I mean we always had expected 2019 would be a 1Y investment year in DRAM with the, the beginning of 1Z and the investments in NAND would be on 96 layer devices and that’s totally what we’re saying and again, it’s primarily focused on conversions right now. Got it thanks. Yes, thank you. Okay, so this concludes our conference call for this quarter. Thank you for joining us. This will conclude today’s conference call. Thank you for your participation.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Tina Correia, CVP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am. Thank you, and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to the Lam Research Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Tim Archer, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Doug Bettinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During today's call, we will share our overview on the business environment and review our financial results for the March 2019 quarter, and our outlook for the June 2019 quarter. The press release detailing our financial results was distributed a little after 1:00 P.M. Pacific Time this afternoon. The release can also be found on the Investor Relations section of the Company's website along with the presentation slides that accompany today's call.
Today's presentation and Q&A includes forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the Risk Factors disclosures of our SEC public filings. Please see accompanying slides in the presentation for additional information. Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release. This call is scheduled to last until 3:00 P.M. Pacific Time. A replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website.
With that let me hand the call over to Tim. Thanks, Tina and hello everyone. After Doug and I go through our prepared comments, we look forward to your questions. Lam delivered a solid March quarter and continued to demonstrate strong execution in a challenging near-term industry environment. Key metrics including revenue, gross margin and operating income margin, all came in above the midpoint of guidance that we gave on our last earnings call. EPS of $3.70 exceeded the high-end of our range helped by a favorable tax rate and the benefit of ongoing share repurchases. This performance and continued execution in the business is attributable to the support of our customers and partners, and as always, the exceptional efforts of Lam employees around the world.
Turning now to our perspective on the current industry environment and outlook. Industry conditions are directionally unchanged from our January call. We continue to expect customer WFE spending for calendar year 2019 to be in the low $40 billion. Though since our last call, we now see a marginal downtick in Memory spending offset by slightly better expectations in Foundry and Logic. Also consistent with our prior commentary, we expect Memory supply growth as we exit 2019 to be below the long-term demand trend line for both, NAND and DRAM.
In DRAM we continue to believe the spending correction will extend through this calendar year as customers continue to rationalize long-term profitability with near-term focus on reducing channel inventories and bringing supply and demand dynamics into balance business [ph]. In NAND, recent industry data indicates that bit shipments where better than normal seasonal trends for the February month, and we continue to believe that market conditions are setting up well for future recovery as demand and supply balance improves through the year.
On the Foundry and Logic side 2019 WFE spending is slightly higher than our prior baseline as customers appear to be ramping leading etch notes faster than we previously forecast which we believe is partly due to increased semiconductor content in smartphones related to 5G. While predicting the exact timing of cyclical change is always difficult, our confidence in the long-term demand drivers for Lam's business is unchanged. We're positioning Lam to capitalize on long-term demand through execution on our three growth vectors of served available market expansion, share gains, and revenue generation from our installed base.
Semiconductor demand drivers such as Industry 4.0, Artificial Intelligence, 5G and IoT are creating compelling served available market expansion opportunities for Lam; all require innovations in the transmission, processing and storage of data using a minimum number of computed cycles at lower power and lower costs. This is leading to changes in compute system architecture and driving growth in new on-chip and off-chip memory designs. Key trends include the use of high-bandwidth memory interfaces for leading accelerator designs, heterogeneous integration for system on chip solution, and the move to MRAM for embedded memories.
I would like to provide a few specific examples of how Lam is set to benefit from these trends. First, new memory devices like GDDR6 improved bandwidth by adding among other things more bit lines which increases etching deposition intensity. Second, high-bandwidth memory and heterogeneous packaging integration are driving an increased need for through-silicon vias and other novel wafer level packaging technologies. Lam's SABRE 3D electroplating and Syndion etch tools are recognized technology and market leaders in the TSV market and provides a stable etch depth and VSL capability required for high-volume production. For wafer level packaging, the market-leading SABRE 3D system delivers technology-enabling co-planarity on our production-proven platform.
And third, emerging memory devices such as MRAM are employing novel materials which require the introduction of new ion beam etch technology. Lam's ion-beam etch technology is differentiated by it's control over both, ion energy and angle to deliver superior device profiles and ultimately increased yield and bit density for our customers. Broadly, we believe the product and services portfolio of Lam Research is unmatched in it's fit to these emerging technology inflections, and our focus is to deliver disruptive customer-enabling technologies to expand our served available market.
From a market share perspective, we continue to perform well on penetration and defense activities. In the first calendar quarter, we successfully defended all key positions in addition to winning multiple new opportunities, and we remain committed to our goal of growing market share in both, etch and deposition. Our confidence in our share gain opportunity is rooted in fundamental product architecture and technology differentiation. Lam's unique quad-station model or QSM is rapidly becoming the process chamber architecture of choice for 3D NAND. The QSM serves as the core high-productivity platform on which Lam's process teams build differentiated 3D NAND Technology Solutions. Examples where the QSM is delivering a capability advantage for our customers include our market-leading films for the ON-ON (ph) STACK, wafer bow management using backside deposition, new ALD films for high-aspect ratio gap fill, and low-resistivity tungsten fill for word line.
Our ability to deliver compelling technology and productivity including fab-space saving using the QSM architecture is unparalleled. We hit a milestone this quarter with our 7,000 module shipped, a metric that signifies the growing importance of this platform for 3D NAND and other markets.
In Logic and Foundry, gate contacts and interconnect layers require new materials for better device performance, reliability and scaling beyond 10-nanometer. In recent engagements we have shown our ability to leverage Lam's long-held leadership position in copper electroplating to win applications for new materials such as cobalt as leading etch notes. And in Memory, we continue to penetrate key semi-critical etch positions through our focus on productivity innovation. An example of this focus is the separate press release we issued today stating that in partnership with a leading semiconductor manufacturer we have successfully demonstrated one full year of uninterrupted production on Kiyo Etch System equipped with a unique productivity focused hardware set. We believe the Kiyo Etch System utilizing our Corvus R technology ushers in a new era of self-maintaining equipment.
Today's announcement is also a demonstration of Lam's commitment to leverage Industry 4.0 technologies, advanced computing and Big Data to bring innovative products and services to our customers.
And finally, in our Customer Support Business Group, we saw continued sequential growth in revenues we drive from our installed base. Our Reliant Systems business grew strongly in the March quarter reaching it's highest quarterly revenue level in our history. This was driven primarily by investments in non-leading etch notes in Foundry, as well as spending on more and more in IoT initiatives. Overall, our installed base business is on-track to deliver another record year, growing again at a rate faster than the installed base.
In summary, Lam is well positioned to capitalize on the long-term demand drivers in the semiconductor industry. We are performing well in a challenging near-term industry environment. And by continuing to focus on execution and investing to meet our growth objectives, we believe we will emerge stronger as WFE spending recovers.
With that let me turn the call over to Doug for his prepared remarks. Great. Thanks, Tim. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today on what I know is a busy earnings season. Lam executed well in the March quarter with our results exceeding the midpoint of guidance for all financial metrics.
Earnings per share exceeded the high-end of the guidance range that we provided mainly due to a lower tax rate that we realized in the quarter. We had a more favorable tax benefit from our annual employee stock grant investing due to the increase in our stock price during the March quarter. I'd also like to highlight that during the March quarter our cash from operations came in at $933 million which on a quarterly basis is the second highest cash generation in the history of Lam Research.
As we discussed during our last quarter earnings call, we believe WFE spending for the first half of 2019 would reflect lower memory spending levels and spending would be driven more by Foundry and Logic investments. Our view today is largely unchanged. Full year 2019 Foundry and Logic WFE might be a little bit stronger than we expected a quarter ago, and DRAM might be a little bit weaker. We continue to expect WFE will be down in the mid to high-teens percent year-over-year from 2018. WFE spending as a percentage of semi-industry profit dollars has been running at a fairly consistent level over the last several years. We continue to track a double-digit number of new fab projects this year spending leading etch Foundry, Memory and IoT driven legacy notes.
Overall, Lam's system revenue for the combined Memory segment decreased to 61% of total system's revenue from the 79% we saw in the December quarter. The composition of the Memory segment was mostly driven by conversions and included non-volatile Memory spending at 40% and DRAM spending at 21%. NAND spending continues to be focused on both, 6x and 9x layer wafers, and DRAM spending is focused on the 1x and 1y notes. The Foundry segment more than doubled quarter-over-quarter accounting for 27% of system revenue which is the highest level in Foundry we've seen since March of 2017. Foundry spending in 2019 is focused on 7-nanometer and 5-nanometer. As a comparison the profile in 2017 was target at 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer notes. And finally, the Logic and other segment was also up contributing 12% of systems revenue.
Let's turn to the P&L performance for the March quarter. We delivered revenues of $2.439 billion which was down slightly from the December quarter and above the midpoint of the March guidance we've provided. Gross margin for the quarter came in at 45.1%; we came in slightly better-than-expected, primarily due to product mix and spending control. And as I always do, I'll remind you that our actual gross margins are a function of several factors such as business volumes, product mix and customer concentration, and you should expect to see variability quarter-over-quarter.
Operating expenses in the March quarter were $488 million which increased by approximately 11% from the prior quarter. Spending in the March quarter was negatively impacted by the appreciation of the stock market during the quarter and the resulting impact on the cost of our deferred compensation plan. We do hedge this to mitigate the exposure; however the offset to this expense shows up in other income and expense. It's neutral to earnings per share at the end of the day. R&D investments continue to be a focus for us with R&D comprising nearly two-thirds of our spending in the March quarter. In June total operating expenses are expected to be lower on a sequential basis compared to the March quarter.
I'd also just point out one spending item that you'll see in the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation table of our press release. We incurred a charge of approximately $11 million related to severance payments for a workforce action we took during the March quarter. Operating income in the March quarter was $611 million and operating margin was 25.1%, pretty much in line with the midpoint of the guidance range. The non-GAAP tax rate for the March quarter was approximately 8% which is lower than our long-term rate due to the tax benefits related to the employee stock investing that I described earlier. For the June quarter in 2019 calendar year, we continue to expect the tax rate in the low to mid-teens and there will be fluctuations in this rate quarter-by-quarter.
In March we completed the issuance of $2.5 billion in principal value of senior notes as we decided to take advantage of a favorable interest rate and credit environment. The note proceeds are for general corporate purposes including among other things to fund our stock repurchase program and to pay dividends. For other income and expense, our newly issued debt added approximately $8 million in interest expense for the March quarter. However as I pointed out, this was offset in OINE by gains on assets related to obligations under our deferred compensation plan.
Going forward, we expect to have approximately $26 million of quarterly interest expense related to our new debt. In total, interest expense on a quarterly basis is now around $45 million. We continue to demonstrate our commitment to capital return during the quarter funding more than $1 billion in dividends and share repurchases. For the March quarter we paid out $171 million in dividends and we completed $862 million in share buybacks through a combination of open market and structured repurchases. These repurchases were made under the new $5 billion authorization that we announced at our earnings call in January.
And I'd just point out to you that in the last year we have lowered quarterly diluted share count by approximately 20 million shares; that's over 11% reduction. Earnings per share came in at $3.70 which was over our guidance range for the March quarter, mainly driven by that favorable tax rate. Diluted shares per EPS were 158 million shares which reflects a decrease from the September quarter related to the share buyback program. The share count includes a dilutive impact of approximately 5 million shares from the remaining 2041 convertible notes in the March quarter. And I'll remind you the dilution schedules for the remaining 2041 convertible notes is available on our Investor Relations website for your reference.
Let me now turn to the balance sheet. Our cash and short-term investments including restricted cash increased notably in the March quarter to $6.4 billion from $3.9 billion in the prior quarter. This was driven by the $2.5 billion debt issuance that I mentioned, and the over $900 million operational cash flow. DSO improved by six days to 61 days. Our inventory levels decreased and consequently inventory turns increased to 3.4 times compared to 3.2 times in the prior quarter. Company non-cash expenses included approximately $53 million for equity compensation, $46 million for depreciation and $36 million for amortization.
Capital expenditures were $76 million in the March quarter which was a decrease from $106 million in the December quarter. Due the timing of certain projects December quarter CapEx was somewhat on the high side and the decrease in the March quarter was in line with our expectations. The majority of the CapEx in March was directed towards investment supporting our installed base business. We exited the March quarter with approximately 10,800 regular full-time employees which is down slightly from the prior quarter due to the workforce action that I previously mentioned. For the long-term we continue to prioritize headcount that is supporting Lam's SAM expansion, market share gains, and installed base business growth.
Looking ahead, I'd now like to provide our non-GAAP guidance for the June 2019 quarter. We're expecting revenues of $2.350 billion, plus or minus $150 million; gross margin of 45.5%, plus or minus one percentage point; operating margins of 26%, plus or minus one percentage point. And finally, earnings per share of $3.40, plus or minus $0.20 based on the share count of approximately 155 million shares.
Operator, that concludes my prepared remarks. Tim and I would now like to open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Hi guys, this is Adaa (ph) calling in for John. I was wondering if you could maybe talk through what your OpEx trajectory is looking like for the remainder of the year given the lumpiness that we saw in March? Yes. I mean we only really guide this one quarter at that time. The best -- I guess, the way I would give you to think about it is, it's going to be plus or minus where we're at in the June quarter. But again, we only formally guided numerically one quarter at a time. Thank you. And then, if you could maybe provide us with an updated view of the domestic China opportunity where you think that looks like this year in terms of WFE and then your puts and takes around that given the macro situation? Sure, I can do that. We said on our last call actually that we had expected China domestic WFE this year to be little more -- greater than $5 billion, we haven't changed our view on that. And our position in China, we've also said is a bit stronger or at least as strong as elsewhere in the world, so we gave guidance on the last call that our business in domestic China would be up as well. You know, there really has been also no change in the regulatory environment that is impacting our results and while we're monitoring it closely, we don't really expect any effect on our business at this point. We will now take a question from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question, you had given the backdrop of weak pricing across both segments in Memory; I think it's a great job on your part in terms of getting what I imagine roughly $1 billion plus per quarter in total shipments just on technology buzz alone. And so I guess the question is, as you look into the back half of the year and you think about the transition 96-layer and if we take into account what we've heard from ASML in terms of a second half ramp (inaudible). How should we think about that trajectory? Are there green chutes there into the back half for the year or is that something that would shine in the first half of 2019 -- 2020, sorry? Yes. Tim and I will take it a little bit I think. You know, C.J. our outlook isn't really changed at all from what we communicated at earnings a quarter ago. We don't see a recovery in Memory this year, we do think it sets up well for -- what -- likely happens in 2020. We expect the exit rate of supply in both, NAND and DRAM to be under where demand is, meaning it's consuming some of the inventory which I think sets us up well, but we really don't see a meaningful recovery or recovery at all this year. Tim, you want to add anything? No, I think that's -- it's a very clear statement of our position. We've been saying that we really don't see the recovery this year. You mentioned a couple of other items though like the 96-layer conversion and I guess from the standpoint of the job we're doing, you know, Lam is squarely focused in the middle of technology conversations and technology conversions are great way for customers to reduce their cost, increase their capability through cycles like this. And so Lam is just focused on helping our customers execute those technology conversions and when they come and there is capacity additions that will be as you say an additional green chute. But right now we've said, we don't see that right now through this year. And C.J., just maybe one more comment from me. As I've said here and I think -- I do know it recovers at some point whether it's later in this year or early next year to me is somewhat interesting from a timing standpoint but obviously it will recover at some point. The industry is working through inventory in the channel and that will take some time, and at some point investment will be more than it is right now. Okay, very helpful. And as a follow-up; considering the magnitude of the debt offering in the quarter can you kind of walk through what net cash or gross cash rather you need to run the business? And are you contemplating perhaps a more aggressive buyback with the funds? Thank you. Yes. C.J., nothing new to communicate relative to the buyback. We just announced the $5 billion a quarter ago, we executed $862 million last quarter, we view this as a favorable debt market as I described in my prepared remarks relative to rates and credit demand and whatnot, we've decided to take advantage of that. It really doesn't impact too much how I'm thinking about the timing of the buyback, the quantum of the buyback. Obviously, I think we've been pretty judicious with returning cash to shareholders in the past and will continue to do so in the future but I don't really have anything new to tell you except that that debt issuance helps fund what we plan to do. Thanks C.J. We'll now take a question from Atif Malik with Citi. Hi, thanks for taking my question and good job in a tough environment. Tim, I have a question on your market share. We all understand and WFE share is a complicated mix of end market, your customer mix; the Gartner data came out today and it shows your WFE share declined modestly last year. I just wanted to understand moving forward as EUV becomes a little bit bigger push and off the Logic spending, what are the things that you can do with your products that can offset -- kind of the natural headwind from EUV?
And then looking beyond one to two years, when I was at SPIE Conference, there was a lot of discussion on horizontal nanotubes or nanosheets being used for 3-nanometer Logic devices similar to what we have seen from 2D to 3D NAND migration. So just your thoughts in terms of when your Logic share can start to improve because of architectural changes? Thank you. Okay, sure. Lot of great questions in there, so I'll do my best. I mean, first, maybe just taking kind of the share question head-on. Obviously we looked at the Gartner report, note, we will be the first to acknowledge we don't win everything we compete for. But I want to point out, we feel -- when we think about market share we feel very good about what we've accomplished in last few years relative to our positions in critical applications. You know, critical applications are the hardest to win but once you have them, they are also the stickiest; I mean they are the applications that our customers are least likely to change. And -- so we really did, we focused on those and we made sure that in key fast-growing segments of WFE like 3D NAND, we made sure that we secured those critical applications because that's really the foundation on which we then can go build everything else. And those are the applications that get you closely collaborating with customers.
I think when you think about share, I've said -- I said it last time and I'll say it again, I want us to do better in the semi-critical applications. But again, yet after the critical application foundation first, then you build semi-critical on top of that. What can we do in that area? A lot of that is you just saw in this press release. We're focused on productivity innovation, and as our customer scale up and you see it this year with focus on the pricing environment and spending environment in the Memory, productivity innovation is welcomed by our customers. So semi-critical is usually a battlefield of our productivity, the press release about the Kiyo Etch with Corvus R. I think Lam will continue to try to set benchmarks for productivity in this space and that will drive share for us.
Those are all things that are within our control. Things that are not so much within our control; device mix, and so just to point out as you look at some element of spending last year what took place was that 2017 to 2018 saw a significant increase in DRAM WFE and not such a large increase in -- in fact, almost no increase in NAND WFE by our calculation. So again, based on choices we've made in strategic positioning, we have positioned Lam to be extremely strong in 3D NAND and I think you all know that. And so some years it will go -- some years it doesn't work out quite as well. Now -- but we feel really good, and quite honestly, I wouldn't trade our position we have right now for anybody else's.
Now your point about Logic, kind of -- just finish on that one. We intend to improve, we're always investing to improve our position across the entire spectrum of applications. I'm not -- I won't play my (ph) expert on your 3-nanometer horizontal nanosheet's application note but we have our CTO office looking at every new inflection that comes and those inflections how we've proven our ability to use those inflections as a share gain opportunities for ourselves and we'll continue to do so. So hopefully that answers your question. Thanks. We'll go to a question from Patrick Ho with Stifel. Thank you very much. Tim, maybe first off in terms of the 2019 outlook. You detailed about the memory outlook remaining pretty much muted through the rest of this year. I guess what are some of the key variables the investors should look out for whether it be in NAND and DRAM, is it just the pricing environment? Is it the inventory situation? What are some of the key variables that you guys are monitoring that will lead to a change or a turn in positive spending for the Memory market? Okay. Yes, I mean it's a great question. I mean, it's one we're asking ourselves all the time, every day. Our customers have a much better view on what their strategies are and what the trigger points are for them to begin investing. But what we're trying to say is that at least from our view what's happening right now is very rational, I mean the pricing environment -- we've seen some talk about taking small amounts of capacity offline, these are all things that we believe will accelerate in improvement in the supply-and-demand balance. So we just watch -- we're watching those, we're talking to customers continuously. And what we're making sure is that regardless as Doug said, we know it's going to come back, I talked about a lot of the demand drivers. There is no question for us about when -- whether Memory comes back, and so we're just focused on staying close to customers and making sure that when they do want to place orders for tools, there is no limitation in our ability to ship to them on the dates they want the systems. Patrick, this is Doug. How I think about it is that I think we all understand there is inventory in the channel, there is inventory with the hyperscale guys, there is inventory with our customers that needs to clear itself out. And we can all do our best to model that, you can do it as well as we can; obviously, we model it, I know you do too. To me when I think about pricing, pricing is an indication of how supply and demand are clearing and until all the inventory is worked out, a lot of what you're seeing in pricing will be determined by how that inventory is moving through the channel; so you got to pay attention to that because that tells you how things are clearing out. And as Tim said, at some point it will clear up and we're all waiting to see when that does. Right. And as my follow-up question for you Doug; I know you've talked about the installed base business as being kind of a hidden growth driver for the Company and we've seen it now over the last couple of years. Can you just qualitatively perhaps give a little bit of color of both where the leading edges installed base continues to grow obviously with more shipments to 3D NAND and that front, as well as some of the opportunities on a trailing etch where you're saying upgrades, productivity improvements. Can you just give a little bit of color of how much that installed base growth is driven from both, leading etch versus trailing etch? I mean a lot of it Patrick is leading-etch stuff, right, that tends to be the most technically complex chambers we have in the field and as a result it tends to consume more spare parts than stuff that's out in the field. But as we've talked about in the past, our tools will run for decades, that's a great part about this business, and this part of the business model is -- things need to be upgraded, things need to be maintained, they all need spare parts on a regular basis. At some point one customer might be done with the tool, he will buy it back, refurbish it, sell it to somebody else; so there is a very long tail to the profit generation from the stuff in the field, that's how I think about it. And we've described this in the past as being roughly a quarter of the company's business. Now in a year like this year when new equipment sales are down as much as it is, it will be more than that obviously, likely this year well north of 30%. And so that's a great part of the business this year is, this is actually growing this year Patrick; so it just keeps going. Tim, would you add anything? Yes, I think the only thing I would add is, maybe even to reinforce Doug's point about the performance in this business this year; this is the kind of business that quite often when our customers are looking for opportunities to increase their capability without having to go to that next increment which is to actually add capacity which is definitely their mindset right now this year. They turn to us for productivity upgrades, capability upgrades, services that help them get more out of the existing installed base and that's what this whole business is intended to do, is to help them leverage the tools that they've already put in place and probably it's kind of a win-win but it means that in the year like this year it's a very good business. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Thank you very much. So I had two. I guess, Tim first, I wanted to dovetail on the answer that you've just had. And obviously, you guys are a great leverage to 3D NAND but I still get a lot of questions sort of on capital intensity and what your share is of the wallet in the layer migration world versus kind of a planner to a 3D conversion world. So, can you sort of help us baseline that sort of per 1K or per 10K; how much you think the WFE spending is and what's your capture is of that wallet? What I'd -- here is what I'd say; I mean, it's a great question and maybe I'll refer back to few other things we've said, and we can then see how close we can get to the level of detail you're looking for. Obviously, we participate as you're talking specifically for layer conversions and 3D NAND; we participate quite significantly in the technologies that are required to make the stack taller, right, basically to increase the density. So we're talking about going from say 64-layer to 96-layer. I don't believe and Doug can correct me if we have, but I don't believe we've actually quantified exactly what we think our share of that spend is externally. Yes, we haven't quantified it numerically. Clearly, we've done it internally, we understand that all. What we did show at the Investor Day last year was that -- obviously for a greenfield investment Lam's opportunity increases meaningfully at every layer of transition as you might expect. I mean you're building a taller stack and it's the taller stacks, deeper etches, the new films that -- I mentioned one; you know, when you get to a taller stack, these new films are required to control wafer bow (ph), are critical to being able to build those taller stacks on the wafer and still be able to process and yield the wafer. Those things do increase capital intensity for us when you're moving between layers. I think the other piece though that we did mention at Investor Day and I guess we can reiterate is that -- from a conversion perspective while the absolute dollars spent are less, our share of wallet as you'd say, our share of WFE actually increases quite significantly because the primary tools that are required to affect that layer transition are etch and depth heavy.
And so in a year like this when most of the attention is turned towards conversion it becomes a year in which maybe we would be achieving and obtaining a higher share of total spend in that area. But I know that doesn't quantify for you, but I don't believe we've done that externally, probably not prepared to do so today. Thanks, Tim. Yes, that was kind of where I was getting at, just layer migration versus the 2D to 3D world. So, thank you for that. And then Doug, just a quick follow-up; so on free cash flow payout I think you paid a little more than all of your free cash flow this quarter. Is that still the sort of payout all of your free cash flow going forward? And I guess the question really is on repo and how opportunistic you were when the stock was lower versus now that the stock is higher? Thanks. Yes, Tim. I mean our formally committed metric that we are committed to return is I think we did this at our Analyst Day last year is at least 50% of the free cash flow and your observation is exactly right, last quarter it was more than 100% and the last several years it's been close to 100%. The way I think about it is, we are opportunistic, we are sensitive to what we perceive fair value of our business to be and where things are trading, we announced at our last earnings call a new authorization, $5 billion, I didn't communicate the timeframe for that and we'll see as it goes. But obviously the fact that in the June quarter year regarding the share count down again, you know we're going to be the market again in June and I've described it as I think about it as being opportunistic. I'm not going to exactly say what that means but we do pay attention to the value of the stock as we're executing. We'll now take a question from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Hi, thanks for taking my question, I have two of them. First one, Tim just to touch upon the market share last year; it looks like you guys did lose some share, especially on dielectric etch (ph) in NAND versus tail and my understanding was that tail is going to two of the customers because of productivity. Just trying to figure out -- I mean, maybe the press release we had was probably related to that. Is there a way that loss can be stemmed or do you think your share gains in the more challenging channel whole etches will more than offset any weakness in the flip etch? And then I'll had a follow-up question for Doug. Well, I'm not going to talk about any specific applications but in general, my comments about semi-critical applications where both your technical capability to do the application as well as productivity are if not equally important certainly like in the mix of the decision that's an area where obviously it's more competitive. And what I'm basically messaging is, our Company is going to focus on delivering best-in-class products that are best-in-class both, for technology and productivity. In many areas we already do that, I talked about the QSM, the deposition tool for -- like the strata ON-ON tool; in terms of productivity it delivered the 3D NAND on many dimensions, cost per wafer, fab space per wafer out. These are all dimensions we're -- as we said we believe we're unparalleled in terms of productivity delivered. Some of the etch applications; we may have some room to go and so when you say can it be stemmed; it's an area of focus for us and I think our track record of both, equipment and process development in critical application demonstrates we have the capability to do it, we have the productivity know-how inside the company to do it as well, and though I will say I'm not overly concerned but it is somewhat coming from our strategy if we needed to ensure we were securing critical applications that will continue to pay -- offer us for many years to come first and I think now we can definitely take on some of the challenges we've had in semi-critical. Got it, that's helpful Tim. And then a follow-up for Doug. If I look at your OpEx and try to normalize it on a weekly basis given that March had an extra week in the quarter; it looks like the OpEx run rate really hasn't changed, it looks like it's about $35 million on a weekly basis. But you guys did takeout 150 headcount, so I'm just wondering was it more flexing on the COGS side or should we expect maybe a downside to OpEx going forward? Yes, I mean the best I'll give you prospectively is that we just got the June quarter. I don't know what it will be precisely, I'm not going to tell you September and December and beyond. What I said in response to an earlier question is the best guidance to give you is plus or minus where we are in June. And I think, Krish, in the first half of the year you have some unique things that happened the first, you're absolutely right, it was our 14-week quarter that occurs every six years, something like six years. We have that elective deferred compensation program, drive spending up that was offset in OINE. I don't anticipate that happens again, but if the market significantly moves you will see some permutations for things like that.
In the first half of the year also you get payroll taxes come in that go away later in the year. So that dynamic comes and goes and then quite honestly with our R& D spending it's based on programs and projects and schedules and it's not perfectly linear, it's not the same every single quarter, there will be some lumpiness to that and that's why we'll guide you quarter-by-quarter as we go. We're conscious of the profitability of the Company, obviously we're conscious of wanting to maintain that profitability, it's why we undertook the workforce action we did.
And the last thing I'd say is, part of that workforce action Krish was in cost of goods sold, it wasn't just in direct spending. So there is lots of things moving around. We'll now take a question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Good afternoon. Nice job on the quarterly execution. We're going to see the focus on semi-critical layer applications. The market doesn't tend to focus here a whole lot but there appears to be a lot of opportunity here as you mentioned where the team can win on attributes like productivity, reliability, tool footprint and all of this obviously have a significant impact on overall wafer cost for your customers. So, of the share gain targets that you guys have set forth in your 2021 model how much of this share capture is due to winning semi-critical applications? We haven't quantified it Harlan but a piece of it certainly is, a piece of it certainly is. And you know when I think about it is and what I hear Tim say all the time is, obviously, productivity is a technology challenge, right. The most productive platform doesn't necessarily mean the cheapest, it doesn't, right? You innovate in productivity, you innovate with the architectures as Tim talked about. You can win business at nice profitability which is what we're aspiring to do. Yes, it's a great question. Some element of it, I mean in many ways you're improving performance even on critical when you're working on things like artificial differentiation for semi-critical, so this isn't where you need to drive completely different attributes. I think it's just a natural part, especially in the 3D NAND space actually -- of how the technology has also evolved and matured as well. I mean, if you go back a couple of years ago, maybe there was a lot more focus on the technical enablement of 3D NAND, it meant a lot more applications looked critical. And I think now as it's matured we figure out which ones we can push the boundaries of our throughput and cost reduction in a way that we can make 3D NAND lower cost for our customers to produce and therefore maybe drive increased volume, I mean basically through elasticity.
So it's a focus of ours and like I said it's not something new; I mean the -- many of the deposition applications for a long time have competed in the semi-critical space and that's why you see unique tool plans that bring back up the QSM, architectural differentiation specifically for productivity, it's a winner. The Kiyo Etch and Corvus R announcement; Doug's point about almost every cost problem requires a technology solution, now that's a technology solution, I mean it may sound easy but the idea of a tool that can replace it's own hardware without human intervention, that's a technology solution to a cost and productivity problem. And I think it's just the first example of the types of things that we want to drive out of our technology organization focused on cost. Thanks for the insights there. And then as my follow-up, as your Memory customers continue to focus on profitability and free cash flow, they started off by cutting CapEx, now they are limiting supply to the market by building inventory and then more recently idealing (ph) capacity or even cutting wafer starts. I mean, now that utilization in fab activity does drive a part of your installed base business and so wondering if you can comment on whether or not you expect to see any potential impact of these customer actions on your services business on a go-forward basis? Yes, maybe a little bit Harlan. Honestly, as I think you well know, our spares consumption often -- well, not often is correlated with fab utilization; so if utilization comes down the consumption of spare parts will reduce a bit. Independent of that, we still see a nice growth here for the installed base. We still are going to deliver record levels of revenue and profits in that part of the business. So yes, we're still feeling great about what's going on. Tim, anything? No, no. I think I'd just point you back to the comment I made. The utilization portion that was what Doug was commenting on, obviously some work dependence there on utilization to things like spares and consumables etcetera. But I made the comment which I think is also shouldn't be lost; it's in years like this the customers are looking to us to help them improve the productivity of their installed tools through upgrades and services, and so you maybe getting a little bit of a balance between those two elements of our installed base business and that's why even in face of this business we're telling you we'll deliver a record year in installed base. We'll now take a question from Westin [ph] with KeyBanc. I actually wanted to follow-up on the installed base business. I'm wondering that if you have a significant slowdown until shipments this year; does that impact your installed base revenue growth trajectory next year and come more importantly, does it put that 2021 target model at risk? No, we're still tracking to where we want to be relative to the growth drivers in this business. You're right, if the growth of chambers slows there will be a lag effect to the growth of the installed base business but we're still feel really good about where we're headed here. Okay, that's helpful. And as a follow-up, you talk about the self-maintenance chamber, that's sounds really interesting. I'm wondering who would be the typical customer and is that something that could help you accelerate revenue growth next year as the Memory CapEx begins to recover? Well that's what we're doing. Yes, obviously it could apply to all applications; it's first application here was in a Memory focused etch application, and I think that we -- just again, it will be more sensitive to places where you're wanting to manage very high-volume production with minimal human intervention. I mean what it really does is, it allows us to not have to interrupt the tool by opening into replaced arps (ph). And so I guess any high-volume application could be a target for it. If it's successful as it's proving out right now then sure it represents a share gain opportunity for us, and therefore better position when spending recovers. All right, that's helpful. Just to clarify, so you think there will be a product in the marketplace next year helping generate revenue growth? Yes. Westin, it's in the market right now. Yes, that was the announcement whether it is manufacturing and manufacturing right now high-volume in manufacturing. We'll take our next question from Mitchell Steves with RBC. First one, during your prepared remarks you guys stated that you saw a little bit more softening in DRAM; but then you didn't have a comment on NAND. So my reason is mostly in between lines, I think maybe NAND price is bottoms high of DRAM or is that I guess a bad assumption to make? I mean, it's just read it be our outlook for NAND is unchanged. Okay, got it. And then secondly in terms of the China demand right now. And obviously has been a lot of growth in terms of what the impact has been between the tariffs. So (inaudible) kind of quantify the impact of the tariffs U.S.? Well, if you mean specifically the impact of the tariffs on Lam results -- what we have said is that we've been able to mitigate close to the point that they are included and reported in our financials and their part of our guidance and then I would say that they have been very minimal impact at this point. How to mitigate what might have occurred Mitch. It's gotten material impact on anything you're seeing from us right now. We'll now go to a question from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Tim, I'm wondering how is the visibility and outlook for the second half now versus what have thought quarter ago. We have heard from some of the Memory customers that they are expecting some optimism about the second half but the inventory situation is not getting much better. So I'm just wondering how you're looking at the second half what's on your dashboard as you look at visibility and at what point do you think you will be shipping demand? Has that view changed in the last quarter or so? Yes, it's a great question. We have been -- I mean where do we look at, I mean, we're said in constant contact with our customers. The message we delivered today and are delivering on this call is that there a year is playing out pretty much as we stated on the last call which is we cheese no meaningful recovery in Memory spending through this year. And we exit with supply growth meaningfully below the long-term demand both in DRAM and NAND. And so we have said 2019 is a year in nature kind of the balance of supply and demand and then inventory issues gets resolved in away that we exit the year and are set up for a much stronger outlook in 2020. That's what we said in January. I guess I'd say we just are a reiterating that we still see it playing out that way. And that's how we're looking at it. Yes, we'll give you one follow-up. Operator just a heads-up we have a time after this for one more call. So very quickly, I don't know whether you answered it before. But what's the sensitivity of the services business to what you're seeing on those businesses. So you will mean historically to see our historically does it mean services go down next year or do you think that enough growth in the installed base and consumables to still have conceptually a positive year consummately positive year next year? We that when we look at this we see this is a growth year for the installed base business and it will grow next year too. We'll take a question from Mehdi Hosseini (ph) with SIG. All the good questions have you asked. I just have one quick follow-up. When you talk about Logic and Foundry, and others, does that include advanced packaging and image sensors? And if not what does that put in which pocket? Yes, Mehdi for us it's Logic and Other as you rightly pointed out. So yes, that's where image sensors goes, that's where advanced packaging goes, it's Logic plus everything else. When you talk about a slight upside to Logic and Foundry, would that include better-than-expected advanced packaging and image sensors? That's not what's driving the upside and spending that we're seeing, it's more leading etch stuff. That does conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time I will turn the conference back to Ms. Tina Correia for any additional or closing remarks. Thank you all for joining us today. This concludes today's call.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Tina Correia, Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead ma'am. Great. Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the Lam Research quarterly earnings conference call. With me today are Tim Archer, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Doug Bettinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
During today's call, we will share our overview on the business environment and review our financial results for the June 2019 quarter and our outlook for the September 2019 quarter. The press release detailing our financial results was distributed a little after 1:00 P.M. Pacific Time this afternoon. The release can also be found on the Investor Relations section of the company's website along with the presentation slides that accompany today's call.
Today's presentation and Q&A includes forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the Risk Factors disclosures of our SEC public filings. Please see accompanying slides in the presentation for additional information. Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release. This call is scheduled to last until 3:00 P.M. Pacific Time. A replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website.
With that, let me hand the call over to Tim. Thanks, Tina, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. In the June quarter, Lam delivered strong results. Revenues, gross margin and operating margin exceeded the midpoint of the guidance we've provided on our last earnings call, while EPS exceeded the high end of the guidance. Our ability to deliver these results was made possible by the support of our customers, our employees and our partners and I would like to thank them for their ongoing commitment to Lam's success.
I would like to start by offering some perspective on Lam given the uncertainties surrounding trade and other influences on the market environment. Through the first half of calendar 2019, we have executed at a high level by focusing on what is in our control. And despite a difficult memory market, we have delivered on or exceeded our commitments.
As you will hear from Doug later, we generated another $880 million in cash from operations in the most recent quarter. At the same time, we have continued to prioritize investment in innovation and product differentiation, shifting a higher percentage of our total OpEx to R&D than in any prior quarter in our history. We remain committed to our long-term growth vectors observed available market expansion, market share gains and increased revenue from our installed base.
Specific proof points are emerging that validate our progress in each of these areas and I will touch on them later in my remarks. But first let me update our industry outlook.
Our view on total WFE remains directionally unchanged, with calendar year 2019 down mid- to high-teens percent from 2018. However, since our last earnings call, Memory spending is incrementally lower, while Foundry spending is tracking higher, we believe due in part to acceleration in 5G development leading to strong demand for 7-nanometer and 5-nanometer products. We now view Foundry Logic WFE to be second half-weighted versus our prior baseline of first half-weighted for calendar 2019.
Within Memory, customers have continued to take meaningful actions to restore supply and demand balance, reducing investment and lowering utilization levels for both NAND and DRAM, as we progressed through the June quarter. As a result, we see year-over-year bit supply growth for both NAND and DRAM continuing to decline, with bit supply growth rates exiting the year well below the long-term demand trend lines.
On the demand side, we are encouraged by early signs that NAND price declines are leading to an acceleration of content growth in devices. For example, SSD penetration in PCs is expected to reach nearly 60% by the end of 2019. But more importantly, the average density per drive is also growing. The predominant SSD configurations in the PC market are now 256 gigabyte and 512 gigabyte versus 128 gigabyte and 256 gigabyte a year ago.
The demand impact is amplified as both units and content per unit grow together. Similarly, we have seen acceleration in bit content growth for NAND and mobile devices. This is evident not only in the premium phone segment, but also in the mid-tier and lower-end phones, where 128 gigabytes offerings are seeing the fastest growth versus 64 gigabyte models a year ago.
We believe the combination of factors influencing supply and demand creates a favorable setup for Memory as we enter 2020. Our actions are focused on ensuring Lam is in the best possible position to benefit from the anticipated recovery in Memory spending. This focus is contributing to gains in both served market and market share as evidenced by wins this quarter across various applications, as well as in road maps for emerging 3D architectures.
In NAND, we are working closely with customers to develop differentiated solutions for potential limiters to 3D scaling. An excellent example is the wafer processing challenge created by stress-induced wafer bow as the number of 3D NAND layer scales to 100 and beyond.
Given Lam's leadership position in critical 3D NAND etch and deposition applications, we are best positioned to address this problem. The new Lam tool, which deposits a counter-stress film on the backside of the 3D NAND wafer, using an innovative single-step process has been introduced to leading-etch customers with multiple repeat orders received.
Importantly, the learning we gain through our investments to scale 3D NAND will be broadly applicable as new 3D architectures emerge in other segments. For example, we believe Lam's leadership in enabling 3D scaling will become increasingly valuable as logic devices migrate to a 3D gate all around structure in 3-nanometer as new memory such as PC RAM scale vertically for cost and bit density improvement, and as 3D heterogeneous integration is adopted as a preferred packaging option for high-performance system solutions.
For 3D heterogeneous integration, several leading companies across Foundry and Logic have announced architectures to connect different IP blocks using high-density interconnects with through-silicon vias. Lam's SABRE 3D electroplating and Syndion etch tools offer best-in-class technology backed by years of high-volume production leadership in the TSV market.
During the quarter we secured an important win at a leading logic customer for our SABRE 3D electroplating system for 3D chip stacking applications. This is a significant validation of Lam's ability to leverage its industry leading position in 3D scaling to new and emerging manufacturing inflections.
We are also seeing successes from our customer focused investments in DRAM. We are collaborating with customers on critical new technologies required to scale to the 1Z and 1A nodes. For instance, as DRAM shrinks, devices shrink to 1Z and beyond, the performance impact of resistance capacity delays becomes a challenge that must be addressed. This quarter, we won critical spacer applications at multiple leading DRAM manufacturers for the 1Z node due to our ability to deposit highly conformal low-k films that help reduce RC delay.
In addition to our progress on critical applications, you might recall that I have spoken previously about the NAND semi-critical process space and is an area of increased focus for Lam as we drive to gain market share.
In the most recent quarter, we began to deliver on this opportunity with significant conductor etch wins at multiple NAND customers for mask open applications. Specifically, Lam's ability to create a highly productive, single-step etch process to replace our competitor's multiple step approach allowed us to differentiate on system throughput, a key decision factor in the semi-critical space.
Another example is seen in dielectric etch where we recorded a key win for a semi-critical metal contact application at a leading memory maker. As 3D NAND scales, the peripheral context becomes deeper and aspect ratios increase. Our dielectric etch system demonstrated faster etch rates and superior profile control, leading to greater capital productivity and less frequent maintenance.
For our Customer Support Business Group, we continue to see 2019 as another year of solid revenue growth despite lower WFE spending. In the June quarter we achieved a second consecutive quarterly record for revenue from our Reliant Systems business as customers invest to address robust non-leading etch demand from end markets such as IoT, automotive and powered devices.
The combination of our focus on leading-etch technologies and installed base performance is being recognized by our customers. In the most recent quarter our top customer completed their annual supplier evaluation process, ranking us as their number one supplier as measured by a broad set of installed base performance, cost reduction and R&D engagement metrics. With this newest rating, we are now in the number one position in more than half of our top customers.
To wrap up, the near-term environment remains challenging. But the long-term growth opportunity for both our industry and for Lam is compelling. We are focused on executing to our commitments and extending the differentiation of our product and services portfolio.
I believe that our continued prioritization of customer focused investment would yield lasting benefits. And as Memory spending returns to normalized levels and non-Memory technologies increasingly rely on 3D scaling for performance and cost improvement, Lam will be in an excellent position to outperform.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Doug. Excellent. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today during what I know is a busy earnings season. Lam executed well in the June quarter with our results exceeding the midpoint of guidance for all financial metrics.
Earnings per share exceeded the high end of the guidance range we provided due to stronger gross margin as well as proactive management of operating expenses. Our EPS performance is I believe are testament to our continual focus on delivering on our ongoing commitments.
As Tim noted, our expectation is that 2019 WFE will be down from calendar year 2018 in the mid-to high teens percentage level. Since our last call we're seeing some upside strength in Foundry, which was partially offset by a reduction in Memory spending.
From a segment perspective, our systems revenue for the combined Memory segment increased slightly to 64% of total system revenue from 61% in the March quarter. We had an increase from the March quarter in the non-volatile memory segment from 40% to 46%, while DRAM decreased to 18% from 21%.
Memory revenue continues to be mainly targeted towards conversion-related investments. In DRAM spending, it's targeted towards 1Y and some initial 1Z investment. In NAND, it's primarily convergence to non-auxiliary devices. Additionally, we are seeing initial investment on 128-layer structures.
We're continuing to see healthy spending in the Foundry segment which came in at 23% of our system revenue for the March quarter. And as Tim mentioned this is heavily focused on the 5 and 7-nanometer nodes. This was slightly down from 27% last quarter although still quite strong.
The Logic and Other segment was flat with the prior quarter level contributing 13% of system revenue. We expect to see continued strength in the Foundry and Logic space throughout the remainder of the calendar year.
It's worth noting that from a geographic perspective, 33% of our revenue was generated in the China region. The majority of this came from indigenous Chinese customers. We expect to see higher than our average concentration level of revenue in the China region for the September quarter as well.
We executed well on income statement performance for the June quarter. Revenues came in at $2.361 billion, which was above the midpoint of the June guidance. Gross margin for the quarter was 45.9% which was better than expected primarily due to customer mix and improved field resource utilization.
Also as we've stated in previous quarters, our actual gross margins are a function of several factors such as our raw business volumes, product mix and customer concentration and you should expect to see some variability quarter-to-quarter.
Operating expenses in the June quarter declined to $450 million from the prior quarter. We are proactively managing expenses with our lower revenue levels. We continue to invest in our strategic R&D programs however and remain focused on our commitment to technology and productivity leadership. The percentage of R&D spend increased to approximately 66% in the June quarter, which was a high watermark.
Operating income in the June quarter was $635 million and operating margin was 26.9% at the high-end of our guidance range. The non-GAAP tax rate for the June quarter was approximately 11% which is slightly lower than our long-term rate.
For the remainder of the 2019 calendar year, we expect a tax rate in the low to mid-teens. And I'll just remind you, you should expect to see fluctuations in the rate from quarter-to-quarter.
For June, other income and expense was a total of approximately $6 million of expense. This total includes interest expense for a full quarter related to the issuance of a $2.5 billion senior notes that we completed in the March quarter. The quarterly interest expense is partially offset by the interest income earned on higher cash balances for the company.
I'll just remind you that total interest expense on all tranches of our debt is approximately $45 million per quarter. We continued to execute on our capital return program during the June quarter. For the quarter, we allocated $1.3 billion to capital return with $1.1 billion coming in share repurchases and $165 million in dividend payments.
Our share repurchase activities were from a combination of open market as well as structured repurchases. The structured repurchase program that we entered into is intended to continue to execute throughout our December quarter. We've completed approximately $2 billion of the $5 billion authorization that we announced in the March quarter.
Over the past 1.5 years, we've utilized approximately $6 billion in buybacks and lowered diluted share count by roughly 15%. I believe this demonstrates our continued commitment to return meaningful cash to our shareholders.
Earnings per share was $3.62, which was over our guidance range for the June quarter. This upside was driven primarily by better gross margin and lower-than-expected operating expenses. Diluted shares per EPS were approximately 154 million shares which reflects a 5% decrease in quarterly diluted share count since the beginning of the calendar year. The share count includes a dilutive impact of approximately 5 million shares from the 2041 convertible notes. The dilution schedules for the remaining 2041 converts is available on our Investor Relations website for your reference.
Let me now move to the balance sheet. Our cash and short-term investments including restricted cash decreased in the June quarter to $5.7 billion from $6.4 billion in the March quarter. The decrease is mainly due to the capital return activities within the quarter, offset by strong cash generation from operations of $880 million. This is the second consecutive quarter, where we had cash from operations in the $900 million range.
DSO decreased by five days to 56 days. Our inventory balance decreased by $82 million. Inventory turns remained at industry-leading levels coming in at 3.3 times. Company non-cash expenses included approximately $45 million for equity comp, $47 million for depreciation, and $18 million for amortization.
Amortization was down from last quarter by 50% as a portion of the intangibles from the Novellus acquisition have now fully amortized. Capital expenditures were $66 million in the quarter, which was a slight decrease from the $76 million that we saw in March.
The June quarter ended with approximately 10,700 regular full-time employees, which is down somewhat from the prior quarter. Additionally, I'd like to remind you that, we used temporary labor as part of our operating model. We have reduced this temporary labor by almost 40% or 600 head count in the last year. This flexibility is a critical part of our operating model enabling us to deliver sustainable operating profits during a time of reduced revenue levels.
So now looking ahead, I'd like to provide our non-GAAP guidance for the September 2019 quarter. We are expecting revenue of $2.150 billion plus or minus $150 million; gross margin of 45% plus or minus one percentage point; operating margin of 24.5% plus or minus one percentage point; and finally earnings per share of $3 plus or minus $0.20 based on a share count of approximately 150 million shares.
Before closing my scripted remarks, I'd like to reiterate some of the tone that Tim shared in his script. We continue to not see a recovery in Memory spending which is our strongest market for 2019. We do observe dynamics in those markets, however, that are positive signs. Some examples of these signs are demand elasticity, pricing trends, and management of factory utilization to bring inventory down. We are tracking a double-digit number of new fabs ready to receive equipment shipments during this year and we see plans for that to happen again next year. We continue to believe as a result that 2020 sets up as a better year than 2019.
Operator that concludes my prepared remarks. Tim and I would now like to open-up the call for questions. Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] We'll take are our first question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. A quarter ago, the supply side situation in Memory was one of disciplined spending and sort of reining in supply. It was really the demand side that was still uncertain, but just even over the past few weeks it seems that the demand side is starting to materialize here in the second half of this year PC market looking seasonally stronger cloud spending set to accelerate this quarter and you even have several big sort of AI in deep learning programs that are starting to fire. Your customers are also talking about inventory starting to come down. So is the Lam team feeling more confident, and more importantly your customers feeling more confident about the prospects for a healthier market environment exiting this year relative to three months or six months ago? Sure. Harlan, I'll take that and then Doug can add what he would like to. Clearly, I maybe – I walk you back since you kind of sets us as a baseline three or six months ago. The very first call of this year we laid out a view that Memory spending really wouldn't recover for this entire year. You just heard Doug kind of reiterate that again. But that didn't mean that through the year we wouldn't see progress, progress in sentiment progress in both the supply side and maybe the demand side. And so I guess, what I would say is incrementally you are hearing commentary about the demand side. I talked about elasticity. You've heard that also from some others even closer to those markets than us.
So I think that you're starting to see some sentiment in NAND that is – are positive signs. Back six months ago we also said that, given the timing in which NAND corrected versus DRAM that NAND corrected earlier, and therefore would be likely the first market where we would see end demand increases as well as pricing and market improvements. What we've tried not to do and it's just challenging given the uncertainty in the market is pin down exactly when that happened.
So we have put an end year supply growth rate number out there which was we said on the last call and we reiterate now in the range of about 30% supply growth for NAND as we exit the year. And that's about 10 points below what Lam sees as long-term demand growth. And so again, what we said is at that point it feels like the market will have tightened and investment could return, but obviously pinning that exact timing is challenging. I feel like the year in terms of supply improvement demand improvement discipline is playing out very close to what we thought it would with a whole lot of moving parts but in general and as I said directionally very much likely we thought at the beginning of the year. I don't know if Doug has anything to add. No. Perfect Tim. I don't really have anything to add. You're starting to see Harlan you alluded to it some of the early indications that the market is getting healthier is turning. And inevitably I think we all know it's a question of when not an if that memory spending will recover and that continues to be how we see it. Great. Thanks for the insights there. And then on the heavier China domestic mix just, given the continued trade tensions U.S. and China which is actually motivating a number of the China-based companies to bring in more chip design domestically especially given some of the recent component bans and the delist additions. Have you guys seen an increase in dialogue or programs that suggest a step up on China domestic activities to accelerate their semiconductor manufacturing capabilities? Yes. I think it's hard to say to tie one directly to the other. What we said as we came into this year is that China domestic spending would be stronger this year than last year. And I would say that at this point in the year, we feel maybe it's even somewhat stronger than that and so demand from domestic China or indigenous Chinese customers is strong as Doug pointed out. I think to this point of exactly what's driving that I think there is obviously long-term demand and a long-term desire to build more domestic capability.
When I think about China, it's -- the biggest challenge for us really is the uncertainty that a lot of the trade discussions probably put not only the investment plans of indigenous Chinese customers, but also in the global players who are a little less certain about how those issues might play into the demand environment. So we're just trying -- we're managing through this. We've said our position in China is strong from a market share perspective and I think as you start to see some of the indigenous Chinese customers move into Memory, I would assume that our market share position should get even stronger. So, it's an important region for us but we track what's going on there closely and manage it as we see best. Great. Thanks, Harlan. We'll go next to Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Tim, you talked a little bit about your focus on addressing semi-critical applications in your prepared remarks. And I think you threw out an example in conductor etch where you managed to have some wins in the quarter. Just curious to semi-critical applications in general how meaningful is that part of the market as a percentage of etch and deposition? Where is your market share today? And how do you see that evolving over the next couple of years? And then I have a follow-up. Yes. That's a great question. In fact we said last time that as we move through the year and perhaps our Investor Day when we hold it next we might break out a little bit more detail on the size of semi-critical as a percentage of our total so we're not prepared to do that today. But it is -- the semi-critical is a meaningful part of the etch market. In terms of -- but I think it's also important and I really want to make sure that the message doesn't get lost.
Our core strength, our core business is the critical market, but if you have ambitions to grow and outperform the industry in the long-term, you have to also be competitive in semi-critical. And so, I think that we look at our performance in the last quarter I didn't talk about it, but we successfully defended critical positions in all markets in the last quarter. And so that was a statement and that's kind of how we go every quarter thinking we have to get done is defend our critical positions.
Where we have the opportunity to grow is by taking semi-critical positions away from the competition. There the defining factor is much more about productivity. As I think I mentioned in the last call or at least in one of our conferences, productivity is something that the company knows how to do by learning from what has been done for a long time on the deposition side where I would say a larger fraction of the market exists within the semi-critical space.
And so what we tried to highlight in the prepared remarks today is refocusing some of our efforts to ensuring that our productivity that we're delivering to customers is best-in-class can yield wins for Lam in the semi-critical etch space. We gave you examples both in the conductor etch space as well as the dielectric etch space. And so obviously that's -- can be interpreted as against two different competitors. So I think we're making progress there. I think just stay tuned and we'll continue to report how we're doing against those efforts. Got it. Thanks very much. And then as a follow-up, I was hoping to get an update on how you guys view EUV. How fast -- or how slow rather the technology is progressing on the Foundry and Logic side? How you see that impacting your business into 2020? And then more specifically I guess one of your customers recently sort of talked about potentially inserting EUV on the DRAM side of their business at the 1Z nanometer node. How do you see that evolving over the next 12 to 18 months? And how that could impact your business? Thank you. Sure. Okay. Great. It's funny, so maybe I'll just come out with a very clear statement at the beginning, because we get asked -- when the EUV question gets asked, it's often -- at least, I interpret it as kind of like, is this going to have a negative impact on Lam's business. So, I guess, what I'd like to start just by saying is, at this point we view Lam -- EUV as being good for Lam. And maybe I'll just run you through a couple of reasons for that.
I mean, we're aligned with this idea, which, I think, is held be many of our customers, that EUV is part of the answer to cost-effective scaling. And cost-effective scaling is what's needed for new technology nodes. New nodes are important to Lam, as you can guess. I just said our critical application business is the core of our business.
Critical applications, kind of, new ones get created when technology advances from node to node and so that's part of our growth strategy is, continue to win the next critical applications are being developed. New nodes also create SAM expansion opportunities for Lam. When there's a new node, I mean, there's new materials and new architectures where Lam can use etch and deposition more effectively. We win new positions.
And in terms of a negative impact, I mean, multiple patterning, we've said also very clearly, continues to grow even with EUV. We've said obviously, it doesn't grow -- multiple pattern, it doesn't grow as fast as if EUV doesn't exist. But, again, our view is, that's one of those hypothetical futures that, it's hard to say exactly how many wafers will get produced in the future of future nodes without EV. So, it's a long way of saying, I think, EUV in total is good for Lam.
Now, I also said, I think, on our last call that EUV is a big technology transition and you kind of pointed out, the speed with which it gets introduced has a lot to do with productivity. And we think that Lam has a significant role that we can play in helping improve, by using etch and deposition we can improve the productivity over the patterning module as a whole. And if we can do that, then it creates new opportunities for etch and deposition and we're partnering with ASML on those opportunities and I think we -- it's a big area of focus for us.
Specifically, to your question, like, for introduction in Logic and Foundry, I think, our view is consistent with industry consensus. So I don't have a lot to say there. Around the question of 1z insertion, again, I think you know probably what has been said. It's clearly not the general consensus that DRAM and D1z will commonly use EUV. I mean, it's a node where people will talk -- at least one customer, as you said, is talking about putting it in kind of as maybe the learning node. But I think that I don't have anything else to add to it than that. Thanks very much. Thanks, Toshiya. We'll go next to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on the solid results. Tim at least by our math, if you look at kind of your June shipments into the Memory market, they're down about 50% plus or minus from sort of peak, but they're still up if you look at -- you're almost 50% from sort of the 2014 to 2016 average and there's been a lot that's going on with capital intensity, your SAM expansion, market share gains.
You guys have been very clear about not calling a recovery in Memory, but I'm kind of curious, how do you think about the current level of spending relative to prior troughs in Memory spending when you adjust for capital intensity going up, SAM growth, market share. Do you feel like we're bouncing along a bottom here in Memory, or how should we think about that? I mean the one thing, I would say, John, is that -- I would say and we've been saying this all year is, when I look at the spending in Memory this year, it is almost entirely allocated to conversion-related investments right? Which is always a cost-effective thing for the customer base to do, it lowers cost per bit.
I don't know that I would say, it's a maintenance level or it's a bottom level, John. But it's always something that economically is -- it makes sense for the customer to do it. And that's pretty much what we're seeing happening this year. And your observation about SAM intensity, capital intensity going up and all of that is absolutely valid. It's gotten more expensive to put wafers in place, because complexity of architectures have grown. And, obviously, that's part of the calculus as well. I don't know, anything to add, Tim? Yes. No, I think in terms of, especially, etch and depth intensity has changed in a pretty dramatic way since, what's the time? But I agree with everything Doug said. Our comments are -- have been, we're clearly at a point where we believe that supply growth spending is insufficient to meet long-term demand growth. So, however you want to call that, Doug, bottom or trough, as Doug said, we don't really want to do that, but it's -- this feels like the majority of investment is really around technology at this point. That's helpful. And then, as my follow-up, I was wondering if you can just give us update on kind of your view of the service business for this year, especially in lieu of sort of the some of the utilization cuts we've seen from customers. I know the installed base is growing, which will give a tailwind to service, but is that still expected to grow? And as you answer the question, one of your customers with the power outage this quarter, what kind of impact might that have had, either on the services or quite frankly in the shipment business? Yes. John, it's Doug again. Yes, I still expect our installed base business to grow this year. And again, your observation is absolutely right. This business will ebb and flow somewhat with industry overall utilization. And I think it's pretty well understood that some of the Memory -- some of our Memory customers are reducing utilization to a certain extent, including from a power outage. And so, as a result of that, things like spares consumption will decrease for a period of time. But this business will still grow this year. And it grows along with growth and chamber count.
And as we've been saying, our view even though WFE is down so much, chamber count will still grow this year. So the tailwind of the business over the next several years continues to be pretty good. Thank you. Thanks, John. We'll take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Thanks so much. Doug, I guess both of my questions are for you. The first one is I'm wondering if you can update us on the comments you gave, I think on second half versus first half loading?
Obviously, your full year WFE has not changed. But the mix has changed a little bit. It seems like maybe a little bit less in your favor. So can you update us on the second half versus first half of this year? Thanks. Yeah. Tim, yeah you're right the puts and takes. We're still suggesting WFE this year is down, mid-to high teens. And within that there are puts and takes. Memory is somewhat softer than we were describing, a quarter ago. And Foundry is a little bit stronger, maybe a decent amount stronger.
And when I look at the profile of that investment, the spending in Memory is somewhat first half weighted. The spending in Foundry and Logic is somewhat second half weighted. And when you put it all together, I think WFE this year will be a little bit weighted to the second half. I guess Doug, I was more talking about your shipments, but I think you had previously guided your shipments or your revenue second half versus first half. So I'm wondering if you can update that. No. We've never guided revenue half on half. We've always and maybe I was misinterpreted talking about WFE. Okay, awesome. Okay and then I guess my second question Doug is you're doing $12 annualized in a pretty nasty Memory cycle systems for Memory are cut in half and total system shipments are down somewhere in the range of 14% from the peak.
Obviously it's much down than really anything in the past. So I guess the question is how do you think about how to optimize the capital structure in the balance sheet as you come out of this?
You have bought back a ton of stock but I'm wondering how you think about the right balance sheet leverage targets, as you look out over the next few years? Thanks. Yeah. Tim, I mean, I haven't communicated a numeric target for leverage or total cash or anything like that. But if you look at what we've done over the last several years I think we've had an inclination to provide meaningful cash back to shareholders. The cash generation capability of the business, continues to be amazingly strong right?
We're coming off two quarters now of nearly 900 -- or approximately $900 million from operational cash flow. So our confidence in the ability to sustain cash generation is obviously much higher.
And if you look at a metric like net cash, it's also why we've been comfortable bringing that down. And we've done that through raising, a little bit of debt and consuming the cash by both dividends and more towards share buyback.
At some point, we'll probably have an investor event again and talk a little bit more about it. But I'm not ready to change what we've described in the past, which has been we're going to return at least 50% of free cash flow to shareholders. And what you've seen us do is a whole lot more than that over the last several years. Okay Doug got it. Thanks so much. Yeah, thanks, Tim. We'll go next to C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. Yeah. Good afternoon. And thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, can you speak to on both Foundry Logic side. Your revenue intensity at the 16, 14, 10, nodes and how we think about share gains and/or greater opportunities for you as we migrate down to seven and five?
And if there's any way to kind of quantify what the incremental revenues per wafer start or any sort of math like that, that will be very helpful. Thank you. Yeah. C.J., I'm going to let Tim actually talk about the direction. We haven't quantified it. And we're not ready to do that on the call. But Tim is pretty well versed in the trajectory. So if you can cover that. Good they took the numbers off the table for me. But I think maybe the first time we've said and we feel quite confident is, in kind of the Logic Foundry world. Our share gains for a variety of reasons both through wins, but also new applications that we've gained our share gains are gains between 10, 7 and 5.
And so we feel quite confident that part of that is intensity in etching that deposition, part of that is new applications that created get created its new processes. And so, while we haven't quantified it, I would say that, as I said in my EUV commentary, every technology transition is an opportunity for us to gain new applications and gain share.
We feel really good about the progress we've made. It sometimes gets lost in the -- in this overlying story about memory and memory spending. And how much impact it has on our business. But we're feeling quite good about our momentum in Logic and Foundry both. That's helpful. And as my follow-up, any update on your self-cleaning etch offering? I'd love to hear about the Kiyo module coupled with Corvus. Anything you can share with us would be great. Okay. Well, I'm not sure I can share with you other than it continues to progress in the marketplace. It's again, when I talked about semi-critical applications, where customers are really focused on trying to optimize the productivity of existing fabs. And one element to productivity of fab is how often you have to actually have technicians or people going and doing maintenance on tools.
And the Kiyo product with the Kiyo -- product with the Corvus Are, the self-maintaining tool is part of that answer. Now, obviously, there's not a lot of spending going on in some of those segments, but we feel this is another example of where we've introduced the right product that one spending recovers in the Memory market, they should be perfectly targeted to the types of tools that customers want to put in to all those new fabs they're building right now. Thanks C.J. We'll go next to Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company. Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. First one for Tim, one of the things I've been hearing is that actually go to higher and higher layers in 3D NAND, the process time for etch keeps going up. Is there a way to quantify in either absolute minutes or relative to prior nodes, what kind of increase in process times are we talking about, and what does it mean for Lam? Okay. Well, I don't think that we're going to quantify that because it's kind of a competitive piece of information that would -- we wouldn't want to divulge here, but it does, I mean, to your point it takes a longer time to etch higher aspect ratio features, and I think that it's relatively well known that that increase is non-linear with the number of layers, meaning, the etch becomes longer non-linearly with the number of layers that are being created. And that's simply due to the etch process physics themselves, physics and chemistry. And so more layers has a positive impact on -- for Lam on the number of etch tools that are required to accomplish that etch.
Now what I would say is that there's a constant battle, I mean, to keep the cost of ownership reasonable for customers, we're continuously working on productivity of every etch we deliver to the customer, including critical etches like the whole -- the 3D whole etch. So not prepared to quantify today, but it is a positive grower for us. Got it. Got it. Okay. And then as a follow-up Tim. When you start gaining more share refocus more on the semi-critical etch applications how should we think about the margin structure, because it seems like productivity is key in this segment. Is productivity a euphemism for lower price, or just trying to figure out how to think about margins and you get more share in semi-critical etch? No. Definitely in my mind, it's not a euphemism for lower price. Productivity is in many ways is much of a technology challenges as any other. And so we're attacking productivity, we are attacking it fundamentally from equipment and hardware and process design in a way that we deliver increased productivity with the cost structure of the tool that allows us to deliver corporate average gross margins for those applications. That's our expectation. And so that sometimes takes time and will require us in many cases to think long and hard about how our tools are designed, but that is the expectation that I have for winning in that space. Thanks Tim. Thanks, Krish. We'll take our next question from Weston Twigg with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First, I just wanted to probe a little bit about your comments on 2020. You said you think it's shaping up to be an up year, but I was wondering if you could just walk us a little bit through the puts and takes maybe both in Memory and Foundry what it would take be an up year? And sort of what your expectations are regarding those? Yeah, West. Too soon for us to get into specifics on this. Really the commentary around setting up for a better year next year, it's all about Memory recovering in terms of investment levels. We'll give you more color on it when we get a little closer to next year, and I'm sure a lot's going to move around in there. But as we sit here today and look at the level of investment occurring in Memory and the growth rates of bits exiting the year and whatnot, we believe the level of investment there needs to go up next year and that's the nature of the comments. That makes sense. I guess related to you talked about some new wins and focusing on market share gains and SAM expansion, some of the Syndion line today, can you help us maybe put some numbers around what -- how much that could expand the opportunity in 2020? The revenue opportunity deal for you? Well, I think maybe kind of no, but you should come back to the -- but you we're getting closer and closer to our market share targets that we put out for 2021. So I guess you can think of these as we've come out and we have said that we would gain four to eight points of share within etch and four to eight points within deposition by 2021. That was our last stated set of objectives.
And when you think about progress we already made in our share positioning critical that's where you move to semi-critical and you say a fair bit of that share gain four to eight points is going to come from those types of wins. That's why what we wanted to highlight today that we feel we're just at the start of making some of the progress towards that type of share gain. Okay. Fair enough. Thank you. Thanks West. We'll go next to Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about the strength in the indigenous China spending. How does that break down between Foundry DRAM, NAND and just generally your view on the sustainability of that spending into next year? Yeah. Joe, we described in the past view that plus or minus there's investment levels of $5 billion from indigenous China relative to WFE this year. As we look at it now, a little bit stronger than that quite honestly. The strength is coming from Memory primarily. And I think you know what's going on. There's several Foundry customers there the big one is SMIC. They continue to be a very important customer for us. You got YMTC investing in NAND and then emerging DRAM investments. The uptick relative to prior communication I think it's been primarily related to Memory both a little bit of NAND a little bit of DRAM. And the majority of the output that they're getting from that spending I mean is that something where you could see more kind of a larger capacity as we move forward, or is it more pilots and kind of getting things figured out? Yes. I mean, Joe, I think they're going to continue to keep innovating on the technology, they're going to keep getting better and better at what they do and it wouldn't surprise me if they can continue to invest at higher levels as we go forward. I'm not ready going to quantify it for you, but they're working very, very diligently on innovating the technology. Very helpful. Thank you. Yeah. Thanks, Joe. We'll take our next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Thanks for taking my question. I had two as well. I wanted to also ask about China. So sales were up 20% in the last fiscal year, non-China was down about that number. How do you measure utilization at your customers? Because their purchasing has gone up right around the time when trade tensions have increased. So is there a risk that there have been pull-ins and this becomes an issue later on? Yes, Vivek when I look at it, I don't think there's significant pull-ins occurring in what we're seeing happening. And I say that because we sort of knew our customers' plans as the year began. And when I look at it for the most part, they're executing to those plans. It's also important I think to understand that a lot of the investment in China is not indigenous Chinese customers, right? You've got the Koreans building fabs, Taiwanese, U.S. companies. So understand that a broad swathe of the spending in China isn't necessarily the indigenous Chinese customers. That's generally how I see that. Okay. And then for my follow-up Doug, on gross margins, you are guiding to 45%. And I know you mentioned a few times that mix changes from quarter-to-quarter. What in the mix is driving gross margins lower? Because when I look at the revenue level, it's kind of back to where it was in March 2017. But at that time gross margins were higher. But I recall at that time Foundry, Logic was a lower part of the mix. So is it Foundry, Logic that has an impact on gross margin? And I think you also alluded to the fact that you do expect to continue to grow in Foundry, Logic. So just how should we think about the trajectory of gross margins over the next several quarters? Yes, Vivek, I wouldn't assume or you shouldn't assume there's differential gross margin by end of market necessarily meaning Foundry to Logic to Memory. That's not the way it works. Generally, there are -- it's what I always say that the larger customers, because they're buying more may tend to get a little bit better pricing simply because they're buying more from us relative to discounts sometimes. Not always, but obviously when you look at revenue down the way it is that's probably one of the bigger contributors right now. And Tim, would you want to... Yes, no. I think there's a -- you referenced back to a point in 2017. We look at those all the time to think about what's different in our business. And what you have to look at is that as we transition through 2017, it was a massive growth cycle for us. And while we have a very flexible operating model, some of the physical infrastructure that we have to put in place to meet a $3 billion quarterly revenue run rate some of that physical capacity has not been taken offline and it does affect gross margin to some degree. We are confident that that kind of physical capacity is what's needed to be able to respond when our customers do ramp as Memory spending recovers. So flexible operating model Doug talked about temporary workforce, but in some cases there were costs put in which are still with us. Doug, I don't know if you have... Yes. No perfect. Great. Pretty helpful. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you. We'll go next to Patrick Ho with Stifel. Thank you very much. Tim, maybe to follow-up from your prepared remarks, you talked about some of the new emerging technologies such as gate-all-around and the industry transition in DRAM to 1Z and 1A. On the gate-all-around given that it's a similar format to FinFET, are there any capital intensity increases for etch and deposition that would benefit you guys when the industry makes that [ship] because you guys clearly benefitted from the transition of FinFET? Yes. I think that I mean what I was trying to message is that at almost every node our customers, the industry has realized that 3D scaling is a key part of the answer both to device performance as well as cost scaling. And for us 3D scaling really means etch and deposition intensity tends to increase. Obviously we're still a little ways away, I mean we're highly engaged with 3-nanometer but final decisions ultimately get made relative to structures and architectures in the future. But it's really a message around etch and dep intensity to create 3D architectures.
It's also why I pointed out in case it was missed the 3D architecture that's emerging in the heterogeneous integration or advanced packaging space, which again is 3D chip stacking and how Lam's etch and deposition will play a role in that. So what I was trying to just translate it I believe that 3D and etch and dep intensity kind of is fanning out across all device types in the future. Great. And my follow-up question for Doug in terms of the installed base business that's probably providing you a lot of support this year, given the pressures on the systems business. Can you give a little color if you're seeing a lot of upgrade business for I guess the trailing etch, fabs that are trying to upgrade improve their productivity, is that a key driver to the installed base business, and the strength that you're likely seeing this year? That's certainly a piece of it. In fact last quarter, record level for our Reliant business, which is our refurbished equipment. So the answer Patrick is yes. Thanks so much. Thank you. We'll go next to Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. All right thank you. I've got two questions on the Memory side. You talk about NAND to supply growth rate exiting this year at about 30%. Can you give us a sense how you think the CapEx or the equipment spend needed to support say, every one percentage point of this supply growth from the current “conversion-only” trough? And can you do the same for DRAM? I guess we have -- you have given us the estimated cost for greenfield fabs before but just trying to put those pieces of information together. Yeah Sidney. No, I don't think we've quantified this in the past. And I don't think we're ready to on the call right now. So I'm going to decline to answer the question. Okay. I'll move on to next one. If I take your reported revenue by end market and compare to what we think the WFE dollars for the various segments I can see that your share has been moving up steadily across all the different segments in recent years. But the one that stood out to me is NAND, which gets to be pretty high just take your revenue number that's probably including services and divide it by WFE, you get to somewhere around 40% from call it 20%, 25% a few years ago. Do you think that number could go higher as the market transitions to higher layer count? I guess, this question is whether it's sustainable? Well, I guess as -- what we've said is that etch and deposition are really key to continued scaling in 3D NAND and so etch and deposition intensity scales with number of layers. So from that perspective measuring share of the customer's total spend on 3D NAND, it will -- we do believe it can and will go higher. Okay, great. Thanks. Thanks. Operator, I think we have time for one more question please. Yes, ma’am. We'll take our final question from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Hi guys. Yeah, thanks for taking my question. I just have one extra one on focusing on the share gain potential here. So I don't expect you guys to know exactly what happened to Japan and Korea, but if you look at the etch and deposition tools you guys sell, where do you guys think you had the most opportunity to gain share against Tokyo Electron? I'm not going to get specific but okay. Well, this is -- look and this is also why I talk about the importance of performing really well in the semi-critical space. Critical applications that the reason we like them is they're hard to win and it takes often a generation or two to sort of prove yourself out. Those are less likely to switch due to some short-term event.
Semi-critical or less critical applications are much more driven by can you accomplish that task at a certain targeted productivity point? So I think that there are a number of applications that we would be targeting where we're highly capable of doing those. And if the customer is motivated to give Lam a try, we're motivated to jump in there and show what we can do. Got it. And just one real quick high level one. I don't know the exact math off the top of my head, but roughly speaking from the last downturn you guys have seen, do you guys see anything irregular in terms of buying patterns? Suggest that people are buying ahead, or buying additional equipment than normal down cycle, or do you think this is essentially a normal semi cap cycle that you see in the past? No. Nothing from my perspective that's out of the ordinary. In fact that was why I kind of started my comments with. For the most part, given some different puts and takes the year's playing out not that differently than we had originally thought from the standpoint of moving through a down cycle in Memory. Perfect. Thank you. Yeah, thank you. So, operator, I think that's the end of the call. If you want to sign us off. Thank you, everyone, for joining. Yes, certainly. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for your participation.

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Tina Correia, Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead ma'am. Thank you, operator. Thank you and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to the Lam Research quarterly earnings conference call. With me today are Tim Archer, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Doug Bettinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
During today's call, we will share our overview on the business environment and review our financial results for the September 2019 quarter and our outlook for the December 2019 quarter. The press release detailing our financial results was distributed a little after 1:00 P.M. Pacific Time this afternoon. The release can also be found on the Investor Relations section of the Company's website along with the presentation slides that accompany today's call.
Today's presentation and Q&A includes forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the Risk Factors disclosures of our SEC public filings. Please see accompanying slides in the presentation for additional information. Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release. This call is scheduled to last until 3:00 P.M. Pacific Time. A replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website.
With that, let me hand the call over to Tim. Thanks, Tina, and welcome everyone. In the September quarter, Lam delivered solid results. Our continued execution to commitments, combined with our guidance for the December quarter increases our conviction that Lam is in a strong position to outperform as wafer fabrication equipment spending inflects higher. Doug will cover the financial results in more detail shortly, but I’m especially pleased with the demonstrated earnings power of the Company. At the midpoint of our December guide, calendar year 2019 diluted earnings per share will be the second highest in our history despite the current industry cycle.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank our customers and partners for their continued support of Lam and our employees throughout the world for their contributions to these results. From an industry perspective, we have revised upward our view on 2019 WFE to the mid $40 billion range versus our prior estimate of down mid-to-high teens percentage year on year, which implied a low $40 billion level of spending.
We are beginning to see improvement in the memory market, led first by NAND. NAND’s demand dynamics are improving and oversupply conditions should continue to abate as we move through the December quarter. We expect to exit 2019 with a bit supply growth rate for NAND of approximately 30%, which is well below our view on long-term demand; and as a result, NAND inventories are expected to decline to normalized levels in the first half of calendar 2020.
While the timing of the memory equipment spending recovery is always hard to predict, we are encouraged that customers continue to manage supply growth even as we are starting to see favorable end-market demand indicators. This is a sign of a healthy industry and a good setup for increased NAND spending in 2020. On the DRAM front, inventories have remain elevated, and we do not expect them to reach normalized levels until the second half of 2020.
However, we see positive demand catalyst ahead in both the server and smartphone markets. Our server CPU upgrade cycle is expected to begin next year with increased adoption of new generation platforms from leading manufacturers. For smartphones, major vendors are planning to launch additional 5G models which is expected to drive content growth for the overall smartphone market in 2020.
Turning to foundry and logic, spending in this segment has been strong throughout 2019 and based on recent customer commentary, looks to remain so heading into next year. Diverse end market applications are driving higher levels of foundry and logic spending, moreover, challenges in scaling functional block such as SRAM and logic devices are leading to increases in die sizes and these in turn are accelerating changes in device architectures and chip manufacturing technologies.
Lam's growing position with key foundry and logic customers has positioned us to incrementally benefit from these secular trends. Competitively, we are executing at a high level. Based on the midpoint of our December guidance, Lam's 2019 foundry and logic revenues are set to significantly outgrow announced customer CapEx plans. The share gains we are now seeing in the foundry and logic segment are the result of close customer collaboration and strong product execution over many years and multiple technology transitions. They are evidence of the benefit of sustained investment in R&D throughout industry cycles.
Looking at the market as a whole including memory, foundry, and logic, we are on track in 2019 to deliver our best ever penetration and defense performance, as measured by net forward-looking, three-year revenue opportunity for application decisions made in this calendar year. A key contributor to our strong penetration and defense performance has been continued focus on technologies that enable 3D device architectures, which are becoming increasingly important to performance and cost scaling across all market segments.
We invested early in 2D to 3D inflections; and as these transitions are occurring, we are seeing expansion in both our SAM and market share. Etch and deposition processes are critical enablers for 3D scaling, and we are investing aggressively to deliver the technology and productivity innovation required to satisfy customer roadmaps. As evidenced by our penetration and defense wins this year, we believe we are extending Lam's leadership in this space.
In 3D NAND, we're successfully defended 100% of our memory whole dielectric etch positions and continue to be the supplier for this application at all 3D NAND manufacturers. We are also winning 3D NAND applications where productivity is the primary point of differentiation. Notably, Lam has been the first to deliver production proven edge-yield solutions for etch. In this quarter, we used our Corvus tunable edge hardware on our flex dielectric etch system to improve profile tilt uniformity and win an important productivity sensitive slit etch application.
On the conductor etch front, we won a 3D NAND application for a new vertical architecture that reduces die size and is a technical solution for lowering bit cost. In deposition, we recorded an important 3D NAND win for the VECTOR DT, which deposits backside films to control stress as layer counts increase. Another significant deposition win was for our Striker ALD tool used to deposit high quality liners and gapfill as aspect ratios get higher.
We also continue to extend our 3D expertise and position outside of the 3D NAND space, including in rapidly growing markets such as advanced packaging and heterogeneous integration. Over the last three years, the installed base for our SABRE 3D electroplating system has grown by more than 70%, and we are the leading electroplating supplier for TSV, for DRAM, CMOS image sensor, and logic devices.
Our SABRE 3D electroplating solutions embed best-in-class technology backed by years of high-volume production experience. With each successive win across our served markets, the installed base of Lam equipment continues to grow, resulting in an expanding long-term revenue opportunity for our customer support business.
To create value for customers over the entire lifecycle of tool ownership, we are actively developing upgrades and advanced services targeted at extending technical capability and increasing productivity from existing installed base assets. These offerings help our customers reduce their total cost; and as a result, we continue to see growing demand.
Revenues from our customer support business grew in the September quarter on a sequential basis and our Reliant business achieved record quarterly revenue for the third quarter in a row. We expect 2019 overall will be another growth year for our customer support business.
Looking at our year-to-date performance, we have made tremendous progress against our objectives of expanding our SAM, increasing our market share, and building our installed base business. Importantly, 2019 has been a year where Lam has strengthened its position in the foundry and logic segment.
Also, with early indications of improving NAND demand and positive catalyst on the horizon for DRAM, we are increasingly optimistic the calendar year 2020 is setting up to be a year of outperformance for Lam as spending mix moves back in our favor.
Thanks again for joining today and now here's Doug. Okay, great. Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us today on what I know is a busy earnings season. We're pleased with Lam's performance in the September quarter. Our results once again exceeded the midpoint of guidance for all financial metrics. Operating income and diluted earnings per share came in at the high-end of our guidance range as we remain prudent in managing our spending throughout the quarter.
Let me begin as I always do by talking about our revenue segmentation in the September quarter. The combined memory segment was flat with the June quarter at 64% of total systems revenue. We had a decrease in the September quarter in the nonvolatile memory segment, moving from 46% to 38%, while DRAM increased from 26% from 18% of assistant revenue.
Spending in the NAND segment was focused on multiple nodes and we're beginning to see the first ramp of 128 layer structures. On the DRAM side, apart from the 1x and 1y nodes, we're seeing initial investments at 1z. As I noted on our last quarter earnings call, foundry and logic spending was strong and we expect strength from this segment to continue to the remainder of the calendar year.
The foundry segment represented 25% of our systems revenue in the quarter. Strength in this segment is related to spending on the 7 and 5 nanometer nodes. Logic another segment was down slightly from the prior quarter level coming in at 11% of system revenue. We continue to demonstrate strong progress in the foundry and logic segments, enabling us to maintain solid profitability levels during a period of depressed memory spending.
I believe probably foundry logic spending will be even stronger in December. Revenues for the quarter came in at $2,166 million which was again above the midpoint of guidance. Our revenue had a slightly broader geographic mix in the September quarter, compared to the June quarter. Our top reasons continue to be China, Korea and Taiwan.
The China region quarter performance remains higher than our historic average concentration of revenue. And similar to what I talked about last quarter, the majority of this came from indigenous Chinese customers across multiple segments.
Gross margin came in at 45.4% which was 40 basis points above the midpoint, mainly due to customer mix. And as we stated in prior quarters, you should expect gross margins to be a function of several factors such as business volumes, product mix and customer concentration, and we expect to see variability quarter to quarter.
We continued manager spending levels in the Company as operating expenses in the September quarter declined to $431 million which was down from $450 million in previous quarter. We remain laser focused on investing in research and development programs, as we saw the percentage of spending and R&D increased quarter-over-quarter to 67% of operating expenses.
The December quarter the guidance reflects total spending, increasing back to the June level, primarily due to an increase in variable compensation expense. A variable compensation fluctuates based on the level of quarterly profitability.
I'm going to also remind you that as we look ahead to the 2020 calendar year, you will see the normal seasonal spending increases related to the March quarter, comes from things like payroll taxes.
Operating income in the September quarter was $552 million and operating margin was 25.5%, at the top of our guidance range. Our September quarter non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 11% which was slightly lower than our long term rate. There will be fluctuations in the rate from quarter to quarter and we now expect our long term rate to be in the low teens level.
Other income and expense was a total of approximately $11 million in expense in the September quarter. The main components of other income and expense our interest income from the cash and investment balances we hold, offset by expense related to our outstanding debt. The total interest expense and all tranches of our debt is right now about $41 million per quarter.
You should expect that other income and expense will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, based on several market related items such as; our deferred compensation assets, venture capital investments and foreign exchange. We continue to execute on our capital return program during the September quarter. We allocated $234 million to capital return in the quarter with $75 million related to open market share repurchases and $159 million in dividends.
I would like to remind you that we continue to have an ongoing structured repurchase program that is expected to mature in the December quarter. This will continue to reduce our share count. We remain on track with our committed capital return. We currently have approximately $3 billion remaining in our Board authorized share repurchase program.
Diluted earnings per share came in at $3.18, which was at the high end of the guidance range that we provided for September. We ended the September quarter with diluted shares for earnings per share at approximately 151 million shares, which is the seventh consecutive quarter where our diluted share count has declined. The share count includes a dilutive impact of approximately 5 million shares from the 2041 convertible notes. And I'll remind you the dilution schedules for the remaining 2041 convertible notes is available on our Investor Relations website for your reference.
Let me now switch to the balance sheet. Our cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash, increased slightly in the September quarter to $5.8 billion from $5.7 billion in the June quarter. Cash flows from operations were $464 million, which was offset by share repurchase and dividends. Year-to-date in calendar year 2019, we have had strong cash from operations performance and we're on track to end this year with the second highest level of free cash flows in the Company's history.
DSO increased to 69 days versus 56 in the prior quarter. The DSO increase is related to the timing of customer payments occurring at the end of the September calendar month, which falls within our December fiscal quarter. Our inventory balance declined sequentially by $57 million, which is the fifth consecutive quarter where inventory balance decline. Inventory turns were 3.2 turns, which was just a little bit less than the 3.3 turns that we saw in the June quarter.
Non-cash expenses included approximately $43 million for equity compensation, $49 million for depreciation and $16 million for amortization. September quarter capital expenditures came in at $39 million, which was a decrease from $66 million in the June quarter. Our September quarter-end headcount was flat with the prior quarter at approximately 10,700 regular full-time employees.
So now looking ahead I'd like to provide our non-GAAP guidance for the December 2019 quarter. We are expecting revenue of $2,500 million, plus or minus $150 million. Gross margin of 45% plus or minus 1 percentage point, operating margins of 27% plus or minus 1 percentage point.
And finally, earnings per share of $3.80 plus or minus $0.20 based on a share count of approximately 150 million shares. I'm pleased to share with you the results we've delivered throughout calendar year 2019 and what has been a challenging industry environment. As Tim noted the supply demand environment is improving for the memory segments and we've made good progress in our foundry and logic positioning. Our installed base business continues to be on track to deliver a growth year in 2019. We're well positioned heading into 2020 and are optimistic about our future performance going forward.
Finally, I'd like to announce our plans to host an Investor Day on March 3rd, 2020 in New York City. Details on the venue and precise time will be forthcoming.
Operator, that concludes my prepared remarks. Tim and I would now like to open up the call for questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Atif Malik with Citi. Question on the WFE, Tim, you mentioned WFE going from low $40 billion to mid $40 billion. I wanted to understand if the majority of the increase has come from the foundry/logic segment in terms of the revised outlook? Maybe a few modifications, I mean, clearly, as we've said, we've continued to see strengthening in foundry and logic. So that is a portion of it. The -- some very early indications of NAND spending increase as we have now guided for December quarter. And finally, continuing strengthening in the China WFE as we've, kind of, seen increased strength throughout the year. So a combination of all those things, lead to our upward revision in WFE. Okay. And then a follow-up in your prepared remarks, you mentioned foundry/logic share gains above foundry/logic CapEx this year. How should we think about the outperformance of your foundry/logic business into next year and out given there’s some of the elements like reuse and growing EUV steps? Well, that's a great question, we basically -- as we have said on a number of occasions, the intensity of etch and deposition we see continuing to increase at every technology node. Our SAM grows, whether it'd be 10 to seven to five to three on into the future. SAM increases even in the face of EUV increased usage. And there's a number of reasons for that; patterning complexity continues to increase regardless of the introduction of EUV, and so there are additional steps for deposition and etch.
EUV itself introduces new requirements for hardmask, which gives Lam opportunity to participate from a deposition perspective. And EUV also, we have talked about in the past introduces opportunities for new steps like and processes like atomic layer etching that can be used to help increase quality and productivity of the EUV pattern itself. So, I think the way you should think about it is our SAM is expanding, competitively our -- we're gaining share at some of these new layers, and we feel we're well setup in both the foundry and logic space going forward as technology transitions. Thank you. We'll now take our next question from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Yes. Good afternoon thank you for taking the question. I guess first question, if we look back through to 2018, it looks like your share of wallet for WFE with NAND is roughly 30%. So curious as you think about moving to a rising layer count and your leadership in the high aspect ratio etch, and the just announced deposition wins on the call tonight, how should we think about your share of wallet as we go to 128 layer and above into 2020? Our SAM as a percentage of customer spend continues to increase with layer count, and that's for two reasons; one, I mean obviously the simple fact of building and etching the higher stack, but also the fact that, as I mentioned there are new steps and new opportunities that get created for dealing with issues such as; in the VECTOR DT case the stress associated with those taller layer counts. So, I think that our view is SAM grows as layer count increases. Thanks, Tim. And I guess as a follow up, Doug, I'm not sure if you spoke to the entirety of installed base revenues, but did they grow sequentially in September? And how should we think about the trend? Or what should we kind of model it to into 2020? Yes. C.J., I think, Tim, actually mentioned in his prepared remarks that they did grow sequentially and it was the third consecutive record quarter for the Reliant component of that business. I'm not going to quantify next year yet, a little bit too soon. But what we said in the past and I can continue to be very comfortable saying today is, I have a hard time envisioning a year when the installed base business doesn't grow, it should grow every single year because chamber count grows every year, it's growing this year, even in a depressed memory spending environment, and we continue to bring new advanced service offerings to market that we hope enable us to achieve more and more of the customer's OpEx spend. So that's how you should be thinking about that C.J. Thank you. We will now take our next question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. This is the second quarter in a row of the heavier China domestic mix. Do you guys anticipate this bias to continue into the December quarter and into next year and similar to my question last time? Is this in your view a focused effort by China to accelerate their semiconductor manufacturing capabilities, given the trade tensions with the U.S. or more your China customers just having more confidence to move forward with their early memory and foundry programs? Yes, Harlan, what I’ve tried to describe in fact, I tried to foreshadow it last quarter in earnings that this is above normal run rate of local Chinese customers spend. But Tim did point out in his remarks that some of the strengthening in WFE came from local China, probably now and nominally somewhat about $6 billion in WFE. And as we look into next year, we absolutely think it will grow again next year, but it will ebb and flow, it will -- these big projects can be lumpy at times, and it will go up and it will go down depending on when equipment ships into any one fab project. Tim, do you want to add anything? Yes, I think that -- as I commented, we've seen strengthening in domestic China spend through the year, anticipate that continuing and maybe the most important part of that story for Lam is that clearly a big portion of the new incremental spending in China is targeted toward the memory market. And obviously our SAM, and our share in the memory space is quite good, so from that perspective we see China as an area of strength for us. Yes, Harlan, I forgot the one part of your question you asked, do we think anything pulled in? Actually really don't, I don't think it would make sense that they would be pulling things in sooner and because if you're concerned about our inability to ship being the reason they pulled in, then they can get spares and service from us, they can't actually really utilize the tools very well. So I don't believe that there was pull-ons really do anything like that. Great, thank you. Thank you for the insights there. And the team continues its strong design win momentum on non-critical and/or legacy technology node. As part of it, as you pointed out is the Reliant systems products continue to do well. We continue to hear from your customers that they're laser focused on productivity throughput, uptime, footprint all of the things that impact overall wafer costs. Are you guys now in a position to at least give us some sense on how fast the non-critical/refurbished business systems -- business is growing? And roughly the size of this business relative to your total revenue base? Maybe you have to wait till Investor Day for that. No, we do plan -- we do -- we have promised for some time now to provide you more detail in those areas and we're just, we will do that. I think maybe a couple of points, your comment about customers being laser focused on productivity? I mean, it's one of the reasons why we have been talking about it, it takes some time for those products for our efforts to really start to show up in new wins.
But you know we're starting to see in this area that Doug talked about in advanced services, where some of these intelligent database tools are really starting to help us reduce, for instance troubleshooting time on the systems, reduced unscheduled downs on the systems and those are things that the customers are pulling hard for because again it's productivity for tools that are already in place and relatively easy to implement. So we are prioritizing productivity, because it's in the best interest of the customer and the industry as a whole. Thank you. We'll hear now from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Yes, good afternoon guys. Thanks, let me ask the question. Congratulations on the strong results. Tim, I just want to go back to the market opportunity in logic/foundry for you. If you kind of look at calendar year-to-date that business combined for you was up somewhere between 30% to 40% year-over-year? I guess, I'm just trying to get a sense of how we think about your market position, maybe in North America as we see 14 go to 10 go to seven and maybe in Taiwan as we see seven go to five go to three, can you talk a little bit about how much visibility you have on product tool of record on some of these critical etch and deposition steps? And how we might think about your share opportunity as we migrate down these nodes? Sure, I can do that without quite getting as specific as North America, Taiwan on those notes. So maybe I'll point you just a couple of comments, I made and then embellish there was a little bit, you know, as I said it within the logic and foundry space, it takes many years to establish yourself as the first -- the development tool of record. And then ultimately see that rollout into volume buys is the production tool of record.
And so when we talk about I gave -- we gave a little bit of a new look into this penetration and defense. Forward-looking three-year revenue opportunity statement, that is designed to give some indication as to how long it takes from the time we win one of those selection decisions and you'll see that revenue opportunity will take place over those following three years, that's definitely true in the foundry and logic space.
And so I think that when we talk about improving opportunity at 10 and then seven and then five, you know, you can kind of look out and say, if you're like a 5-nanometer decision is revenue opportunities that now we're roll in over the course of the next several years. So that may not be quite the level of specificity you wanted, but it basically says things that we are winning now will actually be our revenue for the next three years plus in that space. That's helpful. And then, Doug, you mentioned in your prepared comments, you still have about $3 billion left on the buyback, and I apologize in capital allocation call, but this most recent quarter, the buybacks dipped down a little bit, which I guess is understandable, just given the level of uncertainty. Any color you can give us around the pace at which you might want to try to execute buybacks going forward? And how we should think about, kind of, just remind us again the cash return policy you're trying to hit? Yes, John, I mean, one thing I would point out to you and if you look over the last two years, you will have seen several quarters where the cash we actually deployed moved down somewhat. That was because in the quarter before that we put one of these accelerated share repurchase programs in place. You have the same phenomenon going on this quarter.
So even though the cash that we deployed in terms of open market repurchases wasn't all that significant this quarter, that ASR was still executing buying stock back, and that ASR that's currently out there will complete in the December quarter. So we'll be thinking about what we're going to do incrementally as we go forward.
So far, just remind you what we talked about and it's been a while now the last Analyst Day that we're committed to at least 50% of free cash flow returned to shareholders, and obviously if you look at our history, over the last five, six years, we've done a whole lot more than that. And I had went on the timing to complete the current authorization and I'm going to kind of remain that way. I've said in the past, we'll be opportunistic and that's as much as I have quite right now. Thank you, we'll take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Thanks a lot. I guess my first question, Doug is can you help us a little bit with the mix in December. I'm curious, if the uptick in revenue is going to be more on the NAND side and more on the foundry side? Thanks. Yes, what I said, Tim in my remarks, was I expect December will continue to be pretty strong with foundry and logic quarter. So that's a key piece of what's going on. Okay, awesome. And then I just wanted to -- I just wanted to drill down a little bit into the China piece. So China is about 25% of your revenues now on the trailing 12-month basis. So I guess, I'm curious how much of this is going into indigenous projects versus the multinationals. Because I thought you said China was about $5 billion of 2018 WFE, and I think at that time, you were talking about $3 billion of that $5 billion being domestic China. And I think you just said that China is going to be over $6 this year. So, can you sort of like level set us on how much of that $6 this year will be multi-versus domestic and maybe how much domestic can even grow next year? Thanks. Yes, let me walk it back for you a little, Tim, because some things have moved around a little bit. When I look at what happened last year, local China ended up being I don't know $4.5 billion of WFE roughly. So it ended up being maybe a little bit more than that for that we have been talking about and the way we see it today, it's above $6, it's somewhat above $6. I don't know for sure what next year is going to look like. But as we look at our analytics in the fab projects that are coming in and whatnot, I do see pretty strongly believe it will grow next year. I'm not ready to tell you how much yet. We'll give you more clarity on our WFE view for next year on the next earnings call. But I think local China will continue to grow next year. And, Doug just to clarify those numbers are local China numbers right? That's right, Tim. Yes. Thank you. We'll take the next question from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Yes. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the strong results. Tim, you talked about early signs of a recovery in NAND in your prepared remarks. And Doug, you just mentioned that most of the growth or at least implicitly, I think you commented that most of the growth in December quarter should be coming from foundry and logic? So should we expect some of the NAND projects that we're all collectively hearing about should hit the March quarter from a rev rec perspective? Yes, it's maybe there is not such a big change here from what we've said. We -- you know, ever since beginning of the year, we said that memory spending would likely remain relatively weak throughout the year. And when I talked about early signs, it is the -- it's very early is in there, we're now starting to see some of those projects transpire as you just talked about, meaning a little bit of ordering occurring in the December quarter, but we still maintain our view that we exit the year with this 30% bit supply growth rate and that customers are prudently managing the supply growth, but I do think those projects, you know, it's kind of that early signs, it's a healthy industry and we're going to see growth in 2020. So exact timing, we really don't want to give you that right now, but it's -- it looks to be coming. Got it. And then as a follow-up, I just wanted to hit the logic and foundry opportunity dynamic into 2020. Obviously, you guys have done a great job over the past couple of years and gaining share in both buckets. If we assume that spending in logic and foundry is largely flat in 2020, and if you assume EUV adoption continues to grow. Based on what you guys know from a design win or application win perspective, can you still grow logic and foundry revenues in that sort of environment backdrop? Thanks. Yes, it's a great question and the answer is yes, we would expect to grow in that scenario, based on a couple of things; one, as you move forward, even on the same WFE, our SAM as a percent of that WFE should increase as transition still continued to occur to more advanced nodes. Etch and deposition opportunity increases at each successive technology node, even in the face of EUV. So I think in the scenario described, we would expect to have a larger opportunity and we do believe that we're winning share as well and therefore we would grow. Thank you. We'll hear now from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company. Yes. Hi, thanks for taking my question. I had two of them; first one for either Tim or Doug. More a industry focused question you spoke about how NAND bit growth exiting this year is going to be 30%, kind of, curious like ask your customers start ramping 128 layer NAND, if next year demand bit growth is below 30%. Do you still expect the 120 layers spending to go through next year, because it's more strategic, low cost in nature? Or do you think it might get throttle back if demand bit growth is slower? Maybe I'll take and then Tim you can add-on. I mean, Krish what -- one I don't think that's what's going to happen. But we're that to be what happened, I think you would see a year that looked something like this year in that most of the industry spending was allocated to node conversions as opposed to new capacity adds, because that lowers cost per bit, the economics are better and all of that.
The other thing I would say, and then I'll let Tim add-on. When we look into early next year, I believe supply growth rate will continue to decline based on the investment set have occurred this year, right? Because they have reduced this year and so you're moving into a declining rate of growth, as we look into the first half of next year. Tim, anything you want to add? Yes, I think just to reiterate Doug's point, I mean, technology transitions we think occur every year, simply because of the benefit to bit cost. And so, I guess, I would say that in any year, which is not our view of declining supply growth we would still see the majority of the spend in technology transitions. And I guess there is one other key point to think about, we've mentioned this a few times in a technology transition from say 96 layers to 128 layers, the majority of that spend is for etch and deposition. So there's definitely an outperformance statement there, if spend continues to be based just on technology transitions. Got it, got it. That's very helpful. And then as a follow-up, I think, Tim in your prepared comments you spoke about how you guys are successfully defended 100% dielectric etch market share. I'm kind of curious on the NAND side, is that a fair enough statement, if you look past 128 layer higher than 128 layer DTOR tools or is it more up to 128 layers? Well, in our statement is always as those decisions are made. So we always speak about accomplishing made. So I don't know if any decisions have been made well beyond the 128 layer node. So we -- it's obviously something that we compete for it every node. But, I guess what I'd point out is there is a very important piece of learning that has come from us running now millions of wafers through our dielectric etch tools.
And there was a question earlier about, productivity, reliability, stability, defect performance. Those are all things that again we have millions and millions of wafers of experience. And so kind of come in with an edge every node that you have to compete for as the incumbent. So that -- but specifically, I think, you could bucket most of those in that 128 nanometer and below node since their decisions already made. Thank you. We'll hear from Patrick Ho with Stifel. Thank you very much. And also congrats on a really nice quarter, maybe, Tim, first, a lot of the market questions have been answered on my end. But as you look at next generation memory technologies like MRAM, ReRAM. Can you just give a -- maybe a qualitative view of how Lam is positioning itself to capitalize on those next generation opportunities? Yes, I guess maybe the simpler statement that I make inside the Company is we're not running from our leadership position in memory, and that includes in these new emerging memory markets. And so we're actively looking to develop new applications, new tools that meet the needs of those devices. We've spoken about, one of them in particular so far this year, which is the ion beam edge tool, that's used for MRAM and we have established a very strong position for that particular application, phase-change memory ReRAM, there are other devices we are actively engaged in development with the leading companies. So it is a target market for us, in fact, one might argue that we feel we, sort of, we already sort of own that memory space and I think it's our focus. It's Dough. Just to add-on, if you really want more detail you can go look at the transcript of the Flash Memory Summit, where Tim and Rick Gottscho spent lots of time talking about how we view these emerging memory architectures. Great. Thanks, Doug. And maybe as my follow-up question, you talked a little bit about your atomic layer deposition opportunity. I guess from a big picture perspective, how do you see the total available market for you in that? And do you see it expanding from where -- it looks like you have a strong position on the memory side of thing. Can this also expand onto the foundry/logic side of things? So we'd already has expanded, I mean, ALD is not memory specific. So we use these films also on the logic and foundry side. ALD atomic layer etching and atomic layer deposition and atomic layer etching, these are technologies that will continue to be increasingly used as devices become smaller and smaller and structures become more complex. So I think it's an expanding market opportunity, and in fact I think in coming years, you'll start to see inflections for instance from batch processing tools to single wafer ALD just again for the type of wafer uniformity and requirements of those processes going forward. So it's an area where we're growing and we feel confident about our development activities in the tools themselves. Thank you. We'll hear now from Craig Ellis with B. Riley FBR. Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Tim, I wanted to follow-up on the comments that you made that calendar '20 to be a year of outperformance for Lam. Can you just help us understand how much of that comes from moving deeper into the sweet spot of the foundry/logic share gain that you've been talking about versus help that you would get from what appears to be a nice and very encouraging upturn that's starting to occur in NAND or maybe something else like SAM expansion? Yes, I think for us to give you more detail on the break out on that you'll have to wait until we actually speak to our 2020 WFE outlook next quarter. But you kind of hit it, I mean, we -- the way I think about outperformance in 2020, it's just what you said. First and foremost you -- everyone knows that we are highly leveraged to the memory market, and we do believe that spending mix moves back in our favor next year.
And even in the face of stronger and continuing strength in logic and foundry memory will improve to some extent. We've strengthened our logic and foundry SAM opportunity, as well as share position and so that's a continued benefit as logic and foundry remain strong. And also as Doug mentioned CSBG continues to grow as we expand our portfolio of advanced services in that space. And so can break it out for you, how much each of those contributes, but each of them is important part of the story in 2020. Thanks, Tim. And then I'll do the follow-up to Doug. Doug impressive trough-to-trough operating margin improvement of about 300 basis points. And within that there is dramatic improvement with operating expense as a percentage of sales. And as you noted, there's been significant mix shift R&D. The question is how much further benefit is there in the model for increased operating leverage? And how much room do you have to further drive expense toward R&D from SG&A? It's something we've been working on for years, I mean, Tim was driving those on years ago, honestly in rest of companies rally behind it. We're going to keep squeeze in efficiency out every SG&A dollar we spend. We want to be totally rigorous about that. So that we can allocate more of those dollars to R&D, I think that 60%, 70% last quarter might be an all-time high for the Company. I haven't gone all the way back, but in my recent memory that was an all-time high. We're going to keep at that, we're going to continue to try to get better, we do this every words part of the culture of the Company to be focused on continuous improvement. I don't know how we can get it obviously, but we're going to keep working on it. Thank you. We'll hear now from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Thanks for taking my question. And I joined a little late, so I apologize if this was asked. But DRAM was quite strong in the quarter. And I'm wondering what caused that and how sustainable is that trend? When I look at it, it's primarily conversion spending. That's really what we've seen for the entire year is focused on node conversions, it will ebb and flow. The important thing when you think about DRAM is to understand when we look at similar to what we were describing NAND exiting the year below where we believe demand growth to be, you got a similar story in DRAM.
As we look at the investments that are occurring in DRAM this year exiting the year supply growth is probably in the low teens. And we believe long-term demand growth is in high teens maybe approaching 20%. There is a ways to go, Vivek to continue to burn inventory out of the channel. I think that's going to take a little bit longer. But what I do know is at some point the inventory will be burned off and spending will grow more significantly. In quarter-by-quarter, it's just going to be dependent on what projects are under way at what customers. Got it, very helpful. And then as a follow-up, kind of, looking at your cash flow generation, so fiscal '19 from what I noticed there was a lot of cash inflow from working capital that I'm looking at the model right. How should we think about the plus and minus from working capital this year? Thank you. If you look at the first half of this year, Vivek -- calendar year again. I never really think too much in terms of fiscal calendar year. I mean we're -- cash was just super strong, I think we had two consecutive quarters around $900 million in operational cash flow and you're right. A lot of that came from working capital. Now what you normally see with the business when it's growing, it will consume working capital, meaning it will take cash to build inventory and receivables and so forth.
When it levels off or contracts, it will generate cash and that's really what went on in the first half of the year. I mean, we managed cash quite proactively, but the practical reality of business ebb and flow was that's what happens. The right way to think about the free cash flow of the business is it's a couple of points below where operational cash flow should be on a sustainable basis. But it will ebb and flow around wherever read in the business cycle. Thank you. We'll take our next question from Joe Lachky with Wells Fargo. Yes, thanks for taking the question. You talked about improvements and inventory that you've seen across the NAND flash. I was wondering, if you could talk about, to the extent you can, factory utilization rates and your installed base? It's hard for us actually to put our finger on exactly what utilizations are. I mean we saw it pulled back a little bit in both NAND and DRAM this year. And I think that was pretty well-telegraphed from our customers. But better -- it's a better question to put to them, we don't always know exactly what their utilizations are running at. Okay, fair enough. And then maybe a follow-up to that. You talked about exiting this year at 30% supply growth, I mean, for NAND and maybe and potentially going lower than that next year on the first part of the year. I guess, the question is how do we think about the level of capacity expansion needed to hit kind of the -- I guess, expected demand growth for 2020? Tough question to answer Joe, to be honest. What's occurred this year and NAND largely has been conversions, maybe with a couple exceptions. But if you look at NAND, WFE through the year -- this year, but that's what was going on and you saw declining rate of supply growth such that as we exit the year obviously, we said 30% and I think long-term NAND growth is in the high '30s, maybe 40%. To have 40% supply growth, we need to be adding a few wafers every single year, and so it didn't happen quite so much this year and you've seen supply growth decline. I don't know if that helps you, but that's how I think about it. Thank you. We'll take our next question from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I really had two and most of them have been answered. But from a high level, I mean, do you guys talking about kind of a better market for memory in 2020. So when do you think we'll see capacity upgrades or is this all going to be technology upgrades?
And then secondly, you guys gave a lot of color on NAND, but not so much in DRAM. So based on the commentary about server demand and kind of an increase in Q1, does that mean you guys think that -- that's going to be kind of the bottom or do you think that exiting the year, we're going to start to see supply demand balance for DRAM? Well, I think that what we've said about DRAM maybe just was that we think through the first half of next year. Inventory remains elevated and so it's really not, I guess our view at this point is DRAM maybe more of a second half story for next year. Obviously we'll give far more color as we develop our full 2020 outlook. It's just that NAND is much more upon us right now. Simply because the issues are being worked through more quickly as a result of the supply constraints that have been in place this year and maybe also the demand catalysts for NAND that are occurring right now. Got it. And is a capacity upgrades at what time in 2020 is that like back half or do you think capacity upgrades will begin earlier than that? Mitch too soon for us to talk in any detail about 2020, hold off for one quarter we'll give you a little better visibility on it. It's still a little bit too far away for us to get into detail. Thank you. And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Correia for any additional or closing remarks. Just wanted to thank you everyone for joining us today, appreciate it. Thank you and that does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for participants.

A detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release. This call is scheduled to last until 3.00 PM Pacific Time. A replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our Web site.
With that, I will hand the call over to Tim. Thanks, Tina, and welcome everyone. In the December quarter, Lam delivered revenues and diluted earnings per share above the midpoint of guidance, marking another quarter of solid execution and closing out a year of strong performance in calendar 2019. Consistent with our comments throughout this year, we enter 2020 with increasing momentum and an improved spending mix environment which we believe will lead to outperformance by Lam.
I have now completed my first year as CEO of Lam Research and I am incredibly proud of what our people have achieved. Underpinning our strong financial results this past year has been a companywide focus on execution and an emphasis on our culture where all employees can perform their best. I want to thank Lam's employees across our global organization for their efforts and of course our partners and customers for their valued support.
I also want to take a moment to address the coronavirus situation. Our concern first and foremost is with the health and well being of our employees, customers and partners and with this in mind we have implemented precautionary measures within our global business operations. Additionally, we are donating to Chinese relief efforts to support the people and communities impacted by the coronavirus outbreak.
Now turning to our business results. In calendar 2019, we generated solid operating cash flows and at the same time we invested a company record in research and development dollars to fuel technology innovation and product differentiation. Our EPS performance, the second best in the company's 40-year history, was especially noteworthy given that memory spending declined significantly year-over-year in 2019.
The impact of lower memory spending was partially mitigated by record revenue from our customer support business group, highlighting the importance of our recurring spares and service opportunity to the overall quality of earnings of the company. In 2019, we also saw outstanding execution in our product organizations.
We grew our revenue share of WFE spend in memory and foundry logic, and we laid the foundation for additional gains as we recorded our best ever performance in net penetration and defense application wins as measured by revenue potential over the next three years. We are winning by focusing on high-volume manufacturing solutions for emerging technology inflection challenges, including those associated with new scaling architectures, new memory technologies and new materials.
We are capitalizing on the learning from our installed base of tools that today enables some of the industry's most critical etch and deposition applications. For example, for the three most critical applications in 3D NAND, our Strata, ALTUS and Flex tools each process well over 1 million wafers per month in high-volume manufacturing allowing us to partner early and in a unique way with our customers on next generation needs.
In 2019, this led to the addition of new products to our portfolio such as the VECTOR DT which is designed to address wafer stress problems encountered during the high-volume production of 3D NAND stacks of 96 layers and above. Similarly, we enhanced the capabilities of our Corvus product family to improve device yield at the wafer edge by depositing and encapsulating layers for bevel protection. These products expand our served share of WFE spend, but just as importantly they exemplify our commitment to our customer success.
In 2019, we improved to the number one or number two position at all of our largest customers that provide a competitive ranking of their suppliers based on detailed, quality, support and performance scorecards. In part, this improvement is due to our investment in productivity enhancing upgrades for our installed base. For instance, Corvus wafer edge solutions have become key differentiators for our conductor and dielectric etch systems in high-volume manufacturing and have been instrumental in helping our customers reduce cost of ownership.
We announced in 2019 a Corvus-enabled self maintaining etch tool that ran for one year in high-volume manufacturing without human intervention. Multiple customers are now upgrading their installed base tools to include this high-value-added capability. In 2019, we highlighted heterogeneous integration and advanced packaging as new areas of opportunity to leverage our product portfolio in 3D learning to drive growth.
In the December quarter, we built on our growing momentum in this space with additional wins for our SABRE 3D electroplating system at multiple advanced packaging customers. With these latest wins, we estimate that we have gained more than 15 points of market share in the last two years and we have firmly established ourselves as the technology leader in the increasingly important through-silicon via market.
Another area of growth for the company has been in atomic layer deposition or ALD. Our ALD solutions are gaining significant traction in the market by delivering best-in-class film properties along with hyperactivity and low defects. Due to the inherent advantages of higher film quality and comparability, our Striker ALD oxide systems are replacing older process alternatives such as spin on dielectric and SA CVD for critical applications pulling more WFE spending into our served market.
Similarly, RC scaling requirements are driving increased demand for our single wafer Striker carbide and ALTUS ALD metallization systems. When used for low-k carbide liner spacer applications, our Striker system has been able to achieve 30% better RC properties versus competing batch tools. The metallization we closed out 2019 on a high note with significant wins in logic/foundry for our ALTUS systems as customers look to replace the conventional barrier fill sequence with an integrated ALD approach to lower device resistance in a cost-effective way.
Across all products, we exited 2019 with approximately 61,000 chambers in our installed base. Our installed base revenues grew year-over-year and reached record levels in 2019 with significant contribution from our Reliant business, which also reached record levels.
Productivity upgrades and solutions grew more than 30% year-over-year as we have worked to help customers enhance the performance of their existing assets. Furthermore, we signed several new multiyear customer support contracts. These multiyear contracts enable Lam to significantly reduce customers running costs while generating a recurring revenue stream for Lam.
Now turning to WFE. We estimate 2019 WFE ended in the $46 billion to $47 billion range, slightly higher than our prior mid $40 billion estimate. The increase was driven predominantly by higher foundry/logic spending.
For calendar 2020, assuming no material impact from coronavirus on our full year outlook, our view calls for WFE spend in the mid-to-high $50 billion range supported by sustained strong spending in foundry and logic and significantly for Lam improved spending in memory led first by NAND. Overall, we expect spending in memory and foundry/logic segments to be up year-on-year in 2020.
To wrap up, Lam delivered strong financial performance in calendar 2019. And as our March quarter guidance suggests, we are in a great position to drive higher in 2020 with the improvement in memory spending. Lam's product pipeline is very strong with more innovation on the way, and we look forward to sharing more with you at our upcoming Investor Day on March 3.
Thanks. And now here's Doug. Great. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today in the middle of what I know is a very busy earnings season. We concluded calendar year 2019 with the strong December quarterly performance. Results ended up better than we expected, primarily due to a little bit stronger NAND investment as well as an uptick in our installed base business.
Our installed base business delivered another record year and continued to be a stable profitable business for us. And as Tim mentioned, from and earnings per share perspective, it was the second best year in our 40-year history. The December quarter results came in over the midpoint of guidance for all financial metrics with diluted earnings per share essentially at the high end of our guidance range.
As Tim also noted, we’re pleased with our performance in calendar year 2019 and we delivered solid profitability levels within a challenging memory environment. As we discussed at our earnings call last quarter, there were continued strong investments in the foundry and logic segments in the December quarter. We had the highest system revenue dollars for the foundry segment in our history and the revenue concentration was at its highest level since the September 2016 quarter.
Foundry spending continued its focus on the 7 and 5 nanometer nodes and it represent 36% of our December quarter system revenue. The logic and other segment grew in dollar terms and was essentially flat with the prior quarter intensity level coming in at 12% of system revenues. It was the highest logic and other revenue level in dollar terms in two years driven by 10-nanometer, image sensors and other specialty markets.
For memory, the combined segment decreased to 52% of system revenues from the September quarter which was at 64%. We had a decrease in the December quarter in the nonvolatile memory segment going from 38% to 35%. Going from a dollar perspective, revenue in the segment actually increased.
The DRAM segment decreased from 26% to 17% of system revenue. NAND investment continues to be focused on 64, 96 and initial 128 layer devices and DRAM spending continues to be primarily focused on node transitions.
Revenues for the quarter were $2,584 million which was above the midpoint. In addition to the leading edge foundry and logic strength I mentioned, we saw continued investments in the China region with the majority again coming from domestic Chinese customers. China geographic revenue came in at 29% of total revenue in December.
Gross margin came in at 45.7%, 70 basis points above the midpoint. The strength in the December quarter gross margin is related to customer and product mix as well as increased factory utilization levels relative to the prior quarter.
I’ll remind you as I always do that actual gross margins are a function of several factors such as business volumes, product mix and customer concentration and you should expect to see some variability quarter-to-quarter.
Operating expense for the December quarter came in at $481 million. Our variable compensation spending was higher in the quarter as it’s tied to the increased level of profitability. Spending in the December quarter also increased due to the appreciation of the market during the quarter and the resulting impact on the cost of our deferred compensation plan.
As I’ve mentioned in the past, we do hedge this to mitigate the exposure to the income statement. However, because of the accounting rules, the offset to this expense shows up in other income and expense. It's basically a neutral impact to earnings per share at the end of the day.
We continue to invest in our critical research and development programs and you’ll hear more about our commitment to technology and productivity leadership at our upcoming Investor’s Day in March. I’ll also remind you that as we look ahead to the 2020 calendar year, you’ll see the normal seasonal spending increases related to the March quarter.
Operating income in the December quarter was $700 million and operating margin was 27.1%, essentially at the midpoint of guidance. Non-GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 12.5%. I would like to highlight that the difference between the non-GAAP tax rate and the December quarter GAAP tax rate which was 23.5% was related to the reversal of the tax benefit from the Altera stock-based compensation case. I think you're seeing this from lots of companies in the technology space.
You should expect that fluctuations in the tax rate will occur quarter-to-quarter. And as we look into the rate for the calendar year 2020, I expect it to be in the low-teens level. Other income and expense was up slightly from the prior quarter at a total of approximately $13 million in expense.
The main components of OI&E are interest income from our cash and investment balances offset by interest expense related to the outstanding debt. You should expect that other income and expense will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on several market-related items, things like foreign exchange are what I’m talking about.
Moving now to capital return. For the December quarter, $167 million of cash was deployed in dividends and $1 billion in share repurchase. As we’ve frequently done in the past, the share repurchases were done through a structured share repurchase program that cover repurchases through the June 2020 quarter. We remain on track with our commitment to capital return.
For calendar year 2019, we completed $3 billion of our current $5 billion buyback authorization. In total, our capital return activities represented approximately 158% of free cash flow in 2019.
Diluted earnings per share was $4.01. Our diluted shares continue to decline and we ended the December quarter with diluted shares at approximately 150 million shares. This is the eighth consecutive quarter where our diluted share count has declined.
The share count includes a dilutive impact of approximately 5 million shares from the 2041 convertible notes. And I'll remind you that the dilution schedule for the 2041 converts is available on our IR Web site for your reference.
Let me now move to the balance sheet. Our cash and short-term investments including restricted cash decreased in the December quarter to $4.9 billion from $5.8 billion in the September quarter. The decrease quarter-to-quarter was due to the share repurchase and dividend activity, offset by cash flows from operations of $308 million.
And as I’ve mentioned before, when you see business levels grow, working capital levels generally increase which impacted our cash flow from operations in December. We concluded calendar year 2019 with the second highest level of free cash flow in the company's history at over $2.3 billion. I believe this truly demonstrates the sustainability of our business through a lower industry spend period.
DSO increased slightly due to the timing of collections to 72 days versus 69 days in the prior quarter. Inventory turns improved to 3.7 turns from 3.2 in the September quarter. Both receivables and inventory grew in dollars during December as business levels increased by.
Non-cash expenses included approximately $46 million for equity compensation, $49 million for depreciation and $17 million for amortization. December quarter capital expenditures increased to $62 million from $39 million in the September quarter.
Ending headcount as of the December quarter was flat with the prior quarter at approximately 10,700 regular full-time employees. We expected as revenue levels are growing, we’ll add headcount to support the increasing business.
So now looking ahead, I’d like to provide our non-GAAP guidance for the March 2020 quarter. We’re expecting revenue of $2,800 million plus or minus $200 million; gross margin of 46.5% plus or minus one percentage point; operating margins of 28% plus or minus one percentage point; and finally, earnings per share of $4.55 plus or minus $0.40 based on the share count of approximately 149 million shares.
We see continued strength in foundry and logic spending going into the March quarter and additionally we see NAND spending continue to increase going into 2020. The March quarter guidance reflects our current view of the business environment, including our assessment of the potential impact from the public health situation in China.
We see business disruptions potentially with both customers and suppliers that are essentially extending the lunar New Year holiday through February 9. Absent this situation, our numbers would have been somewhat higher.
We also increased the revenue and EPS ranges to take into consideration the uncertainty of the impact from these activities. We believe this is temporary but the issue is developing day by day. I think we’re taking a prudent approach to what we’re doing with the numbers.
So to conclude, we’re well positioned heading into 2020. We’re on a strong trajectory to outperform based on our product portfolio as well as operational strategies. And that concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, Tim and I would now like to open up the call for questions. Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. My first question just is been focusing on the domestic China market. Doug, you were kind enough to tell us it was the majority of the China business in the December. I’m wondering if you can help us understand how much of a majority it was. And what was the split between sort of memory and logic? And then as you look out to your WFE forecast growth of at least 20% in calendar year '20, how important is the domestic China market and how should we think about the memory versus sort of the logic/foundry side of that? Yes, I’ll answer it and then I’ll let Tim add on. John, I’m not going to get into the habit every quarter of giving a precise quantification except to tell you the majority in the December quarter was from domestic China. And that’s been the case the last couple of quarters. And the reason I’ve been mentioning that over the last couple of quarters is it’s different than the last several years have been where the majority has actually come from the global multinationals. Then your question relative to how we’re looking into 2020 in China, I think 2019 probably finished with WFE from the local China customers a little bit above $6 billion, something like that and it’s growing in 2020. And as we look into 2020, I think John probably it’s up $2 billion to $3 billion is my best guess from local China. And that spending is broad based; it’s NAND, it’s DRAM, it’s foundry and logic. So it’s not one or the other. It’s broad based settled [ph] for customer spending. Tim, you want to add anything. No, I think that pretty much covers it. And then as my follow on just on WFE and kind of your share, Tim, you talked about in your prepared comments you did a nice job kind of gaining your share of WFE. Is 2020 a year where that becomes a little bit more difficult with sort of the addition of EUV or how important is EUV to your growth projections this year? And as we think about EUV deployment, is that a good leading indicator for your future business or how should we think about that? Yes, I think that – we’ve talked about EUV a number of times. And so I guess maybe I’ll just repeat a few things I said and maybe add a couple of comments. In general, what we’ve said is that technology transitions themselves are very good for Lam. We have highlighted a number of times that Lam’s served market actually grows at each technology node within foundry/logic even with the introduction of EUV. So really what we want is we want the market and our customers to be able to keep moving their technologies forward. Specific to patterning as you move from say 7 to 5 nanometer, even in the case of EUV what you’re starting to see is, is the increased use of more high-quality hard masks moving away from spin on dielectrics towards deposition metals like PECVD where Lam has a very strong position. And so in many cases, our SAM is actually increasing because we’re pulling in applications that before were actually done with older processes and now they’re coming into a more critical space. And so with that, we see SAM increase and therefore even with the EUV we see a growing market for ourselves. Doug talked about highest dollars from foundry and logic and that’s just I think further evidence, because we’re seeing technology investments right now at those EUV nodes. Now as far as the leading indicator, John, what we said is that EUV is obviously – those shipments are signs of these more complex technology nodes and again our SAM grows, so opportunity grows. John, the only thing I would add, as you think about wallet share of WFE going into 2020, I think you know our SAM and share in NAND is very good. And clearly 2020 in our view is going to be a stronger investment period for the NAND industry as we’ve seen kind of pricing and profitability stabilize. So our share of wallet actually in addition to the EUV commentary Tim had is actually going to have a tailwind from the fact that NAND spending I think will be stronger. That’s right. Thanks, guys. Congratulations again. Thanks, John. All right. Thank you. Our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question on WFE as you think about the roughly $8 billion to $10 billion increase year-on-year into 2020, can you tell us how much of that is memory versus foundry and logic? Is that kind of an 80/20 split? And then as part of that, are you including the material uplift in DRAM within that or is that something that could be a source of further upside? Okay, C.J., great questions. I don’t think we’re going to give you the exact breakout, but I think we’ve characterized it as – maybe you can look back to what we said as we were exiting last year. What we said was that we were seeing very strong spending in foundry/logic and that we were just starting to see the early signs of improvement in NAND and we felt that DRAM would come after the NAND market had improved. And so I think what you’re seeing in our outlook for 2020 is that starting to play out. Except for again sustained strong spending in foundry and logic, certainly the emphasis on sustained and a strong uptick in NAND spending which as Doug just commented is a significant tailwind for us in terms of our SAM as a percent of WFE. Relative to DRAM, I think we characterized last year primarily as the technology investment year with very little capacity additions. And I would say that in general our outlook at this year is that that doesn’t change much at least until much later in the year. So I’d say primarily sustained strong foundry and logic and a strong uptick in NAND. Great. And as a follow-up question on the service side, thank you for providing the installed base numbers, very helpful. So up I think 12% in calendar '18, up 9% in calendar '19. Can you help us kind of think about what the growth rate for service could look like? And is it fair to say that service in 2019 reached roughly mid-30s of total revenues? Thank you. So I’ll take the last one. It wasn’t quite that high, C.J., but it was comfortably above 30 in 2019, I’ll give you that much. I think that we’re very confident. We’ve said that because of the growing installed base, the overall customer support business grows every year. How it grows each year I’ve talked a little bit about that dynamic where depending on where you are in kind of utilization and spending and customers will spend on different things. I highlighted a very strong year for us in 2019 on productivity upgrades which is – one of the things customers do when they’re looking to squeeze a little bit more out of the assets they already have in their fabs and we saw a lot of that last year. I think that as you transition now to a very busy year and customers ramping aggressively, then you’ll find yourself much more in this comparison and some of the value-added services part. But in general, given the dynamics with our market and our product portfolio, we feel very confident about its ability to grow year-on-year with the installed base. Thank you. Thanks, C.J. Thank you. Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Good afternoon and great job on the solid business execution. With the complexity of the manufacturing process combined with higher specifications, maybe longer install and call times, on average from the time that you ship a tool to the time that that tool is put into full value production, I think greenfield is around six months. Is this lead time around the same time for conversion and incremental capacity expansion? And the reason why I ask is I just want to do a sanity check that for some of the memory shipment goodness that you’re seeing, hopefully this is going to be layering on in-sync with the demand pull for memory which is typically more kind of middle to kind of second half of the year weighted? I don’t think we’ve really broken it out. In fact, I don’t know that I could even really speak to a material difference in lead times. I guess if I caught your question, it was does a conversion have approximately the same lead time for the upgrade to take place and the product to be called? If that was the question, I would say they’re not dramatically different in terms of cycle time. Yes. And Harlan, maybe I’m guessing what your question might be. When we look at the way spending occurred in the second half of '19 in NAND, and I remind you we were saying this for a while. We exited the year we believe the industry’s supply growth 30% year-on-year. Based on the investments we saw occurring in the second half of '19, we believe that rate will decline – supply growth will decline into the first half of '20, right. And so you’re starting to see an uptick in investment that will have a lag effect to it and it won’t immediately be producing output. I think that’s inherently what you’re asking, right? Exactly. That’s exactly right and I appreciate the response. And actually as a follow on to that, so you guys had anticipated NAND bit supply growth exiting 2019 around 30% below the demand rate. I think some of your customers in DRAM were seeing bit supply kind of low to mid teens again before kind of the demand rates. So given the improving fundamentals in memory this year, kind of extrapolating from your customer equipment requirements this year, how do you guys see bit supply growth in NAND and DRAM this year from kind of the depressed levels exiting last year? Yes, so you got it exactly right what we said. We exited the year well below the long-term demand trend. And actually even with the guidance we’ve just given, we actually see ourselves under growing long-term demand this year in terms of bit supply growth both in NAND and in DRAM. Great. Thank you. Thanks, Harlan. Thank you. Our next question will come from Atif Malik with Citi. Hi. Thanks for taking my questions and a good job on results and guide. If I look at your top line growth historically, you outperformed WFE by 2x or so. How should we think about your top line growth relative to WFE for this year? Atif, the color I’d give you is again what I’ve already said is I think it’s an uptick in NAND investment. Our SAM and NAND is really strong. Our share in NAND is really strong. And so to the extent that NAND is driving an uptick in WFE, Lam will do really well. And you’ve seen that over the years in times when memory is spending more, we do real well and when it’s going to other way, we do less well. You should expect the same thing. I’m not going to quantify it for you whether history is a good indicator, I’m not completely sure. But I’ll be very disappointed if we don’t outperform this year. Very helpful, Doug. And as a follow up, your WFE number for this year is even bigger than what we were thinking 55 billion. Can you just talk about the opportunity in which sensor, advanced packaging, things like that and how big that number is in your WFE number for this year? Yes, we’ve put that in the logic and other space. And what Doug indicated is we expect foundry and logic to grow '19 to '20. I don’t know the exact image sensor number, so I can’t answer your exact question. It’s a secular grower for sure. But in the grand scheme of how big foundry and logic is, it’s actually not all that big. But it is something we do really, really well in, in terms of the TSV aspect of image sensors. Yes, all I would add is, is one of the reasons you’ve heard us talk a lot more about specialty technologies and some of the products that we introduced in 2019 really focusing on heterogeneous integration and advanced packaging and MRAM and the image sensors was because many of those items are somewhat growing year-by-year from applications that are a little bit decoupled from the larger WFE cycle. And so again even last year’s WFE was down, we were setting records in what we kind of prefer to as our specialty technologies business which is primarily served by the Reliant tools. And so I think you can continue to see us focus in those areas because they’re places where our technology plays very well. And as Doug said, we can by bringing the right technology and cost point we can really gain quite a large portion of that market. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question will come from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the strong and consistent execution. I have two questions as well. The first one, I’m curious what goes into your WFE calculation just because it’s such a strong outlook for this year. Is it orders, is it CapEx, is it memory pricing assumption? I’m just curious what goes into it? And as part of that, if you could also give us some color on how you think the shape of WFE looks like first half versus second half? Yes, I’ll go through it and then I’m sure Tim will have comments on that. We go at this in a couple different ways. We talk to customers first and foremost. Customers tell us here’s our plans, here’s what we think we’re going to do kind of customer-by-customer, fab-by-fab. So that’s the bottoms-up approach to it. It doesn’t mean it’s exactly precisely correct. It changes. Customers’ plans can change, but that’s one aspect of how we come at it. The second aspect is actually a tops-down approach, which is we take a read on, okay, what is global GDP going to look like this year? What does that mean for electronics demand? What does that mean for IC unit and semi revenue growth? And what does that mean relative to wafers and technology? And then we try to correlate the two approaches together. We don’t always get it perfect, but it’s a pretty robust process and I think we do a decent job. But we don’t always get it exactly right, but we do our best. Tim, anything? Yes, I think it stems, as Doug said, from pretty extensive conversations with customers. One of the nice things about this business is that we have developed very deep relationships with customers and they’re just as interested in having us deliver the technology they need on time. And so I think it’s pretty open sharing about when tools are needed when the ramp is going to occur. So that factors quite a bit into the calculation. And anything on first half versus second half? Yes, I think that it’s going to be a little bit of a first half weighted year really driven by foundry and logic. I think memory spending is going to be pretty steady through the year, but I think foundry’s probably a little bit first half weighted. All right. And for my follow up, your installed base has grown at a 10%, 11% annual base the last five years, which is pretty remarkable given the volatility in WFE. My question is how fast have your services kind of grown annually during those five years and how should we think about the installed base and services growth for the next two to three years? Thank you. Yes, I’ll give you little color. The best indicator of how it’s growing is just chamber count, because that really is what drives the business opportunity. Having said that, we’re doing a lot of innovative things around advanced service offerings in different ways to deliver value to customers that drives our objective, Vivek, at the end of the day to have dollars grow faster than just the growth in chamber count. And if you come see us in March, we’ll probably give you a little more color around what this business looks like. Yes. And I think the only thing I’d add, I made comments about the productivity upgrades and solutions a part of that business. It’s – obviously every customer is driving to reduce their running cost in their fabs. And so between upgrades for existing tools as well as new really data-enabled services that we offer to help recover tools more quickly with less labor and with a higher probability of first-time right. That part of the business is actually growing very fast and I think has the ability just as it did the past year of growing 30% year-on-year the ability to outgrow the installed base. And so we’re investing in that area. Thanks very much. Thanks, Vivek. Thank you. Our next question will come from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company. Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking the question and congrats guys on the great results. Just two quick ones either Tim or Doug. When you look at the calendar year 2020 and like you mentioned WFE is probably front half loaded and mostly foundry/logic bias going towards memory in the back half. Are there any nuances in gross margin we should worry about or is there like one segment has a better gross margin profile than the other? And then I have a follow up. No, there’s nothing specific to gross margin by segment that you should be thinking about. It varies with customer mix, it varies with product mix and then overall business volumes is what I think I’ve said every single quarter that I’ve been at the company, it’s the same language. So there isn’t anything specific by segment. Got it, Doug. And then just a follow up on the OpEx. I understand March has the seasonality with all the merit increase, et cetera, but how do we think about OpEx on a go-forward basis? Is like 18% of sales a good bogey to use or is the 500 million plus run rate – quarterly run rate the right metric? If you look at what we’ve done over the longer term, we’ve let spending grow at a rate less than the top line has grown over the last, I don’t know, since we brought the two companies together. And I think you’re going to see us thinking that same way as we see a stronger year in front of us. And again, come see us in March I’ve give you an updated financial model as well. Got it. Thanks, Doug. You’re welcome. All right. Thank you. Next we have a question from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Thanks a lot. Doug, I had two. First of all, China has been running about 30% of revenue for the past three quarters. Should we expect it to be about 30% as a percent of revenue in March? And I assume within that that it would still be – like the vast majority of it would be the domestic guys. Is that correct? Yes, I’m not going to get into kind of telling you quarter-by-quarter what it is, but I’ll remind you what I said earlier. I think it grows $2 billion to $3 billion of a base of 6-ish – going a little above 6 for the year. It will lumpy. Tim, you know how this goes. There’s a project that takes tools, then has to ramp it for a while and digest it, then something else kicks in. I’m not going to give you exact color around – on the March guide, but I think it will be a good year for local China this year. Okay, great. Thanks, Doug. And then I guess this is kind of a bigger picture question, but given what’s going on with export control, you’re saying that domestic China is going to add maybe 2 billion to 3 billion to 2020 WFE. Do you think that there’s any of this incremental stuff going on within China where customers are concerned about maybe someday down the road they can’t get access to tools, and so maybe they’re calling in timelines of these fabs? Thanks. Yes, I guess I’ll take that one, Tim. We’ve answered this a couple of times. We see no indication that the China buys are pull-ins. There appear to be solid plans behind what they are trying to do and every tool we ship they’re trying to ramp as quickly as they can. So I really don’t think that plays into it. Having said that, we are watching what’s going on with the talk about regulatory controls, but at this point no details that we could even really comment on. Awesome, Tim. Thanks so much. Thanks, Tim. Thank you. Our next question will come from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Great. Thank you. I wonder – back to the topic of this China sovereign business, if you could give us some color on the number of customers. I think people tend to think about memory, but just I’m not looking for specifics, but how much of it is memory versus other stuff and just an indication of the breadth that you’re seeing? Yes. So Doug made a comment about the demand being pretty broad based. We are seeing – and again, just sort of think about what’s great about our market right is the breadth of driver – end market drivers. There’s a lot of IoT in specialty technologies whether it be automotive, power devices, image sensors, you kind of see all of that being – people in China trying to address that end demand. And so it’s not isolated to any one thing. Clearly the uptick in memory has outsized importance for Lam’s revenue and basically we watch very closely what happens especially in the NAND and DRAM areas. But really our outlook and the $2 billion to $3 billion increase that Doug talked about in 2020 is pretty broad based across quite a number of customers. Okay, great. And then you guys have talked about kind of a $70 billion five-year WFE for NAND kind of keeping us on a historic supply growth trajectory. Is that still kind of the right ballpark? And we would seem to be quite a bit lower than that right now. Is that still kind of the right framework for thinking about what WFE ought to be if we stay in a historical demand context? Yes. That’s still the way we look at it. And our comment as you just said we were quite a bit below that at this point, that was part of our commentary as I said through last year we were actually under investing for long-term demand. That long-term demand is what establishes our $70 billion five-year investment. And even this year as we see a strong uptick in NAND, we still as we said expect ourselves to enter the year maybe slightly still below the long-term demand rate. Perfect. Thank you very much. Thanks, Joe. All right. Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel. Thank you very much and congrats also. Maybe, Doug, first in terms of being an installed base business and the growth you are seeing there and the sustainability of that growth, can you just give a little bit of color of how you’ve seen maybe over the last few years and going forward how the business has kind of transitioned from I guess the transactional break and fix type of business to more of a contract base which gives you a better visibility into the revenue and cash flow stream of that business? Patrick, I’m actually going to redirect it to Tim because I think he’ll give you a more comprehensive answer than I would. Yes, Doug can certainly add something there, but I think we have seen that transition and it’s not just something that’s happened to us. It’s been a strategy we’ve been driving to try to make this business less transactional and much more value add and also much more long term. And I talked in my script about one way in which we do it. You transition the transactional to longer term through multiyear contracts. Even there you’re able to help the customer control their costs in a much more predictable way and that gives us better visibility going forward, makes the business a little less transactional. But I think the biggest way that we’ve transitioned this business from transactional to strategic is really through our focus on new products in the portfolio of services and upgrades that allow the customer to change the cost profile of running their install base. And so in that way you can make this much more strategic. I talked about the Corvus R technology, the self-maintaining tool where the system itself replaces some of its consumable parts rather than having to have technicians going and do that work. When we engineer that type of new upgrade, we then would create for yourself an entire new SAM within your installed base. And now as customers recognize the value of that automated replacement system, they go and they upgrade to all of those older tools that are in the installed base, and it creates another source of ongoing revenue for us. And in the meantime we’re looking for that next upgrade to engineer and offer to the customers. And so I think it’s becoming much more of a product and strategically focused business. It just happens that its targeted market is the installed base we’ve already shipped. Great, that’s helpful. And maybe as my follow-up question and maybe for Tim since you talked about it in your prepared remarks about the ALD market and the market expansion opportunity there. On top of the share gains you’ve made in that segment as well as the market growing particularly in the foundry/logic space, do you see additional applications at foundry and logic driving this growth or is there an opportunity for it to expand to other segments, like DRAM? Yes, it already is expanding into other markets. The only difference being again with ALD you’re essentially creating a deposition technology, a platform and that’s one thing that Lam is very good at is we’re creating high-productivity platforms. And then we expand the portfolio of films that we can deposit and that creates more application opportunities for us. As I talked about oxides and carbides, there are other films that are also being developed same time. And I think that ultimately every device type reaches a point where it needs to do some level of atomic layer processing. And so the long term I think this is just where the technology is going and that’s why you see ALD starting to replace, as I said, some older process alternatives for certain steps. Great. Thank you. Thanks, Patrick. Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Congrats on the results. I was curious on the NAND flash side. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the amount of clean room space that you see across the industry today that’s empty. And then how do you think about just the industry’s kind of use on filling it versus past cycles? Joe, are you still there? Sorry, you broke up at the end. Okay. There’s plenty of space out there in the industry for sure across all of the customer base. And so what I always say is – in fact I think I don’t know a quarter or two ago we talked about the fact that we were tracking double-digit number of new fabs in 2019. I think the number’s probably about the same in 2020, a lot of those being memory fabs. The thing to understand with our customers is building the shell is – it’s a cheap call option on the future, right. It doesn’t mean we’re going to equip it tomorrow, but it does indicate to you a long-term intention. And then they buy equipment when they really need the output. That’s where the real money and capital gets deployed. But there’s plenty of clean room space out there. Yes, I guess the only thing I’d add. I thought perhaps you were going to ask about the importance of clean room space and I was going to be able to tell you that that’s one of the things that we focus on. You might have understood in the past from past commentary that a benefit of some of our products, like the Strata and why it’s popular within the NAND market is the number of wafers that we output from that tool per square meter of fab space that consumed is actually the best in the industry. That’s an important metric. Even when Doug says there’s lots of fab space, which I certainly agree with, how they use it is always important to the customer. And so again as we think through platform, design and launching new tools what we call footprint density or throughput density is really one of the key metrics that we focus on. That’s helpful. Thank you. And then just back on the services side, given that we should start to see I would think an acceleration in the growth of your installed base this year with just a rebound in memory demand, is it fair to us to think about accelerating year-over-year revenue growth for that business in 2020? Joe, the way I generally think about it is the chambers ship and then they monetize over a period of time after they ship. And so the fact that you saw chambers grow in 2019, that’s a good indicator of what’s going to drive growth in 2020. That’s how I generally think about it. There’s a little bit of a lag to it after the chamber count, which is why historically we’ve given you a chamber count number one time a year at the end of the year. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Yes. Thanks for taking my question. All the good ones have already been asked. Just a quick follow up for Doug. How should I think about OpEx just roughly beyond the March quarter? Yes, I kind of answered that already. I kind of didn’t answer it in how I answered it. But what I said was that I’ll give you a new financial model in March. And what I said is over the last several years the same management team is here that’s been around the company for a while. We like to see revenue grow faster than we want to let spending grow so that we deliver some leverage to the bottom line. That’s still very much how we think about it. But your March quarter shows a typical seasonal uptick and I know we got to wait until March 3, but as we model this kind of fine tune our estimate, should I think of your OpEx remaining at the minimum at the same level? It’s not going to just be a one-time event. Yes, that’s probably not an unreasonable way to be thinking about it for now, Mehdi. Good. Very reasonable answer. Thank you. Thank you, Mehdi. All right. Thank you. Our next question comes from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I think the majority has been answered, but I just want to clarify maybe two small things. So number one is the comments on DRAM, so it sounds like that’s going to be up year-over-year for 2020? I just want to make sure that’s right and there wasn’t anything to read between there? And then secondly, I don’t expect numbers from this, but is the message that you guys believe you’re going to gain more share in NAND relative to the other markets in '20? I’ll take the first one and then I’ll let Tim comment on the share. I don’t really see when I look at the WFE, the color that we just gave you, a real recovery in NAND I wouldn’t describe it that way – sorry, in DRAM. But clearly in NAND, yes. Foundry and logic continue to be strong. DRAM is kind of push in plus or minus. And what we see happening is there’s still a little bit of inventory out in the channel. It’s got to get burned off. And at some point you can’t continue to sustain supply growth below where demand growth is. And when we look at DRAM bit growth, we think supply growth in 2020 is below demand growth. And I think a little bit longer term and also relative to clearing the inventory. We’ve been very encouraged by comments we’ve heard about what we understand are drivers for DRAM; the growth in the server market, the introduction of 5G where you’re seeing pretty substantial step up in terms of DRAM content per handset. And so it’s – and I think Doug said this in the past, but even for DRAM a little bit more matter of when, not if. So I think it’s just – right now we have, as you said, maybe about a push for the outlook that we have just given you. Your comment about NAND, I guess when we think about share or share of total spend, one of the things we’ve talked about is the strength for us in NAND obviously is that we are – and our tools are key enablers of building taller and taller NAND stacks. And as those stacks increase, our share of total WFE continues to increase. And so given that year-on-year we continue to see a greater portion of spend being spent on taller NAND devices, our share of total spend will increase. Okay, thanks. Perfect. Just really a small one if I could. What was just like a dollar impact to the virus that you guys are taking out of the Q1 just to get an idea? I’m not going to describe those specific dollars. It was an amount that we think is consistent with what we’re hearing from customers and suppliers. Okay, understood. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Hi, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. One near-term question, one longer-term question. On the near-term question, given the travel restrictions in China around the coronavirus outbreak, can you guys say are you guys having difficulty accessing some of the fabs either in the installed base business or delivering new tools or is it still somewhat business as usual and you have access to service the tools in the fab and you’re able to deliver tools here in the near term? I think very specifically I think most people are aware of the travel restrictions have been placed on travel in and out of Wuhan. And so obviously you can’t travel into that area where there are some customers located. But in general I think that as Doug said, we’re moving to the Lunar New Year which now has been extended and got abundance of caution Lam is also implemented travel restrictions for our people to kind of business critical situations only. And I think from the standpoint of impact and the way we’ve looked at it is there could be delays of a few weeks in supply chain or shipments to customers and we don’t see that as any real change though to the demand picture that we’ve outlined and therefore we’re really talking about just hopefully seeing this normalize over the next few weeks. Okay, that’s helpful color. And then the longer-term question is your 2020 WFE forecast I think is higher than probably what many of us were thinking. I guess as I look out to 2021, it sounds like DRAM is not part of the 2020 forecast. Do you think 2021 WFE can continue to trend higher if that DRAM spending comes back? You know we’re not going to answer that. Even I don’t know what '21 is. When I think about it though, the long-term growth drivers are totally intact. We’ve been talking about this for years, right. You got data exploding in society. You got crowd and hyperscale, the Big 7 what have you investing in more in equipment this year, that’s good. You’ve got 5G on the come line, that’s good. You’ve got density growing there in every phone. So the long term is really very positive for the industry and our position in the industry enabling it we feel really good about where we’re sitting. Thank you. Okay, operator, we have time for one more question please. Okay. Our last question comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. My first question is on the memory spending this year. If things stay out the way you think, are you thinking that NAND CapEx will still be below that $70 billion run rate? I know you said that you waited [ph] below the 40% bit supply in growth. I guess in a way I’m trying to parse out that $8 billion to $10 billion increase in WFE you guys are forecasting. Sidney, you know we never give you segment by segment WFE numbers and I’m not going to now. It is going to grow this year. And as Time described, we think bit growth in NAND is in the first half anyway below where long-term demand is and probably exiting the year it’s getting closer to being in balance. But we still think it’s below where demand growth is. I’m going to leave it at that. Okay. How about DRAM bit supply growth exiting the year if there is – to your point if there is – DRAM CapEx being a push? DRAM bit was also I think as we said would undergo long-term demand this year. Okay. Maybe a longer-term question, with the share gains you have in foundry and logic this year and I think it was as high as 48% of the total revenue last year. How should we think about your exposure between foundry and logic and memory through the next cycle? I think versus maybe last five years, memory was averaging like close to 70% sales. We’ve got nice trajectory rather than what’s going on in foundry and logic. We had a really strong December quarter, record level in foundry. I expect our share of WFE in both foundry and logic to continue to be very strong. I’m not going to pinpoint exactly what it is versus memory because we’re very strong in memory as well. I feel really good about where we’re positioned, I’ll just put it that way. Well, I think the simplest way to think about it, as a company our objective is to improve our revenue share of WFE across all segments. Okay, great. Thanks. Thanks, Sidney. All right. Thank you. I’d like to turn it back over to our speakers for any closing remarks. We just want to thank everyone for joining our call today. We appreciate it. Thank you.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Tina Correia, Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you, and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to the Lam Research quarterly earnings conference call. With me today are Tim Archer, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Doug Bettinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
During today's call, we will share our overview on the business environment and review our financial results for the March 2020 quarter and our outlook for the June 2020 quarter. The press release detailing our financial results was distributed a little after 1:00 o'clock PM Pacific Time this afternoon. The release can also be found on the Investor Relations section of the Company's website. along with the presentation slides that accompany today's call.
Today's presentation and Q&A includes forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factors disclosed in our SEC public filings. Please see accompanying slides in the presentation for additional information. Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release. This call is scheduled to last until 3 o'clock PM Pacific Time. A replay of this call will be made available later this afternoon on our website.
With that, I will hand the call over to Tim. Great. Thank you, Tina, and welcome everyone. I hope you and your families are doing well in these very challenging times. Against the evolving backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, Lam delivered solid financial results in the March quarter.
I want to start by discussing how we are managing through the current environment. The impact from the globally-spreading virus began to materialize in our manufacturing and supply chain operations in the latter part of the March quarter as shelter-in-place orders went into effect across many regions. We've responded effectively to these disruptions and while near-term predictability remains more difficult than usual, I am pleased to say that our essential manufacturing facilities and labs are operating, allowing us to focus on critical customer deliverables. I'm very grateful to our Lam employees and partners around the world, who with tremendous commitment and dedication, have risen to meet extraordinary challenges.
Our focus at this time is concentrated in three key areas. First, our top priority remains the health and safety of our employees, our partners and their families. From the start, we have actively sought the best available guidance to formulate our response plans and we are complying with all public health directives in the locations in which we operate. All employees that can execute their roles remotely are doing so. And through our expansion of our IT infrastructure capabilities, we have maintained a productive remote work cadence. To protect our employees that are working on-site at Lam locations, we have implemented rigorous safety practices, including on-site temperature monitoring, mandatory use of personal protective equipment and strict social distancing protocols.
Second, we are executing our business continuity plans throughout our manufacturing and supply chain network. Our capabilities are still limited compared to normal operation, but as the pandemic has impacted different parts of the world at different times and to different degrees, we and our supply chain partners are successfully leveraging our global footprint to support our customers' most critical priorities. Past investments we have made to complement US production capability with operations in Korea and Taiwan have proven valuable as both of those countries have reported earlier stabilization of local COVID-19 conditions. Similarly, we have worked closely with our suppliers on their challenges in specific regions and we are beginning to see signs of improving material availability.
Third, we are focused on increasing the capability and expertise of our regional field teams to meet our customers' ongoing installed base needs, including installation of newly-shipped systems. We anticipate the cross-region travel will be discouraged for at least the near future and therefore we are working closely with customers to significantly enhance remote support capabilities using advanced data collection and information sharing technologies.
Overall, I am extremely pleased with how our teams have executed to mitigate the impact of this global pandemic on our employees, our customers and our business. I also recognize that we are very fortunate in this difficult time to be able to give back to our employees and the communities that have helped us build our strong company. In early April, we announced the creation of a $25 million relief fund to provide direct and immediate assistance to employees and others around us most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. I'm happy to say that in only three weeks, more than half of our committed relief funds have already been deployed to help people affected by this crisis.
I'll now transition to our results and the broader industry environment. In the March quarter, we delivered revenue of $2.5 billion and earnings per share of $3.98. Both results were below our original guidance, which we withdrew late in the quarter as we saw production and supply constraints emerge due to shelter-in-place orders. Customer demand in the quarter was unchanged from our original view. We believe that our revenue in the near term will be determined primarily by the capacity of our global manufacturing and supply chain network as social distancing restrictions are expected to continue for the next several months in locations in which we and our suppliers operate.
While we are currently seeing improvements in both our own operations and those of our suppliers, risks and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 crisis remain. Consequently, we will not be providing our usual financial guidance for the June quarter. Doug and I will however provide our best assessment of the environment in our comments and Q&A.
From our perspective, customer demand for equipment continues to remain very strong in the first half of 2020. We believe that WFE spending is largely being driven by customers investing in strategic initiatives, including both foundry and memory technology transitions that will be critical to both capability and competitiveness when global markets eventually emerge from the effects of the pandemic.
The equipment industry is currently supply constrained. We exited the March quarter with record backlog and would expect to fulfill this unmet demand over the coming months. Looking beyond the near-term impact, we remain strong believers in the underlying fundamentals and resiliency of the semiconductor industry. Semiconductors have become so embedded into nearly every industry, so we expect broad portfolio semiconductor equipment companies such as Lam to see offsetting areas of strength and weakness to help support results. This was our experience through the trough of the recent industry cycle where we saw increased foundry and logic spending offset memory weakness. Despite a 40% decline in memory spending in calendar year 2019, our revenues held up well compared to prior cycles. As we assess the potential future impact of COVID-19 on our business, recent customer commentary points to cloud and enterprise strength as an offset at least in part to the weakness that may be seen in more consumer-oriented end markets like smartphones and auto.
The need for equipment and capacity to support work from home initiatives is causing cloud service providers to increase CapEx, creating the potential for a surge in server demand. Third-party estimates suggest that cloud capacity would need to increase 10-fold to service the peak workloads seen as shelter-in-place rules went into effect. Although these heightened workloads are likely a short-term phenomenon, this event will underscore the need for companies to invest more in infrastructure and business continuity capabilities as the daily economy and our dependence on technology continues to expand over time.
The PC and server markets account for nearly half of DRAM and NAND bit demand on average. And when you also consider that memory customers under-invested in capacity additions in 2019 causing the industry to exit the year with supply growth well below long-term demand, we believe there is good reason to be confident in the healthy fundamentals of the memory market, near-term uncertainty notwithstanding.
Longer term, our focus is on executing the strategy we outlined at our Investor Day event in March. Our growing installed base business serves as a strong and stable foundation for Company performance. And as we committed, we have started disclosing our Customer Support Business Group or CSBG revenue this quarter. Doug will cover this in more detail, but I wanted to highlight that in the March quarter, our installed base revenues grew faster than installed base unit growth, consistent with our objective to increase revenue capture per tool with additional value added service offerings. Within CSBG, we also continue to see strong activity in our Reliant business, which grew for the 7th consecutive quarter and reached yet another record level. At this point, we see our CSBG business poised for another growth year in calendar 2020.
From a share gain perspective, we are executing well on both penetrations and defenses so far this year. In etch, we've seen wins across all segments, DRAM, NAND, and foundry and logic. At our Investor Day event, we launched our innovative new Sense.i etch platform targeted at both widening our lead in critical applications and strengthening our competitiveness in the semi-critical space. COVID-19 related manufacturing and supply chain disruptions have set our schedule backed by a month or two from our original plan, but customer pull for Sense.i has strengthened since launch.
Sense.i was designed to deliver advanced equipment intelligence, data analysis and self-maintenance capabilities to minimize required on-site human intervention with the system. Customers have a heightened awareness of the value these advanced capabilities can deliver and we expect they will look to accelerate their adoption of smart fab technologies. Sense-i is well positioned to deliver both the technology and data collection capabilities our customers need to be successful. In deposition, we're focused on served available market expansion opportunities that we believe can be accessed by accelerating conversions from older process technologies to our highly-productive enhanced atomic layer deposition or ALD solution set. We continued to execute on these opportunities in the March quarter with additional ALD metallization wins for advanced logic nodes and new dielectric gap fill penetrations in 3D NAND. In both cases, we displaced older process technologies from our competitors with a more extendable Lam solution.
Overall, we are confident in the strength of Lam's position in the market and our opportunities for growth when the current crisis subsides. So to wrap up, the Company is executing well during a very difficult time. Our global teams are working tirelessly to mitigate operational impacts from COVID-19, and while near-term visibility is low, we believe that long-term secular demand for semiconductors will continue to drive sustainable WFE growth across cycles.
Thank you all again for joining, and for your support. I'll now turn it over to Doug. Great. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today in what I know is a challenging time for all of us. I hope all of you and your families are safe and healthy. As you're aware, given the uncertainties with business disruptions around the world related to COVID-19, we withdrew our March guidance on March 17. Despite the operational challenges, we delivered solid results in the March quarter.
Our revenues for the quarter came in at $2.5 billion, down $80 million from the December quarter. The decrease was entirely due to production interruptions. Customer demand remained strong through the quarter. I'd point out that we're exiting the March quarter with the strong level of deferred revenue at $726 million. This was partly due to shipments that occurred at the end of the quarter that had backordered materials.
From an earnings per share perspective, the March quarter came in at $3.98, which was driven by strong gross margin performance, focused expense management as well as a favorable tax rate. From a system segment perspective, as expected, memory investments increased in the March quarter. The combined memory segment increased to 56% of system revenues, rising from the December quarter at 52%. We saw increases in NAND spending with investments focused on 64, 96 and initial 128-layer devices. DRAM spending continues to be focused on node transitions primarily on conversions to 1y and 1z.
NAND was the majority of memory investments at 40% of systems revenue, with DRAM coming in at 16%. Foundry revenue strength continued with customer investments there focused on 7 and 5-nanometer. As a percent of system revenue, foundry represented 31% of systems revenue as compared to 36% in the December quarter. December quarter was the all-time high systems revenue level for our foundry business. March was the second highest. The logic and other segment was fairly flat in both dollar and percent concentration quarter-to-quarter, coming in at 13% of system revenue. Logic spending is driven by 10 nanometer image sensors and other specialty markets. The China region continues to invest and came in at 32% of total revenues for the March quarter. The majority of the China revenue again came from domestic Chinese customers.
Also as Tim noted, our Customer Support Business Group revenue continued to grow in the March quarter. This is the first quarter we're disclosing the specific revenue amount. You've likely seen the tables in our earnings release. The installed base business came in at $856 million, which is an increase of approximately 3.5% from the same quarter a year ago.
Gross margin for the March quarter was 46.3%. The strength in the March quarter gross margin is related to customer and product mix. Gross margin was somewhat negatively impacted from lower-than-expected output as well as increased spending in manufacturing and the supply chain. And just a reminder, our actual gross margins are a function of several factors such as business volume, product mix and customer concentration and you should expect to see variability quarter-to-quarter.
Operating expenses for the March quarter were $486 million, which was essentially flat with the December quarter. The March quarter has normal seasonal increases as it always does at the beginning of the calendar year. We managed other variable expenses down during the quarter as we address the COVID-19 impacts on our operations. We maintained our focus in critical business projects for our customers with two-thirds of our operating expense focused on research and development.
I also want to highlight for you that the benefits and costs of our deferred compensation program are no longer mismatched in our non-GAAP results. As I've discussed in the past, we hedged this plan to mitigate the exposure to the income statement with the up - excuse me, with the OpEx offset to this historically showing up in other income and expense. You can see the impacts of the market fluctuations related to deferred compensation program in our GAAP reconciliation tables in the earnings release. These hedging offsets remain mismatched in our GAAP results.
Operating income in the March quarter was $673 million and operating margin was 26.9%. Our non-GAAP tax rate this quarter was 8.3%. This rate was lower than expected due to incremental deductions from equity compensation related to exercises during the quarter. We will have fluctuations in the tax rate from quarter-to-quarter and we expect our rate for calendar year 2020 to be in the low teens level.
Other income and expense was up in the March quarter, coming in at approximately $30 million in expense. The main components of other income and expense line are interest income from our cash and investment balance, offset by interest expense related to our outstanding debt. We did have a small amount of incremental interest expense from the drawdown on our revolving credit facility that occurred late in the quarter. You should expect that other income and expense will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on several market related items like interest rates and foreign exchange.
Let me now move on to capital return. For the March quarter, $164 million of cash was deployed in dividends and $146 million in share repurchase.
As we discussed at our Investor Day, we have a long-term plan for capital to return of 75% to 100% of free cash flow. We have approximately $1.8 million - excuse me $1.8 billion remaining on our $5 billion board authorized buyback plan. In the current environment, we will be slowing our buyback activity. It is likely, we won't buy any stock back in the June quarter.
Diluted earnings per share again came in at $3.98. We ended the March quarter with diluted shares of approximately 148 million shares, which was down from the December quarter level. This is the 9th consecutive quarter where our diluted share count has declined. The share count includes a dilutive impact of a little more than 1 million shares from the 2041 convertible notes. And I'll remind you, the dilution schedules for the remaining 2041 convertible notes is available on our Investor Relations website for your reference.
Let me now move on to the balance sheet. Our cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash increased in the March quarter to $5.6 billion from $4.9 billion in the December quarter. The quarter-to-quarter increase was due to strong cash flows from operations of $541 million as well as a $1.25 billion drawdown on our revolving credit facility. We also had debt maturities and redemptions of more than $600 million in the March quarter that obviously reduced the cash balance.
Our strong balance sheet and cash generation capability continue to provide robust liquidity. DSO increased to 80 days versus 72 days in the prior quarter. The increase was largely due to the timing of collections and invoiced, but not yet revenue shipments that occurred at the end of the quarter. And I would point out on the first day of the June quarter, we collected more than $370 million.
Inventory turns were 3.2 in the March quarter compared to 3.7 turns in the December quarter. Inventory was higher due to the fact that output slowed from the COVID-19 situation. Non-cash expenses included approximately $40 million for equity compensation, $50 million for depreciation and $17 million for amortization. March quarter capital expenditures were $51 million, which was a decrease from $62 million in the December quarter.
Ending headcount as of the March quarter end was approximately 11,000 regular full-time employees, which is an increase from the December quarter of approximately 300 people, mainly to support field and factory operations.
For the June quarter, although we're not providing official guidance, I'll share some things for you to consider when thinking about our June quarter financial performance. We are seeing the following dynamics. Capacity limitations are coming from our supply chain as well as adjustments and factory operations to maximize output considering social distancing challenges. We plan to add resources during the quarter to increase our output capability. Demand remained strong. We are output constrained. These capacity challenges will negatively impact revenue and gross margins. If our current assessment of our output capability turns out to be correct, revenue in the June quarter should be higher than March. There is obviously uncertainty around that statement.
CSBG business remains resilient. Our priorities are the health and safety of our employees and partners as well as taking care of our customers. We will spend incrementally in these areas and we will actively control cost in other areas. Interest expense will be up from the revolver drawdown and share count is likely to be flat.
So to summarize, we see continued strength in foundry and logic going into the June quarter. We also see - excuse me, memory demand continuing to strengthen. The long-term outlook for our business continues to be solid and consistent with what you heard from us at our Investor Day in early March.
That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, Tim and I would now like to open up the call for questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from C.J. Muse of Evercore. Please go ahead. Yes, good afternoon and thank you for taking the question and glad to hear you're all healthy. First question, I guess, revolves around demand side, obviously, you talked about supply constraints. How are you, I guess, prioritizing customer demand and have you seen any demand disruption given the uncertainty to COVID? Or just too early just to see anything works out on that front? Yes. I guess we, C.J., we are working very, very closely with all of our customers to help prioritize shipments in the order of greatest need for the customer. So you can imagine critical R&D programs, where there's a technology conversion, it requires a one of a kind tool, specific capacity bottlenecks that are critical to their factory output or delivery to specific customers of theirs. And so one of the great things about Lam having built very strong customer relationships over all these years is that we really partnered with them to understand their priorities. And we do have fair flexibility within our own operations to prioritize certain tools ahead of others for a specific customer. And so I'd say through very, very close coordination with the customers who are trying to meet their needs. It's - I guess, I would say, maybe the simple answer is, we've seen no demand disruption, no change in demand. One could say maybe that's - it's too early to see that. But we really haven't sensed in any conversation with the customers today a change in demand. So our focus is really on how to get the tools to them that they need. Very helpful. As my follow-up, I guess, on the supply - supply chain side, is that more upstream in your ability to produce the tools, get parts, perhaps issues in Malaysia? Or is it more logistics of getting the tools actually to customers? And then I guess as part of that, Doug, if you could help at all, how do we think about the implications to gross margins as you obviously bring on more resources to satisfy customers' demand in this crazy world? I'll take the first part of that. It - I'd say some of the supply challenges, they're kind of across the board, but clearly, I think most people are quite aware of the control orders that are in place in Malaysia, which is - tends to be for many equipment companies, a large subsystem supplier. Lam, we've - one of our strengths, both operationally and financially, has been a supply chain operation that allows us to do what we call merging transit. And so therefore, some of the subsystems never actually come to Lam facilities. They arrive directly at customer sites. If those don't arrive obviously, the system cannot ship complete. So it's across the board. Materials coming into our facilities, which we feel are operating quite effectively right now, but also coming out of major subsystem suppliers in places, as you noted, places like Malaysia and others. So that's… C.J, I mean I'll give you a little flavor of how we're running things in areas that are probably going to be a little bit of a drag on gross margin. And I won't quantify it specifically, but I'll give you some stuff to think about. Basically, what's happening is, given the need to have social distancing, we're needing to space people out further away from one another in the factory environment. And obviously, that means we can generate less output per square meter, per square foot, what have you. So essentially, what we're trying to do C.J., is moving to incremental space where we have it, take some incremental space where we have it and bring incremental people into that other space. Obviously, in an environment like that, you're doing everything you can to take care of the customer and generate revenue for that matter, but you're going to be less efficient in terms of your ability to be super-efficient on the gross margin line.
Other things that are going on, as I'm sure you're aware, freight and logistics is more expensive right now. It's up a decent amount in certain areas. So we're having to spend more to get materials coming into the factory as well as giving them to customers. I'm not going to quantify it for you specifically, but the way I would want you to be thinking about it is we've been in the gross margin range over the last five, six, seven years. I think what you're going to see is, we will trend towards the lower end of where you've seen our gross margin over that time frame. I don't think we'll go below the range we've been in, but I think we will be towards the lower end, given the dynamic I described. Very helpful. Thank you. Thanks, C.J. We'll take our next question from John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Yes, good afternoon guys. Thanks for letting me ask the questions. Appreciate all the color you have given the uncertainty. Doug, I'm just kind of curious, can you quantify what the supply impact was to revenue in the March quarter? And is it going to be larger in the June quarter despite June revenue being up? And do you expect to kind of get most of these behind you by the end of the June quarter, so as you go into the second half of the calendar year, supply is less of an issue? Yes. John, I'll take you back. Our original guide was $2.8 billion, plus/minus $200 million. And we kind of realized the last couple of weeks of the quarter and our limited ability, we might end up ending below the low end of that range, and we did. So that was the impact. We came into the quarter expecting to be able to deliver $2.8 billion. And I'll remind you that as we began last quarter, we basically said, demand is actually stronger than that, but it was the beginning of things beginning to break out in Wuhan, and we knew there was going to be some supply chain impact. So that's kind of what went on there, John. Now obviously, we're getting much better at operating in this environment. We brought the factory back online. We got people back to work. We're hiring people. We're moving into incremental space. So I think we're going to be able to mitigate it better than when it just kind of fell in our lap.
And based on how we believe we're going to be able to operate and get more output and execute our business continuity plans, I think revenue will be higher in June. Demand continues to be much stronger than that. This is a supply situation. And Doug, by the second half, do you think you will have mitigated all these supply issues or not? Second half of the calendar year? I hope so. Yes. I mean, we're executing our business continuity plans. It's not going to take us longer than a quarter to get those in place. I hope, and Tim can maybe comment on this as well. Yes. No, I think as I commented, we're continuously seeing improvements. Most important thing that we prioritized as well as I believe our supply chain did is, first, to establish a stable source of supply and production capability at a level that clearly is less than 100%. But stability being the key. We have customers, as I mentioned, with critical projects, critical production bottlenecks. And so what we wanted to ensure that we were avoiding beyond, of course, in any way endangering employees or our supply chain partners. But beyond that was endangering somehow taking a step back and moving too fast and then having to come back and not actually build the supply at that stable level. So I think day by day, we're able to inch that stable production level up. And I think as we exit this quarter, we'll be at a higher production output capability for sure. And as Doug said, probably working off this stronger customer demand over the next several months. And maybe just one other comment as I was thinking while Tim talked, John. Obviously, we have a plan to execute to a number, and we know what that number is. The reason we decided not to formally provide guidance to a number is, we're just concerned things could change. This is a very dynamic and fluid situation. That's really why we decided not to give you a hard number right now. That's helpful. And then for my follow-up, Tim, you guys did a good job in the March quarter, pulling some levers on OpEx and bringing OpEx down. But clearly, you still have a lot of investments on your plates for future growth. So I'm just kind of curious on how you're going to manage OpEx through this environment? Should we think about it growing in line with revenue? Or are there more levers on SG&A that you can pull, but keep R&D growth continuing? How should we think about that dynamic? Yes, well, clearly, we will continue to prioritize R&D. We laid out some pretty aggressive plans, where we see really great opportunities for the Company at our Investor Day related to new system introductions, continued progress. I mentioned a couple of them today, new etch platform, new ALD progress. We will continue to fund those to the fullest that we can. We are seeing, of course, some very nice OpEx offsets. We're not traveling. And so there are elements of the expense lines that are coming down quite dramatically. So we're going to be prudent. We're not going to spend where we don't have to. A lot of discretionary spending around meetings and events and other things that kind of normally take the course of our normal business, those will not be occurring and we'll be reallocating that money to R&D and other things to ensure we come out of this stronger than we went in. Thanks, John. Thank you. Your next question comes from Timothy Arcuri of UBS. Please go ahead. Hi, thanks. Doug, I just want to follow-on to that question and see if maybe you could quantify the constraint in June. And obviously, we know what the constraint was in March. But if you could meet all the demand in June, can you give us a sense of maybe where revenue would be? Would it be sort of in excess of $3 billion, maybe $3.1 billion or $3.2 billion [ph]? Tim, I know you were going to come with a question like that. I'm not going to give you a number, but demand is very strong. And I'll simply remind you, what we originally guided in March was $300 million higher than what we delivered at the end of the quarter. Demand didn't change. And I specifically mentioned the $700 plus million in deferred revenue because that's stuff that shipped, but it was an incomplete system. It wasn't a fully functional system. Obviously, that stuff is going to revenue. So there is decent upside to demand. It's just - we're in a supply situation right now that we're working our way through. Okay, got it. And then just on the suspension of the repo. The stock is down a little bit based on the balance sheet. I get that maybe the topics of share repo right now is not that great. And maybe that's the answer, but you are typically pretty supportive of the stock, and opportunistic around the stock. So can you maybe comment as to why you could retail now and maybe it is just the opposite, but if you could give us some comments there. Thanks. Yes Tim, a little bit of is OpEx [ph], a little bit of it's just being prudent, right? I think every CFO in the world today is focused on liquidity and making sure you have the utmost liquidity. And I'm highly confident in the cash generation capability of the Company. But it just felt like the prudent thing to do to just kind of take a pause on the buyback, get focused on conserving cash. Hook our head up to see where end demand ends up. I do think at the end of the day, there will be some demand disruption. We're not seeing anything from customers yet. But when I look at the consumer-facing semiconductor companies, their business is beginning to be impacted. So I just - I want to get a little more time behind us, Tim, and assess what might actually this look like at the end of the day. And just trying to be prudent with the cash right now is all. Sure. Okay, awesome. Thanks. We'll take our next question from Harlan Sur of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Good afternoon and great job on the business execution just given the supply chain challenges. You guys characterized the demand environment to your system is remaining [ph] strong. Any way you can somewhat qualitatively or quantitatively describe this demand. You did say that you started this quarter with record backlog. Did you systems bookings actually grow sequentially in the March quarter? You want to take that, Tim? Yes. I mean, they did. I mean, it's - our comment about - I mean, I guess the best way to look at it is we gave on our January call, our outlook for the year. Now we're not reiterating the year because we recognize, as Doug just said. There's a fair bit of uncertainty about how things may play out with the macroeconomic environment later. But that outlook for the year that we spoke of and the strong demand at the January call, that's the demand we're talking about being unchanged, which means through this first half of the year, the continued strength in foundry and logic, the strengthening demand in memory because recall memory under-invested, we exited the year really in a situation where we felt very good about the need to add in the demand space and also eventually in the DRAM space.
And we haven't seen those plans change and that demand remains kind of at the same level it was in January. And which means that we have a full order book, and we're - really, our challenge is how to get these tools to customers. And I would say 100% of my conversation with customers right now are about how to get the tools they need to them. And I think that will continue for some period of time. And as Doug said, we will reassess after that period to see how demand is being affected. And just maybe one incremental comment for me, Harlan. I mean, our customers are investing in very long lead time items. I wouldn't have expected anything to change. We're just monitoring and trying to be cautious about, obviously anything that is a consumer-facing business at the end of the day isn't going to be as strong. We haven't seen anything move through from our customers yet, but we're just - we're trying to be aware of what's going on the environment, I think, is how I'm thinking about how Tim is thinking funny [ph]. Great. Thanks for the insights there. And then on the innovation of design win pipeline, just given the short-term place here in the Bay Area, wondering if this has slowed either internal projects or collaborative engagement with customers at our research facility in Fremont or some of your other labs globally? Or are the labs considered an essential business process under state or federal guidelines and they are being staffed by the Lam team? Yes, they are and they are staffed. And as I mentioned in my comments, they're operational. But just as Doug spoke to, Lam is being - our top priority is safety of our employees and others working in our labs. And so we've implemented very strict social distancing protocols, which does limit the overall number of people who can be in the lab at any given time. And so I would say we're not operating the labs clearly at our full capacity for this event. But we are operating. We're able to prioritize critical R&D programs for customers. I did mention in my comments some of these projects, they probably have taken, say, a one-month delay or maybe a two-month delay because of not only the couple of weeks we're shutdown [indiscernible], but then the restart here through the local orders and social distancing. So - but we remain focused on them, and I would say that in the long-term sense of R&D projects and how they play out over time, this is not a - it's not a major disruption to their schedules.
Now, your other comment is just on how we're engaged with customers. Clearly, travel is more difficult. But one thing Lam is focused on over the years is building strength in our regions. And so we do have a lot of process engineers and hardware engineers that are deployed out into the region and engaged with customers. And in most cases, our customers have continued to operate in a way that's not dramatically changed from before. And so we're able to engage with them on-site on those critical projects. All right. Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Krish Sankar of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the good execution in these tough times. First question for Doug. Doug, China sales were very strong. Is there anything you can segment it between how much of it was memory versus foundry? How much of it is domestic versus multinational? Then I have a follow-up for Tim. Yes. I'll give you a little color, Krish. Yes, 32% in the China region, a little bit over half of that local Chinese customers. Maybe like 60% might be a reasonable way to think about it local versus the global multinationals. We've got a broad-based set of customers in China, NAND, DRAM, foundry. So it isn't one or the other, Krish. It's broad across all of that spectrum. This is the way you should think about it. Got it. That's helpful. And then, Tim, just a big picture question, given that you have been in this industry for a while, and Lam has a broad suite of product. If and when demand slows down, where do you think you'd see [indiscernible] in the productivity products like single-wafer clean, would it be within upgrades of the customer business group. I'm just kind of curious where you think or would it all happen at the same time and it really doesn't matter nitpicking it? Yes. No, it's a great question. I mean, in fact, I think if we look just to last year as maybe an example, and I'm not saying who knows, I mean, the future could be different than the past. But when we saw things slow down, say, in the memory market, and I talked about the fact that memory spend was down almost 40% last year, we actually see, in those cases, customers turn to how can they get and extract the most out of the installed base they have. So we tend to see things like advanced services and upgrades actually increase during those periods. So that's the strength of our installed base business and why we're so focused on it is because we believe that it is actually one of the areas that can help you weather worse market condition. Obviously, capacity additions would fall away. But again a lot of what we're looking at are technology conversions, ongoing strategic investments from customers, a lot of the investments that we've talked about in China and other places, is very long-term and strategic. And so I don't - I think those would probably be the last places to see R&D, technology, strategic investments, those would be the least affected. Thanks, Tim. Thank, Krish. We'll take our next question from Vivek Arya of Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead. Thank you for taking my question. I understand visibility is limited. But when I hear you saying that capacity situation is slowly improving and your customers' CapEx plans are not really changing, I'm curious, what is your best guess on where WFE can land this year? Even qualitative comments would be very useful. Are there certain areas where you think it could be more resilient than others? Just any way to say, directionally where it can be this year would be extremely useful to us? Yes, Vivek. We were debating how much to say about this. I mean, we came into the year expecting the beginning of memory recovery, continued strength in foundry and logic, all of that is still how I see things, how we see things, I think. But I think it would be remiss to just come in and tell you, it's exactly the same as it was a quarter ago. Something is going to get softer, although we're not seeing it yet, honestly, from what we're hearing from customers. To quantify it, I don't know, kind of hard. We said mid-high-50s, 90 days ago, probably low mid-50s might not be an unreasonable way to think about it right now. I do think we're going to see softness at some point and things that are facing the consumer. I don't know. Tim, anything else you'd… Yes. No, I think that's a reasonable way to look at it. The other is, and maybe I thought maybe where you're going with this is, at some point, we must resolve the supply issues, otherwise, they start to affect the actual WFE that can be executed in the year. We can't pile everything up on to customers in the back half of the year as a makeup because that's not possible from our own manufacturing, shipping and also the installation and the customers' digestion of that equipment. So I don't think we're quite at that point yet, but we would be where at some point to a certain, if it couldn't be executed simply because of the supply constraints. But if things continue to progress, and as Doug said, we see the June revenue higher and us working through the backlog that I spoke to, then I don't know that we see huge issues with the constraints on WFE. All right. And on the services side, thanks for providing that disclosure, do you think that proportion kind of remains for June and the following quarters, so kind of one-third from the services group? Or is there something about the current macro environment? That impacts that ratio one way or another? That's a hard one, Vivek. I mean, what I see happening over a multi-year time frame is the equipment stuff has a little bit more volatility to it and sometimes can accelerate in which case - I mean, installed base business is just kind of a slow and steady grower in some ways along with the installed base. So a lot of stability there. I think as total revenues tick up, probably equipment will pick up a little bit more quickly, at least over the next couple of quarters, I hope. And so the percent would go down, but it will ebb and flow. I mean, historically, how I've described it as 25% to 30%. And obviously, if you do the math on what we just saw, it's more than 30%. But I think that the reason why we - I mean, obviously, we finally felt it was very important to disclose more details on this business is because the new system shipments and CSBG in any particular quarter are not so directly linked. That's why we like the business so much. And so I would start to recommend people not think about it as the percentage of our business as much as it is a business that we've said we would expect to grow every year. And it has multiple components that give it resiliency from the spares and upgrades and advanced services and Reliant systems. And so, I think in and of itself, maybe it does depend on the growth of the installed base, but that comes a little bit, there's a lagging time indicator there as tools have to ship. They have to go out of warranty, then they start to consume parts and upgrades and such. So I think we're disclosing it, so you can start to think about it as a business that's growing kind of on its own. Thanks, Vivek. Thank you. Good luck. We'll take our next question from Atif Malik of Citi. Please go ahead. Hi, thank you for taking my questions. First one, have your lead times stretched in the current environment? And if yes, by how much? And as a follow-up, Doug, you talked about $8 billion to $9 billion domestic China spending in January. And given the strength in March, are those expectations looking up for the full year in terms of demand? Thank you. I'll let Tim take the lead time question, first. Yes, I guess - let me take it on. They clearly have stretched. I mean, that's what we're talking about relative to supply challenges and our own challenges. So lead times have stretched out. I don't actually want to quantify it for you on this call, though. I mean it's something - again, it's competitive reasons, but you can imagine, it's - lead times have stretched out, and that's why we're in conversation with the customers about how to get them their high priority tools closer to the original lead times that we would have originally provided. Yes and Atif, what we've said about local China WFE is that in 2019, it was a little bit above $6 billion or above $6 million, and we expected an incremental $2 million to $3 million. Still kind of how I think about it, obviously. I don't know that a whole lot has changed in that regard. Thank you. We'll take our next question is from Sidney Ho of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Thanks for taking my question. If you compare to the midpoint of the guidance there, there's a $300 million shortfall. What end market or geography were most impacted? It looks like China still have pretty decent growth, but Taiwan was down quite a bit, which is different than what the big foundry guys over there saying. Any color there would be great. Thanks. I don't know that there's any unique geographic distribution between what wasn't able to be supplied versus what we did ship. Nothing is in my head, Sidney, to give you an answer that said [indiscernible]. Yes. I think it's - the way I would think about it and maybe back to even the previous question a little bit is that each of our - we have a lot of different products. And the makeup of the supply chain for those products is not the same. And even the manufacturing facilities for those products are not all the same. And so I would say it was less about any particular customer not receiving a big chunk of tools as much as certain tools the lead time having pushed out a little bit and those tools kind of slipping out of the quarter. So certain tool types were impacted, I would say, more so than us as a result of where their supply chain was heavily concentrated. Okay, that's helpful. My follow-up is, if your June quarter revenue does come in the way you expect, which you think is higher, I guess they're still two more quarters to go for the year. But what are your thoughts on bit growth for DRAM and NAND and maybe leading edge foundry capacity additions, I guess, based on how you think that the second half of the year is going to be? Hard to answer, Sidney. I mean, first thing I'd tell you is our view of the long-term good demand really is unchanged. Now having said that, obviously, a lot of bits are consumed in the mobile space, and that's gotten probably softer given the more direct exposure to the consumer. That's offset, though, by what you see going on in the hyperscale space, which is also [indiscernible], right? The work from home, whatnot and the stuff. Tim had in his script about the likely uptick there. Those two are going to offset. I don't know that I'm ready to quantify it for you just because there's so many moving pieces unless Tim wants to quantify? No, we debated it, but no. I think the challenges we said, we do recognize there will be areas of strength and weakness. And as Doug has said many times, I think we need to see how, obviously, later in the year, macro is really affecting consumer spending in other segments of the market. We wouldn't sit here today and say that this kind of economic disruption would have no effect. And so just hard to quantify. I think we just have some comfort in knowing that we feel like we came out of - we come into this year and ended this economic disruption without having been a situation of like a lot of spending last year. So if there's one overlining, it's that there was underinvestment last year, so we enter in a pretty good space from that perspective? Yes. The trajectory of growth was declining as we exited last year, and that continues into the first half of this year and the second half will depend on the investments that occur. So maybe something to think about Sidney. All right. Thank you very much. We will take our next question from Joe Quatrochi of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Yes, thanks for taking the question. Going back to your prior WFE growth expectations, could you provide us any color on just how we should think about - what was it baked into that for capacity expansion versus technology transitions? Yes, Joe, we didn't - I didn't break it down specifically. What we said was continued strength in foundry and logic. That is what we're seeing. And then some level of a recovery in NAND read that to be - last year in memory, the spending was pretty much all about just node conversions, almost no wafer capacity. And that created a situation where the rate of supply growth continued to decline through the year such that our view was it was below where demand growth was going to be in both NAND and DRAM, right? We had inventory adjusting pricing getting better, all that kind of stuff. I think the real question that's on all of our minds is, okay, what is demand going to do this year. I'm not going to wait into that one quite yet. So that's what we saw. We saw NAND beginning to tick up a little bit, probably adding a few wafers. DRAM, no. DRAM really was a continued trajectory that we saw in '19 through most of '20, maybe a little bit of an uptick. And I think we're just going to wait and see how this plays out to assess what's going to happen there. But that's what we were seeing 90 days ago. That's what we described 90 days ago. Okay. And then on the strength in China, I mean, it sounds like it could have been even stronger in the March quarter. Is that fair? And then I guess if that's true, do you expect that to grow further in the June quarter, just given that some of that could have slipped into this quarter? I don't know that it would have grown as a percent, Joe. I mean, the supply issue was across every geography, quite honestly. So if you think in percentage terms, I don't know that would have been all that different. Everything had challenges around supply. And then just to frame what we see going on in local China, again, we expected - not expected. Last year was a little above $6 billion, and we saw an incremental $2 billion to $3 billion in China, and that's still pretty much what we see from local China in terms of WFE - that was a statement of WFE. Okay. Thank you. Operator, we'll do one more question. Okay. Your final question will come from Quinn Bolton of Needham & Company. Please go ahead. Thanks, guys for squeezing my in. First question, just trying to reconcile the lower revenue for you guys out of Taiwan in foundry when TSMC put up a record CapEx number in the March quarter. Is that just sort of a timing when TSMC recognizes CapEx? Or do you have any thoughts on that? And then the second question, the social distancing that you put in place in the manufacturing operations, does that slow your cycle times for an extended period of time and reduce your sort of quarterly revenue capacity? Or do you think the plan that you put in place to try and expand footprints can get your back to where your manufacturing output was, say, before you went into the COVID downturn? Thanks. Okay, great. Let me take both of those. The - relative to Taiwan and your questions there, I think there's no story other than just timing. I mean as Doug said, we had systems impacted in that first quarter. So I don't think there's anything there. From the capacity perspective and social distancing, that was part of what Doug was speaking to. Clearly, within our factories, once we've implemented strict social distancing, we can have fewer people in the same area, I mean space. And so to that extent, our cycle time does stretch out. Some tasks take longer than they would have otherwise and so our overall capacity out of an existing space does decline from what would have been pre-COVID.
Now, we're finding ways to reroute our lines and actually gain some of that capability back. But at the same time, as Doug also mentioned, we have access to additional space, and we're moving and expanding into some other areas to recapture that capacity. That takes a little bit of time, but we clearly will execute those plans. And as we see - if we see demand continuing to hold up as we would expect and we need that capacity, we will continue to grow our output. Thank you. Yes. Thanks, Quinn. Okay, operator. I think that will conclude our call today for Lam Research. So thank you all for joining. This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation. You may all disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day, everyone.

A replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website.
With that I will hand the call over to Tim. Thank you, Tina. And welcome, everyone. The global pandemic, volatility in the macroeconomy, ongoing US-China tensions. We are operating this year amid tremendous uncertainty and unprecedented challenges impacting people all over the world. We see technology playing a critical role, keeping people connected, enabling businesses to remain productive and accelerating solutions to the myriad of problems the world is confronting.
I am very pleased with how Lam's employees have demonstrated care for each other and our communities and have responded with great effort to support our customers' success. As a result of their outstanding execution, today, we are reporting strong performance for the June period and guiding to another quarter of solid growth. Specific to the COVID-19 pandemic, our teams have demonstrated agility and resolve in establishing safe and effective protocols to perform essential work in our facilities, while also enabling the majority of our employees to remain productive while they continue working remotely.
We have ramped and stabilized our supply and production capability after an initial period of disruption, to support revenues greater than $3 billion per quarter. As you have seen from our guidance, we will be nearing record output levels for the company in the September quarter, highlighting the effectiveness of our business continuity plans, our global manufacturing network and our trusted supply chain partners. We will continue to capture learnings to further improve business resilience and better serve our customers in the future, but overall, I am proud of what our employees and partners have accomplished during this challenging period.
Before discussing our results for the quarter, I wanted to comment briefly on our review of the new rules regarding sales of semiconductor equipment into China. China remains an important part of the global semiconductor ecosystem and Lam has a solid track record of business in this market. We are closely monitoring and complying with all regulatory directives and based on our assessment we currently see no material, financial or business impact from the new rules.
Turning now to the June quarter. Revenue and EPS came in above our expectations. Operating margins improved sequentially and we generated over $800 million in cash from operations. As the September quarter guidance indicates, we see continued positive momentum as we move into the second half of the year. The results also represents sustained progress towards our long-term objectives. As we mentioned earlier, our guidance indicates, we are nearing prior record levels of revenue, but we believe that our opportunity for growth remains robust.
Key point supporting our view include, one, memory investments must continue to grow to meet secular demand drivers. Lam's memory mix year-to-date as slightly below 60% of system revenues is well below historic highs. We expect our strong memory position to drive outperformance in share of WFE spent, as NAND and DRAM investment levels increase. Two, our actions to improve our Foundry/Logic SAM and Share are yielding results. With our revenue growth in this segment outpacing Foundry/Logic WFE growth cycle-to-cycle. And three, our customer support business group at 34% of total revenues year-to-date is an increasingly greater contributor to our top line than in the past.
Looking at the broader WFE environment, our outlook remains strong. While COVID-19 has created volatility for the semiconductor industry, in a larger sense it is underscored the rapidly growing reliance of individuals and businesses on semiconductors and the products and technologies they enable. For example, we are seeing accelerated growth in Internet video traffic, as video becomes embedded in a broad range of business and consumer activities. This is manifesting currently in work-from-home, e-Learning, telehealth, online gaming and of course, video streaming.
Nearly 2/3 of global consumers, cite video as their preferred medium for obtaining information. The demand that this places on data transport, analysis and storage, will continue to rise. Mobile networks are migrating to 5G. Video quality is doubling from 4K to 8K and cloud and enterprise data centers are expanding to support the enhanced data traffic. A 2x resolution improvement in mobile video drives roughly a 70% increase in NAND storage content and newer server architectures are expected to have over 30% more memory channels versus prior generations.
Despite the recent downtick in smartphone units, our own assessment of NAND content in smartphones, in calendar year 2020 has trended higher versus our prior baseline due to a greater mix shift towards 5G devices. We are also seeing increased NAND demand related to new product cycles in the game console segment, with some of the new platforms adding up to a terabyte of SSD based storage. Launches of the new game consoles are expected to add low to mid-single-digit percent growth to overall NAND bit demand in 2020. These demand drivers in combination with increasing semiconductor manufacturing complexity create a compelling set up for sustained strength in WFE spending.
In 2020, we estimate WFE to be in the mid to high $50 billion, driven by growth in both Memory and Foundry/Logic investment. Although we have seen underlying demand drivers fluctuate due to the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, our current WFE forecast in total is very close to what we expected at the beginning of the year.
From a mix perspective, we see memory share of WFE growing in 2020, off a low 2019 level. This trend should continue into 2021. Particularly in DRAM, we believe inventory levels will be lower as we get to the end of 2020. In both NAND and DRAM, we see bit supply growth lower than long-term demand this year and NAND recovery progressing ahead of DRAM.
By geography, domestic China customers continue to be a strong source of WFE demand, with expected calendar year 2020 WFE spend in the $10 billion range. Year-on-year growth in China investment is predominantly driven by NAND and foundry segments. Looking more broadly at longer term global WFE spend, we are increasingly confident that the accelerating digitization of the economy, along with the rising complexity of semiconductor manufacturing at each technology migration is establishing a higher base of WFE spending at the $60 billion level. With this outlook. We are focused on delivering on our objectives to drive greater than 50% growth in revenue and more than a doubling of EPS by 2023, 2024 compared to our 2019 results. Key to achieving these goals is to execute on the SAM expansion, market share growth in installed base revenue opportunities, we laid out at our Investor Day in March.
On the system side, we continue to see positive momentum across our businesses. The June quarter marked a record for net penetration and defense wins in our Etch business, as measured by three year forward revenue, which is a metric we began tracking internally a few years ago. We achieved key wins in High Aspect Ratio Mask Open and Contact Etch applications in both DRAM and NAND and leveraging unique hardware capabilities for RF Control an edge yield enhancement that we introduced last year.
We have further extended our technical leadership in high aspect ratio processes across both conductor and dielectric etch. We also combine these technologies with our hydro patterning system, which is enabled by Lam's equipment intelligence and uses fab data inputs to improve customer yield. With this system, we were able to secure new positions in Quad and EUV patterning for DRAM.
In the June quarter, we also made good progress in our effort to disrupt older equipment segments with more innovative, extendable Lam solutions. With our enhanced ALD family of products, we achieved 2 new wins for 3D NAND gap fill applications and a multi-layer application win in Foundry/ Logic. Superior film quality, integration and architecturally enabled productivity were instrumental to our success.
In DRAM and Foundry, we are also seeing accelerated adoption of our ALD solutions for critical spacer applications which have traditionally been done using furnaces. Overall, we believe our enhanced ALD solutions are helping to enable the performance and cost road maps our customers need. At the same time, we continue to help customers extract more value from their installed base of Lam equipment.
In the June quarter, our customer support revenues grew approximately 8% from the March period and our revenue growth has exceeded installed base unit growth year-to-date. Our Reliant Systems business posted its eighth straight quarter of record revenues, driven primarily by shipments to analog-mixed-signal CIS and microcontroller segments.
The challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic have also accelerated the deployment of important new technologies for remote equipment support. By enabling real time in fab access to Lam Service Experts located worldwide, we have reduced installation and troubleshooting time without the need for extensive travel. In addition, increasing adoption of our machine learning based analytics, leveraging big data at customer sites is enabling faster detection and resolution of issues. These advances are the result of investments that as we shared at our Investor Day, are targeted delivering services innovation that create value for our customers and also increases our revenue opportunity per chamber.
So to wrap up, Lam delivered a very strong June quarter and we see continued strength ahead. We are seeing positive momentum in our efforts to grow our installed base revenue, expand our served markets and increase our market share. And as a result, we believe we are increasingly well positioned to benefit from the long-term secular growth drivers in the semiconductor industry.
Thank you, all for joining and for your support. And I'll now turn it over to Doug. Awesome. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. I hope all of you and your families have been safe and healthy.
Our operation steadily improved throughout the June quarter as we executed well in this COVID-19 environment. We've become increasingly more efficient and effective in our operations, which I think are well reflected in the results from the June quarter. Our revenues came in at $2.8 billion driven by broad based demand. Our customers are investing in leading-edge technologies to service the growth you're seeing in 5G, data centers and product cycle driven demand in the gaming console market. Lam's solid execution is reflected in our revenue result, our gross margin performance, as well as our earnings per share that came in at $4.78. I'd also just point out that our deferred revenue balance is back to a more normal range as compared to the end of the March quarter.
From a system segment perspective, the total Memory segment in the June quarter increased to 61% of System revenues from the March quarter level, which was at 56%. We saw increases in NAND spending, which contributed 45% of our system revenue which was up from 40% in the March quarter. Net investments are broad based, focused on 64, 96 and initial 128 layer devices. DRAM spending was consistent across the June and March quarters at 16% and continues to be focused on node transition, primarily conversions to 1y and 1z.
The combined memory market remains in a healthy place due to proactive inventory management as well as a prudent investment cadence. In Foundry, demand across diverse end-market applications continues to drive the investment profile. While Foundry as a percentage of our system revenue slightly declined from the March quarter percentage of 31% quarter to the June quarter at 29%, revenue actually increased in dollar terms, coming in at the second highest system revenue level for Foundry in Lam's 40-year history. We continue to be pleased with our trajectory here.
And finally, the Logic and other segment contributed the remaining 10% of systems revenue in the June quarter as compared to 13% in March. Term investments continue to be strong in the June quarter, with 34% of our total revenue coming from that region. We're seeing investments from customers in all market segments within China. The majority of the revenue again came from domestic Chinese customers. We continue to expect solid investment levels in this region throughout the calendar year. China is obviously an important market for Lam and we remain confident in the strength of our business there.
The June quarter revenue for our Customer Support Business group was a record at $927 million representing an increase of 8% from the March quarter level, and an increase of over 17% from the same quarter a year ago. We're delivering sustainable growth across the components of our customer support group in spare parts, service, upgrades and our refurbished Reliant tool business. Within the June quarter, we executed two significant longer term spares contracts, further improving the recurring nature of the revenue streams in this business and demonstrating further evidence of the trust our customers have in us to continuously deliver value.
Gross margin for the June quarter was 46.1%. At the start of the June quarter, driven by uncertainties related to the COVID-19 situation, we saw a potential capacity limitations both from our supply chain partners as well as our own internal production capability. However, as the June quarter progressed, we were able to increase our production efficiency. The resulting expansion in production volumes yielded better effect, better factory performance that enhanced gross margin from our original expectations. In addition, gross margins fluctuate, as you know, based on customer and product mix and in the June quarter, we ended up with a slightly more favorable mix than we anticipated at the start of the quarter.
We are seeing higher cost due to COVID in several areas, most notably freight and logistics. We're doing our best to mitigate that headwind by managing other expenses in the factories and in the field. During quarter, operating expense came in at $493 million, slightly higher than the March quarter. We focused our spending in the research and development area, as we address our customers' most critical needs. Roughly two-thirds of our spending remains focused towards R&D. Our incentive compensation expense increased in the prior quarter which is tied to our improved profitability levels. At the same time we've managed expenses elsewhere, most notably travel and they came down throughout the June quarter.
Operating income in the June quarter was $795 million and operating margin was 28.5%. It was an increase of 160 basis points from the prior quarter. Our tax rate this quarter was 7.6%. Our rate was low in the June quarter, primarily due to a more favorable mix of geographic income and maybe more importantly a one-time year-end adjustments recorded as we closed our fiscal year. We will have fluctuations in the rate from quarter to quarter. You should continue to expect the ongoing tax rate to be in the low-teens level for your models. Other income and expense increased slightly in the June quarter, coming in at approximately $33 million of expense.
Within the June quarter, we were opportunistic with our capital structure. At the end of April, we completed an offering of $2 billion of investment grade bonds with maturities of 10, 30 and 40 years. I was pleased with the demand for our paper, as well as the pricing which came in with coupons of 1.9%, 2.875% and 3.125% respectively. We used $1.25 billion of the debt proceeds to pay down the revolving credit facility that was then outstanding. That facility is now completely paid down.
As we discussed in last quarter's call, the cost of our employee deferred compensation plan and the offsetting hedging balances, remain mismatched in the GAAP P&L. You can see these results in the GAAP reconciliation table of our earnings release. Given the volatility in the market in the June quarter, there were large fluctuations between our GAAP expenses in the O line and E lines that the hedge essentially offsets at the net income level.
And you should note, the other income and expense balance includes the interest expense of our outstanding debt amounts, obviously, offset by the interest income from our cash and investment balances. You should expect that other income and expense will vary quarter-to-quarter based on several market-related items. Should think about things like foreign exchange.
On the capital returns side, we noted in our March quarter earnings call, that we will be pausing our buyback activity during the June quarter, until we had a better line of sight in the business environment. As a result we had only a small amount of share repurchases in the latter part of the June quarter and that together with dividends ended up having us deploy approximately $200 million towards capital return. Long-term capital return of 75% to a 100% of free cash flow remains our plan.
Diluted earnings per share, as I said, was $4.78. I mentioned that the one-time benefit from the tax items I referenced was roughly $0.14. Our diluted share balance for the June quarter rounded down to 147 million shares, only a very slight decrease due to the minimal share repurchase activity. The share count includes a dilutive impact of approximately 1 million shares from the 2041 convertible notes. The dilution schedule for the remaining 2041 convertible note is available on our Investor Relations website for your reference.
Let me now move on to the balance sheet. Our cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash, increased in the June quarter to $7 billion from $5.6 billion in the March quarter. Cash flows from operations in the quarter were strong at $813 million due to healthy profitability and solid collections during the quarter. Remainder of the increase quarter-over-quarter was related to the debt issuance, offset by the pay down of the revolving credit facility. DSO decreased in the June quarter to 68 days from 80 days in the March quarter demonstrating strong collection performance and the resulting timing of customer payments. Inventory turns were flat with the prior quarter at 3.2 times. We have consciously increased our inventory balance to support the higher revenue level that we see in the September quarter.
Non-cash expenses included approximately $50 million for equity compensation, $54 million for depreciation and $17 million for amortization. In quarter capital expenditures were consistent with the prior quarter amount coming in at $51 million.
Ending head count as of the June quarter was approximately 11,300 regular full-time employees. This headcount reflects added resources in our factory and field operations, supporting increased volume. As well as additions in research and development to support ongoing critical deliverables, like the new Sense.i Etch platform and the dry resist program that we announced at our Investor Day in March.
So now looking ahead, I'd like to provide our non-GAAP guidance for the September 2020 quarter. We're expecting revenue of $3,100,000,000, plus or minus $200 million. Gross margin increasing to 46.5% plus or minus 1 percentage point. Operating margins of 29.5% plus or minus 1 percentage point and finally, earnings per share of $5.15 plus or minus $0.40 based on a share count of approximately 147 million shares. These ranges remain wider than normal, due to the continuing uncertainty from COVID-19. We are well positioned for the second half of calendar 2020 as we expect continued healthy WFE investments. We see continued strength from Memory and Foundry, for that matter, driven by demand in more strategic technology oriented investments. The customer support business group is also expected to provide continued momentum for the company.
Operator, that concludes my prepared remarks. Tim and I would now like to open up the call for questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead with your question. Thanks a lot. Doug, I guess the first question. You're talking about now WFE being mid to high 50s this year. If I look at Q3 and I look at your guidance and your sort of probably going to gain some WFE share this year, it would sort of assume that we're running maybe in the low 60s in Q3. So, I guess if I assume your full-year forecast and I assume maybe you gain of 100 basis points of WFE share this year, something like that, it would sort of imply that December revenue is well sort of flattish and I'm not asking you to guide December, but I'm just kind of wondering whether you think that, that math holds together where you should gain like a little bit of WFE share this year? Thanks. Yes. Tim, you're absolutely right. We're only guiding one quarter at time but and I'm not going to give you a specific answer on December but I will qualitatively say, I think December will continue to be a strong for us. Your math -- I don't look at WFE on a quarterly basis, I'm sure you're doing the math right, but you're also right about the observation on share spend and where memory is trending and all of those things, we're setting up I think for a pretty good second half, Tim. Thank you for the question. The next question will come from CJ Muse with Evercore. Please go ahead. Yes, thanks for taking the question. I guess a question on the memory side of things and where are we in the cycle. I know 30% above the recent trough, but still 40% below the prior peak and investors clearly been focused on this aspect. Would love to hear your view, particularly as it relates to any positive trends you highlighted into calendar ' 21? Sure, I'll start C.J. and then let Doug add something if you want to do. Obviously, what we have, we've been saying for quite some time is that memory is a story of one kind of coming off what was a very strong 2018 and a couple of years of then digesting that, but at the same time, there are underlying growth drivers that I think you're seeing everywhere for both NAND and DRAM, that give us greater confidence in what we've stated is long-term bit demand growth in the high 30s for NAND and in the high teens for DRAM. If those are correct and like I said, I gave you a few of the examples of where the big consumers of NAND and DRAM from an application perspective on the horizon, we think that memory investment has to continue to grow for years to come. Yes, obviously at our Investor Day, we laid out a model of a more normalized memory spending level in the context of total $60 billion WFE and in that environment we grow the company quite significantly. Yes. And C.J. maybe I'd just add, I mean more near term tactically relative to what's going on this year. I think NAND is a little bit ahead of DRAM relative to the pace of recovery. When I look at the market both are kind of managing inventory investment -- investing what I described as or tried to with a prudent cadence, that's gotten end up this year and DRAM maybe up a little bit, but not too much. I really do think DRAM will be more 2021 story. So think about that near term and then on top of that as it relates to Lam, I mean we're doing extremely well in Foundry as well. So, factor that in when you think about what's going on with our company. Very helpful. And if I could follow up on the service side, you grew that business stellar 70% [Phonetic] year-on-year. Was there any catch up there on the deferred side and I guess, thinking through that, how should we think about the potential for sequential growth and into September, December? How do your tools coming off warranty and upgrades look at least based on your build plan today? Whatever you can share. Thanks. Yes, C.J. In this part of the business, the deferred stuff we had at the end of March, really wasn't impacting things. The deferred, if you remember what we described at the end of March, had to do with back ordered shipment. That was really all about new equipment. So I don't think there's anything terribly unique going on in CSBG, Tim unless there's something. No. I think it's -- again, it's just the efforts as we've said to continue to provide services to grow our revenue opportunity per chamber. And also just our business as you pointed out, as our company continues to grow faster, the installed base grows faster and generates more opportunity. Thank you. I don't think there is anything unique. Yes, thanks, C.J. Operator, can we go back to Tim Arcuri for an additional question please. Yes, I thought of as Tim only had one question. Yes ma'am, one moment. Your line is open Tim. Thank you. Thanks for that Doug. Sorry, Tim. I'm sorry. Yes, sure. Sure, no worries. So, the second question, I guess, can you go through a little bit about the, how the whole military end use thing is transpired, it seems like China WFE is a little higher, the domestic stuff is maybe $1 billion to $1 billion higher than you thought it would be and it seems like now all these customers know that there is restrictions looming at some point. So they're going to keep on pulling stuff in. So can you just talk about how the export controls have transpired? Is commerce happy just as long as you do the due diligence with the customer on military end use? Can you just kind of talk about all that? Thank you. Sure, I mean, I think Tim, in my comments I talked about our assessment. It was quite an extensive diligence process that we went through which consisted both of our own conversations in questioning of the customers and their certification as well as the use of third party research and also validation by outside counsel and we arrived at our conclusions, as I stated, no material, financial or business impact as a result of all of that work.
Now, that is an ongoing activity for us, means that we are continually assessing and doing that kind of research and so that's something that we have committed to but at this point that is our conclusion, if by your question about and connection to domestic China WFE. I don't think that's a connection that we're making and basically we are saying that China has plans to invest and I indicated that a lot of the investment is coming from NAND as well as Foundry and at least in our view right now. We have not made that connection that somehow domestic China WFE is in any way really affected by these rules one way or the other. Yes. Tim, maybe a comment from me, my sense is, it's not, there is nothing pulled in say no, we may be wouldn't know if it was or wasn't a little bit. But given we've concluded the rules are not impacting our ability to ship. I don't know why anybody would think there should be pulling things in right. Awesome. Okay, thank you much. Thanks, Tim. Thank you. The next question will come from Harlan Sur with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead with your question. Good afternoon. Great job on the business execution and strong results. One of the large logic manufacturers recently talked about the potential of moving to a more outsourced business model. Maybe just a continuation of the industry trend towards a fabulous business model. At a high level, it would appear to be a zero-sum game. But wanted to get your views on the potential ramifications of your business in a structural move in the industry towards a more fab like or fabulous business model. Yes, okay. Let me try to take that, Harlan, to start. Obviously, we don't want to comment about the specific plans of any one customer, but to your point of the industry moving to outsource model, I mean, obviously that's a more than 20 year story and I think that anything that allows wafers ultimately to be produced with better technology at lower costs, however, that's done, in-house or outsourced, is what's good for the industry and that's good for Lam. I'm quite certain that as a result of the advances that have happened on the Foundry side, Lam's business has benefited tremendously in the last 20 years and that just comes back to a statement that I've made a number of times, which is the best thing for Lam is that technology nodes continue to migrate.
We have greater SAM at every technology node migration across NAND, DRAM and Foundry logic and so every company has to decide for themselves, what's sort of the best answer to advancing technology at the best cost. That can be in-house, can be outsourced. What we care about is whether that technology advances and more wafers get produced and so I think, we obviously watch it and we look at the impact on our business. But ultimately Foundry hasn't been bad for the industry or for Lam. Absolutely. Yes. And Harlan, just one or two comments from me. The way I think about it is what matters to Lam is the number of leading edge wafers in the entire industry that are put in place, whether it's in-source, outsource, largely doesn't matter too much. Either way it needs equipment, right? Independent of where it goes, we're selling largely the same things to the industry. Yes, that's great insights there. Good to see the recovery of the business and the improvement in the supply chain and logistical bottlenecks. Just wondering, Doug, if the team is still, even with this strong September quarter guide, playing catch up on the delinquent backlog as a result of the earlier bottlenecks and if so, how much of that has yet to be worked down? Yes, Harlan. I think we've got nicely caught up. I don't think we're completely caught up as we sit here today, but we made very nice progress during the quarter. Great, thank you. Thanks, Harlan. Thank you. The next question will come from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Yes, good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on the results. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Doug, just maybe a follow on to Harlan's question, it sounds like COVID was still a cost headwind in the June quarter. I'm wondering if you can help us quantify that and as you look out into September with the guide how much sort of COVID logistical expense is still in there and when do you think you might be able to take that out of the model? Yes, John. The biggest individual item, when I look at it is freight and logistics. I mean freight lanes are more restricted than they were obviously pre-COVID. Things are more expensive. Really tough to mitigate that. I mean, to a certain extent, you take the price, you do your best negotiate it, but you're somewhat of a price-taker there. That doesn't mean we're not, as I tried to describe working to drive efficiency, effectiveness elsewhere in the operation. That's what Lam is extremely good at doing and we're doing that, but that is where the challenges are right now. I'm not going to quantify it, John. But it is impacting gross margin to a certain extent. I don't know, Tim, if you want to add anything. No. The only thing I'd add is; obviously, Doug pointed out some near term headwinds on the cost side. You know fully, we would expect those to eventually roll back as things normalize post COVID. But I mentioned this point of the acceleration of remote support technologies. And I think that's -- while we haven't fully quantified kind of what the benefit could be, clearly some of the benefits of less travel and more productivity of kind of worldwide engineers who can now connect into fabs and provide expertise via some new technologies, that actually will be likely a cost and kind of personnel benefit for us, so in -- down in the future. And so we're investing in that and I think it's a positive headwind just further -- positive tailwind just up further down the road. That's helpful. And then, Tim, you guys covered a lot of ground at the Analyst Day earlier this year, but you couldn't cover everything. I'm kind of curious if you can kind of spend a few minutes talking about your positioning in advanced packaging, because clearly, there's not a lot of volume in sort of chiplets today, but as you look at Intel moving to their second generation 10 nanometer part sometime in the second half of next year, it seems like the tiles last chiplet strategy is really poised to accelerate starting in the back half of next year and going forward. And I know you guys have some good leverage there, but I'm just trying to get a sense of quantifying and how big do you think that market opportunity is. Sure. I don't know if I'm -- I don't know if we're prepared quite to quantify it for you on this call, but what I can tell you, is it kind of follows on from my earlier comment about customers and just the industry in general looks for the best way to achieve the performance that's required at the lowest cost. And sometimes that's by looking at total system performance and these advanced packaging 3D chiplets, these sorts of technologies, actually are one way to deliver system performance without having to necessarily utilize the most advanced node chips for every application. And our position has been very strong. We've been -- we were an early investor there. We have leading positions on both the etch and depth side in TSV applications and we think that we're extremely well positioned when that comes.
And so, every time we hear about acceleration, we're actually quite encouraged. But it's something that our high aspect ratio etching processes and our ability, I think most people recognize our leadership for 20 plus years in copper electroplating fill. Those are critical technologies for these 3D packaged and heterogeneous integration applications. Helpful. Thank you, guys. Thanks, again. Yes, thanks, John. Thank you. The next question will come from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Hi, thanks for taking my question. Tim, I had a question on memory. Clearly memory, WFE is the underspending right now and your revenue has a lot of potential upside. If I look at the last cyclical peak which was in March 2018, if you are able to get back to those kind of WFE levels for memory, how will Lam's revenue profile look like in memory, given that you gain some shares? Is there a way to quantify it, to see how much higher, you could be versus the last cyclical peak? And then I had a follow-up. I think Doug's signaling, I can't quantify that. Of course, we have quantified it and that's why my comment was, we believe our opportunity. We knew there'd be this peak question but my comment was, regardless of the fact that our revenues are approaching the last time and therefore the peak question starts to come up, the setup is quite different and in fact, that's why we pointed out, our memory mix today is a much lower. WFE is not back there and so I guess probably you can do the -- do it just as easily as we can. But there is still significant upside as memory growth continues not only to return to prior levels, but also to continue to grow to meet all of these new application drivers that we've talked about. Yes, Krish. Obviously, when we put a financial model out, not all that long ago in March, we comprehended some aspect of memory being at a higher investment level. CSPG growing. Our strength in foundry continuing to grow. So you have the data points. It's kind of all in there. It's all in there. Got it, got it. No worries. And then I have a question on your ALD traction. I'm just curious like when you look at the ALD, like clearly that market is going to continue growing. You guys are like a number two player in that, I would probably say. How much of the -- how much of the growth in ALD is actually driven by technology versus the fact that productivity for ALD tools is still pretty low? Which is driving the bigger upside in ALD? Well, all of these new adoptions that I keep talking about, these are, these are LAM's efforts to expand the application base for ALD and which means it's a technology-driven decision. But usually what has -- I mean, in the past, what has held back ALD from adoption in many of these cases was, it's great technology, but the productivity wasn't -- it wasn't affordable to put in at a certain nodes. So people pushed it out. What we've done is, we've married both an expanding film set, more applications with, as I said, architecturally enabled productivity and we're getting a lot of traction across a number of different applications. I talked about 3D NAND gap fill, talked about a multilayer application in Foundry/Logic that's a different material, talked about critical spacers and so it's just we've broadened I think the target market for ALD and we're seeing good traction. Thanks, Tim. Thanks. Thanks, Krish. Yes. Thanks, Krish. Thank you. The next question will come from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question. Hi, guys. Thanks very much for taking the question and congrats on the strong results. Doug, you mentioned that for 2020 domestic China, you guys are expecting about $10 billion in spend. Curious, what's the rough split between memory versus logic and foundry? And on the memory side, I feel like both you and the broader industry is currently in a sweet spot where your customers are spending, but they're not really contributing to supply. At what point would you expect them to start to really move the needle on supply and as a result of capital intensity come down in local China? And then i have a follow-up. Thank you. Yes, no problem, Toshiya. We haven't quantified what is in which segment in China but I forget if Tim said or if I said it in the script, it kind of blurs in my mind sometimes, we said its broad-based in China, in all segments. So it isn't just one, it's a broad set of customers that are investing. So, think of it that way, it's not one or the other. And you're right and I wouldn't characterize China's inefficient in the investment, it's just when customers are investing for the first time or are relatively new to investing in capacity, you got to buy it. Then you have to ramp it and it takes time for that to happen. It's not unique to any one geography or any one customer that is really what's going on and over time customers get more efficient as they ramp things. That's how I think about it, Tim. I don't know… Yes, no, as you suggest in the earlier question, I think thinking about the model we've put out just back at Investor Day, I think by the time you get to the 2023-2024 timeframe, we've comprehended that those additions in China are effectively the same as additions elsewhere in the world. So we don't think there is some extra inefficient spending in that case that's driving numbers higher for Lam. So I think if you just look back at that model that's a relatively efficient spend across all segments in 2023-2024. Got it, thank you for that. And then as a quick follow-up. Doug, in your prepared remarks, you talked about winning two service contracts in the quarter, I believe I wasn't sure if you meant to highlight it as a meaningful dynamic here but did those contracts at all drive incremental growth going forward, or does it change how we should be thinking about quarter-to-quarter, year-to-year volatility and your installed base business or profitability going forward? Thank you. No, not really, Toshiya. I mean I just mentioned it because one, they were a little bit longer term and two, they were bigger than perhaps typical and to me is very much part of how we run this business. It's the customer has faith and confidence in your ability to deliver and provide value, it is consistent with what we expect that business to do and it has done in the past. I just mentioned it because it was notable when we looking at the results this quarter. Thank you. Yes. Thanks, Toshiya. Thank you. The next question will come from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please go ahead with your question. Hey guys, thanks for taking my question and a great result. Just kind of curious. from a high level, the wafer front-end, you're keeping the same amount in your catching up to. I'm just kind of curious as you look at it, the way the year shaking out. I think there's a lot of doubts whether you hit that number, is it the same contribution and then any comments on the strength in the second half by geography would be helpful? Blayne, are you asking about WFE? Was that your question? Just wanted understand. I'm curious as you're still seeing the same WFE forecast for the year and kind of curious... Yes. Is it contribution as we thought starting the year and then any comments on geography, particularly into the back of the calendar year? Thanks. Yes. I think Tim specifically mentioned in his script there's puts and takes in here, right. It's ended up at the same level. I would suggest to you that more consumer-oriented stuff is a little bit weaker, smartphones, as an example, smartphone units aren't the same as we thought at the beginning of the year that is creating a little bit of a downtick but that's offset by other things going on in hyperscale cloud consumption of silicon, work-from-home type things and net-net, one is up a little bit once down a little bit. We're in the same place that we began the year. And then, just -- I was just curious from a geographic perspective, if you had any color into the growth into September? No, we never forecast the GOPs. I wouldn't expect it to be wildly different than what you've seen over the last couple of quarters or so from a directional standpoint. Thanks. Thanks, Blayne. Thank you. The next question will come from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead. Thanks for taking my question. I'm curious about WFE growth outside of China, because when I look at your first half ex-China sales are down in the last fiscal year. So when do we see -- why are we seeing these trends, I understand this is probably a very short frame, timeframe for looking at these trends, but I'm just curious, qualitatively, why are we not seeing the same kind of WFE growth outside of China, because I imagine everyone is exposed to the same growth drivers? Vivek, I mean obviously the majority of WFE spending is outside of China. 2/3 of it is outside of China. Right. And so you're seeing the contribution of WFE across every geography, right. It's more about what's going on in the end markets. That's how you should be thinking about it right. Foundry is strong this year, NAND up from last year, DRAM maybe up a little bit, but to a large extent that's geographically independent. No. I guess my question is that when I look at last year WFE was I think 50- 51, this year you're guiding it up $5 billion to $7 billion, but a big part of that growth is coming from China. Right. The incremental growth is coming from China. So I'm just curious why we are not seeing WFE spending outside of China at that same pace or is that just something we will see next year perhaps? Yes. No, you are -- I mean there three to four probably incremental in China and the rest of it is outside of China. Vivek? Okay. As a follow-up, CSBG, thanks for providing that info. So it grew I think about 7% or so last fiscal year. I'm curious what it -- how much it grew the prior fiscal year and what part of that, should we think of that as kind of recurring and this is such an important part of your business that I'm always very curious about how to correlate this to your growth in chambers. Is this correlated to your chamber growth from two years ago or three years ago? Just how should we take this 7% number, and I don't know how to forecast your CSBG business. I guess that's really what I'm trying to ask. If you're thinking about forecasting, we gave you data points at the Investor Day, which was Pat Lord, who manages this business for us suggested that by 2023-24, it will have grown 40%. So there is your data point for how to forecast it. Chamber count is critically important but Pat and Tim talked about, it's not just chambers, it's dollar per chamber growing from, I think we, I forget what year we indexed it back to 2013, maybe... 2013. It was one point. Yes, it was 1.0 then it had gone to 1.5 and we had objectives to continue growing it to 1.7, which was what was baked in the model. So that's how you should think about it. Chamber count is important. We're also driving some of the innovative service offerings like Tim talked with remote diagnostic on equipment and things, to try to add more value for the customers and get paid for it. Thank you. Thanks, Vivek. Thank you. The next question will come from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Please go ahead. Yes, sir. Thank you for taking my question. Just as a follow-up to the prior question, how should we model the customer support over the next few quarters? Should we just track the memory investment you highlighted as doing better than foundry or would it be more in line with the overall revenue trend line that you described earlier? Yes. I think that again it's -- the beauty of the CSBG business is, it probably -- it doesn't change on the time scale that you're talking about here relative to any particular quarter's change in shipments. I don't think you're going to see that and we have an installed base in excess of 60,000 chambers. And we're driving revenue in our CSBG business off of tools that were shipped 20 plus years ago and there is upgrade cycles in their service contracts that Doug talked about, there's consumable parts. And so I don't think you're going to see that.
But as I said, that's the beauty of this. This is the, let's say, it's a stabilizing function for the company's revenue, and that's why we're investing heavily in this and it delivers value for the customers in reuse of and extension of installed tools. Yes. I believe this is the first quarter that you're actually breaking this out and I was just trying to better understand whether the Customer Support Business Group would grow faster with memory or with foundry or with a bit of same for different end markets. Yes, I can -- okay. Well, I think it's the second quarter that we've actually put out the data. But I think the couple of pieces of information to think about. One is, we've said that the business will grow every year and that's simply because again the installed base is growing every year and again we're investing to try to create more services, value-added services and products for that installed base. We haven't really made a comment about, does it grow every quarter. I mean, because it's -- again it's --you can be influenced by certain service contracts, certain upgrade decisions that customers make in any given quarter, but year-to-year, you can think about it growing every year.
It maybe a little bit less about segments. I've talked in the past about critical applications and Lam's focus on critical applications and the importance of that. I mean, one, they are sticky, but two, they actually tend to drive more parts and service requirements because the customers have to keep those systems at absolute top performance because they're performing the most difficult applications in the customers' fab. And so you tend to see a little bit more pull-through on the CSBG business for the critical applications where Lam is extremely strong. And so maybe that's -- yes, maybe it's a little less by device type but more by the application requirements.
And also critical applications tend to drive a more frequent upgrade cycle as the customers need to keep the installed base kind of performing for that latest technology node. Thanks. Thank you. Thank you. The next question will come from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question. Great, thank you. I know you guys said you had --you were working your way through the supply challenges but I wonder if you could help us kind of with what the quarterly revenue progression might have looked like if you hadn't had those. You had said in March, to get about $300 million of revenue deferred by the supply challenges. Should we view June as kind of having caught up to that and then this surge in September is more shipping directed demand or just what would that have looked like if you hadn't had the supply challenges that you had? Yes, Joe. I didn't quantify that. I'd say we've got nicely caught up. I also said we're not completely caught up at the end of the June quarter and that's as much as I think we're going to give you right now. We're driving efficiencies. We're getting much better. I think, Tim and I are pretty happy with how the supply chain is performing. All right. Great, thank you very much. Thanks, Joe. Thank you. The next question will come from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Yes, thanks for taking the question and congrats on the results from me as well. I think you mentioned that your capacity from a manufacturing perspective is over $3 billion per quarter now with all the issues with the supply chain. Is there a scenario over the next few quarters where you see potentially demand outstripping what you can deliver? Well, we have a global manufacturing factory network that we're highly confident in, I think it's unlikely that that's the scenario. I didn't want --I did not give you a maximum output for our factory network. I was only wanting to indicate that clearly we were supply constrained in the last quarter, was one of the reasons why we were unable to provide our normal guidance. Now with capability beyond $3 billion, we're confident in our September quarter and we're confident that over time, we'll continue to ramp that higher and higher. So it was -- we're not going to divulge our exact manufacturing capacity, but I'm quite certain we can continue to meet higher demand. That's helpful. And then just... Go ahead, Joe. Just a quick one on capital return. Should we think about your comments of reiterating your long-term target model for 75% to 100% of free cash flow is kind of indicative that we should start to see maybe some more -- or maybe at a re-accelerations on the share repo in the current quarter and into the end of the year? Yes, probably, Joe. I mean, we said last quarter, we were pausing in -- we actually came back into the market a little bit before the end of the quarter. So we're back, looking at things and I've always said it's opportunistic in terms of how we do what we do and we'll continue to be opportunistic. Thank you. Thanks, Joe. Operator, we have time for one more question, please. Okay. The next question will come from Weston Twigg with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to dig into the operating costs a little bit. Just understanding that people aren't really traveling right now, you're probably saving some money, you mentioned some tailwinds around remote servicing. But should we expect operating cost to ramp up meaningfully in 2021 assuming there is some sort of post-pandemic return to kind of a normal level of business and travel and marketing? And I kind of noticed that you added some head count as well. So I would assume that that would roll in and I don't know if that continues through next year. But just kind of wondering how next year works from an operating cost standpoint? Weston, I'm not going to give you a forecast for next year yet. I think there'll be plus or minuses assuming we get back to normal, we get a vaccine, the therapeutic regimen, what have you. I think we're going to learn from how we're operating right now and be better over time. I mean that's what Lam is really very good at. Looking at an opportunity, getting better and systematically doing it that way. I think we will do that. And yes, if we get back to normal travel, come back a little bit. I don't think it would come back -- comes back to where it was, but again, we'll keep managing the P&L in the right way. Yes, I think the only thing I'd add is at the same time, we've, obviously, I think we have a great track record of managing OpEx and you can kind of look at the results to support that. But we are investing in our 2023, 2024 plans. I mean, you've seen some of our announcements recently. The construction of a technology center in Korea, obviously there's expenses associated with that. It's a strategic investment to expand our R&D capabilities, put it closer to some of our largest customers. We are building a new manufacturing facility in Malaysia, which again is going to expand our global manufacturing network, provide additional business resilience, help take some cost out of manufacturing structure.
So, there are some near-term investments that we're confident in our long-term plan. And so we are pushing those through even right now. And we are seeing some of that reflected in our expenses as well, so, maybe that's offsetting a little bit some of the savings that that Doug talked about. But I wanted to get into the product and R&D, we continue to push more into R&D because we think it's the long-term growth engine of the company and we are really confident in our product pipeline and new products coming out. Okay, that's very helpful context. Thanks. Yes. Thanks, Wes. Okay, operator -- yes. Thank you all for joining today, we appreciate it. And stay safe and healthy. Thank you. This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.","today's earnings conference call is scheduled to last until 3 o'clock PM, Pacific Time . a replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website . today, we are reporting strong performance for the June period .",1.0

With that, I will hand the call over to Tim. Thank you, Tina. And welcome, everyone. Lam delivered very strong September quarter results. Revenues and gross margin came in above the midpoint of the guided range. Operating margin and diluted earnings per share exceeded the high end of the range. Our performance reflects solid execution across the company. The operating environment remains challenging due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the tremendous dedication of Lam's employees and our partners worldwide is enabling us to perform at a high level.
Notably, the September quarter marked record revenue and diluted earnings per share for the company and was also the first quarter in which we have exceeded $1 billion in revenue from our customer support business group. At the midpoint of our December quarter guidance, we will be growing EPS more than 35% year-over-year in 2020. Investments we are making in manufacturing and supply chain resilience are enabling us to meet customers’ critical needs in a period of strong demand and are preparing us for the continued growth we see ahead.
Before I talk about market and product trends, I want to touch upon China-related trade regulations. As has been widely reported, U.S. regulations have impacted our ability to ship wafer fab equipment and parts to a large foundry customer in China. We're working with regulators on this issue and have applied for licenses to ship equipment and parts that are subject to restrictions. As a result of the current situation, our December quarter guidance reflects an impact to sales to this customer.
From a market perspective, we see positive momentum in the underlying drivers of semiconductor growth and believe this translates into a healthy outlook for Lam's business. Work and learn from home trends continue to drive demand in key electronics categories, including PCs, storage, and networking. Third-party data suggests that growth in PC, notebook, and workstation shipments in the calendar third quarter surpassed a 10-year high to reach record levels. Moreover, some memory manufacturers have noted shipping record levels of consumer solid-state drive bits in their most recent quarter. We believe that many of the changes brought about by this year’s shift to remote working and learning environments will be structural. The net result will be a pull forward of key long-term secular growth themes for the semiconductor industry, including accelerated build out of cloud data centers and expansion of high-speed communication networks.
Against this backdrop, we see WFE spending growing across NAND, DRAM, and Foundry/Logic supported by demand fundamentals that should drive continued WFE strength into 2021. Overall, our expectation for WFE in calendar year 2020 remains unchanged from our prior outlook of the mid to high $50 billion range with an improved memory mix compared to 2019. Leading edge spending in Foundry/Logic remains robust, with rising capital intensity and the secular growth drivers discussed earlier, effectively resetting equipment spending expectations to a higher level in this segment for the foreseeable future.
We are also experiencing strong pull for trailing edge Foundry/Logic nodes, due to a pickup in the automotive, IoT, and image sensor markets. This helped us deliver in the most recent period, another quarter of record sales for our Reliant business. In NAND, we see spending increasingly focused on 9x layer and beyond devices where higher capital intensity for etch and deposition, combined with Lam's strong market share positions create even greater opportunity for the company than at prior nodes. Year-on-year total NAND installed wafer capacity is expected to remain flat, with NAND bit supplies growth still tracking below long-term demand as we exit calendar year 2020.
In DRAM, customers continue to invest cautiously and supply growth remains below long-term demand. As a result, we see a positive setup for next year and believe DRAM spending will increase as we progress into 2021. We expect to provide our full 2021 WFE outlook in our January earnings call.
Turning now to our business updates. We recorded solid progress in the September quarter towards our long-term growth objectives. A fundamental part of our strategy is to deliver broad innovation in equipment, process, and support capabilities to help our customers accelerate the transition of next generation 3D devices into high volume manufacturing. We are developing a pipeline of differentiated products and services to address what we believe is one of the most pressing challenges for our customers. The need to drive on ever more complex leading-edge devices, the node-to-node cost per bit and cost per transistor reductions that have been the key to our industry’s success.
With this goal, we are investing significant focus this year in two areas: One, accelerating our vision for Equipment Intelligence solutions. And two, extending our technology leadership in critical high aspect ratio processing. First, Lam Equipment Intelligence is a suite of capabilities, including data-driven modeling, state-of-the-art sensing, adaptive feedback algorithms, augmented reality, remote support, and self-maintenance hardware, aimed at shortening process development times and delivering predictable manufacturing ramps at lower cost with fewer resources. Our groundbreaking Sense.i etch platform introduced earlier in 2020 is a great example of a tool designed to leverage our holistic approach to our Equipment Intelligence offerings. On Sense.i, these capabilities are used to enhance RF and temperature control, improve edge yield, automate routine maintenance activities, and reduce chamber matching times across large fleets of tools.
In the September quarter, we continued to gain traction for this new product with initial shipments to two additional memory customers. We have aligned roadmap insertion plans with the top memory manufacturers and expect to ship multiple repeat systems in the next few months. While new platforms like Sense.i are designed for Equipment Intelligence from initial concept, we have also demonstrated this year that customers can realize significant value by deploying select elements of our Equipment Intelligence solution set as options or upgrades for their current generation systems. For example, our Corvus R automated self-maintenance feature available on our Kiyo conductor etch system has been proven to shorten maintenance cycles and improve process repeatability on critical and semi-critical applications. As a result, the installed base of Kiyo etch systems equipped with Corvus R technology is on pace to expand by more than 4 times in calendar year 2020.
Lam Equipment Intelligence is also enabling new types of remote support that have proven vital to business resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic. Big data analytics approaches to enhance troubleshooting and simplified process optimization are seeing growing adoption. In 2020, our data enhanced service activities are on track to grow 3x over the prior year. Virtual reality technologies are allowing us to continue training engineers across the globe to further develop their skills on our latest systems without the need for international travel.
Similarly, the latest innovations in augmented reality headset devices are allowing us to connect the engineers at customer sites to real time experts support in our factory, often as much as halfway around the world. Our customer support business group is projecting 6x growth in remote support engagements this year. We believe building an ecosystem of smart tools and intelligent services will help drive sustainable cost reductions across the semiconductor manufacturing process and generate growth for our installed base business.
Revenue from our productivity-focused offerings, including advanced services is expected to grow approximately 25% in this calendar year. In the area of process technology, the continued vertical scaling of 3D device and packaging architectures across all market segments creates a compelling long-term growth story for Lam.
Over the past decade, we have built a winning track record in etch and deposition at the 3D inflection; most notably, in the transition to 3D NAND. In the September quarter, we further extended our lead in 3D NAND with favorable high aspect ratio conductor etch [decisions] for devices beyond 200 layers and new application wins in dielectric ALD gapfill and carbon hard mask deposition.
Our high aspect ratio processing expertise also applies to emerging 3D packaging architectures. In Foundry/Logic it has been estimated that 3D heterogeneous integration solutions can enable cost reductions of approximately 20% for leading-edge nodes. In addition, 3D chip stacking is delivering performance advantages for advanced image sensors and high bandwidth memory. We expect etch and deposition intensity in advanced packaging and our corresponding revenue opportunity to continue to increase as more integration schemes leverage 3D scaling. In the most recent quarter, we received multiple follow on orders for our SABRE 3D electroplating and Syndion etch tools for this market. And since 2015, our installed base for both tools has doubled.
Looking forward, I am more confident than ever that Lamb's capabilities and strategic investments are well aligned with the fundamental needs of our customers and our industry. The complexity and cost scaling challenges for future technology nodes require comprehensive innovation in products and services that drive efficiencies from the very beginning of the design process all the way through to the support and maintenance activities in a high volume manufacturing fab. This focus is fast becoming the thread that ties together our strategic growth objectives. And we are pleased that we are beginning to see the results of our efforts reflected in our strong financial performance.
Thank you again for joining today's call, and now here's Doug. Thanks, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I hope everyone has continued to remain safe and healthy. We're extremely pleased with our operational and financial execution in the September quarter. We delivered record performance in multiple areas, including total revenue, which came in at $3.18 billion. And as Tim mentioned, as part of that revenue, we achieved over a $1 billion of revenue in our customer support business group. These results are clear evidence of our ability to grow the company and meet the needs of our customers while further improving our business resiliency. Our September revenues increased 14% from the June quarter driven by customers’ technology investments to meet long-term growth opportunities. These opportunities range across multiple vectors such as data centers, 5G networks, smartphones, gaming consoles, and personal computers.
In the September quarter, we also had a record level of earnings per share coming in at $5.67, the results of our solid revenue and gross margin performance.
Let me now move on to provide some color on our systems revenue. There were continued strong investments in the Foundry segment, and we had the highest system revenue dollars per foundry in our company's history. Our customers invested broadly with spending targeted at 14, 7 and 5 nanometers. Foundry represented 36% of our systems revenue for the September quarter. The Memory segment was also strong in the September quarter coming in at 58% of systems revenue. NAND represented 39% of our system quarter revenue with investments spanning 64, 96 and 128 layer devices. We saw increases in DRAM spending, which contributed 19% of our systems revenue, which was up for 16% in the June quarter. Customer investments focused primarily on node transitions to 1y and 1z.
We continue to see memory bit supply growth in the near term below long-term demand growth, supporting our belief that the memory market remains a healthy place from an inventory management as well as investment standpoint.
And finally, the Logic and Other segment was down quarter-to-quarter and contributed the remaining 6% of systems revenue in the September quarter compared to 10% in June.
For regional revenue concentration, as we discussed last quarter, we see solid levels of investment in the China region, which came in at 37% of total revenues in the September quarter. The majority of that revenue again came from domestic Chinese customers in the quarter. We have a broad base of customers in the China region. And despite the trade regulations that have impacted us with certain customers, we see continued strength in this region for our business from both domestic and multinational customers. We achieved another record quarter of revenue for our customer support business group at just over $1 billion, as I previously mentioned. This was an 11% increase from the June quarter level and over 28% higher versus the same quarter in 2019.
In addition to the strength of our advanced service offerings we’re optimizing the capabilities of our installed base through technology and productivity upgrades. We also continue to see strong demand in the refurbished tool business driven by growth in various applications within the specialty technology markets. You should think about things like IoT, RF and power devices.
We're on track to deliver the growth objective of over 40% cumulative revenue growth between 2019 and 2023 for CSBG that we outlined at our Investor Day earlier this year.
Our gross margin for the September quarter was 47.5% at the high end of our guidance range. Customer and product mix are always factors impacting our gross margin. We also experienced favorable impacts in the quarter related to increased factory and field utilization.
We made more progress on our production efficiencies as we operate with COVID-19 related safety protocols. We are experiencing higher costs in the global freight and logistics area and expect these elevated costs will continue until broader air freight availability becomes available. September quarter operating expenses were $523 million. Over two-thirds of our spending remains focused on R&D as we continue to make progress in our growth initiatives for market share, and technology disruptions to expand our serve available markets. Incentive compensation was higher as well during the quarter related to our higher profitability levels. We are maintaining travel and other expenses at lower levels as we continue to work remotely in many locations.
Our operating margin in the September quarter came in over the guidance range at 31.1% with operating income of $988 million. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 10.9%. We will have fluctuations in our tax rate from quarter-to-quarter, and you should continue to expect the ongoing tax rate to be in the low teens level. As we've noted before, we expect other income and expense will vary quarter-to-quarter based on several market related items, think about things like foreign exchange and the level of interest rates.
Other income and expense was approximately $51 million in expense, which was higher than in the June quarter. The increase was driven by lower interest income on our cash and investment balances, as well as the impact of a full quarter of interest expense associated with the $2 billion debt offering that we completed at the end of April.
Let me now shift gears and move on to capital return. We continue to drive strong cash flow and remain committed to the targets we laid at our Investor Day earlier this year to have our capital return at 75% to 100% of free cash flow. We were active in our buyback activity during the September quarter and repurchased approximately $450 million of stock. In addition, we paid $167 million in dividends in the quarter. I would also like to highlight that we announced in August a dividend increase from $1.15 to $1.30 per share each quarter, which was paid in October.
Diluted earnings per share came in at $5.67, above the guidance range we provided for the September quarter. Our diluted share count was essentially flat for the September quarter at 147 million shares as we expected. The share count includes the dilutive impact of approximately 900,000 shares from the 2041 convertible notes. The dilution schedule for the remaining 2041 convertible notes is available on our Investor Relations website for your reference.
Let me now move on to the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments including restricted cash decreased slightly in the September quarter to $6.9 billion from $7 billion in the June quarter. Cash flows from operations came in at $643 million, which is solid performance in an environment where we continue to deploy cash towards working capital to support increased business volumes. DSO decreased slightly in the September quarter to 66 days from 68 days in the June quarter. Inventories turns were also slightly down from the prior quarter coming in at 3.1 times. Inventory balances are somewhat higher, as we are growing inventory to support higher business levels, as well as to mitigate risk and potential supply chain disruptions.
Non-cash expenses were approximately $56 million for equity compensation, $56 million for depreciation, and $17 million for amortization. Capital expenditures in the September quarter increased from June to a total of $63 million. We are slightly ramping up capital spending to support things like the Sense.i platform development, our new Malaysia factory and the technology lab that we announced in Korea. Ending headcount for the September quarter was approximately 11,700 regular full time employees. We added resources to support the higher levels of customer activity in the factory and in the field. Additionally, we're supporting new activities in research and development areas like Sense.i, enhanced ALD and dry resist.
Looking ahead, I'd now like to provide our non-GAAP guidance for the December 2020 quarter. We are expecting revenue of $3.3 billion plus or minus $200 million; gross margin of 46% plus or minus 1 percentage point. Gross margin is a bit lower as we see a less favorable mix, as well as ongoing COVID-related expenses; operating margins of 29.5% plus or minus 1 percentage point. And finally, earnings per share of $5.60 plus or minus $0.40 based on a share count of approximately 146 million shares.
Now, in an effort to address your question, I know everyone has concerning our business with a large Chinese foundry, I'll just give you a direct update relative to the guidance. As Tim mentioned, we are fully complying with all regulations and have applied for licenses to allow us to ship tools and parts to them. The status of the license approval is uncertain. The revenue and earnings guidance I just provided is lower than it otherwise would have been as a result of this uncertainty. With the results we've delivered and the guidance we've provided for the December quarter, the 2020 calendar year is expected to be the strongest ever in the 40 year history of Lam Research. We're well-positioned to advantage from the continued strength and investments across all segments of the semiconductor industry.
That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, Tim and I would now like to open up the call for questions. Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] We'll go ahead and take our first question from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Please go ahead. I guess first question on the NAND side. I think there's a notion that perhaps we might be nearing the peak on spending. So, we'd love to hear your thoughts on: A, how do you think about your revenue opportunity on just node migration versus new wafer starts? And then B, can you kind of walk through the revenue opportunities, which sounds like it’s increasing as we migrate from the 9x layer node to 128 layers and above? Sure. Let me start C.J. Yes, I think that, you probably called out the most important point right there at the end. What we have continuously said is that, because of the role that etch and deposition play in building devices, our opportunity is growing quite significantly at two of those node migrations. And so, from our revenue perspective, we clearly see that, that revenue continues to grow in 3D NAND into the future.
From a spending perspective, obviously, anytime you continue to see higher and higher numbers, you can start to think about a peak. But again, if you looked at and thought about what I said about supply growth, we still see ourselves exiting this year with supply growth remaining below the long-term trend line. And also if you go back and reference the data point we've given a couple of times at the NAND Flash at the Flash Memory Summit, about five year spending requirements to meet what we see as long-term demand growth in the high 30% range. That is -- we're kind of nearing those spend levels right now after a couple of years previously of underspending that. And so, I think that we're still quite confident about how we enter 2021 from a NAND spending perspective. And as my follow-up, on the CSBG side, you saw great acceleration on a year-over-year basis I think, up 29%. So I was just curious, is that a function of higher utilization rates of customers? Is there kind of one-time upgrades in there or is that tools coming off warranty? And as part of that, how should we kind of think about the growth trajectory of that business for all of fiscal ‘21? Sure. Well it’s -- maybe the last part first, which is, as Doug pointed out, probably the best way to think about its future growth is still the same as what we said in March, which is a 40% growth between out to 2023, but we did see an acceleration. And I think what you're seeing is in some ways the power of that business, which is made up of several different components, you pointed out some of them, a sensitivity utilization which is primarily in the spares business.
And then also as customers look to get more out of their existing installed base, I mean, a lot of my script talking about how customers are looking for ways to enable these transitions and enable high volume manufacturing ramps, but we are sensitive to how much it costs to do that. And so, customers continue to look for technology and productivity upgrades to make those installed bases as valuable to them as possible. So we have seen upgrades increase in terms of that. And then I also mentioned, spending on refurbishment and other systems as well. And so, it's a multifaceted business and I think that right now we're hitting all of the angles that are very important to our customers. And we’ll go ahead and take our next question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Great job on the quarterly execution and strong results. Yes, it's been two years of sort of weak flattish DRAM spending. But as the demand profile looks strong next year, and you have the early move to run alpha node, 2021 is looking like a growth year for DRAM spending. And on top of that, memory architecture has always been very 3D-like, and similar to NAND-like. Aspect ratios are increasing, tighter tolerances on material thicknesses and so on. So ahead of this strong DRAM year, how do you view your SAM and share expansion potential on some of these next generation 1-alpha DRAM architectures? Yes, just to kind of reiterate comments we've made in the past. I mean, we -- as you pointed out, every time you move forward in technology, whether it's 3D NAND, we just spent time talking about or hearing DRAM. The features are getting taller. The aspect ratios are getting more difficult and that is requiring more etch and deposition technology, and it tends to expand our SAM. What we’ve said is every technology node in DRAM, NAND, and in Foundry/Logic, our SAM grows if the technology moves forward. So, your question about DRAM is no different.
We do anticipate and we said that we think we enter 2021 with a good setup for rising DRAM spending. As you pointed out, a couple of years of flattish DRAM spending where we've kind of been under growing long-term demand. And so, we combine increased spending with, we see as higher intensity due to these technology changes that require more etch and deposition equipment, we think it's a good setup for Lam going into 2021. And then, Doug, on -- obviously, very strong gross margin performance by the company. And that's even still with the higher logistics and transport and freight-related cost due to COVID-19. Can you just give us an update here, and maybe give us a sense on how big that impact is to your gross margins either in the just reported September quarter or in the December quarter guide? Yes, Harlan, I haven't quantified it, but it's noticeable. I mean, let me put it that way. I mean freight logistics spending is quite expensive right now simply because there's just not enough airfreight flying across the Pacific Ocean where a lot of our stuff comes and goes. But I haven't quantified it. Harlan, the right way -- maybe just thinking back longer-term to the financial model, but the right way to think about it is still the numbers that are embedded in there. Right now, when I think about the revenue levels we're at, we're trending a little bit below what might be in that model and it's because of the COVID inefficiencies, in particular, freight and logistics. I'm not going to quantify it for you, though, but that's how you should be thinking about it. And we had a really positive mix in September. We don't have quite as positive mix in December. So that's the commentary around sequential gross margin. We'll go ahead and take our next question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. I guess, Tim, Doug, you talked about SMIC in the December quarter being a hit, but I was hoping you could quantify that. And as you do, kind of help us understand how China might trend as a percent of revenue in the December quarter. It's been well above trend. And I know you've talked about broad-based strength, but do you see that kind of well above trend representation in the December quarter as well? Yes, John, I'm not going to quantify the large Chinese foundry impact to the guide. I think the numbers I've seen people suggest, percent of revenue, WFE, longer-term basis, the right way to kind of think about where that particular customer might have been and could continue to be if we are all in the industry able to get licenses. In any given quarter, it can be up or down as all customers are. So I'm not going to specifically quantify it in December, but I think you know roughly how big they are. That's helpful. And I apologize for the follow-up, but you guys clearly understand the concern out there is, how much of the China strength is related to customers that are being worried about full bans going into China by the U.S. government. Tim, I'd like to get your kind of thoughts. In a worst-case scenario, if the U.S. were to ban equipment going into China, how much of the China CapEx in WFE today do you think would need to be reconstituted in other geographies to support demand? And how much of it do you think could be lost in just representative of kind of China building in anticipation of demand multiple years out as they go -- pursue their semiconductor -- domestic semiconductor strategy? Well, I mean it's a very difficult question to answer from the standpoint that in many ways, what you just implied in the question was that some of that may be building in China in anticipation of demand they see several years out. We think that demand -- I mean, for all of the reasons that we talked about, whether it's -- I mean, it's just the digitization of the global economy, that's occurring everywhere. And so we think that demand remains. And so to your point of how much of it gets reconstituted, how much of it gets satisfied, I think China demand, global demand has to be satisfied by somebody. And so I think, ultimately, a lot of it gets reconstituted. And the only part that might not be is, what we have acknowledged, and I think most people recognize is as you're coming up the learning curve, there can be in the short-term some overspending as you're learning and you're building yield and you're gaining efficiencies.
But even in the long run, that -- we've seen that play out over every region. And what ends up happening is that turns in ultimately to business -- for our installed base business, where we go back years later, and we're making that installed base productive. And so this industry is so efficient but I don't think there's ever really anything that gets lost, quite honestly. And that's -- but I mean, there's a lot of -- there were probably a lot of pieces to your question that require assumptions. But I think that it would cause some disruption, as we said, in the short-term. But in the long term, demand drivers and the need to supply semiconductors and semiconductors equipment to meet them doesn't fundamentally change in our view. Yes. And maybe, John, I'd just add a couple of things, the way I think about it. When I look at the revenue in China for us, it's split fairly evenly between the multinational customer base and the local Chinese customer base. So to help you frame it a little bit, that multinational stuff, obviously, was a decision to put in a country that could have gone anywhere quite honestly. And then as Tim alluded to, a lot of the Chinese customers are relatively new in their process ramps, so maybe they're a little bit inefficient or somewhat inefficient. But at the end of the day, they're building capacity to support long-term demand that somebody else will step into over a period of time. So anyway hopefully that's helpful. And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead. I had 2. I guess the first one, Doug, is on service. And I guess the question is, how much, if any, inventory stocking of spares, do you think is going on? I know you try to put controls around that. But it seems pretty clear how much service has taken off for the past 6 months that maybe that is actually happening. You've been pretty clear that you can't run the tool if you don't get the spares, so it wouldn't make any sense to pull the tool in. But we have heard that there is some communal stocking happening in China for parts and whatnot. So can you speak to how much of a factor that is? Do you actually see that happening? Yes, Tim, it's hard to know, to be perfectly honest. One thing I looked at in anticipation of this question coming up is, from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter, did any customer meaningfully increase their spares orders with us in China? And the answer to that was, no, not really. That doesn't mean that maybe they weren't planning to stock a little bit ahead. It would be pretty hard at times to know. But I don't see a big stocking going on in China for spares. That's maybe the way I'd summarize that. I don't know, Tim, if you think any differently about that. No, I think that's fair. I mean, obviously, just as you see, even sometimes in our own numbers, is you're building for growth. I mean, there's no doubt, the inventories themselves, the number of parts that have to be stocked and maybe it’s what we’d call the safety stock level. I mean, those may rise. I mean when you're in the early days of a manufacturing fab, you’re always concerned about like the time to get another part shipped in. But as you really start working towards efficient mass production, you do that. So I think we have seen -- and clearly, we have seen that shipments have increased, but whether they're increasing more than the growth plans of the -- of those customers, a little bit more hard to say. And I'd say just across the board, there's a little bit of a -- everybody is focused on business resilience. But as we talk about things that may be structural, I think for quite a long time, and people are going to be looking at what do I have to do to ensure my business can run. And so I don't think those -- you see those immediately like turned on and off. And then, Doug, I guess a follow-up just on the balance sheet. You did start to repo back up, $450 million is definitely a respectable number, but you still have $7 billion in cash. And I think in the past, you said maybe you did $4 billion but that's kind of the optimal cash. So you definitely have a lot of excess cash. So maybe can you update us there on your thoughts on what you're thinking with the excess cash? I think it seems a little harder that you'd be able to do M&A and semis to get some regions to improve that. So can you just talk to the excess cash level, Doug? Yes, Tim, I specifically reiterated the 75% to 100% return to free cash flow as the company's planned objective. I don't know think of it, however, that's what we're planning to do. Now over the last couple of years, we've done more than that. We've done more than 100%. And your observation is right. We probably have a little more cash than we need sitting on the balance sheet right now. We'll be looking at that periodically over time. But I don't have anything new to tell you right now relative to any change in our plans or thinking. And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. I have two of them. First one for Tim. On the NAND side, when your customers go from 96 to 128 layers, as you move organically, the etch times went up, and which is a big positive for Lam. But going beyond 128 layers, if customers start stacking layers, is it a slight negative? What I'm trying to figure out is, is stacking neutral or negative for dep and etch intensity? And then I have a follow-up. I mean the simple answer is no, SAM still grows under every scheme to build more layers. It translates into different parts. Again, I've talked about this where you kind of picked your battle whether you're trying to build ever taller stacks in one shot or you're trying to build efficient stacking. But simple answer is etch and dep intensity rises in either case. Just perhaps split differently with different applications. And then a follow-up for Doug. Would you be willing to share how much of your service of CSBG revenues is from domestic China or overall China? Not that I'm willing to share it, Krish, because off the top of my -- I'm not sure I know what the number is. The way to think about it over time is consistent with equipment shipment with a lag, right? And the way we've generally been talking about the business for us from a system standpoint in China is, it's been pretty evenly split between multinational customers and local China. And over time, the CSBG business kind of would get caught up to a similar footprint, if you will, maybe not immediately. But Krish, that's just off the cuff reaction to the question. And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please go ahead. I was hoping if you could give us some directional view on the China versus non-China and the Foundry/Logic versus memory mix for the December quarter guidance? You're asking, Vivek, about December specifically? That's right. Just directionally how do you see those mix things trending in December? Yes. I think China is going to remain strong in December is how I view it right now as we sit here today. And I think the broad-based set of customers in China that I tried to describe will continue to be what it looks like. And on the Foundry/Logic versus memory mix? Well, the large China foundry customer likely isn't going to get much from us, if anything, unless we get a license in December. So that will probably trend down a little bit in December. Got it. And as my follow-up, I wanted to revisit this DRAM question. I understand DRAM sales are still below their peaks, but they are still back to the levels you had in the second half '18. How are you thinking about your DRAM growth over the next several quarters? What are the signs that you're looking for to say that now we are at a trough, and now we can get back to some normalized trend? I mean, Vivek, what we look at is we run our own models of bit supply growth and do our best to try to understand inventory that's out there, what the customers are holding, what the customers’ customers are holding. What's going on with pricing? What's going on profitability? And as we look at all of those things, our view is, right now, the investment levels that are occurring in DRAM are generating supply growth below long-term demand growth. And at some point, that will need to get itself caught up. And we think it's sometime in 2021. I think it sets up to be a pretty decent year for DRAM in 2021 is as much as I can tell you right now. I don't know, Tim, if you want to add anything? No. I think also just you referred back to like 2018, and I think that, again, for us, we look and there are -- across all semiconductor segments, I mean, significantly greater drivers and broadening of drivers we're seeing today. And we pointed out a couple of those on previous calls. But just even the difference in DRAM content in the high-end smartphones and the dramatic jump that takes from -- into the 5G phones. And then, of course, we talk about the buildout of data centers and everything else. It's -- there's a demand element to it. There's the supply element. And I think we just see it as a positive into 2021. And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. I had 2 as well. First one, I guess, is very much a follow-up to the last question on DRAM and NAND supply growth exiting the year. Doug, you just talked about your internal model. You’re suggesting that the supply growth exiting the year is below the long-term trend line as you see it. Is there any way you can give kind of quantitative color around that. For DRAM, are you looking at kind of 15% to 20%-ish supply growth exiting the year? In NAND, is it kind of around 30 or below 30%? And I guess related to that, you talked about your expectations for DRAM into 2021 being positive. Any directional guidance you can give on the NAND side? Yes, Toshiya, those numbers you referenced probably are fairly consistent with what I think is the consensus view as well as our own models. So I don't have anything incremental to add there. Your second question, sorry, ask it again. Yes, directional guidance on NAND into 2021, if any? My view, I mean NAND is pretty decent right now. And I think it will be pretty decent next year. Again, based on our view of the industry inventory, investment plans, I think it will be a pretty decent year for '21 next year. We're not going to give you numbers on '21 yet. We'll do that in next quarter's earnings. But I think it sets up pretty well. Got it. And then a quick follow-up. In terms of market share, you guys talked about 4 to 8 percentage points of share growth like kind of your 2023 target at your Analyst Day. If I take the midpoint of your December quarter guidance and make assumptions around your CSBG business, I think your systems business is going to be up close to 25-ish percent in calendar '20, so you're clearly gaining share. What sort of the outlook into next year based on wins that you have already, both on the memory side and logic and foundry side, do you think you can sustain this level of share growth momentum? Or could that accelerate? Could that slow down a little bit? Any color would be great. We're certainly going to try. And I think that in our business -- we've described this in many ways, every quarter, we come in and we talk about wins and new applications. And I know it kind of starts to sound like we're a broken record here. But the reality is it takes a couple of years for those wins to start to translate into the numbers that you're starting to see now. And so if you go back and you kind of look at the old transcripts, you'll see us talking about pretty significant momentum that started really in the 2019 time frame. And it's been building through 2020, and that's what you're going to start seeing I think play out. As those wins at those future nodes start to roll in through high-volume manufacturing.
I'd make the same caution we're extremely happy with Sense.i momentum right now as it's winning sort of those slots and sockets in future nodes. But I know the timing for those to then become the main driver of revenue and market share growth won't be until those nodes that are in development now and moving into pilot become high-volume nodes. But that's -- so I would say that we look back 2 years to our progress, and that's kind of what we're starting to see, and we look at wins we're making now. And that's our pipeline to hit the 2023, 2024 objectives. And I think we -- as we said, we feel we're on track and almost couldn't feel better about the strength of the product portfolio and the pipeline right now. And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. I wonder if we could get some additional color on the restrictions in China. When exactly did they kind of go into place. And just so I understand for modification if it happens again, what happens to product that's being installed on-site to product that's shipped on the way there that stuff fits in backlog? Are you still able to ship against that? Maybe I'll make a couple of comments. And then Tim, you can add on. I mean the incremental I think that came out was really an application of a rule that was previously out there around military end use that basically said, if you’re enabling that, one of our customers is, you need a license. And so what ended up happening is, I guess, guidance, if you will, from the Department of Commerce that you need the license to ship to at least 1 customer, the foundry customer in China. I mean, that's really the only thing that was new, Joe. And so we're applying for license is basically what's going on. I don't know how long it's going to take to find out whether those license will be granted or won't. We're kind of in sort of uncharted territory, and we're waiting to see how it plays out. So timing, I don't know that I can help you much with. Okay. And then in terms of the backlog and anything that might be assembled on site. Generally speaking, when these rules come out, you get a little bit of a lead time, so you can adjust whatever is like in the very near term going on. But it's hard to know, quite honestly. So at this point, we are complying with all regulations that are out there relative to this 1 customer, which means we're delaying the shipment plan for the December quarter, basically it’s what's going on until we know more. And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Blayne Curtis with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead. I was just going to -- love a little more color on just the trailing edge strength. How much of a trigger that was. Obviously, we've heard about tightness and clearly seeing a rebound, but a lot of these end markets are kind of still down a bit. Kind of just your perspective, is the different mix, particularly in markets with higher content. And kind of just perspective, is this just a little bit of a catch-up? Or is it a more sustainable trend? No. I think this -- I mean, at least from our view, I mean, I mentioned it was another record quarter for our business group that satisfies that demand. We've just seen tightness in this market and kind of a broadening of those activities quarter-by-quarter. So -- and if you go back and look, we've reported record quarters now for quite a number of [quarters]. So I think it's just tightness. It's difficult. In fact, we just had a very strangely, but a new product release, where we talked about we're leasing a product now for 200-millimeter photoresist strip. And so I think you can get a sense from that where we're going back and basically refreshing 200-millimeter products that the demand is out there, and it cannot be solved or served just by refurbishment of the existing base. It's -- the requirement is actually expanding beyond that. Yes, Blayne, I mean, I know you know this market really well. I kind of think of the analogy IoT edge kind of devices that are out there, you know what's going on there. I mean, that's really what's going on with this part of our business as well. Back at our Investor Day in March, we suggested that we think WFE in this space quickly grow 2 times to 3 times faster than WFE broadly. And that's what's going on. Got you. And then maybe as a follow-up, you mentioned that WFE would grow next year. You're not giving the specific guidance. You mentioned memory up, I didn't hear you say foundry. So I guess I'm just curious, obviously, you don't know what's going to go on with SMIC and licenses in China in general. But just kind of curious, with the strength of the trailing edge, is foundry going to be up next year as well, kind of the factors there? Yes, Blayne, our normal practice at this point in the year is not to give specific numeric, here's what next year looks like. We'll do that a quarter from now. We're giving you a little bit of color that we think it's going to be a good year next year, but it's too soon for us to quantify. We just -- our practice is to wait until the December quarter earnings to give you that. And we will give it to you then. And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead. Doug, you have talked about a $10 billion domestic China WFE number in the past, and is that still the right number within the mid-50s WFE for the market? Yes. Our view is still mid-high 50s from a WFE standpoint, in China, roughly $10 billion, plus or minus a little bit. We're 3 quarters of the way through the year. So if the 1 customer that everybody is thinking about right now isn't able to spend in the fourth quarter, we're still in that range. Okay. And as a follow-up, has the backlog normalized due to COVID-19 impact in the March quarter and now fully reflected in your Q4 revenue guide? Or you still have some carryover? No, Atif, we're pretty much caught up at this point. And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. My first question is going back to China, given the strength you've seen last quarter, are there any risk of customers pulling in purchases? I think you addressed the spare part side earlier. But the question is not just from the 1 foundry customer, but also maybe other customers on the memory side as well. Well, I guess you addressed it, is there a risk? Do you mean backward-looking risk in the September, the risk that pulling occurred? I think Doug kind of answered that, which is we really haven't seen or felt anything that feels out of the ordinary relative to the growth plans for these customers. Going forward, I think, again, in many ways, you see us guiding to yet another record for the company. And I don't think that we'll be -- I don't think that any of that right now factors in what we would, again, think is abnormal pull-in activity. Okay. I think you guys were talking about spare parts earlier, but I guess the system -- new system itself… So I mean, no, we're… I think the question maybe was about spare parts, but it's really more of -- I think it's a broader statement. Yes. I agree. Okay. Maybe my follow-up question is on Intel. I think last quarter, you guys pretty much said this, there's no impact. It doesn't matter who makes the chips. But on the memory side, now that Intel sold the business -- NAND business to Hynix, given that they have very different architecture, do you think there will be a net impact for you guys going forward? Well, hard to know. That's a pretty recent announcement, and it would be a little bit of speculation. I mean, Sidney, long-term, the way I think about this is, at the end of the day, demand is what matters, right? Our customers are putting wafer capacity in place to supply demand. And things can get pulled in, pushed out a little bit on the margin. But at the end of the day, when I think about where I think the industry heads, supply and demand have to be in relative equilibrium, over the medium or longer term. And whether that means we have 5 customers in NAND or 3, it largely doesn't matter. They're going to invest to satisfy demand in my mind. Yes. And the -- question was, is it all targeted towards that strength. I mean, we basically have talked, I think in the past. We're strong across all flavors of 3D NAND. We'll go ahead and take our next question from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. On the NAND, I was curious, within your bit supply growth model or expectations, how do you think about the growth from no transitions or technology transitions in terms of, if bit demand is closer to 30% next year and versus kind of a long-term of high 30%, do you think the installed base needs to grow to support that? In any given year, Joe, when we look at it, there's always a blend of both. It's always in the best interest of the customer to do the node conversions first because it's a very cost-effective way to do it. And then generally, that means you lose wafer capacity and it needs to get topped up a little bit. In any 1 year, the mix is different 1 year to the next but it's always a blend. Okay. That's helpful. And then just -- I thought your comments in the prepared remarks around support engagements being a remote. That was interesting, obviously, with COVID. And so I was curious, how do you see that trending over the next few years. And maybe what percentage of engagements are remote now? And maybe how do we think about the cost savings potential there? Yes. It's -- well, I guess what I would say is we featured the Equipment Intelligence solutions. You imagine if we're launching Sense.i designed around Equipment Intelligence, we started that activity long before COVID was ever even something we could imagine. So we feel very fortunate now that we're driving that aggressively. And it really is designed to do things that remove the need for people to be physically located at the tool in order to troubleshoot and repair the tools. And so we have seen -- I mentioned a 6x increase in remote support engagements year-over-year. A lot of that is because our engagement with customers, there's kind of like not many other choices at this point to bring the kind of expertise you need to the tool. And I think that what -- just as we're seeing with work from home and other things, a lot of that will remain structural. It is -- it does save money for the customers by allowing us to repair the tools and get them back into production more quickly. And it saves money for Lam because we don't have to deploy as many people flying all over the world trying to service these tools. So I think a lot of that, I hope and I believe, will be structural and long lasting. Operator, we have time for one more question please. Perfect. We'll go ahead and take our last question from Weston Twigg with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Quick 2 questions. First, advanced packaging, you talked about it in the opening remarks. Can you help quantify what that is as a percent of systems revenue? Or sort of how relevant it is to the overall top line? You know, Wes, right now, it's small, but with nice growth trajectory. And we're excited about what the future looks like. It's not huge right now. But when you listen to the industry and our customers talk about it over time, it's clearly part of their road map to drive Moore's Law forward. So we're excited about it. It's not huge now. We hope it will be over time. I think, though, it also is -- Wes, maybe you've been around a long time. So you recognize the SABRE name point. And the point there is, in many cases, these are -- I mentioned this is about leveraging a lot of the expertise we've already built for other applications into new areas where we can gain high share. And it doesn't require in those cases for those markets to be quite so big to start to have an impact. So SABRE 3D, very, very strong position, very long track record. A lot of that R&D already kind of being done for larger markets; Syndion, same thing in terms of very high, very strong market position. And then, as Doug pointed out, what we're really trying to say, we have those positions, and we actually see the market coming to us as more of these integration schemes continue to go 3D. So we highlighted it just as it's one other example of 3D helping drive incremental growth for the company. I see. Okay. That makes a lot of sense. And then the other question I had was just the U.S., it was remarkably low in terms of revenue contribution last quarter. I was wondering if you could offer any commentary on that, if that's a trend that you see or it's just an abnormally low quarter? There's not a lot of fabs in the U.S. taking equipment. I mean that's what's going on. I mean this is a [shift key] statement. And most of our customers' fabs are outside the United States, Wes, you know that. Yes. I guess, it had dropped a lot quarter-over-quarter as well. So it seems like the investment is declining. And I don't know if that's a sustainable trend and it could be, but that's the commentary I was looking for. No. It's just -- you know how this works. Equipment can be lumpy to any one fab that come one quarter and then it needs to ramp. And it's lumpiness, but you know the fabs are in the U.S., and that's what's going on. It's just timing. And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to today's speakers for any additional or closing remarks. No more closing remarks. Thank you, everyone, for joining today. We appreciate it. Once again, this does conclude today's conference. We do appreciate your participation.

2020 was a remarkable year for Lam Research. Our global teams rose to meet the unprecedented challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic and delivered the best year in our history. Total Revenue of $11.9 billion and earnings per share of $20.45 were both record highs for the company, driven by served available market, market share and customer support business growth. Through the year we also launched new products and announced breakthrough technology solutions that we believe lay the foundation for our continued success.
Before going into details. I want to express my sincere thanks to our teams for their incredible execution in an extraordinarily difficult environment and to our customers and suppliers for their partnership and support as we all adapted to the unforeseen events of 2020. We enter the New Year with hope that the world will soon emerge from the COVID-19 health crisis and move towards a global recovery.
From our view, WFE spending in 2020 ended in the high $50 billion range. This is about what we estimated at our Investor Day in March, just before the extensive COVID-19 impact was known. We saw spending growth across all segments of the market led by a recovery in NAND, continued expansion in Foundry/Logic, and a slight pick-up in DRAM. China's domestic spending for the year was in the $10 billion plus range.
As we look to 20 to 21, we see strong momentum across all parts of our business. Our early view is for substantial WFE growth to the high 60s to $70 billion range, supported by the ongoing migration to higher layer counts in NAND, a strong spending environment in DRAM, an increased investment in Foundry/Logic, as indicated by recent customer commentary. Currently, we are seeing spending bias somewhat towards the first half of 2021.
While today's absolute levels of WFE are significantly higher than a few years ago. We believe the rapid digitization of the global economy, combined with rising capital intensity due to greater process complexity supports robust multi-year WFE spending. In fact, if there's a common theme that underpins our outlook for the next several years, it is that sustainable growth throughout the semiconductor value chain will be driven by the proliferation of artificial intelligence, high performance computing, IoT, 5G and the incredible societal advances and user experiences these technologies enable.
We expect strong demand from a diverse set of end use markets to positively impact semiconductor and semiconductor equipment growth in 2021 and beyond.
Take, for example, the $200 billion global online gaming market. Nearly 3 billion people worldwide actively play video games across a variety of platforms, generating over the last five years, more than a 50% CAGR in data growth, as users embrace realistic experiences enabled by more powerful processors, faster memory, and higher graphics resolution.
If you just look at a sub-segment of the broader gaming market, namely gaming consoles, the number of these units shipped annually is much smaller than the number of smartphones sold. However, when you consider that a GPU for gaming console is approximately four times the size of a smartphone application processor, this is an important driver of incremental WFE. From a memory and storage perspective, newer consoles utilize approximately twice the DRAM bits, and employ SSD-based storage versus HDD in prior generations. And rising capital intensity trends on top of this semiconductor content growth and the impact on WFE increases further. We estimate for the 5% upside in the game console market has the potential to drive about $500 million of incremental WFE. And this is just one end use market example. If we similarly look at the impact of a 5G phone market, we see that 5% incremental demand in 5G units has the potential to drive close to a billion dollars in incremental WFE. It is demand drivers such as these that have strengthened our conviction around the sustainability of WFE spending over a multi-year period.
It is against this positive backdrop that Lam remains focused on executing to our long-term objectives for SAM expansion, market share gains and installed base business growth, we described at our Investor Day, last March. In NAND, we continued to extend our strong leadership position, we estimate that our tools have now cumulatively processed approximately 37 million more wafers than our nearest competition through the three most critical 3D NAND applications.
Since we first provided this metric at our Investor Day, less than one year ago, we have widened the wafers process experience gap by more than 40%. The accelerated learning that comes from our installed base of 3D NAND systems, puts Lam in the best position to deliver the solution needed to meet our customers next generation manufacturing challenges.
It also allows us to gain early insight into new opportunities being created by technology inflections. For example, in 2020, we announced our new Striker FE atomic layer deposition system, which employs a unique ICEFill capability for high aspect ratio dielectric gapfill. This tool addresses a new technology need for 3D NAND devices scaling to 128 layers or more and production ramp of Striker FE is underway at multiple customers.
2020 also saw the launch of Sense.i, our next generation etch platform, and today we announced our new Vantex high aspect ratio dielectric etch module on Sense.i. Vantex features advanced RF technology and new uniformity enhancements to enable next generation device roadmaps.
Vantex and Sense.i together collect more data per wafer than ever before, enabling advanced equipment intelligence and to deliver new levels of productivity and process control. The timing of our Vantex launch intercepts DRAM and NAND roadmaps facing increasingly complex node to node scaling challenges. As a result, Vantex is already in qualification with both DRAM and NAND customers, and repeat orders have been received to ramp this system into high volume production in 2021.
For Foundry/Logic, we continue to target new technology inflections to expand our opportunity and position. Our Kiyo GX conductor etch system has been engineered with an advanced RF pulsing capability to meet the unique requirements of extremely narrow, high aspect ratio features. It also provides extendibility to future devices featuring nano wire or nanosheet architectures.
Leading etch Foundry/Logic customers are increasingly adopting Kiyo GX for their most critical front-end of line applications at five nanometer and beyond, where the need for atomic level precision etch becomes more acute.
Moreover, as devices scale parasitic RC degrades transistor performance. As a result, we are seeing increasing customer pole for Lam etch and deposition solutions designed to reduce RC effects, including atomic layer etch for self-aligned context, new functional films and optimized metal solutions, which reduced via end line resistance by simplifying middle of line and back end of line process flows.
In DRAM, we are seeing incremental share in SAM growth also coming from growing complexity of node transitions. We assess that we have greater than 50% etch market share in DRAM, and due to the importance of high-quality hard masks and mask open etches with EUV, we expect additional patterning share gains in etch and deposition as EUV passes increase in future nodes.
Adoption of EUV and Foundry/Logic and DRAM is also creating a significant SAM expansion opportunity for Lam's dry photoresist solution. Using this new technology, we believe we can accelerate our growth in both Foundry/Logic and DRAM disrupting the existing wet photoresist equipment market.
Our solution is gaining significant traction with leading customers as they look to improve the cost metrics of the EUV patterning. Changes of this magnitude due take time to realize but with tools now being installed and wafers being run for top DRAM and boundary logic customers, we're pleased with our progress readying this innovative technology for production.
And finally, 2020 was another outstanding year for our customer support business group. Our installed base has now reached nearly 66,000 chambers, and CSBG revenue growth exceeded chamber growth by a factor of more than 2x for the 2020 calendar year. We generated record revenues for all sub-segments within CSBG. Growth in our Reliant business is driven by automotive, 5G and consumer electronics. We expect these areas to continue to outpace overall market growth in coming years.
Meanwhile, we delivered on the expectations we said on our last earnings call, for calendar year growth of 25% in productivity focused services, and 6x growth in remote support engagements. We are excited about the trajectory and broad strength of this business and especially its proven ability to deliver world class support of complex technologies in high volume manufacturing.
To wrap up, Lam marked its 40th anniversary in 2020 with record financial performance, a strong slate of innovative new products and services and solid execution on our strategy to expand leadership across markets. As our March quarter guidance suggests, we are optimistic about the opportunities that lie ahead for Lam and believe we are in an excellent position to win. Thanks again. And now here's Doug. Excellent. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today on what I know is a very busy earnings time. I hope you and your families have been safe and healthy since we last spoke with you.
I'm really quite pleased to be reporting these outstanding results. We came in at the high-end or exceeded the range for all guided metrics in the December quarter. Despite the challenges we face during 2020 related to the global pandemic, Lam delivered record financial performance in revenue, operating income dollars and earnings per share.
Our December quarter revenue came in at $3.46 billion at the high end of our guidance range, and represented an increase of 9% from the September quarter. The strength in our performance was driven by investments in all device segments, as our customers ramped to meet the demands of a diverse set of end markets such as data centers, smartphones, PCs, gaming consoles, IoT and automotive.
Overall, our revenue increase was not only driven by the wafer path equipment needs of the industry, but also by the continuous growth of our installed base. We continue to add value to our customers by delivering extra spare parts, equipment upgrades, refurbished tools and advanced service offerings.
Looking at the details of our systems revenue, the memory segment was strong in the December quarter coming in at 68% of systems revenue. This strength was driven by the NAND segment which represented 51% of our systems revenue versus 39% in the prior core.
December was a record revenue level of NAND quarterly revenue dollars for the company. We have clear leadership positions in the NAND segment, with customers investing in equipment for 64, 96 and 128 layer devices.
DRAM investments contributed 17% of our system's revenue. DRAM spend was spread over the one y, one z and one alpha nodes. The revenue percentage was down slightly from the 19% in the September quarter. We expect continuing healthy investments in the combined memory market as we see proven inventory and profitability management.
On the Foundry segment side spending remains robust. We concluded 2020 with a record level of revenue dollars in this segment. The majority of the investments in the December quarter were concentrated at the leading edge seven and five nanometer nodes. Foundry represented 26% of our systems revenue for the quarter versus 36% in the September quarter.
Rounding out the system revenue picture Logic and other contributed the remaining 6% of systems revenue in December quarter, which was flat with the prior quarter level.
From a regional revenue perspective, we continue to see solid levels of investment in the China region coming in at 35% of total revenues. Different than the last several quarters, the majority of the China's spending this quarter came from our global multinational customers investing in their China located fabs.
As Tim noted, we achieved another record quarter revenue for our customer support business that are coming in at $1.1 billion, which is an increase of 12% from the September quarter, and over 35% higher than the same quarter in 2019.
The growth we've seen in each of the sub-segments of this business is a testament to the value we're providing to our customers for technology and productivity enhancements. We remain very comfortable with our commitment to deliver greater than 40% cumulative CSBG revenue growth between 2019 and 2023, as we outlined at our Investor Day in March of last year.
The December quarter gross margin was 46.6% generally in line with our expectations. As I've noted in the past, gross margin can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter due to overall business levels, along with customer and product mix.
In the quarter, our factory utilization levels improved with the increased business volume. I would mention we do have continued headwinds to gross margin related to elevated costs for air freight that will impact us until freight planes get back to more normalized levels.
Operating expenses for December came in at $563 million, which is an increase from the prior quarter largely as a result of increased incentive compensation expense that was tied to our higher profitability levels.
During calendar year 2020, we spent over $1.3 billion in research and development, which represents approximately two-thirds of our operating expenses. The R&D focus is a fundamental part of offering differentiated products and capabilities like Sense.i and Vantex enhanced ALD and dry resist that deliver on our long-term growth objectives. They had over a billion dollars in operating income in the December quarter for the first time in company history, with operating margin at the high-end of the guidance range coming in at 30.3%. This was due to our strong revenue and gross margin.
Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 11.5%. As we've discussed in the past, we will have fluctuations in tax rate from quarter-to-quarter and you should continue to expect the ongoing tax rate to be in the low teens level for the 2021 calendar year. I would mention, we are monitoring potential tax changes that may arise from the new administration in the United States.
Other income and expenses approximately $53 million in expense fairly flat with the prior quarter.
I would like to remind you that beginning in the March 2020 quarter, the benefits and costs of our employee deferred compensation plan are no longer mismatched in our non-GAAP results. They are mismatched in the GAAP results. This mismatch was $24 million in the December quarter. You can see this in the GAAP reconciliation table of earnings release. The fluctuations were higher this quarter due to the volatility in the market.
Let me turn to our capital return activity. For the December quarter, we paid $188 million in dividends and allocated $703 million towards share repurchase. During the quarter, our Board approved an additional $5 billion share repurchase authorization. For calendar year 2020, we repurchased 3.8 million shares, deploying $1.4 billion at an average repurchase price of approximately $360 per share.
We also paid out dividends totaling approximately $686 million during the year. In total, our capital return activities represented close to 100% of our free cash flow.
I'd also mention that since we increased the level of our capital returned back in 2017, we've paid out $2.1 billion in dividends, and deployed $9.3 billion towards buybacks. repurchasing 47.3 million shares at an average price of $198 per share.
Diluted earnings per share came in at $6.03 a little above the guidance range and more importantly at an all-time high for the company. Our diluted share balance was down slightly from the September quarter coming in at 146 million shares pretty much as we forecasted. The share count includes the dilutive impact of approximately 800,000 shares from 2041 convertible notes.
Let's now look at the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments including restricted cash decreased to $6.3 billion from $6.9 billion in the prior quarter, largely due to the capital return activities that I discussed previously.
Day sales outstanding increased to 76 days in the December quarter from 66 days in September. The increase is largely due to revenue linearity and the timing of collections that fell in the March fiscal quarter. I just mentioned that we collected $136 million on the first day of the March 2021 quarter and over $570 million during the first week. The inventory turns were slightly up from the prior quarter level coming in at 3.2x.
Cash flows from operations came in at $345 million, which is somewhat depressed as a result of the growth in accounts receivable and inventory. We've grown the inventory to support the higher expected March business volumes and to mitigate supply chain risks from any potential disruption from the COVID-19 environment.
Non-cash expenses included approximately $52 million for equity compensation $59 million for depreciation and $17 million for amortization. Capital expenditures for the December quarter increased from September to a total of $92 million. We're investing to support the expanding operations at our new Malaysia factory, a manufacturing facility in Ohio that's focused on critical spare parts and the recently announced Korea Technology Center. We expect to see somewhat higher levels of capital expenditures in 2021 as we support these critical initiatives.
And then, headcount for the December quarter was approximately 12,200 regular full-time employees. Resources have been added to support the increased business volume in our factories to service our customers in the field and to further enhance our R&D capabilities.
Now looking ahead, I'd like to provide our non-GAAP guidance for the March 2021 quarter. We're expecting revenue of $3.7 billion plus or minus $200 million. Gross margin of 46% plus or minus one percentage point; operating margins of 30.5% plus or minus 1 percentage point; and finally, earnings per share of $6.55 plus or minus $0.40 based on a share count of approximately 145 million shares.
Tim's already given you our outlook for 2021 WFE. I just reiterate we do think it will be a somewhat first half separated spent although things could change as the year unfolds. You should take that into account as you build your models for the year.
So in summary, we just concluded the best financial year in Lam Research's history. Additionally, we provided guidance for March that represents another record level of financial performance. The company is executing well in a challenging environment. We are delivering on our near-term objectives while laying the framework for continued long-term execution. This is a testament to Lam's leadership team and our dedicated employees.
Operator that concludes my prepared remarks. Time and I would now like to open up the call for questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question today from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Congratulations on the great results. Tim, I just want to go back to your WFE target guide for this year of high 60s to 70. Now, if you harken back to the Analyst Day, almost a year ago, your three to four year target out was sort of a range of 60 to 70. And so I'm curious, how should we think about how quickly we've gotten here? Do we worry about cyclical overheating? And in a similar vein, as you think about this year being perhaps a little bit more first half weighted? Is that really a commentary on normal seasonality, you want to add capacity in the first half, the demand in the second half? Or as you look at the bottoms up? Are you worried about any areas that are kind of perhaps cyclically heating up a little bit too much? A lot of questions in their John. Maybe there was a comment in my script even that said, in many cases, the outlook, we gave at Investor Day, now it is formulated before we really knew about COVID-19, before we saw all of these tremendous work from home drivers, a lot of things that just really kind of changed, maybe the way semiconductors have and the role semiconductors have played kind of in the world in the last 12 months.
And so, we give our best view when we give it and at that time, we thought our range of 60 to 70 billion seemed pretty reasonable, given what we thought about demand. Clearly, some segment to the market have been growing a lot faster as we just mentioned, from those demand trends. We look at it -- there is an urgency to get tooling to meet demand. And that's not our customers, that's also us as we look don't talk about investment in our Ohio facility to build critical spare parts as factories are running at very high levels of utilization. So we're investing, our customers are investing.
I think the outlook is, it's difficult to say, we're telling you right now, it looks like it's first half, somewhat the first half weighted. But I also talked about long-term demand drivers that we think fundamentally continue to become growth drivers for this industry in the long-term. And you've just seen growth, and I gave it a couple of examples, 5G, gaming consoles, everybody has read about the shortages in automotive, image sensors. There's just such a role that semiconductors play today. I don't think there's any segment we would point to that we feel is overheating relative to the long-term trends we've talked about.
Just one example, I know we'll get the question at some point on NAND. We talked about the recovery in NAND. But if you look at the spending on NAND over the last three years, and you average that out, it's actually very close to the average annual spending that we've outlined to a couple years at the Flash Memory Summit, which says that you need roughly $70 billion over a five-year period to hit the high 30s demand growth rate. And so, we feel reasonably comfortable with demand profiles across all the segments right now. And there'll be changes quarter-to-quarter in such but long-term, we think they're in line with the demand we are seeing. Next, we'll hear from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Just to follow up on the WFE commentary. Is there a way to quantify it? How much is it front half related as to back half? And is there any upside to back half, everything is going to come from memory, dielectric China anything? Then, I have a quick follow up. Yes. Well, we haven't quantified it. I don't think we're going to do so right now. Doug shaking his head, no, and are going through right now. But, I think that to your point and Doug kind of mentioned, it's like, this is our view now, you can always feel the demand and the urgency for the next couple of quarters much, much stronger than the quarters further out. So I think your question is a good one, which is where might we see changes later in the year?
I think you have to look at some of the demand drivers. And again, there's a broadening of demand across -- it's not just driven by leading edge. In fact, we were looking at the amount of foundry spending for instance that's coming from 28 nanometers and above. It's a very high level these days, you see that in strength that gets reported into our CSBG business, the Reliant business. I think you can continue to see strength there. It's how semiconductors being incorporated into everything. The content in cars and such, it's just increasing in quite a rapid rate. And those tend to drive kind of that off leading edge business at a very rapid pace.
Where that gets manufactured. I mean, there is a fair bit of investment in China, for instance, that is at those, those trailing-edge nodes. And I think that's why we have seen strength in China, and why we actually believe that China, especially at those trailing-edge nodes, continues to be an area of strength as they satisfy a lot of that domestic demand for those kinds of applications like 5G and cars and other things. So, I guess you could say there might be might be added strength in those broader demand drivers that could surprise us later in the year. Got it. That's super helpful. And then, just a quick follow up in your WFE assumption for this year, what are you modeling for domestic China? You think it's 10 billion last year? I'm just kind of curious where you are seeking out to this year? Thank you. I don't think we're ready to give like an exact number. But what we've said is 10 billion plus this year and we expect growth this year. I don't know, if Doug wants to add anything. Probably in the same range, Krish, plus minus a little bit is kind of how we're thinking about it. Next, we'll hear from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. I guess, Doug, I wanted to ask the prior question maybe a little bit differently. You said WFE this year, it's probably, 58, I'm sorry, not this year, last year, probably about 58.5. So your share grew about 100 basis points up to like 13.6%. So if I assumed that the service business, maybe you could help tell me if this is right, but it seems like service is going to be maybe 12.25 or 12.50 in March. So if you use that same share numbers, you get like an 18.5, 18.3, 18.5 billion worth of WFE in Q1. So that's almost $74 billion annualized. So, I sort of look at the full year number regarding high 60s to 70. So that was sort of implied that the back half of the year has to be -- at least for the industry has to be down pretty substantially off of for the first half of the year is? Or at least talk about Q1's running.
So I'm just kind of wondering if you can comment on that and sort of like double-click on [indiscernible] and I have a follow up. Thanks. Tim, I'm not going to unpeel the whole number. And I can't go through all the numbers, as I sit here that he just spit out, I'm sure you're doing the right math or close. As we look into the year, it does look like the first half related year, things move around, things change. I think probably NAND is first half related, I think Foundry/Logic probably a little bit also. And I think DRAM, probably through the year is fairly steady.
But things move around, things change, we always have pretty good visibility at this point into the first half, and the second half is far enough away that it can move around. So that's why we kind of tried to put some ranges, you guys will do the math to kind of take it through an open company here. But that's generally what I'm seeing, and then how I'm thinking about it. Okay, cool. And then, I guess my second question is on NAND. So it looks like CapEx is going to run about EBITDA this year for the industry. I mean, you're going to -- the industry probably does 19 billion in NAND, I don't know if you'd agree with that, 19 billion WFE this year. So that's pretty substantially above the 14 billion run rate that you get when you divide your 70 billion by five. So I guess when you take those two factors, and you look at CapEx being about EBITDA, usually that's not all that sustainable. So I guess, what's do you tell your customers, does that concern you at all? I'm just sort of curious on that. Thanks. Tim, when you look at this, it'll go up, it'll go down, nothing goes up every quarter. It ebbs and it flows and if you go back to '19, it was pretty low. Go to '20, it went up a little bit, '21, flat to up a little bit? Maybe? Yeah, probably.
And then, it'll course correct based on whatever demand looks like. I mean, when we step back to on the reason, Tim and I both talked about these long-term demand drivers is that the important thing to think about over the next several years for the industry, it won't go up to every quarter. It never does, you know that better than I do or as well as I do.
In timing, a fab investment, when things come in, it'll go up, it'll go down. That is what always happens and is what will happen in 2021 most likely. Yes. I think probably just to add Tim, I mean, the absolute spending in NAND any given year is somewhat out of our control. But I mean what we do control is, how we continue to expand share of every dollar WFE spent. And that's why I talked about, how we've leveraged the learning we're getting from being the company that runs the vast majority of the critical applications in NAND. So identify new opportunities and new applications and grow into those so that the next node, our share of WFE Fi goes higher. And I talked about Striker FE, the ALD tool for gapfill, brand new application for us compete in the space where we didn't compete before. And, as trend node transitions occur into the future, means that our share of WFE increases.
It's also important to remember that our share of every dollar WFE spent on node transitions actually is the highest. And that's simply because of the role that action deposition play in those transitions. So if you end up in a year, let's say and I'm not characterizing any given year in this way, but at the end of the year, where you do have lots of wafer starts, people become concerned that that might be a bit of overheating with new capacity. But actually we look at it as adding to what we would consider to be kind of our 3D annuity, the 3D NAND annuity, which says installed base is larger, which means that the next transition, RAM will get an even greater share of the spending that is required to move that entire 3D NAND installed base forward to the next node. So, that said any given year, something happens, but in the long-term trend, we think Lam's opportunity continues to grow in 3D NAND. We will now hear from CJ Muse with Evercore. Question is on CSBG business. Is your commentary on the first half weighted year reflected for that business as well? And as part of that, if I hold the business just flat at Q4 level, that business would run about 16% in calendar '21. So how should we think about the growth rate this year? And I'm going to have a quick follow up. Yes, CJ. My commentary on first half, second half was very much targeted at WFE, not necessarily installed base. Now the installed base won't necessarily grow every single quarter will grow every single year like we've been saying. We feel really good about where we're at, I mean, it's we're record after record. And Tim shared the chamber count with you. It's kind of like it's been over the last several years. So the tailwind there is, it's really very good. Yes. And I guess, just to add at our Investor Day we talked about the goal, we had to expand that number. The number of products and services available for the installed base is way of increasing revenue per chamber. And I think you've seen our progress in that area in this past year, and we'd expect that to continue to increase going forward as we focus on equipment intelligence and remote services and a lot of database productivity enhancers. That's great. And as a quick follow up, on your last call, you talked about how -- given the preponderance of manufacturing in Fremont, you couldn't ship to one large logic player in China. Curious if you've been able to get a license and as part of that, are you including the spend there in your 2021 domestic China outlook? Thank you. That's where we're at right now CJ. We're still in the application process for license haven't heard back. When we look at China, that's plus or minus how we described flat to up. There's a range around it. But at this point, we haven't heard back on the license. We have applied and we're waiting. Next, we'll hear from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. And congratulations on the solid results and execution. For all of the leading growth, leading edge growth trends that you highlighted in your prepared remarks, Tim, there's no corresponding significant attach rate of analog and mixed signal semiconductors to these applications. Additionally, some of your customers are moving to 12-inch analog manufacturing. And then, we know that there's pretty significant tightness in boundary capacity for lagging edge 28 and 40 nanometers seam also, approximately, and obviously, I think you mentioned this in driving some of the strength in your business. Approximately what percent of your overall business is lagging edge technology nodes? And do you see this expanding as the year unfolds? We don't break out exactly what percentage of our business is in that segment. But I did say we do see that area continuing to grow again. And it's -- that's like what we would almost consider to be the strongest secular growing part of our market, because it's being driven by almost every aspect of the economy in terms of the types of products that semiconductors going into, that are manufactured with those trailing edge nodes. And so, we've seen, I don't, maybe I think it's something like I could get along with eight or nine quarters, I think in a row that we've now had reported record revenues in that trailing edge space.
So one, we feel like we know how to compete and address that market. And we think that it's going to be just one that just continues to grow, maybe not quarter-over-quarter-over-quarter, but records every quarter, but certainly year-to-year-to-year, it will continue to be an area of strength for us. And Harlan, I'll just remind you what we said back at the Investor Day in March and still believe that this segment of WFE will outgrow the rest of the market by -- I don't know, two times, maybe three times, although the leading edge stuff has picked up since then. But it's still a very good growth area for us. Thanks for the insights there. And then, to kind of follow up on CJ's question in calendar year 20, as you mentioned, services grew 22% that's not only double your installed base, growth CAGR over the past few years. But it's double the trend line target of around 10% as it relates to your 2023/2024 financial model. And if you just look at the continued complexity on these next generation leading edge tools, the strong demand for lagging edge nodes, it appears that the service business is going to continue to grow faster than this 10% growth targets that you guys have put out there, upgrades, the VAN services, Reliant, refurbished flows. So would you broadly agree with that? Or are there some offsets that we should be thinking about that could dampen the year-over-year services trajectory, back to that kind of normalized kind of 10% to 12% level? Yes, I don't think we're ready to up our long-term objective just yet. But I think you're pointing out some of the things that are doing quite well in that part of the business around advanced services. And we talked about a 6x increase in remote support engagements. I think if we look, one, we put out that model, Investor Day, as I mentioned, as COVID environment kind of evolved, some of the advanced services, the database services, the poll for the idea of like less people related maintenance, using data and remote capabilities, clearly caught a lot more traction in the second half of the year. We need to see how much of that sticks as we kind of come out of this environment. But we believe that, that those things are -- those capabilities are now kind of demonstrating their value and a lot of that will stay, those will be strong drivers.
Another thing happened in 2020 is, there probably were some instances of spares being ordered a bit ahead of normal trend. And as you know, everybody, including Lam, seeing some of our inventory numbers, tried to hedge against disruptions due to COVID-19. So you might see some moderation if you're looking for offsets in that space. So, we feel as Doug said, very comfortable about hitting the objective we put out at the Investor Day, but we're not ready to set a new growth target for the business until we see a little bit more of the trend this year. We will move on to Vivek Arya with Bank of America. For the first one, I'm curious, what do you think is the right way to gauge the utilization of your NAND shipments last year? Is there some engagement with those customers on the CSBG side that gives you insight into what that installed base utilization is because I imagine the NAND number, at least to us was somewhat of an upside surprise? And I just wanted to understand what's driving that? Well, I guess if I understand the question about, you're kind of asking how much the tools that we've shipped are being utilized in our customer fabs and that's not something I can really comment on. Obviously, to our engagements with customers, we have good insight into fab but not something we can really talk about. If I misunderstood the question maybe... Or maybe if, Tim, what do you think is the supply demand balance for NAND right now among your customers? Well, I think if you consider that we talked about further strengthen the NAND market in 2021, I would say that there is a sense that more equipment is needed to bring on additional capabilities in NAND at this point in time, for sure. And as a quick follow up, Doug I think you alluded to some cost headwinds from air freight. Some of your semiconductor peers, I think have managed to kind of pass on increasing costs in other areas, foundries and wafers and substrates and so forth. Do you think this is the kind of cost you could pass on? I'm trying to think, how do you go from your operating margins right now to the 32% to 34%, kind of range you had outlined at your analyst day at similar level of annualized sales? Yes, Vivek. We're always trying to get the best pricing that we can get. It's hard at times, though that it kind of passed up like this through -- we're doing our best. And it is a bit of a headwind. So I guess we're not able to push it through at this point. I do think just part of things will mitigate at some point, as the world gets back to normal and freight lanes get back to normal. Things are just constrained right now, we fly things in and out of our factory, a lot, oftentimes, or at least we used to in the belly of our commercial aircraft carrier at times. And they're just not flying at the volume that they used to be. I do think that comes back at some point, once we get COVID under control in the world. Any way to quantify the headwind, Doug? Is it like 100 basis points to gross margin, 50 basis points? Vivek, I haven't given a hard number, but I would tell you, it's noticeable, it's meaningful. It's a meaningful headwind, I wouldn't be talking about it and we're doing our best to manage it. And I do believe it will get better over time. But I haven't quantified it. Next, we'll hear from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. You talked about the drivers of the higher WFE in calendar '21. He talked about migration to higher layer counts. In NAND as well as DRAM and Foundry, I guess, in the NAND side, does that mean you think NAND spending is higher for the year? Or are you not going to go that far? And then, for DRAM, it seems like the economics are improving. Do you think that's -- where people spending sort of independent of that just thinking they need to get a technology migration? Or have you seen sort of stronger spending because the market has been stabilizing and improving. Joe, I will start and then I will let Tim add on as well. As we look into 2021, right now, pretty much we see every segment of our business up, right, it's up in Foundry/Logic, it's up in NAND, it's up in DRAM, to different degrees, and like I kind of alluded to earlier, things can change but that's our outlook right now. And again, we see these longer term demand drivers as a large part of what's going on. And Tim, if you want to add anything? No. I think you pretty much get it. I mean, I think, you started with the question about NAND, I mean, again, it's again, this layer transition is a way for customers to reduce their costs. And that those transitions are complex from [indiscernible] perspective. So creating a lot of demand for our tools to help enable those transitions. Yes. To the extent that a lot of NAND spending is on layer count migration, rather than adding incremental wafers. I mean, does that wouldn't Lam normally outgrow the WFE in that kind of environment, assuming there isn't like a lot of capacity being added in NAND? In a conversion, as Tim alluded to earlier, when you're just doing layer count conversion, that's the sweet spot for us in terms of the percent of spend. So the answer is yes. With the caveat that everybody's installed base is a little bit different. There's always a handful of new wafers coming in, and you got to kind of peel the onion back to the next layer and look at what's going on in any one period. But I would agree with your comment that in a layer count conversion, that's a good spot for us. Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs has the next question. Hi, guys, thanks for taking the question and congrats on the strong results. I have two as well. My first one is somewhat related to Joe's question, wanted to get your thoughts on your ability to outperform WFE in 2021. Tim, given sort of the application wins that you have in the bag, and given sort of the device type mix that you guys are assuming internally, would it be fair to assume kind of a similar magnitude of outperformance in your systems business in 2021 vis-à-vis 2020. Or do you think 2020 was a little bit unique given how strong NAND was in the year? So that's a lot of information you're asking for. As we look, I mean, Doug just mentioned, I mean, clearly we see strength across all parts of the business. NAND expansion is clearly good for us. As I mentioned in my comment, you're more than 50% share in DRAM etch, we're expanding our deposition. So DRAM is good. Foundry/Logic is an area where, obviously, from an exposure perspective, Lam has -- it's been less in the past, but we've talked about our improvements there. And so I think even there, as the nodes move forward, some of these new products we're talking about, whether it's dry resists, that might not be a 21 story, maybe, but more of a 22 and beyond story.
But you know, we're working hard to increase our SAM as a percent of WFE and so, I guess what I just say is in terms of outperformance, you get to go back to what we said at investor day, which is the way our past outperformance is to expand our SAM and coming from where we are in the high 30s. We said we're going to get to 40% SAM as a percent of WFE. That's increasing our opportunity. And then, we do think with new products like the Vantex and Sense.i, and other products that are kind of in the pipeline to come in later this year. Those will be market share drivers for us. And so, combination SAM expansion and market share gains will hopefully to continued outperformance in the market. And then, Tim, as my follow up, you just mentioned Vantex, pretty fascinating technology. Wondering if you could kind of give us some color on areas or points of differentiation, vis-à-vis your nearest competitor in Asia. And if you can remind us what your market share aspirations are and dielectric etch over the next couple of years, that would be super helpful, just given how, relatively speaking, you've been stronger in conductor. So I think the opportunity set is bigger in dielectric. Thank you. Well, just a couple things. I mean, one, the Vantex story is really like two parts. One is, it is the first module on the new Sense.i platform. So again, when you're thinking about Sense.i, you're thinking about a tremendous amounts of data collection and using that, not only to improve the productivity of the platform and the maintenance and such, but also process control. And as you look at now in that dielectric high aspect ratio etch, which is where Vantex is targeting, those etch's are becoming incredibly difficult both in NAND and DRAM where that product is really targeted.
We've leveraged the learning from all of those wafers I talked about, we've been running relative to the competition in 3D NAND to really understand what it takes to build the world's class high aspect ratio etch and that's what we think we've delivered to the market. We do really well in dielectric etch, quite honestly, in both DRAM and NAND already, but we're not going to -- we haven't quantified, I believe our dielectric etch ambition, but clearly it's higher in years to come. And we think Vantex and Sense.i is the platform to do that. Now we will from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Wanted to go back to the last quarter you talked about, obviously, you wanted to guide WFE because guideposts and obviously DRAM was the strongest. Now fast forward and we've all seen big foundry CapEx numbers, but your NAND came in strong as well. Can you talk us through over the last three months, what kind of improved for you? I know you don't want to [indiscernible] for the year but just trying to get a better feel as to what you're expecting between those two segments. I know Blayne, obviously, one large foundry customer upsized their CapEx. I think everybody understands what happened there. I don't think any of us saw the totality of that coming. So clearly, that was a bit of the upside. Maybe that would be the only thing I would specifically point to. And then, just back on gross margin, obviously, you have the higher freight costs, you are guiding it down a bit, revenue up, can you just kind of walk us through the March guide. And then, there's opportunities for leverage, either gross margin or even on OpEx, for rest of the year. I think everybody knows this isn't really a huge fixed cost business. So when revenue goes up, it matters but it's not what matters as much as in like our customers business, product mix matters, customer mix matters. Customer concentration moves gross margin around. That's happening probably a little bit in the March quarter. A little bit of a headwind, if I think about the longer term, getting to that financial model that we put out for '23. Two things I would point you to on the gross margin and operating income for that matter. One is this freight headwind that we're dealing with. Second, I referred to ramping the factory in Malaysia, that's going to be somewhat more efficient, a little bit bigger factory, a little bit more cost efficient factory. So there's some upside that we're going to see in gross margin there. And that's really from where we are today to where we're trying to get to or where we're going to get to, what gets you there. Our next question will come from Atif Malik with Citi. Tim, you guys have seen strong growth in 3D devices, particularly in NAND area and are announcing the new technology for high aspect ratio. My question is in the logic side, the logic devices are now moving in three dimensions. For example, nanosheet, the three nanometer Korean foundry this year. And how does that impact the definition etch opportunity? And should we be looking at that as a major inflection? I would hope you would be. We've been talking about really at some point along the roadmaps, every device ultimately is inflecting to 3D simply because that's how you get continued scaling. And so, I talked about our Kiyo GX tool. One of the -- you start seeing new types of technologies come in the etch and also deposition space. I mentioned that tool with its atomic layer etch capabilities, those tools are well suited to the types of 3D devices that you're going to see in nanosheet, or nano wire architectures.
There will also be other tools, which we haven't really talked about so publicly that they are in the hands of our customers around selective etch that will become much more prevalent within 3D logic foundry devices. And then a whole slew of new deposition films that also help, I mentioned some of the [RC] [ph] and such so, I think it's an area where we can continue to expand our SAM by catching kind of those 3D inflections in logic and foundry. Our R&D that Doug talked about is really targeted towards growing our opportunity in that space. Okay. And we have heard about supply constraints in chips and printed circuit boards. Is the availability of chips impacting your capability to be able to present for your customers? In any supply chain is complex as ours is with as many suppliers as we'd have. There's always something that you're working your way through. And certainly there's a handful of those things today, given volume is inflecting up, but we're managing through it pretty well. Operator, we have time for one more question, please. Certainly, our final question will come from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. On your expectations for domestic China being flat up? How are you thinking about the efficiency of spending this year as the customers continue to ramp up their technology curves? In China, specifically, Joe, is that's your question? Yes. For your domestic China customers, I think in the past, you talked about there's some level of inefficient spend just given that they're still kind of learning. Our domestic China customer base is very broad. It's much broader, I think, perhaps than all of you realize. And you've got people at all kinds of different points along ramping technology, some are been doing it for a really long time. Some are brand new to certain technologies. When a customer is new to a technology takes a little while to get to an efficient ramp point. So it's a broad set of customers that are at different points, I think is what I would describe. Again, depending on how long they've been doing, what they're doing. Okay, fair enough. And then, quickly on just the CSBG side, how are you thinking about the improvement of memory fab productivity last year contributing to the growth? And then, how do we think about that this year? Because I assume that the spare parts business would be more of a modest contributor to growth for that business this year. Let me think about that question. I don't know, Tim, if you have anything you want to add. I mean, consumption of spares will ebb and flow across every one of our end markets with utilization and utilization size spare part consumption is somewhat higher? It's just the nature of how -- it's a consumable part, obviously. So it needs to go along with volume.
I don't know if I'm answering your question but that's true and the memory fab is true in foundry and logic as well. As Tim suggests, maybe there was a little bit of by head in spares maybe a little bit, but I don't think that was huge. I don't know. And I don't think that it was something that needs specific memory. But in general, a couple of comments we've made about spare parts, maybe just to come into, we have always focused on the critical applications, because critical application, you have to keep those chambers in very pristine condition in order to be able to deliver the [on-wave] result the customer needs. They tend to be bigger drivers of spare parts. And so, I think as each of these technology nodes gets more complex, spare parts and the capability of those spares continues to grow. That's good for our business. But the flip side of that, of course, is that's customers cost. And so, that's why we are continuously looking for things like the new Sense.i platform to help our customer reduce maintenance cost and running cost of the systems.
I mentioned Sense.i and Vantex, the first adopters and the first one to ramp up that production are going to be in the memory space. And that's simply because it delivers technology, [indiscernible] productivity and that's really the key. How do you find that balance of getting the results on the wafer without consuming too many spare parts and without consuming too much of the tool equipment time? I think Lam has become very good at that. And I think that again, we point to the volume of learning we have in high volume production, cross and endearing cost sensitive applications. I think we may be the best at that. That will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to Ms. Correia for any additional closing remarks. We just wanted to thank everyone for joining today and we will talk to you all again soon. Thank you. That will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

And with that, I will hand the call over to Tim. Great. Thank you, Tina, and thank you to everyone joining the call today. Lam posted excellent results in the March quarter with record revenues from both systems and install businesses, as well as record cash flow from operations and record earnings per share. Our performance reflects solid execution by Lam employees and our partners worldwide despite ongoing COVID-19-related impacts.
The investments we are making in manufacturing and supply chain resiliency are enabling us to support our customers' needs, amid a broad based strengthening in semiconductor demand. We are very optimistic on our positioning and see continued strong growth for Lam in the future.
Let me first begin by updating our expectations for wafer fabrication equipment spending. Since our last earnings call, we have seen WFE spending plans increase for the calendar year. Our outlook for 2021 WFE is trending above $75 billion. And we now believe the WFE spending in the second-half of the calendar year will be higher than the first-half across all device segments.
Several factors are at play in driving this robust WFE growth. First, secular tailwinds such as AI, 5G, and IoT continue to strengthen. And over the past year, COVID-19-related impacts like work and learn from home have accelerated adoption of these technologies.
Second, the complexity of manufacturing advanced semiconductor devices continues to increase at a rapid rate, leading to a rise in equipment capillarity [ph] across all segments. Third, innovative consumer products are incorporating more semiconductor-enabled functionality, driving faster growth in semiconductor content per [Technical Difficulty].
On our last call, we talked about new gaming consoles as an incremental driver for semiconductor demand and WFE.
A similar example as we see in wearables. These devices are utilizing an increasing number of sophisticated sensors, manufactured using mature technology nodes to deliver added functionalities such as body temperature measurement, heart rate monitoring and blood oxygen sensing.
Wearables are integrating these sensors with advanced node semiconductors that deliver lower power and lower latency, in addition to the computation capability required to support new AI and machine learning enabled applications. This is having a marked effect on semiconductor content in these products. And today's wearables contain nearly double the amount of DRAM and four times the amount of NAND versus five years ago.
Semiconductors are also capturing a greater share of the value within the electronics supply chain, and we see 2021 semiconductor revenues into the electronics revenues breaking out of the historic averages over last 15 years.
And finally, the growing importance of semiconductors to global industries has led governments in the U.S., Europe and Asia, to call for actions to mitigate supply chain risk, which will likely include increased investment in regional semiconductor manufacturing capacity.
When combined, these four factors of accelerated technology adoption, growing complexity, increasing semiconductor content and real capacity investment support a compelling case for a strong multi-year WFE spending environment, one in which Lam is executing extremely well.
In 2020, we gained share across both etch and deposition, including significant gains in conductor etch. We expect to deliver overall share growth again in 2021. Our positive momentum demonstrates how we are successfully positioning Lam as the partner of choice for our customers at a time when technology complexity has increased heavily.
3D scaling of device and packaging architectures will be a primary focus of the industry for the remainder of this decade, and Lam approaches this challenge with unique experience. We were the leader in enabling the transition to 3D devices through our early engagement in etching. And as a result, we built enduring leadership positions in the most critical etch and deposition applications.
And as the 3D NAND roadmap is evolving to multi-stack scaling for higher layer counts, our technical contribution continues to grow. To integrate multiple stacks to build taller devices, innovative solutions are required for stress management, etch selectivity and defect control.
The increase in complexity of multi-stack scaling is creating new product opportunities for Lam. And this quarter, we recorded a key deposition win for a multi-stack enabling film at a leading memory customer.
Through our leadership in the 3D NAND market, Lam has developed a portfolio of products and acquired the expertise in high-volume manufacturing to help customers highly complex 3D scaling challenges across other device segments.
In foundry/logic, the adoption of 3D-like gate all around or nanosheet type structures introduces unique processing requirements. In the last earnings call, I highlighted the momentum of our latest conductor etch system, KIYO GX, which utilizes an innovative plasma pulsing capability to deliver superior, high aspect ratio etch results for nanosheet structures.
In the quarter, we saw additional application wins with KIYO at multiple foundry/logic customers. We are also seeing share gains with our new suite of selective etch products designed for ultra-high selectivity removal processes, previously performed using distance.
Related to the challenge of the back end of line scaling, we are taking new approaches to deposit lower K materials and deliver better interface control. New material duration schemes enabled us to win multiple 5-nanometer back end-of-line applications. And in the March quarter, we extended our wins to more advanced nodes as well.
In addition to device scaling, we remain equally focused on our customers' objectives to improve cost and operating efficiency in their fabs. You’ll recall, we announced our new Vantex dielectric etch process module on the Sense.i platform. Vantex on Sense.i delivers best-in-class etch technology and brings to market unique and innovative solutions to lower overall cost of ownership.
The Sense.i platform architecture increases wafer output per square meter of fab space. New RF power designs consume less energy to support cost and ESG roadmaps, and advanced equipment intelligence and self-maintenance capabilities minimize required on-site human intervention.
With semiconductor demand at unprecedented levels, these factors have become critical differentiators as customers look to cost effectively and sustain ramp capacity on advanced nodes. As a result, we continue to make solid progress on Sense.i adoption and leading customers.
Our focus on helping customers solve productivity and manufacturing challenges is also reflected in the excellent performance of our installed base business where we are seeing outstanding [ph] growth. CSBG revenue eclipsed $1.3 billion in the March quarter, yet another record. We are executing very well in this business. And as we sit here today, we are tracking ahead of the growth model that we shared with you at last year's Investors Day. All product lines within CSBG had record revenues in the quarter.
Our upgrades business is expected to roughly double over the two-year period ending in 2021. By enhancing productivity and extending installed base capability for multiple generations, our upgrades business plays an important part in our customers' cost reduction roadmaps.
In Reliant, we see specialty technologies continuing to grow in areas like CIS, power and RF devices. In spares, we successfully closed with a key customer, the single largest annual contract in the company's history, which includes commitments for critical leading etch parts.
And lastly, we are seeing great progress in services. Big data and equipment intelligence are playing an increasingly critical role in the operation of advanced semiconductor fabs. This quarter, we closed a multi-region data services license contract with a major memory manufacturer to provide enhanced tool data to enable their smart manufacturing roadmap.
Additionally, our services team completed the first year of a comprehensive multiyear equipment intelligence services contract at another major memory producer. System performance under this contract exceeded objectives, leading to a significant return on investment for the customer.
So, to conclude, we are in an environment where industry fundamentals continue to strengthen. The strategic relevance of semiconductors is reaching new heights and semiconductor capital equipment is well-positioned to benefit. Amid strong WFE spending, Lam is delivering great results and making foundational investments in new products and infrastructure to drive continued outperformance.
Thanks again for joining today and now here's Doug. Great. Thanks Tim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today during what I know is a busy earnings season. I hope you and your family is safe and healthy since we last spoke with you.
Lam delivered outstanding results for the March quarter, with record quarterly revenue and strong profitability metrics. For the quarter, our revenue and gross margin came in above the midpoint of our guidance, and both operating income and earnings per share were above the guidance range.
We've continued our excellence in execution, not only in delivering impressive financial results, but also in being our customers' most trusted partner. We delivered revenue for the March quarter of $3.85 billion at the high end of our guidance range, which was an increase of 11% from the -- quarter.
Our solid revenue performance was mainly due to an increase in foundry-related systems as well as record performance in our customer support business group, or CSBG, where we had increases in all parts of that business. Our customers' fabs are running at high utilization levels, which drives the need for consumption of spare parts and services.
First, let's focus on our systems revenue where we saw continued strength in the memory segment, which represented 62% of systems revenue in the March quarter. The NAND segment was 48% of our systems revenue compared with 51% in the prior quarter, with customers investing in higher 3D device layer -- and added capacity to address the overall broad demand for storage bids.
The March quarter NAND systems revenue amount reached a record level, again, demonstrating Lam's leadership position in the NAND segment. Customers were primarily investing in equipment for 96 and 128-layer class devices.
In DRAM, we had 14% of our March quarter systems revenue in this segment compared with 17% in the prior quarter. Year-end investments consisted of both conversion and capacity additions with concentration in the 1y, 1z, and 1-alpha nodes. We expect to continue to see healthy and prudent levels of investment in the overall memory segment in calendar year 2021.
We had our highest quarterly revenue level in the March quarter for the foundry segment, and it came in at 31% of our systems revenue compared with 26% in the quarter. We're seeing leading-edge investments focused on 5-nanometer as well as spending related to mature technology nodes required to meet higher demand for specialty or consumer-oriented integrated circuits.
And finally, logic and other contributed the remaining 7% of systems revenue in the March quarter, up slightly from the prior quarter level at 6%.
Let me now shift to the regional profile of our revenue. The China region came in at 32% of our total revenues, down slightly from 35% in the December quarter. The majority of the China spending this quarter was from domestic Chinese customers.
The Korea region was also strong for us in the March quarter, representing 31% of revenues, which is up 10 points from the prior quarter. And as Tim mentioned, we achieved another record quarter of revenue for our customer support business group, coming in at $1.3 billion, which is an increase of 13% from December and up over 50% versus the same quarter in 2020.
The growth we've seen in each of the subsegments of this business is a testament to the value we're providing to our customers for technology and productivity enhancements, as well as the strength of this market supported by our Reliant product line.
We're also supporting customers' requests for increasing spare parts purchases to support both higher equipment utilization and some level of inventory stocking. We expect continued strength in CSBG through the remainder of the year.
Let me now shift to profitability. March gross margin was 46.3%, generally in line with our expectations. And I'll remind you, as I always do, gross margin fluctuates quarter-to-quarter due to overall business levels, along with customer and product mix.
We do continue to incur higher freight and logistics costs because of the COVID environment, and we expect these costs will remain until we see a normalization of airfreight volumes.
Operating expenses for the March quarter were $567 million, slightly higher than the prior quarter, reflecting our commitment to manage expense levels, while we invest to grow the company.
We've prioritized our spending towards R&D, which represents over two-thirds of our operating expenses, enabling us to build on our deposition and etch leadership positions. Operating income exceeded $1.2 billion in the March quarter, with operating margin coming in over the guidance range at 31.6%.
Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 7.8%, which came in lower than we expected due to incremental deductions from equity compensation for annual investing that occurred during the quarter.
As we've discussed in the past, we will have fluctuations in the tax rate from quarter-to-quarter, and you should continue to expect the ongoing tax rate to be in the low teens level for the 2022 calendar year. I would mention, we continue to monitor potential tax changes that could come from the new administration in the United States.
Other income and expense was approximately $42 million in expense, which is lower than the prior quarter and lower than the typical run rate, primarily due to marketed items like foreign exchange and interest rates.
And as a reminder, beginning in the March quarter of last year, the benefits and costs of our employee deferred compensation plan are no longer mismatched in our non-GAAP results. The mismatch was $8 million for the March 2021 quarter, and you can see the details of this in the GAAP reconciliation table of our earnings release.
We paid $187 million in dividends and allocated over $900 million towards share repurchases, tracking nicely with our committed Lam capital return plans. Further buyback in the quarter went to a structured repurchase program, which was supplemented with open market repurchases.
Diluted earnings per share came in at $7.49 above the guidance range. This was the results of the higher revenue gross margin, as well as formality [ph] that I mentioned in the tax rate. Our diluted share balance was down from the December quarter level, coming in at 145 million shares, as we expected. The share count includes the dilutive impact of approximately 500,000 shares from the 2041 convertible notes. In addition mention is that late in the March quarter, we issued a redemption notice for the 20 41 convertible notes. As of March quarter end, we had approximately $17 million remaining on these notes. This redemption would retire the last of the convertible notes in our capital.
Let me shift to the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash, decreased slightly to $6 billion from $6.3 billion in the prior quarter. The decrease was attributed to the capital return activity, offset by the strong performance we had in the March quarter cash flows from operations, which came in at a record level of $0.2 billion.
Days sales outstanding decreased to 66 days in the March quarter from 76 that we saw in December. This improvement was driven by strong cash generation with the higher level of business, and as I alluded to last quarter, the timing of collections across the December and March quarters.
Inventory turns were flat with the prior quarter, coming in at 3.2 times. Given the overall demand strength we're seeing as well as our focus to mitigate potential supply chain disruptions, inventory turns will likely remain at these current levels for the foreseeable future. Non-cash expenses included approximately $56 million for equity compensation, $61 million for depreciation and $18 million for amortization. Capital expenditures for the March quarter were down slightly versus the December level, coming in at $90 million.
As I noted in our last earnings call, we're investing to support the expanding operations at our new Malaysia factory, our manufacturing facility in Ohio that's focused on critical spare parts and the upcoming Korea technology center. We expect to see somewhat higher levels of capital expenditures in 2021 as we support these critical growth initiatives.
The headcount level ending the March quarter was approximately 13,100 regular full-time employees. Resources have been added in our factories to meet the increased output levels in this robust business environment. Within this, we opportunistically bought out our Asian joint venture manufacturing facility that is focused on our Reliant product line. This added half of the growth in headcount that you saw in the quarter. Additionally, we've added field service and R&D personnel with a focus on delivering best-in-class technology services and solutions to our customers.
Now looking ahead, I'd like to provide you our non-GAAP guidance for the June 2021 quarter. We're expecting revenue of $4 billion, plus or minus $250 million, gross margin of 46.5%, plus or minus 1%, operating margin margins up 32%, plus or minus 1 percentage point; and finally, earnings per share of $7.50, plus or minus $0.50 based on a share of approximately 144 million shares.
So, in summary, I'm quite pleased with our operational execution, which is reflected in the strong financial performance of the company. We now see greater strength in WFE as we go through calendar 2021, with the second-half looking stronger than the first-half.
We are guiding to continuing record financial performance for the company, and we are well on the path to achievement of our growth objectives that we spoke to you about at our -- Investor Day in March of last year. I've personally never been so excited for the things the semiconductor industry is enabling, and I'm proud of the results Lam has continued to deliver enabling this industry.
That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Good afternoon, and congratulations on the strong results and execution. I assume that given the strong demand trends across leading edge and lagging edge, that the team has seen extended tools. Wondering if you can quantify, is the team already starting to book into the second-half of this year? And if I'm a customer that places an order today for one of your tools, when will this tool actually be producing wafers? Is it nine months from now, 12 months from now? Would appreciate any insights. Yes. Harlan, thanks for the question. Obviously, for a lot of reasons, we're not going to divulge our lead times on this call. But we will say that, clearly, what we said is unprecedented demand, and combining that with COVID impacts capacity is tight, and it has extended our lead times.
We would say our visibility into our future is quite good at this point, but we don't want to go into exactly how long it takes for a customer to order to get it and qualify it at this point for competitive reasons, ours and our customers. Yes. Appreciate that. If I think about the fundamental environment, right, if I look at your memory business and I look at your customers, so both NAND and DRAM pricing fundamentals continue to move higher, combination of strong demand, relatively disciplined supply spending.
In fact, relatively disciplined supply spending since the last week in 2018. Most of your customers are anticipating that DRAM and NAND bit demand will exceed its supply growth here in 2021. I know you guys do a pretty good job on the analytics side around supply and demand.
I'm just wondering how you see the supply/demand balance in memory, especially as we move through the back half of this year and factoring in the incrementally better WFE outlook that you outlined today. Yes I'll go ahead and make a couple of comments and then let Doug chime in with some of the specifics on the supply. Clearly, we've said even entering this year, we felt it was going to be a very good year for memory for a couple of reasons. One, DRAM had gone through a couple of years of very conservative spending. And so there was some pent-up demand there for spending both on technology and some capacity.
From a NAND perspective, we talked a lot about the increasing spend related to layer transitions that were going to be occurring this year. And so, we have seen that playing out. I think you combine that with, again, growing demand across many, many different end market segments and also the need to add capacity both in a greenfield perspective as well as conversions and that's led to an ongoing stronger outlook. We do model obviously bit supply and demand. I'll let Doug talk a little bit about what we're seeing there. Yes. Harlan, thanks for the question. Yes. We came through 2019 where spending was held pretty closely in check and even through a good chunk of 2020 and maybe all the way through 2020 for DRAM.
And when you look at the two years of investment there, exiting last year and you look at supply growth, it was below where longer-term demand growth was in both NAND and DRAM. And I think you saw that and are still seeing it in pricing.
And as a result, our customers respond -- we see them responding carefully, prudently is the way I like to describe it, consistent with where they see demand growth. And the investments we're starting to see increase somewhat in both NAND and DRAM are a result of that.
We continue to believe long-term NAND demand to be in the mid-high 30% in bit supply and not caught up of that yet, and that's why investment is up. Similarly, in DRAM, we think longer-term demand is in high teens, maybe approaching 20%. And as a result, the supply growth is being invested in to try to get caught up with that. That's really what we see going on. Thank you for the insights. Thanks, Harlan. Thanks, Harlan. Thank you. We'll take our next question from John Pitzer with Crédit Suisse. Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on the strong results. Tim, I want to talk a little bit about kind of market. Tim, in your prepared comments, you talked about your expectation for this being another market share gaining year for you. And at the Analyst Day a year ago, I think to your 2023 model, you guys had sort of embedded sort of 4% to 8% points of share in etch and dep.
I'm just kind of curious to what extent was that sort of time-sensitive versus volume-sensitive? And as WFE kind of gets ratcheted up here at a faster rate, do you expect share gain to happen more quickly?
And while you're on the topic of share, the perception on Wall Street is that you guys are extremely well positioned in the NAND market, but I think perhaps people are underestimating your positioning in kind of logic/foundry. Kind of curious, if you can talk about the areas outside of NAND where you feel most comfortable about share growth this year and going forward. Yes. Sure. John, I'll start this one. I think it's a great question. And I would actually say this, breaking it in this way of time versus volume [Technical Difficulty] where we already possess a very strong leadership position like 3D NAND, increased WFE volume helps with share gain immediately.
But that – but it's not just a volume story, because time progresses and transitions occur to greater numbers of layers. We actually see both more equipment needing to be purchased to deposit and etch those thicker stacks, but also new applications that get created that, again, expand our SAM, and with time, even build on a really strong NAND position. So there's kind of an element to both volume and time in there.
On foundry/logic, a little bit of the same, although, I think most people know that we've laid out a story of how some of the technical inflections really do create new opportunities for Lam to introduce new products, gain share and build a strong position in foundry/logic.
I would say there, there definitely is a time element in that we need technology transitions to occur. You need to go from 7 to 5 and 5 to 3 and, ultimately, 3 to 2, because we're focused on catching the new applications that are being created by the most difficult technical challenges.
And so in my prepared remarks, I talked about things like nanosheets, gate all around, the 3D-like inflections that are occurring. And those -- there's a time element. They have to -- they -- those nodes have to ramp, and they're not ramping just yet. We talked about EUV and our new dry resist process, again, a great opportunity for Lam to enter into a space that's - in foundry/logic that we just haven't been in up to this point, but we -- those are future node-looking opportunities for Lam over the next several years.
And so, again, I think that's why what you hear from us is confidence that we benefit from the strong environment we're in now, but we're laying the foundation for an even stronger future as time evolves. That’s helpful. Thank you. Thanks, John. Thanks, John. Thank you. We'll take our next question from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to talk about the customer service business a little bit. Can you give us some idea of how much of the strength in the quarter -- coming from the Reliant mature node tool set? I get the idea that there's more mature node capacity need right now. Do you feel like that is a long-term trend? Is that sustainable?
And maybe if you could give us some -- any further color on the amount of the CSBG group that's actually coming from upgrades. And I guess the same question, are there -- is there more like a onetime element to that? Or do you think the run rate of what we're seeing right now is a sustainable driver for that business going forward? Yes. Stacy, thanks for the question. Maybe I'll take this and let Tim add on afterwards. I think both Tim and I said in our script, all components of BG business delivered record performance last quarter. You're right about the Reliant product line, very much focused on maybe trailing etch 28-nanometer and above nodes, another record. I think we're printing double-digit number of quarters where we've delivered records there because of the things you're referencing or referring to.
Upgrades were very strong, which is always a high ROI for the customers to get increased capability from the installed base. Spares were very strong. Think of that as being driven by utilization in the industry, broadly speaking. Utilizations are very high. I see our customers trying to build a little bit of inventory in spares similar to what we're doing with our own inventory because of concerns about different supply chain disruptions.
So -- and then service. Service also correlates with utilization in the industry. So honestly, when you think about what's going on in the totality of CSBG, $1.3 billion, up 50% from a year ago is hitting on all four cylinders that I just mentioned. And each of them have their own unique tailwinds that are driving the business. Yes. I think, service wise… Maybe just -- sorry, go ahead, Stacy. No, no. Please go ahead. No, I was just going to add on. I think to your point about the sustainability of upgrades, I think the one key point is that we've said the installed base grows every year. And so really, that is our opportunity. So we -- naturally, by Lam shipping like in a year like this, so many new systems out into the field, our SAM expands for upgrades every single year. And so we really do think that through innovation and coming up with ideas for how the customers extend the capabilities of the tools and improve productivity, it's in our hands to continue to deliver greater revenue capture from every one of those tools that's out in that installed base and so I think that's quite sustainable.
And then to your point of the lagging edge, clearly, there's a very strong demand at this point. And kind of to the first question about capacity constraints and lead times, that problem doesn't get solved probably in a very short order of time. And when I think about sustainability there, it goes to this point I made in my talk about it's about semiconductor content in everything, enabling new functionality, and many of those items are making great use of mature technologies. So, we've seen that business just grow quarter after quarter after quarter, expanding with the overall market. So, I think both have a strong sustainability component to their revenues. Do you think it would be possible to give us some rough split of how the customer service business breaks up right now between those four categories, upgrades, repairs, and services? We haven't quantified it, and I'm not going to now. I think the color we have given is the spare parts piece of it is the largest component, but we haven't quantified it. Got it. Thank you very much guys. Thank you. Thank you. We'll take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Thanks a lot. Actually, I had two. I guess the first one, Doug, obviously, CSBG is running like roughly 15% above your 2020, and you gave that a little bit over a year ago. So, I guess, the first question is sort of what did you under appreciate in that model a year ago? I know that WFE and your systems business has really just taken off, and maybe that's the answer that you're still growing double the installed base, and that's just taken off more than you thought. And then I had a second question as well. Yes. I mean Tim alluded to chamber account. Clearly, it's been a very strong year and so chamber account is higher than I think I would have thought a year ago. Industry -- probably stronger than I would have expected a year ago as well. And upgrades is probably benefiting from that also, Tim. So there's probably an aspect of it in each of the segments. And yes, we are certainly ahead of the model that we gave you a year ago. I'm not ready to update the model. But clearly, we're ahead of where that model is. Yes. Okay. Thanks. And then also, I keep getting a lot of questions on NAND and your business, and you guys do a great job mapping the WFE back to bits. And my math says we're running close to $5 billion a quarter in NAND WFE right now, and it sounds like you think that goes up into the back half of the year.
So, if that's right, and then I tie it back to your comments that you mapped kind of $15 billion a year to drive mid-30s bit growth, and then I think you said $350 million for each 100 basis points beyond that, that would sort of scale up to like 45% bit growth, maybe as high as 50% just on like a run rate basis. So, I keep getting pinged on that from people asking about that. So, can you sort of tie those numbers back? Thanks. I don't know if I can do all the math that you just asked on the call, Tim. I mean investment ebbs and flows, ebbs and flows in each of the end markets flows in NAND. We did say we expect the second-half to be stronger investments in all aspects of the market, including NAND.
Yes, it's up this year from where it was last year. It's getting caught up with kind of the under-investment that we saw in 2019. To a certain extent, you're still seeing very strong pricing. And as a result, people are investing, trying to get caught up with where demand is, honestly.
And it'll ebb and flow. It won't go up every single quarter. We see a very strong investment this year, and I think it's going to continue in the long term to be very strong, right? But I can't do all the math that you just asked, sitting here on the call. I'd be happy to follow up with you offline, though. Thanks, Doug. Cool. Thanks. Yes. Thanks, Tim. Thank you. We'll take our next question from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a very strong results. I have two, one is the short term and one is the long-term question. The short-term question for Doug is, is there a way you can quantify how your second-half revenue is going to trend with the first-half? Or do you think CSBG revenues would outperform system revenues in calendar 2021? And then, I had a follow-up for Tim. Krish, did you say second-half earnings? I didn't quite catch. Second-half revenues versus first-half revenues, and would CSBG be greater than system revenue growth this year? Yes. Krish, we guide one quarter at a time, and then we give you color about what we see for the year. And I'll remind you what we tried to say. We see WFE in the second quarter, which is good for the trajectory of our business. So you can read into that what you think for our revenues, but WFE is stronger is going to be a good thing for us.
We just guided June up to $4 billion. So that's as much as I'm going to give you on the revenue side. So, yes, it's been like a pretty strong year, and we see the second-half spending stronger than the first-half across all of WFE.
And what I say -- yes, Krish, what I said on CSBG is, I expect it to be a strong year for CSBG, a continued strong -- give you a hard number on it, but all the tailwinds that I described look like they're continuing. Fair enough. Thanks. And then just a follow-up for Tim, a longer-term question. When you look at like some of the upcoming technologies like gate all around, it looks like selective removal etch would be important in addition to Epi. So I'm kind of curious, how is Lam positioned for gate all around. And is there a way you can quantify the dollar or revenue opportunity for Lam? No, I don't think there's a way we can do that. But what we've said is that Lam SAM expands at every technology node. And clearly, gate all around is the map.
What we tried to point out is, again, what's -- what is sort of the embodiment of our product and technology strategies to identify new applications, new requirements that emerge when device technology changes, when architectures change and ensure that Lam is positioned early for those with products and with our customers, so that when the change happens, we're in a great position to win those.
We've given you a few examples, not all of the examples, but I think that, that's -- that's again, it's just to give you a sense that when these inflections occur, we're -- we have a track record of doing quite well. It's also why we keep pointing back.
It's the same strategy we executed through the 3D NAND inflection. And ultimately, over time, it's built for us an incredible business. And so, I think, gate all-around is coming as an opportunity for us in that way.
We pointed out EUV and the ultimate changes in the way patterning is done and what we see anyway for the opportunity for Driver Assist is another, while not gate-all-around focused, it's kind of at the same technology node where those changes occur. So we see promise in foundry/logic for our future. Okay. Thanks. Thanks all. Thanks, Krish. Thank you. We'll take our next question from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Yes. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question, you talked about second-half WFE higher than first-half. Curious what magnitude of upside this could support versus simply just being sold out and pushing demand into the first-half of 2022. And as part of that, can you speak to the timing of ramping capacity in Malaysia and bringing more resources on for you guys? Okay. C.J., let me get it go on this one. Clearly, what we've said is that capacity is tight. And so the very first question, I probably could have even added. If a customer would order a tool today, when they get it, I won't divulge, but I mean, clearly, it will not be adding to qualified capacity this year. I mean that, sort of, gives you some sense of where lead times and such are.
But we do have a couple of events coming in the second-half of the year that are meaningful for us, and that is expansion of our Asian manufacturing facilities. Doug talked about the buyout of our JV in Taiwan as an opportunity for us to take a little bit more control for that entity and continue ramping. And Malaysia is a second-half 2021 story for us in terms of its ramp.
And so we are confident in long-term capacity needs for the company, and we want to be able to support and return lead time is back towards more historical levels for the company. And as I said, they're extended now. Part of this capacity expansion is to return those more to normal as we get towards the end of the year. Very helpful. And as a quick follow-up, for domestic China revenues, was that primarily manned and as you able to obtain a license for SMIC yet? C.J., demand in local China customer base, broad-based. Trailing etch foundry, a little bit of DRAM, a little bit in NAND. As to license for our large foundry customer in China, no update. We're still waiting to hear back from the government. Great. Thank you. Thanks C.J. Thank you. We'll take our next question from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on the strong results. Doug, I wanted to follow-up on China. I guess I've been a little bit surprised how long your China business has been over the past quarter or two despite some of the restrictions placed on SMIC. What's been the offset to the upside in your China business? You just talked about broad-based demand, but did anything stand out over the past quarter or two? And how are you thinking about calendar 2021 local China WFE on a year-over-year basis? And then I've got a quick follow-up. Yes. Sure. I'll take a crack at it. I mean, it's broad-based. First thing, I'll remind you that when you see our regional revenue, it's a ship to fab location. So it's -- there's a balance between local China and global multinationals taking equipment at their -- in their fabs in China. I did say that the majority, more than half last quarter were the local Chinese customers. The quarter before, in the December quarter, it was the other way around. It was more MMC-oriented. So it's pretty broad.
And it's -- then relative to the local China component of it, it's a broad set of customers. Some of you probably know, but I would tell you, there's a long tail of smaller customers that maybe you're just getting to know or maybe you don't know yet. So, it's a broad set of people investing. And thinking about WFE from local China this year, it's up from last year. It's growing across laying edge, logic nodes, and memory. Got it. And then as a quick follow-up, on CSBG, Doug, you mentioned the long-term growth outlook there is now better to what you presented last year at your Analyst Day. Is that simply a function of the 2021 base being higher? Or has something changed structurally or fundamentally in CSBG? You talked about the chamber account obviously being higher and utilization rates being higher, but anything kind of structural that has changed over the past 12 months? Thank you. No, I wouldn't point anything structural. It's -- we're shipping more chamber, so that’s some bigger opportunity from I guess I think of an available market standpoint and its pieces of all four components in CSBG. Thank you. Thank you. We'll take our next question from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Great. Thank you. May I follow-up on that last question? Doug, you made the comment that you can't see the services business. You'd be very surprised to see it not grow each year. And obviously, the chamber count growing is a nice kind of lead indicator. But when you talk about a lot of the drivers of higher utilization, people building inventory of spares, things like that, that are sort of a function of this very tight supply environment that we're in, do you see those things turning into headwinds next year? And I mean it still seems like you're likely to grow given the growth in chamber count. But the outperformance versus chamber count, can that continue beyond this kind of very strong near-term environment? No, I don't have any different view of the business, Joe. I have a hard time seeing it not growing every year. It doesn't mean it's going to grow every single quarter, but we're shipping a lot of chambers this year, which is the momentum of the business going into next year and beyond. Not every component of it may grow every year, but we're feeling really good about where it's going. And like I said, the chamber count is an important metric to think about future business opportunity. And Joe, if -- I don't know if you remember, but at our Investor Day, we showed an objective we had about revenue capture for chamber as well. And so I pointed out in my comments a couple of places we're making progress. It is about trying to develop some of these data and equipment intelligence, services offerings, also productivity upgrades.
Clearly, customers are focused on trying to get as much output out of existing installed base as they can, and those types of services and upgrades help them do that. And in that way, as chamber count grows, we're also expanding SAM for those. So, that's another reason why we believe year-on-year, we can continue to grow that installed base business. Great. Thank you. Thanks Joe. Thank you. We'll take our next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Thanks for taking my question. I had two as well. First on the NAND side, I was hoping you could give us a sense for how much of the market right now is -- versus greenfield deployments? And how does that compare to what it was last year? And does this ratio impact the benefit you can derive from the market? Like does the spending intensity change, right, depending on whether there is more conversion versus greenfield? Yes. Vivek, I'll take that one first and let Doug comment. But fundamentally, there is -- and I said this on our last call, our view for this year is a bit more greenfield investment this year than last year.
There's also more conversion investment as well. So the overall market is up. But there is an important difference in terms of the capital intensity per bit in the greenfield, which is higher. Conversions are more efficient.
But what's unique for Lam is those conversions, our share -- our capture of the WFE is much higher in the conversions. And so, while we really do sell the same things in both instances, in the conversion, it's mostly etch and deposition equipment that's required to continue to build those taller stacks. And so we do very well there.
So this year, it's a blend of both. But I think that, again, it's one of the reasons why, as we look going forward, every tool that gets installed for a greenfield, ultimately, as customers transition to higher layer counts, those tools will ultimately need to be upgraded and move forward through that next layer count. And that means our opportunity for the installed base business just continues to grow, the more fabs ultimately that we built for NAND. All right. Very helpful, Tim. And for my second question, if I take a longer-term view of WFE, what we have seen is that, historically, it will grow for two, at most three, and then it'll kind of consolidate there for a few years. And then, it'll take another big step-up.
When I look at the WFE outlook for this year, this will be the second year of very strong growth. How do you think about WFE intensity from these levels? And when do you think we should start to bake in any incremental benefits from the regionalization or increased domestic manufacturing headlines that we see in U.S. and Europe? Yes. It's a great question, and we were -- there's no doubt when you have strong years, people start wondering when you'll get a year of the strong. We haven't talked about whether 2022 is up or -- but we have said, we feel we are in a strong multiyear environment.
We think it's too early to really know how all these factors I talked about play out in any given year. But over the longer term, we see these new technologies and increasing content, we definitely know increasing complexity. You're hearing that from all of our customers. Increasing complexity is increasing equipment capital intensity.
And then your regional comment, another bit of a wildcard, but definitely positive, given everything that is going on that you're seeing in chip shortages and all the discussions there. So I think those items, they will play out over a multiyear period.
Recent -- we're kind of aligned with recent things we've read in the media that say, chip shortages don't get solved in 2021. Regional capacity investment ambitions don't get solved in just a couple of year period. These are multi-year trends that we think are tailwinds for semiconductor capital equipment. Thank you, Tim. Thanks, Vivek. Thank you. We'll take our next question from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Hi, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just I want to ask specifically an analysis of DRAM market, it's been an undersupply. You haven't seen kind of any company, you really see a big uptick. Just the fact, that is what's going on there and if you see any uptick as you look in the back half of the second year.
And then just for Doug, just when you laid out your long-term targets, obviously, a $75 billion WFE is higher than that. You're dealing with higher shipping costs. But just a perspective on, I don't know when you're going to be able to sell the shipping cost or perspective on getting that margin back from the 33% to 34% target that you laid out? Yes. So you really -- you've got two questions here, Blayne, what's going on DRAM and then what's going on the target model. I'll take a cut at both and then let Tim comment on either one.
Yes, we see -- DRAM investment, when I look at it, it's a pretty consolidated set of customers. And I just view them prudently managing capacity, prudently managing where they see pricing, prudently managing how they bring capacity online and paying attention to profitability is really what I see going on. And so that's why when we look at this year, the first-half, DRAM still is fairly muted in terms of level of investment, and you see it ticking up a little bit in the second-half as the industry tries to bring supply closer to where demand is. It's just in a pretty healthy place is how I see it. And yes, that's all -- that's what I get there.
Relative to the long-term model, a couple of things to think about. First on the logistics costs. We're going to be dealing with elevated logistics costs until global airfreight gets back to a more normalized level. I don't know when that's going to happen. I think it's going to require some level of consumer travel again because a lot of stuff flies around in the belly of commercial aircraft. And so I'm optimistic it gets progressively better, but we're still seeing headwinds for the foreseeable future.
Then relative to the financial model getting at slightly higher profitability, first, I feel great about where we just guided, right, 32% operating income at the midpoint; that would be the second highest level of profitability the company has generated in its 40-plus-year history. So I'm feeling good about what's going on there. There's a time component to the profitability as well, which has to do with some of the things that we talked about on the call today, ramping a factory in Asia -- in the Asia regions where cost structure is a little bit better, dealing with those freight logistics costs. I still feel really good about attaining that financial model. And I think actually, you're seeing demonstration of it this year from us already.
I don't know, Tim, if you want to add anything. Yes. No, I think the only thing I would add is, clearly to echo Doug's comment, we're extremely happy with the 32% guide. And in the same vein, we're investing a lot for our future. I mean, Doug mentioned the Malaysia factory, which will help, new Korea technology center coming up, put us closer to our customers, accelerate solutions, bolster our opportunities per share gain across both memory and foundry/logic, new products that are coming out. I mean, I can't remember a time when Lam has had more new products coming out, really focused on key technology inflections across all device segments. And so we're very happy, we're delivering these financial results and making these investments that we think make us much stronger going forward. Thanks, Doug. Thanks Blayne. Excuse me, Operator, we have time for one more question please. Thank you. We'll take our last question from Weston Twigg with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Hi, thanks for taking my question. First, I just wanted to ask a follow-up on C.J.'s question around your revenue capacity capability in the back half of the year. It sounds like it maxed out in terms of your system revenue heading into the June quarter, and it loosens up a little bit. But can you give us a feel for what that peak could be? Is it $2.8 billion? Is it $3 billion just from, sort of, boundary in terms of what you're limited by -- from a revenue perspective? Yes. Weston, I'm going to quantify for you, but we're making investments across all of the factory network. We talked about taking ownership of a Taiwan factory. We talked about ramping a new factory in Malaysia. We're trying to squeeze incremental capacity out of what the other existing locations to try to get those lead-times back to a more normalized level that Tim was referencing. And so as we do those things, our capability will get bigger. I'm not going to quantify it for you, but we're working on all of that stuff. Okay. So, it just sounds like -- as long as we think about a gradual improvement over time, we should be -- and don't get too crazy, which should be in the ballpark. The other question I have is just in terms of revenue growth drivers. And wondering if you could just give us a feel for the rate of growth of your systems revenue that's driven by 10-nanometer and below in logic versus some of the older nodes where you're also seeing pretty good growth. Is the rate similar? Or are you saying you're still seeing quite a bit faster growth at the leading edge, which is what we would typically expect? The majority of the spending in foundry and logic is at those leading edge nodes. Even though there's a broad-based set of investment occurring less because of the capital intensity at the leading edge node, that's usually what drives a lot of what's going on. Okay, that’s what I would expect. Perfect. That’s helpful. Thank you. Thanks Wes. Thank you. I'll turn it back to management for closing remarks. Thank you, operator and thank you all for joining our call today. We appreciate your time. This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation.

The quarter came in well above expectations with record revenues of $4.15 billion and earnings per share of $8.09. We also generated record cash from operations in the quarter of $1.4 billion.
The June quarter marked the end of Lam's fiscal year, and despite a challenging operating environment, we delivered the highest revenue in the company's history. Compared to the prior fiscal year, revenues grew more than 45% to $14.6 billion. Earnings per share increased at an even faster pace to a record $27.25 in fiscal year 2021, more than 70% higher than in fiscal year 2020. The demand environment for semiconductor equipment remains strong. And we now see wafer fabrication equipment spending in calendar 2021 trending above $80 billion.
While absolute WFE spending levels have risen to new highs, we remain confident in the health and sustainability of the industry at these levels. Wafer fab equipment spending as a percentage of semiconductor industry operating profit remains within historical ranges, and semiconductors continue to enable critical technology transformations such as AI, 5G, high performance computing and IoT.
We believe, robust semiconductor demand, rising device manufacturing complexity, and strategic regional investments are powerful drivers for multi-year WFE spending. By device segments, we see strength across NAND, DRAM and Foundry/Logic in calendar 2021.
Against the backdrop of broad demand, increasing device manufacturing complexity plays well to Lam's strength in critical applications, and continues to create new growth opportunities. Looking at the past five years, as manufacturing complexity increased in NAND with the transition to 3D, Lam gained over six points of share of WFE in this segment, and leads the next closest supplier by about eight points of customer spend.
In the June quarter, we secured another win for a critical deposition application, and are now the tool of record for all NAND manufacturers for this process. Instrumental to our success has been the differentiation afforded by our quad station chamber design. Our multi station architecture refined over many years, allows us to use sequential processing to precisely tailor film properties to meet the needs of next generation devices without compromising the productivity required for high volume NAND, DRAM and Foundry/Logic manufacturing.
Another example where we believe we are well-positioned to benefit from rising complexity is through our enablement of higher quality surface conditioning. Surface properties have been shown to greatly impact device performance. And existing surface preparation methods are in many cases insufficient to meet the stricter requirements for new materials, and tighter dimensional control at advanced nodes.
For the Foundry/Logic segment, we recently introduced a range of novel, selective edge strip and surface treatment solutions that use our ultra-high selectivity, zero damage process capability to remove unwanted materials with minimal impact to other layers. We are gaining significant momentum with this new approach, with multiple Lam tools selected by a large customer in the June quarter, as tool of record for leading-edge applications. We plan to share more details on this innovation in the near future.
Additional opportunities for Lam are being driven by the need for higher pattern fidelity, as Foundry/Logic pitch tolerance is tightened. For extremely small features, the relationship between change in resistance to change in dimension is exponential, therefore necessitating an extreme level of precision in device fabrication and advanced nodes.
Even small variations in pattern roughness can degrade RC and transistor speed. In response, we have developed edge solutions such as our RF plasma pulsing capability to reduce line roughness by up to 30%. This technology has proven to be a key enabler for many critical edge applications. And when combined with our proprietary uniformity and RF power solutions, has helped Lam maintain our overall market-leading position in multi patterning edge. As the industry transitions to even more demanding EUV patterning, we are seeing success applying these technology solutions to win new EUV patterning steps.
Solving complex scaling challenges including transitions to 3D structures in Foundry/Logic and DRAM will not be accomplished without deeper collaboration across the ecosystem. Our customers are increasingly highlighting the need for closer partnerships with the equipment industry, to meet their overall device performance and cost roadmaps.
As a result, we continue to expand R&D investments closer to customers, with the aim of accelerating new application development, shortening cycles of learning and strengthening our understanding of the customer's most difficult problems.
In addition to these regional R&D investments, I am pleased to announce that we recently shipped our first modules from our new Malaysia factory. This new facility adds resiliency to our global manufacturing network, creates capability closer to key customers and supply chain partners, and provides us with urgently needed capacity to support our continuing growth. I would like to acknowledge the tremendous efforts of the Lam employees and partners that completed the Malaysia project on time, despite the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.
In our customer support business, June quarter revenue growth again outpaced growth in chamber count. Our service upgrades and reliant businesses all delivered record quarters. Reliant has now shown growth for 10 consecutive quarters, driven by strong investments in power, CIS and non-leading edge foundry. We achieved in the quarter a key edge penetration, and one of the top 5G RF providers, exhibiting our technical leadership in this space. Also, the spares team executed a major contract and a key customer in Asia, which secures a stream of revenue from our installed base.
While, quarter-on-quarter CSPG growth rates can vary based on customer investment patterns, we are very well-positioned to deliver strong calendar year growth with a portfolio of products and services focused on our customers' operational success. We are increasing the productivity of our customers tools and extending the life of their equipment, which contributes to lowering the overall environmental impact of semiconductor manufacturing.
On the topic of sustainability, I would like to share a few highlights for the company. In June, we released our annual environmental, social and governance report. I am very proud of our organization's efforts last year to support the needs of the communities in which we work and live, to keep our employees safe to the COVID-19 pandemic and to advance inclusion and diversity across our global workplace.
This year's report introduced our goals of operating on 100% renewable energy by 2030, and achieving carbon net zero by 2050. We are driving innovations in product and process solutions in support of our sustainability objectives. For instance, our new Sense.i etch platform improves power efficiency, and requires less aluminum raw material for tool construction. Our new drivers this technology uses five to 10 times less chemistry, and two times less energy than the current process of record.
Our parts cleaning, repair, refurbishment, and recoding services are enabling more reuse and lessening waste. These solutions drive sustainability and make Lam products more competitive in the marketplace. I encourage you to check out our report on our website to learn more.
So to wrap up, we had an outstanding quarter and fiscal year. Most importantly, as we look to the future, we see rising device complexity and continuing transitions to 3D architectures driving growth of the Lam.
Thank you all for listening today. Now here's Doug. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today on what I know is a very busy earning season. As the world continues to face challenges with the pandemic, I hope you and your families have been safe and healthy since we last spoke with you.
Lam continued to deliver outstanding performance with record quarterly revenue, operating income and earnings per share in the June 2021 quarter. Our revenue, gross margin and operating income came in at or above the midpoint of our guidance, and earnings per share were above our guidance range. We're extremely pleased with our operational execution. And we thank all of our customers, suppliers and employees for their dedication and support.
Our revenue for the June quarter was $4.15 billion, represented an increase of 8% from the March quarter. We had record revenue in both our systems and our customer support business group.
Now I'll turn to the details on systems revenue. The memory segment continues to be an area of strength for Lam and represented 59% of systems revenue in the June quarter. The NAND segment concentration was essentially flat with the prior quarter at 49% of our systems revenue, and again hit another record level in terms of revenue dollars. We saw customer investments in both capacity ads and conversions with spending primarily on 128 layer class devices.
In the DRAM segment, we had 10% of our June quarter systems revenue versus 14% in the prior quarter. The DRAM investments were concentrated mainly in the 1z and 1-alpha nodes. And I would just mention, we do see DRAM spending strengthening into the second-half of this year.
For the Foundry segment, we had our second consecutive quarter of record revenues, coming in at 35% of our June systems revenue, as compared with 31% in the March quarter. Foundry spending is occurring in both leading-edge and mature technologies to meet the end demand for various market drivers like AI, 5G in gaming, as well as specialty chips needed for things like IoT, image sensors and power devices. And finally, logic and other contributed the remaining 6% of systems revenue in the June quarter, which was essentially flat to the prior quarter percentage.
Now, looking at the regional profile of our total revenue, the China region came in at 37% of our total revenues, up from 32% in the March quarter. The spending profile for the China region was generally balanced between the domestic and multinational customers with their fabs that are located in China.
The Korea region also continued to be very strong in the June quarter, representing 30% of revenues. CSPG which is our installed base business came in at nearly $1.4 billion, which as I noted is another high point for this group. The revenue level is an increase of 6% from the March quarter and 49% higher than the same quarter in 2020. All of the sub segments of this business are delivering excellent performance.
The reliant product line, that serves specialty market, upgrades where we're extending the life of our customers tools, as well as spares and service, that are supporting the high industry utilizations. All sub segments strongly contributed in the quarter.
So let me shift to profitability, June quarter gross margin was 46.5%, right at the midpoint of the guided range. I'll remind you that our gross margins fluctuate quarter-to-quarter due to overall business levels, along with customer and product mix.
I would mention there continues to be elevated air freight and logistics costs due to the COVID environment impacting us in the current quarter, which are also reflected in the September quarter guidance.
Operating expenses for June were $574 million, slightly higher than the prior quarter. You may note in our earnings release, that we did incur a charge during the quarter of approximately $6 million related to an asset impairment of the product line that we're shutting down. This charge was excluded from our non-GAAP operating expenses.
We've demonstrated our ability to scale a company profitably, as we've continued to decrease operating expenses as a percent of revenue. I'll also note that we've continued to prioritize R&D spending to ensure that we have the resources to continue to build on our technically differentiated leadership positions, and we've maintained an emphasis on R&D spending, and it continues to represent approximately two-thirds of our operating expenses.
June quarter operating margin showed solid performance coming in over the midpoint of our guidance range at 32.6%, reflecting strong gross margin and operating expense management. This operating income percentage represents an all-time high watermark for Lam Research.
Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 12.6%, generally in line with our expectations. As we’ve noted in prior call, our tax rate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. We expect the ongoing tax rate to be in the low teens level for the 2021 calendar year. And I would just mention, we're continuing to monitor potential tax changes that are under discussion in the current United States Administration.
Other income and expense was approximately $23 million in expense, which is lower than the prior quarter as a result of a $30 million market gain in one of our venture capital investments.
As we previously noted, OI&E is subject to market related volatility that could cause a difference from any typical run rate. And also just to remind you, beginning in the March quarter of 2020, the benefits and costs of our employee deferred compensation plan are no longer mismatched in our non-GAAP results. This mismatch was $17 million for the June 2021 quarter. And if you're interested you can see the details in the GAAP reconciliation tables in the earnings release.
Now, let me shift to capital return, we paid $185 million in dividends and allocated $440 million towards share buyback. This is in line with our long-term capital return plans of 75% to 100% of our free cash flow.
Earnings per share came in at $8.09, above the guidance range. The outperformance is due to the higher revenue and expense management, as well as the favorability, I noted in OI&E. The diluted share count balance was down slightly from the March quarter level coming in at 144 million shares. During the June quarter, we redeemed the remaining 2041 convertible notes, which I'm happy to tell you is the less convert that was in our capital structure.
Let me shift to the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash totaled $6 billion, which is flat with the prior quarter. We had record performance in the June quarter for cash flows from operations, which came in at $1.4 billion.
During the quarter, our cash generation was deployed the pay down of $800 million of senior notes that were due in June, as well as cash outlays for the capital return activities that I mentioned.
Day sales outstanding was flat to the March quarter at 66-days. Inventory turns were up slightly from the prior quarter level coming in at 3.3 times. June quarter non-cash expenses included approximately $56 million for equity compensation, $60 million for depreciation and $18 million for amortization.
We're investing in increasing our capacity and support of customers. And as a result, capital expenditures for the June quarter were up from the March level and came in at $105 million. We have investments occurring around the globe with our new Malaysia factory, which is formally opening this quarter, expansion in our U.S. critical spare parts facility in Ohio, and R&D investments in our new Korean lab facility.
We expect to see somewhat elevated levels of capital expenditures in the remainder of calendar year 2021, as we support these growth initiatives. The headcount level ending June quarter was approximately 14,100 regular full time employees. Resources have been added in our factories and in the field, to meet the increased output levels and to support customers in their technology evaluations, as well as tool installation requirements.
My final commentary to touch on for the June quarter is a follow-up in the ESG space, which obviously is strategically important for Lam Research. In June, we extended and upsized our revolving credit facility to $1.5 billion. We transitioned this facility to a sustainability linked revolver, which includes a pricing structure that is linked to certain performance metrics for energy savings, and employee safety.
In addition to the ESG focus areas that Tim noted, this credit facility is further demonstration of our commitment to integrate ESG principles into all aspects of how we operate as a company.
So now looking ahead, I'd like to provide our non-GAAP guidance for the September 2021 quarter. We're expecting revenue of $4.3 billion, plus or minus $250 million. Gross margin of 46%, plus or minus one percentage point. Operating margins of 32%, plus or minus one percentage point. And finally earnings per share of $8.10, plus or minus $0.50, based on a share count of approximately 143 million shares.
We continue to maintain a widened revenue range, as we work to mitigate ongoing output challenges in our global supply chain. These supply chain challenges are also driving a modest headwind in our guided gross margin. Customer demand continues to look strong in the second-half of 2021 as well as into next year.
Lam is operating at record levels of financial performance, as a result of the tireless efforts of our operational organizations and supply chain partners. We continue to progress on our longer-term share gain objectives, with investments in new platforms like Sense.i and dry resist. We'd like to thank the company for rising to the challenge and delivering on these objectives.
Operator, that concludes my prepared remarks. Tim and I would now like to open up the call for questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Yeah, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Tim, notwithstanding your comments and your prepared commentary about still feeling comfortable with the industry is spending at healthy levels. We're also here it's all too seductive to kind of look at where your NAND quarterly revenue run rate is today, and go back and look at where that peaked in ’18 to see that its higher. And I guess maybe you can help us out if you think about just the overall growth in complexity of NAND since ’18, and I guess more importantly, your market share gains. How do we look at this number the June quarter and compare it to sort of a 1.287 you did in the March ‘18 quarter? Yeah, it's obviously a question that we spend a lot of time thinking about. And I think you've hit on the most important point, which is what does it meant for Lam to see not only the transition to 3D, which I gave some elements of how it changed our position in terms of share of WFE over the last five years. That was my comment over six points of share gain of WFE.
But more importantly, what are we doing going forward to ensure kind of durability in this business, meaning defending the positions we've worked hard to gain, but also benefiting from the complexity that's occurring because of layer scaling. And that's really our product focus. And so maybe to talk about complexity, number of layers increasing clearly is driving a strong demand for the tools that deposit those film stacks, etch the holes in those film stacks, and backfill them with the metallization. Those are the strongest positions Lam has within NAND. And we feel extremely good about there our defensibility of those positions.
But even those are seeing changes. And so it's different materials, for instance, to reduce line resistance. We're seeing new opportunities for new tools. We talked about the vector DT dealing with stress issues as layer count increase. Those things didn't exist, just that application didn't exist just years ago. We're seeing the transition to ALV gapfill again, that application did not exist as an ALB film, and therefore not within Lam's wheelhouse at the last peak.
And so, not only have we grown our existing positions, because the more layers, we've actually added more critical steps to the process. And I think it bodes well. At every peak, our goal is to expand our serve market in a way that if we come out stronger and bigger peak to peak. That's helpful. And if I could follow-up, Doug, in your commentary, you talked about expectation for DRAM growth to accelerate from here. I think year-to-date, you guys are up about 13% versus the same period last year. You've had guys like ASML talk about DRAM CapEx being up as much as 60% for them. Now, clearly, they're benefiting from some easy assertion, but any numbers you can put around by how big of an acceleration do you expect in the back-half of the year? Yeah, John, I'm not going to quantify it, because I never do when we're looking in the on segments, but it's going to grow nicely in the second-half. It's going to grow nicely because of our patterning positions. And, I feel really good about the trajectory when I look into the second-half for DRAM. It's going to be a good second-half. Let's leave it at that. Perfect. Thanks, guys. Thanks, John. Thank you. We'll take our next question from C.J. Muse of Evercore. Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question on gross margins. Doug, can you give us a little more granularity on what's driving the headwind sequentially? And I guess, as part of that, would love to hear how we should be thinking about the ramp of Malaysia capacity and the impact of gross margins over time? Thanks for the question, C.J., I expected this one pretty quickly in the call. Listen, when I look out over the next quarter there's challenges in the supply chain. And some of those challenges as we work to mitigate them requires incremental spending. When I look at what happened in June and what happened in September, maybe the incremental downtick in gross margin is primarily a result of that.
So that's one thing to kind of put in the quiver there a little bit to think about, as we go forward. We'll work our way through that. It'll get better over time. It'll also get better over time, as you rightly asked about as we ramp Malaysia now, right now, when I look at Malaysia in the September quarter, it's not a benefit to gross margin, because we're too early in the ramp of that facility. You got the fixed cost sitting there and you got startup costs. So that actually is driving a little bit of a headwind right now too. And over time, that headwind will shift to a tailwind as we get the benefit of the Asia-based cost structure.
So, I look forward. We've got trajectory and gross margin that will get better over time. And really, right now, we're just dealing with supply chain as we work to mitigate some of the challenges that we see out there. That's great. And as a follow-up question, I guess, perhaps, could you provide a little more granularity on Reliant? It certainly sounds like trailing edge demand is robust this year, but also should be robust for some time. So we'd love to hear your thoughts on how we should be thinking about the contributions there over time. Sure. I don't think we're going to quantify Reliant itself, but what we can tell you is, as you pointed out, the specialty technologies, these trailing edge foundry extremely strong. In fact, you hear from many in the industry, that's where a lot of the chip shortage exists today, and so that is an area that’s seeing tremendous growth.
But in many ways, the growth in that area has also been limited by the ability of those companies to ramp and equipment to get out to them. And, I would fully expect that that's an area of trailing edge foundry that continues to ramp strongly really on into 2022 and maybe even beyond. And C.J., I just remind you, if you remember back at our Investor Day in March of last year seems like so long ago, but we talked about a viewpoint that we still have today that the trailing edge or the Reliant exposed WFE grows two to three times faster than overall WFE. And that's still how we see things. Great. Thank you. Thanks, C.J. Thank you. We'll take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Thanks a lot. Doug, I know you've seen the headlines in China, as to some delinquencies from some of your biggest customers and some of the debt that they've be faulted on. So I'm just wondering whether that's having any impact for you, whether there's anything that you're doing there, whether you're seeing anything that's getting pushed out, or any project timing that's changing? I guess, I'd say two things, Tim. Obviously, in a situation like you're alluding to, first thing I do is get on phone and talk to my guys in China to make sure I understand what's going on. I'm comfortable with where we sit today. I will tell you that most of the business we do with customers in the China region are under letters of credit. So its money is good. We know its money is good. So that's one thing I'd also have you think about.
In relative to the plans of our customers in China, I got to be careful about talking about a specific customer, Tim. But we haven't seen any change in anybody's plans as a result of anything. Cool. Thanks. And then I’ll ask the same question as last quarter, this mass that you gave the $70 billion over five years to add 35% bit growth, which was like $15 billion a quarter, and then you gave the number of every $350 million as another 100 basis points. So if you sort of look at where NAND is running right now, you just sort of conclude, well, maybe you're adding more like mid 40s bit growth. But I know you've also said, hey, those numbers don't really hold anymore, because capital intensity has gone up as well. So I wonder if you've had time to put pen to paper on maybe brushing up those numbers, if we can try to correlate where we are back to bit growth? Thanks. Yeah. Tim, I'm not really on the phone right now to update any of those longer-term numbers, that would be something we do on I don't know, an Investor Day kind of format, which we will do at some point in the future, I think. And you're right, the observation that over time, capital intensity grows in that device architecture and NAND. And when we gave those numbers that were kind of broad averages over long periods of time to try to be helpful, and it's not a static number. So I agree with you, we do need to update it, I'm not ready to do it on the call right now.
But like Tim said, we're pretty comfortable with the strength and investment in NAND. It looks pretty rational to us. And it's going to be a good year for investment in NAND. And actually, I think next year is going to be a pretty good year too, Tim. Yeah, if I can just add something, Tim, I mean, while I agree with the comment, and we made it that the rising capital intensity probably means those numbers need to be updated on the absolute basis. I want to point out, as the layer count increases and complexity increases, we're taking actual share as well, meaning we're converting applications that had previously been done with older legacy technologies. And we're moving those over to newer technologies like ALB. So we're actually winning new applications as well.
So even within whatever that new number is, we're benefiting from an expansion of spending per bit added, but also from actual application wins. And we pointed one out that, it's been a pretty big deal for us, which is the conversion to ALD for dielectric gapfill. So I think, it's another point being Lam’s strong positioning and close collaboration with customers in the space really does give us great insight into what those next application opportunities are for our company. Thank you. Thank you. We'll take our next question from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company. Hi. Thanks for taking my question, I have two of them. Firstly, for Tim or Doug, just a follow-up on the NAND. I think you articulated it pretty well compared to the prior peak, clearly the layer count has gone up, capital intensity has gone up, and also the market share has up. I'm just kind of curious when you look to like, the 2018 peak versus today, if I just dig one level below, can you just say the mix of dielectric and conductor etch trend versus today. Because it seems to me that dielectric etch process times have gone up, that's also a big factor in it. So I'm just kind of curious, is that right? And if so, is there a meaningful difference in the split between dielectric and conductor etch for Lam, in NAND today versus in 2018? And then I have a follow-up? Sure. Well, a number of things have changed demand. As you mentioned, the dielectric etch is fundamentally tied to – and its process time is fundamentally tied to layer count. So clearly, it's scaling pretty dramatically as layer counts grown.
The other element you find process time is relative to consumables, and therefore growth in our installed base business as well, which also scales nicely with layer count growth. So there are a number of changes, but the sure dielectric etch plays a very critical role in reading that layer count expansion. Got it. [indiscernible] on the Sense.i etch platform, the smart platform that you have, I'm just kind of curious as you roll out the platform, is there, do you think that installed base advantage, since customers have to look at Sense.i why don't they look at another platform like a SEM-T [ph] or whatever it might be? So, would Sense.i actually be a slight negative for you, given the fact that your installed base advantage [indiscernible]? Well, I mean, there's two elements to what makes a great tool. One is the platform, one is the process module technology. And so I think that when we're enhancing the platform capability, adding all of this equipment intelligence, we're certainly not giving up the incumbency power that's been developed. I mentioned, even today, proprietary RF systems, proprietary uniformity solutions, the new Vantex module that's on the Sense.i platform kind of marries up all of that equipment intelligence and use of data to make our market leading etch chamber even that much better. And so clearly, we thought a lot about the power of incumbency that if you stagnate, you also leave an opportunity for your competitors to catch up. And that's not our plan. Thanks, Tim. Thanks, Krish. Thank you. Our next comment comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question, I wanted to ask about leverage, and I know operating leverage, and I understand what's going on with gross margins next quarter and everything. But as I look at the Analyst Day model, like the midpoint, I think was something like mid-33 and EPS on a $16 billion revenue number. You’re run rating revenue right now over $17 billion, which is the high end of that guide and your run rate EPS sort of below the midpoint of the Analyst Day guide. So I guess how do we think, I think EPS is like 10% below or even more. So how do we think about I guess the progression of operating leverage from here as we go forward? Like, even if revenues don't grow, should we think about -- what timeframe do we think about EPS kind of like reaching those kinds of model levels that you talked about not that long ago? Stacy, I would tell you that there's a revenue level component to the leverage, there's also a time element to it. The time element is dictated by some things like ramping a new factory in Malaysia that's got a better cost structure. It's also driven by mapping a new etch platform like Sense.i, that we think will have a better profitability profile than the one before it, because it delivers incremental benefit to it.
So when I look at the leverage that we had in that model, I still feel quite good about it. When I think through and look at the time aspects of how we deliver the benefit, it is still the right way to think about it. The financial model we put out in March of last year is right when you think about the profitability opportunity for Lam. Got it. Thank you. For my follow-up again, I want to hit on the NAND point again. Last quarter you were explicit about saying that you thought NAND would grow I guess half over half in the second-half. And you seem to be suggesting that pretty strongly for DRAM now, but you didn't. You weren’t explicit about NAND. But you also I think I did hear you say that you thought NAND would be in general strong this year would be strong next year. So do you still think NAND grows in the second-half of the calendar year, and I guess you sounded like you expect NAND in calendar ‘22 to be up from calendar 2021? Is that what you're trying to say? I'm not trying to really say anything about ‘22 with the exception that it looks like it continues to be strong. It is a qualitative statement I made. It's too soon for us to put numbers around ’22, Stacy.
And when we look at WFE, so a quarter ago, we were talking about trending above 75. Tim now said, we see it trending above 80. I think overall, it's a second-half weighted WFE profile. DRAM looks solid in the second-half. Foundry/Logic looks pretty good in the second-half too.
I think NAND, probably as I sit here today is more balanced half on half. And a quarter ago, we said look like it was a little bit second-half, I can still see that potentially happening. But there's some customer investment timings that might occur more in the first-half of next year. Right now, it looks kind of balanced half on half as we sit here today. Got it. I guess that's still a couple quarters ago, you were saying those will be down. So you're kind of like dialing it in as we go forward. Yeah. I mean, as the year unfolds, obviously, we get better visibility to what's happening. And we're not halfway through the year. And if you include the guide for September, we're three quarters of the way through the year. So we just have better visibility on what's going on relative to timing, as well as the supply challenges the industry is having. Got it. That's helpful. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. We'll take our next question from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Good to see the team ramping its new Penang systems manufacturing facility and unlocking a little bit more revenue capacity here in the second-half. My understanding is that the team is targeting $3 billion of potential annual systems revenue capacity by the middle of next year out of Penang, so a pretty meaningful part of your future revenue profile.
And I think the goal is also to source more raw materials, machining and other support services locally over the next few years in Malaysia, so all of this should provide the team with some pretty strong gross margin tailwinds. Was most of this tailwind encompassed in the 2023, 2024 target financial model? Or, is this a source of margin upside above your target if you grow revenues into this new facility over the next few years? Harlan, what I would say is we always knew we were ramping a factory in Malaysia. So when we put that model out a year and a half ago, it was comprehended. We knew how big the factory was going to be. We knew Lam would be ramping and so forth. So it was all in in terms of the profitability. And I kind of referenced that with Stacy's question.
So, there isn't upside, but it is how we've continued to deliver leverage that we see. I don't know, Tim, if you'd add anything or want to add anything? No. And I think it's just that the current demand environment we're in today, that the ramp rate for Malaysia is a flat out. And while we haven't given any numbers for 2022, so I'm not sure where you got those. But clearly, we're ramping it. It will be a big facility for us and it will eventually take on a large position within our global manufacturing network. Yeah, thanks for the insights on that. And then on some of the uncertainties on supply chain and therefore, slightly wider revenue range on the guidance. Your systems have very advanced capabilities, like compute, storage systems, complex sensor networks, our power circuitry graphics, user interface capabilities. Is the team being impacted by the chip shortages with some of your advanced platforms that have a lot of these processor memory RF type content? Harlan, when we start here, probably a quarter or two ago, we were thinking capacity constraints. We were really thinking about physical space and labor. And quite honestly, I think we've done a really nice job, expanded in our Livermore, California facility, our Oregon facility, Korea, as I just said, shipping from Malaysia. So that physical capacity, we're really starting to sort of free up. We've hired a tremendous number of people also across the globe.
And now we're being hit with that next level, we have very complex supply chain. And you are right, chip shortages, shortages of other components as well. And because it can affect many different players within our supply chain, it's a little bit more unpredictable. And that's leading to some of the increased guidance that Doug spoke to.
Again, I think that Lam is very proud of our ability to execute. And, I think these are issues that just everyday we're working through, and with time, we would expect that these just like for the rest of the industry will begin to be resolved. Great. Thank you. Thank you, Harlan. Thank you. We'll take our next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Thanks for taking my question. The first one, I'm curious what is your estimate of China as a percentage of WFE this year versus last? Is it in line with what you thought at the start of the year? And have you heard of any potential restrictions on shipping to any Chinese customers from a U.S. regulatory perspective? Vivek, I’ll take and then Tim can feel free to add on. I think from a percent of WFE, probably fairly consistent. I mean, WFE overall this year is up nicely, China's up nicely, too. And we have talked about license requirements for one of our foundry customers in China. No new update for you there, Tim, unless you want to share something. But it doesn't impact anything else that we see going on in China. Yeah, we're actively engaged. As Doug said, we haven't seen significant movement on the licensing front. We will say we've seen the approval of a few licenses for spares and upgrades for mature technology nodes. So I guess if we were any update that we would say, some small progress, but we're here we're actively engaged with the licensing agencies within the government, want to ensure we're fully compliant with everything they have in place today, but also to be advocating for moving forward with additional approvals on the shipments that are pending. And for my follow-up, you sound sort of optimistic about the growth opportunity for spending next year. I'm wondering of your markets, is there one market do you think that will have kind of a greater rise in capital intensity going into next year? Is it Foundry/Logic? Is it DRAM? Is it NAND?
And conceptually, how does that impact your share gain potential as you look at next year? I realize you're not giving a specific WFE number. But let's say if you're in a growth environment, is there one market where you think given all the technology changes, that there is going to be a greater than average rise in capital intensity? Thank you. Sure. I guess, you can interpret from all the comments I've made about multi-year impact to WFE spending. We see strong regional investments, many places government supported, rising device complexity, and then actually, we think the demand environment still remains good overall for semis. So those are – we’re not giving 2022 right now, we don't see great clouds on the horizon. We see a lot of positives.
When I think about different areas of opportunity for Lam, to your point about where my capital intensity be rising the fastest or maybe just spending, really think about Lam. And therefore, where's etch and depth really going to play a bigger role? Where does Lam have the opportunity? I see that across the board. We spent a lot of time on this call talking about NAND complexity. But, you're seeing 3D transitions, Foundry/Logic space gate all around, advanced packaging, very etch and depth intensive. Next year, if you're looking, I'm not saying it's flat WFE, but if you were looking at flat WFE, Lam’s opportunity would be growing in those spaces because of etch and depth capital intensity increases.
And where we really are spending our time and effort this year, it is two places. Doug talked a lot about operational improvements, making sure we come out with infrastructure that's better off from that perspective. And what I tried to highlight was where we are investing in products so that as these transitions occur to 3D in Foundry/Logic and DRAM over the next several years, then Lam is going to be in the same position to benefit from those as what I highlighted happening for us in 3D NAND, and I think it's places I just talked about, selective etch, and things like dry resist, it's the position we have in high aspect ratio, etch and depth relative to 3D packaging.
I would just say it's a very opportunity rich environment for a company like Lam right now. Thanks very much. Thank you. Thank you. We'll take our next question from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking my questions, I had two as well. I guess this one's probably for Doug. I think historically, you guys have spoken to your thoughts on DRAM and NAND supply growth exiting the year. I was hoping you can update us higher thinking about that exiting 2021 based on what you've shipped in the first-half and what your expectations are for the second-half, supply growth exiting the year relative to demand growth for both DRAM and NAND? DRAM, I think this year, supply growth is still going to be below where demand growth is. I think, pretty well chronicle from the industry the demand for DRAM bits is probably 20, low 20s. I think supply is probably high teens approaching 20 in DRAM. I think on the NAND side, probably more imbalance. I think supply demand mid high 30s. It feels fairly balanced for the year in NAND. Got it. And as a quick follow-up, I wanted to ask a question about your opportunity in leading edge logic. I think in the past year, you've talked about your application wins. I guess, initially at 14, and how that's expanded at 10. And your expectation as we sort of eventually transitioned to seven. I guess, despite some of those comments, we haven't really seen that show up in numbers. And I realize you disclosed logic and others, so there's another component in that line. But, what are you missing? I think, I realized you don't want to talk about a specific customer. But that customer is ramping CapEx, yet we're not seeing the uplift in your numbers. Thank you. I think, I'd say two things. You've got this sort of right, 14 to 10. We've talked about a nice growth in application footprint. 5x is what we've described in terms of number of applications. And then that growing again, from 10 to seven, that's absolutely what we see happening. And I got to be careful talking about any one customer.
I think, when you look at logic and other you're absolutely right, there is the other component in there and things like image sensor, and other logic devices, but also you have to think about the timeframe in which anyone customer is investing in technology, is it in a concentrated two or three quarters, or is it over a longer period of time. And if it's over a longer period of time, you won't see it in any one quarter. And so, I would encourage you to think about both of those things when you look at the logic and other stuff. And then I’d also suggest, I think logic and others is going to look pretty good in the second half also. Yeah. And I think the only thing I would add is, maybe we need to transition that story before a lot about progress we were going to make in action and the output. Now, we step up with a logic or logic and foundry basically similar devices, similar trends. As we move to gate all around our nano sheet structures, many of the products I talked about dealing with selective etch and the processes that are required to create those complex structures. The challenge is that foundry and logic customers at the leading edge see with RC and its impact, and therefore the need for evolving the metallization structure.
We talked about dry resist and the potential to impact the cost performance of EUV at future nodes, not only current node, but also high NA. These are ways in which Lam is ensuring that we have the right product portfolio. So whether it's advanced foundry or advanced logic, whichever custom you might be talking about the -- we have very strong products to offer to help with those transitions. And so, I think over the years, our opportunity to engage those customers has just gotten stronger and broader. Great. Thank you. Thank you, Toshiya. We'll take a next question from Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Great. Thank you. You got a couple quarters now the installed base business growing 50% year-on-year. And, we don't have a long time series of that. But I mean, is that -- I assume that's kind of a historically unusual growth rate. And, anything in that, that sort of makes you think, I think you mentioned last quarter people accumulating spares or inventory a little bit. Now obviously that's a growth a really good growth business and you've been vocal about that. But, is there any cyclicality when you start talking about these types of growth rates that we should be aware of? Yeah, I'll take that. I included in my prepared remarks one liner that said it was supposed to be hinting, please don't count on this kind of growth every single quarter quarter-on-quarter. There are components. And this kind of went back to the question about trailing edge foundry and how do we see that going forward. We don't see that abating. But that is an area where we're seeing tremendous demand right now, and eventually that may not kind of keep pace quite with the growth in the installed base.
But the elements, you think about what's in there, spares continues to grow with installed base. And as we've seen this tremendous growth in installed base, that becomes a recurring revenue stream going forward, that really is just based on customers continuing to utilize what they've already bought. So we feel very good about that.
So if there's one part that you might see a little bit of investment timing, in fact, it would be specialty technologies and trailing edge or non-leading edge foundry. But our near-term outlook for that remains quite strong. Thank you. Thanks, Joe. Thank you. We'll take our next question from Patrick Ho of Stifel. Thank you very much. Congrats on the nice quarter. Doug, maybe for you in terms of the component and supply constraints that you're facing. I know, there's a lot of moving parts. But what are you trying to do to kind of ‘mitigate it’? And I guess what I'm looking for is a little more detail. Are you working with additional suppliers? Are you working with your main component suppliers of getting those parts at a certain period of time? What are some of those, I guess, initiatives and efforts you're doing to try, I guess mitigate that situation? I think I’m actually going to give it to Tim. Yeah, I'm actually pretty close to this one. And what I would say is that there, maybe it's everything. When you have your major customers really clamoring for on time shipments, we're leaving no stone unturned. So, in some cases, it's working with different suppliers. But again, we have complex supply chains. And, in many cases, we're looking at where those suppliers have additional facilities in other parts of the world. So for impacted, say, by issues throughout the COVID pandemic, in one part of the world, we transition to that same supplier in different factories, and the parts of the world. That's usually the most expeditious means of getting additional supply.
But at times, we are finding additional suppliers. We're also, I talked about refurbishment and recoding, and reuse. That's another area where we're working with customers to actually qualify refurbishment processes that allow us to shorten the time, so rather than having to procure brand new parts, for instance, we do a refurbishment and that part can go back in the machine. From the fewer parts you use within the installed base, more you have available for build forward out of your factories.
And so, I would just say between us and the customers very close collaboration and collaboration of our supply chain partners are getting very creative about how to try to mitigate these risks. And it's many, many, many different things. Great. Thank you very much. Thanks, Patrick. Operator, we have time for one more question, please. Thank you. We’ll take our last question from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to try to understand the kind of updated WFE guidance and your commentary around NAND being maybe a little bit more balanced half on half. I guess, can you help me understand just what, I guess increased to maybe offset some of that, including going to over $80 billion for WFE? Was it just more Foundry/Logic? Or, is that your comments around DRAM being stronger? Just any comments there will be helpful. I think the practicality of it, Joe, is we're just further through the year. We're halfway through the year, we got pretty good visibility into the September quarter, because we just guided it. And so it's that right. It's an understanding of customers’ plans. It's an understanding of what we think the industry is going to be able to supply. We still see a second-half weighted WFE spending profile. We kicked it up somewhat as a result of this better visibility is what I would describe. Okay. That's helpful. And then just a quick question on the services business, another quarter of a major spares contract win. I was wondering if you could quantify how much of your spares revenue is based on long-term contracts. No. Obviously we look at that a quite a bit. But I would say that a large portion of it, whether it's under long-term contracts, or it's in -- I talked about our complex supply chain. I mean, in many ways for spare parts, it's very similar, which means regardless of the length of contract, we tend to be the primary supplier for the vast majority of those spares. And so, I would say the majority of our parts are under contract, but then the length of contract we're not really ready to talk about at this point. Fair enough. Thanks. Thank you, Joe. Great. Thanks. Okay, operator, I think that was our last caller. Tina, do you want to close this off? Yeah. Just want to tell everyone we appreciate your support, and thank you for joining our call today. This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation.

A replay of this call will be made available later this afternoon on our website.
And with that, I will hand the call over to Tim. Thank you, Tina and Happy New Year to all that are joining us today. Calendar 2021 was another year in which companies and our communities had to respond to significant challenges on many fronts. Lam’s operations and results were impacted by the effects of COVID-19, labor shortages, freight and logistics cost escalation and supply chain constraints. But I am proud and thankful for how Lam employees responded at every turn with commitment and agility to support our customers and business.
As the digital transformation of both the global economy and our everyday activities accelerated throughout the year, demand for wafer fabrication equipment continued to strengthen. Lam delivered record revenues and record earnings per share in calendar year 2021. Embedded in these results is record revenue in every area of our business, including NAND, DRAM and foundry logic and within every sub-segment of our customer support business. Even in a year with relatively higher foundry logic spend versus memory, we gained market share in both etch and deposition.
As we closed out 2021 and enter the new year, demand for Lam products has never been higher. Yet as we have discussed in prior quarters, the global supply chain remains severely stressed at these unprecedented output levels. In the December quarter, unexpected shipment delays primarily for components from a critical supplier surfaced in the last two weeks of the quarter leaving us with insufficient time for full recovery despite the diligent efforts of our supplier and our global operations team. The resulting shipment delays caused revenues to come in below the midpoint of our guidance range. Revenue for the tools that were impacted in December will be recognized in the March quarter.
Looking into the first weeks of 2022, we see that supply challenges have broadened with the COVID Omicron surge adding further disruption to freight and logistics operations as well as exacerbating skilled labor shortages. We also continued to encounter significant scarcity of certain components and parts, including semiconductors. As a result, our March quarter revenue levels will be limited by the output constraints of our global supply chain. And this is reflected in our guidance. We are aggressively working on the issues with our suppliers and believe we will see progressive improvement as we move through the next few quarters. Overall, for calendar year 2022, we expect to deliver strong across-the-board revenue growth.
On the demand front, we are seeing continued momentum in wafer fabrication equipment spending. We believe that spending in calendar year 2021 ended consistent with the mid-$80 billion estimate we provided on our last call. Strength was broad-based with NAND, DRAM and foundry logic all growing double-digits. As we look to calendar year 2022, there are multiple themes underpinning our view for continued WFE growth, including powerful end market demand trends, rising device complexity, strong semiconductor industry operating profitability and regional government support and incentives. In end markets, the technology landscape continues to build not only on the prevalent drivers of AI, IoT, the cloud and 5G, but also now along another vector as advances in virtual and augmented reality lay the groundwork for the metaverse over the coming decade.
Immersive gaming experiences will be a primary driver of metaverse development and adoption. And I have spoken on prior calls about how advanced processors and memory devices for gaming are favorable for WFE demand due to both leading edge performance requirements and semiconductor content growth. Across the semiconductor industry, we see more than 20 new fabs being built and customers have already announced significant CapEx increases for the year. Consequently, we expect 2022 WFE spending to be in the $100 billion range with strong growth across all segments. We believe that our performance in 2021 has strengthened our ability to win in the robust demand environment we see ahead. We launched innovative new etch and deposition products, gained market share at key technology inflections, and rapidly grew our installed base.
On this last point, our customer support business group continues to exceed expectations. Our chamber count grew approximately 13% in calendar year 2021 to approximately 75,000 units. Our revenue per chamber, which we highlighted at our 2020 Investor Day as a key growth objective, increased nearly 24% year-on-year in 2021 or nearly twice the growth in chamber count. We expect calendar year 2022 to be another strong growth year for our CSBG business. Our large and growing installed base also adds immense value through our product innovation process. The high volume of wafers running on our installed base everyday enable us to detect newly emerging challenges more quickly and accelerate our cycles of learning, both of which are critical in an era of increasing device and manufacturing complexity.
On the product front, 2021 was a year of significant milestones for Lam. To highlight just a few, our Vantex dielectric etch system became the fastest ramping new etch product in Lam history. Built on our groundbreaking new Sense.i platform, Vantex helps customers reduce costs by enabling higher etch rates and improving fab footprint efficiency, while new process capabilities extend our technology leadership in high aspect ratio edge. We expect continued growth in Vantex shipments in 2022, with overall revenues from this product roughly doubling year-over-year.
Our VECTOR DT product for backside deposition, achieved process tool of record status at all customers for 3D NAND devices with more than 200 layers further demonstrating our leadership in 3D scaling enablement. We achieved several important leading edge wins with our selective etch, strip and surface treatment solutions, including applications for gate-all-around and a foundry logic customer and our first selective etch win in DRAM.
As device complexity increases across logic and memory devices, the need for angstrom-level precision is driving greater adoption of Lam’s selective edge solutions compared to conventional wet etch methods. This should enable selective etch revenues to double this year as customers adopt our innovative suite of products for current leading edge applications as well as for future device architectures. And finally, we increased our deposition market share with wins in critical bit line and spacer applications for RC reduction and are now qualified at all leading nodes for this application.
To conclude, our product momentum and outperformance in our installed base business have put Lam in a great position to capitalize on the tremendous demand we see for wafer fabrication equipment. Our top priority is to alleviate the near-term supply constraints that have impacted our output capacity, our delivery predictability and our financial results. With progress expected on this front over the next several months, we believe calendar year 2022 will be another outstanding period of growth for Lam.
Thank you. And now, he is Doug to cover the financial results and our outlook. Great. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining our call today during what I know is a very busy earnings season.
Calendar year 2021 was a record year for Lam Research in many respects. We closed the year with revenue at $16.5 billion, which includes record levels of revenue for both our systems as well as our CSBG businesses. We also delivered an all-time high for earnings per share coming in at $32.46. I think it’s important to point out that we had 59% growth in earnings per share over calendar year 2020, which outpaced the growth in revenue, which was at 39%.
We ended the year however on a bit of a down point. As Tim spoke about, our revenue came in at the lower end of the guidance range due to supply chain issues that impacted us in the last two weeks of the December quarter. These delays primarily from one supplier for critical parts meant we were unable to recognize revenue for tools that we actually ship to customers, totaling more than $200 million. You will notice this reflected in the increased level of deferred revenue on the balance sheet at the end of the December quarter of $1.46 billion. The vast majority of these parts have now shipped and the full value of the tools, will revenue in the March quarter.
While we continue to increase the output capacity of our own factories, we are seeing a broadening out of headwinds from the global supply chain, which is impacting the somewhat soft March quarter revenue and gross margin guidance. These headwinds are partially Omicron and labor-related, partially supplier scaling-related and partially due to freight and logistics constraints. Our expectations are that the broader supply chain issues in the industry will persist for a while and will exit the March quarter with incremental supplier shipment delays potentially causing another growth of as much as $500 million in deferred revenue.
I would just highlight that we often ship equipment to our customers on a modular basis, which accelerates deliveries and allows customers the ability to begin installation while waiting for the fully configured tool. As we get our suppliers caught up with our needs and these missing components ship, these tools will revenue in future quarters. This is obviously a fluid situation right now.
Let me now turn towards the details of our December quarter results. Revenue for the quarter came in at $4.23 billion, a slight decrease from the September quarter, but an increase of 22% from the same quarter a year ago. From a segment perspective, Memory represented 58% of systems revenues in the December quarter, down from the prior quarter level, which was 64%. The strength in Memory during the quarter was driven by investments in the DRAM segment, which increased both in terms of dollars as well as percent concentration at 23% of systems revenue versus 19% in the September quarter and 10% in the June quarter. The DRAM investments were primarily focused on the 1z and 1-alpha nodes.
The NAND segment was 35% of our systems revenue versus 45% in the prior quarter. We are seeing both capacity additions as well as conversions across our NAND customers, with investments in 128 through 192-layer devices. We expect we will continue to see a blend of additions and conversions as we go through calendar year 2022. Broad demand across both leading edge and mature device nodes drove continued strength in the foundry segment, with the December quarter representing 31% of our systems revenue versus 25% in the September quarter. Multiple customers are investing in the segment to meet end demand drivers such as AI, IoT, cloud and 5G, which is leading to significant unit growth and more silicon content in most technology devices. We had another record quarter of system revenue dollars in the Logic and Other segment, which contributed 11% of systems revenue in the December quarter, which was consistent with the concentration in the prior quarter. Our customers are investing to meet the demand requirements in the market for microprocessors, image sensors and heterogeneous silicon packaging technologies.
Now, let’s switch to the regional composition of our total revenue. The China region came in at 26% of total revenues. And while being the top region for December, it was down from the 30% plus levels we have seen for the last few quarters. This was an expected outcome and is related to the timing of customer investments. China domestic customers were the majority of the China regional revenue in the December quarter. The Korea and Taiwan regions also had solid investment activity, representing 25% and 18% of revenues respectively in the December quarter.
The revenue for our installed base business, CSBG, was nearly $1.5 billion, which was 29% higher than the December quarter in calendar 2020 and approximately 8% higher sequentially. The continued strength of CSBG reflects a growing installed base of tools, customers operating at high utilization levels as well as our ability to monetize the growing installed base by offering more value-added advanced service solutions. Each sub-segment of CSBG hit a new record in the quarter, but I want to specifically callout our Reliant product line for achieving its 12th consecutive record quarter, delivering value to a growing specialty market across numerous customers. While the CSBG business can have quarterly fluctuations, we continue to see sustained and stable growth on an annual basis.
Now, moving on to gross margin, the December quarter was 46.8%, above the midpoint of the guided range. The increase in gross margins came from a favorable customer and product mix due to shipment timing as well as high field resource productivity due to greater customer installation activity. As we have discussed in the past, gross margins can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter due to overall business levels, along with customer and product mix. And I would just mention, we have got incremental negative cost impacts from the supply chain constraints that we discussed earlier that are negatively impacting the March gross margin guidance.
Operating expenses for December were $627 million, an increase from the prior quarter amount of $586 million. The December quarter had higher variable compensation as we closed the calendar year as well as additional research and development investments. We have added headcount in R&D to support our growing product portfolio and we are focused on supporting our customers’ ongoing technology roadmaps. December operating margin came in at 32% or approximately $1.4 billion. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 11.9%, generally in line with our expectations.
Looking into calendar year ‘22, we expect the ongoing tax rate to be in the low-teens level. We continue to monitor potential tax changes under consideration in the United States. Given the uncertainty there, we have not yet reflected the impact of any changes in our financial modeling. And as we have discussed in prior calls, our tax rate may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. Other income and expense came in for the quarter at $19 million in income. This amount is better than the prior quarter and resulted in income in the December quarter due to a gain in one of our venture investments that recently raised capital in a public offering.
As we have noted in last quarter’s earnings call, we did not include the estimated gain of approximately $50 million in our December quarter guidance and the amount in the results that you are seeing was reasonably close to that forecast. This gain added 26% – or excuse me $0.26 tax adjusted to earnings per share. And I just have you note that overall OI&E is subject to market-related volatility that could cause a difference from our typical run-rate. We continue to buyback shares with our focus on capital return. And in the December quarter, we repurchased approximately $430 million worth of stock. In addition, we paid $211 million in dividends during the quarter. For the calendar year, we allocated a total of $3.8 billion towards capital return, which was approximately 94% of free cash flow. During 2021, we reduced share count by more than 4 million shares at an average repurchase price of $593 per share. Diluted earnings per share for the December quarter was $8.53. And the diluted share comp balance was slightly lower than the September quarter level coming in at 142 million shares, which was in line with our expectations.
Let me now shift to the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash, totaled $5.6 billion, up from the prior quarter level of $4.9 billion. We generated strong cash from operations in the December quarter of $1.4 billion, which was somewhat offset by the capital return activities that I just spoke about. Day sales outstanding was essentially flat coming in at 73 days compared to 72 days in the September quarter. Inventory turns were down slightly from the prior quarter level coming in at 2.9x, which was pretty much as planned as we’ve grown inventory to increase the business volume.
Non-cash expenses for the December quarter included approximately $63 million for equity compensation, $62 million for depreciation and $20 million in amortization. Capital expenditures in the December quarter were flat with September coming in at $138 million. Capital expenditures are mainly focused on expansion activities such as our silicon parts facility in Ohio and the Korea Technology Center that will be opening in the first half of 2022. We have 16,300 regular full-time employees at the December quarter – at the end of the December quarter, which is an increase of approximately 900 people from the prior quarter. Our headcount growth was mainly in the factory and field organizations to support the growing output levels that we’re seeing.
Now let’s look at our non-GAAP guidance for the March 2022 quarter. We’re expecting revenue of $4.25 billion, plus or minus $300 million. As we’ve discussed earlier, the guidance reflects our expectation for a higher level of shipment delays in the March quarter, due to broadening out of supply chain constraints we’re seeing. Customer demand is decently stronger than what we can currently supply. Backlog has grown for five consecutive quarters as we exited the December quarter.
We’re expecting gross margin of 45%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. Our guidance reflects a higher level of spending that we’re incurring for managing the execution of the supply chain as well as extra costs to secure critical semiconductor component parts. As we sit here today, I believe our gross margin will improve as we progress through the year. We’re forecasting operating margins of 29.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. And finally, earnings per share of $7.45 plus or minus $0.75 based on a share count of approximately 141 million shares. We’re widening our ranges out a bit due to the supply chain uncertainties that we’ve discussed.
As we start calendar year 2022, we’re in the strongest investment year in the history of the semiconductor industry. It’s important to note that the demand is clearly there. We are dealing with broadening out of supply chain constraints, which we know we’re going to fix over time. We’re laser-focused on addressing these supply challenges, and we’re confident that we will deliver improvements as we go through the year. We’re in solid market share positions. We’ve gained further traction across all market segments in 2021. And we’ve got a robust and growing installed base business.
Operator, that concludes Tim and my prepared remarks. We’d like to now open up the call for questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So can you guys just help us understand on the supply chain constraints? Is this more subsystems and part shortages or is it chip shortages? And I assume that you’re placing orders for both subsystems, parts and ships to the entirety of this year just given the extended lead times. So looking at what your suppliers have committed to shipping to you this year, if all of this plays out, combined with the incremental systems capacity expansion from Malaysia, can the team meet its forward backlog and forecasted customer requirements this year or do you think that there is some likelihood that you exit this calendar year with your shipments below your customers’ demand requirements? So Harlan, I’ll start that and let Doug add if he wants to. As we mentioned, the December issue was primarily critical parts that you call them – I’ve called them probably subsystems, pretty large critical components that goes into our tool. But the underlying reasons for why certain suppliers are having challenges, shipping goes across the board. We talked about broadening challenges. In some cases, it’s shortages of labor that have been driven and exacerbated by COVID-driven absenteeism. In some cases, it’s chip availability. In some cases, it has been freight and logistics. But I would say that we are working closely with these suppliers, and we have committed schedules. We’ve said our lead times are quite extended versus normal. We have better visibility today into demand and customer schedules, I think, than we ever have. And therefore, to your point, we have placed those orders with suppliers. And I would say in both Lam’s case and our suppliers case, it’s about executing to that much higher demand plan. Now what we’ve given you as an outlook for WFE that we do believe we can execute to. And as we said, we believe we will make progressive improvement in supply chain capacity in coming quarters. And that as we do that, you’ll see Lam output, the output of our supply chain increase and we will be meeting the customer demand at that point.
What I would also point out is that from the standpoint of our own capacity. This was a key area of focus in 2021, and we talked a lot about it. We significantly expanded our existing factories in the U.S., in Korea, in Taiwan. We ramped and started shipping from our new Malaysia facility, which ultimately will become our largest manufacturing site. We increased our own employment both in full-time and temporary workforce. And I would say, right now, our focus is ensuring that every aspect of our supplier base has grown their capacity to match ours. And that is something that we’re working on every day, and I do believe we will – as Doug said, we – this is a fixable problem, but it is our primary priority at this point. And maybe the only thing I would add just so it’s crystal clear to everybody listening, the December slight miss below midpoint, really one supplier that emerged very late in the month of December. And we just didn’t have time to respond to it. So that’s one statement. Second, what Tim just told you is there is a broadening out that we see beyond one supplier that we’re working to mitigate. And we’re doing lots of different things with lots of different suppliers to work our way through this, Harlan, but we know we’re going to fix this. This is something that you can manage your way through, and we will manage our way through it. Demand is very strong. And maybe just a final comment to note, obviously, on everybody’s mind is that we were fighting challenges all through 2020. I mean, it’s not as though supply chain has just become an issue. But I would say that some of the things that have changed when we talk about the slight worsening that we’re seeing right now is also that in many cases, whether it’s Lam’s inventory or suppliers’ inventory they have been drawn down by these very high output levels to the point where our vulnerability to a miss that might only be just a few days, but at the output rate of our factories. Those few days can actually translate into some pretty big revenue numbers, and that corresponding few days could be the same for our suppliers. So I think that what’s different right now is that we just have a little bit less room to respond to the challenges. But I tell you, all through 2021, we are fighting these and in almost all cases, we were successful in mitigating them without them becoming misses in our financial results. But I think that – and that’s what gives us confidence that we will solve these as we go through ‘22 as well. And I appreciate the insights. Then can you just – given the strong WFE backdrop and the potential strong growth backdrop for Lam. Can you guys just give us an update on the Malaysia manufacturing ramp? I believe that the target was to get to about $3 billion of annualized revenue output from Malaysia by the middle of this year. Is the team still on track for that? And I’ve also heard that the team is trying to build out domestic supplier support around this facility, which is potentially a big benefit for you guys, right, especially during periods like this where having to procure materials from other geographies can probably be quite challenging. So maybe you can also update us here on the strategy for building out the domestic support capability in Penang? Yes. Well, what I would say is that the ramp of the Malaysia factory is on track. And we’re quite happy with the progress we’re making there. Again, it’s ramping per schedule. Demand is somewhat outstripping the ramp rate. But coming back to your point about why we embarked on Malaysia and also expansions, as I mentioned, in Korea, Taiwan, the U.S. and even in our factory in Europe. And that is we get the opportunity to tap into different talent pools. So I talked about labor shortages, not all COVID-related. These are just driven by serving demand in lots of parts of the industry. So by having factories in different locations, we tap into different talent pools. And also, as you mentioned, we have the opportunity to qualify different supplier sets or even in some cases where we have global critical suppliers, they built factories in those same locations next door to us very close to our site. And they also tap into that different talent pool. And so there is many ways in which this expansion of our global footprint, we think in the long-term, actually makes us less sensitive to disruption in any one particular region, whether it’s in freight and logistics or it’s in workforce or it’s in the supply chain. So it’s all part of our strategy. We’re executing on it and we just need to get to that endpoint a little bit faster. Thanks, Harlan. Thank you very much. Yes, thank you. And so we will go to our next question from Krish Sankar of Cowen & Company. Yes. Hi, thanks for taking my question. I had two of them. Doug and Tim, you mentioned the WFE to be $100 billion this year. But if I look at the current WFE run rate, it seems like it’s like more in the low to mid-$90 billion. So to get to $100 billion, the second half run rate has to be more like $105 billion to $110 billion. And I understand the demand is strong, and it’s all about supply constraints today. So if my math is right, does it mean that the WFE and the revenues have to step up in the second half? Is that kind of the implication of $100 billion WFE from where we are today? And is it fair to assume that Lam revenues had to head up – step up in the back half of this year? And then I have a follow-up. Yes, Krish, I do think WFE is back half weighted this year. Maybe as much to do with where true demand is, but also a little bit because I believe the industry in the first half of the year is going to be somewhat supply constrained. So I think it’s going to be a second half weighted spending here, Krish. Got it. And then Doug, just to like quickly just follow-up on that, is that the implication that your revenue should also step up in the back half? Likely, yes. Got it. Got it. Alright. Fair enough. And then my follow-up question is just quickly on China, you mentioned about domestic was pretty strong in December. It looks like the domestic China business is going to be strong this year, too. Can you just help us understand what is driving it? There was some recent news about Tsinghua, the parent company of YMTC having some issues. So some investors worry that’s going to cap YMTC’s CapEx or WFE this year? So I am kind of curious, what do you think is going to drive China WFE? Is this still the long tail of smaller trailing edge customers or do you expect the big guys like SMIC and YMTC to also be a big part of domestic China WFE this year? Thank you. Yes. I think that from a China WFE perspective, we think it remains very broad demand across many different players, in fact, even some new fabs and new players that are entering the market there. And while some of it, of course, are big players, a lot of it is our fabs that are addressing what we all know is a very tight trailing-edge technology landscape. And so I think that is a pretty big driver for WFE, and Lam participates well in that market. And Doug mentioned our Reliant business that continues to show record after record in terms of business, and a lot of that stems from investments in places like China at the off leading-edge nodes. Yes, the investment performance – I was just going to say, it’s a very broad set of customers was all I was going to add, Krish. A lot of whom you’ve probably not even heard of, frankly. So there is a long tail of people spending dollars in China. Got it. Just I mean, Tim and Doug, just want to clarify, you’re not too worried about all the China news on Tsinghua at this point? I’m not overly concerned. No. There is ample liquidity in China for the aspirations that they have to make the investments they are planning to make. Thank you very much, guys. I really appreciate the info. Thank you. You are welcome, Krish. And we will go next to C.J. Muse of Evercore. Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, first question, a derivative to the supply chain issues that you’re seeing and in higher freight costs. Curious your ability to pass along of your higher input cost to customers. I understand there is a long tail in contracts, but would love to get a sense of how you’re seeing that play out here in 2022. Yes. C.J., I’ll take a shot at it. I mean, first of all, I mean, we’re not going to go to the detail on conversations we may be having with customers on that point. But I guess I’d point to a couple of things. One, it’s hard to see perhaps what we are doing, given the overwhelming cost challenges, Doug talked about, relative to the near-term projections. But longer term, Lam equipment is absolutely vital to ramping global semiconductor capacity. That’s important for every one of our customers and industry more broadly. And we’re also – our equipment is also vital to achieving the technologies road map for the industry. So there is tremendous value in what we do for our customers in the industry, and we always fight to get paid fairly for that value delivered. Right now, I would say that we’re focused squarely on solving these supply chain issues, having conversations with customers and suppliers about how we do that in the most efficient way. And I think as you see us work through that, you’ll see our financial results including gross margin continue to improve into the future. Great. Very helpful. And I guess, as my follow-up, as you look at your installed base business, you talked about 24% chamber revenue growth per chamber, which is pretty impressive. Curious how we should think about growth beyond 2021? I think historically, you kind of talked about a 6% to 10% kind of anticipated revenue per chamber CAGR. Has that changed? And should we be thinking a higher number going forward? Well, yes, I mean, if you project out these current growth rates, you get to a pretty big customer support business group in the future. But we – as I mentioned, exceeding expectations, the business is doing extremely well. I would say that we anticipate some mitigation in that growth rate. I think at our Analyst Day, we kind of put out a model to say, look, our objective every year is to go in saying that we will outgrow – the revenue will outgrow the growth of the installed base, which means fundamentally, you’re moving forward the revenue capture per chamber. Right now, we’ve flowed those numbers away. But some of it may be a little bit short-term. I mean, clearly, everyone is increasing held inventory that probably goes to our spare parts business as well. Over time, and I don’t know when that would be because I think people are going to be a little bit cautious for quite some time about supply issues as we’re talking about. Eventually, they will draw those inventories back to probably more efficient numbers, and that would cause some mitigation in the spare parts business part of CSBG. We’ve also talked about the Reliant business and tremendous growth in upgrades and sales of tools for trailing edge. I don’t know that, that will mitigate so much, but it’s been on a red hot pace the last year or two. And so I would expect some mitigation there. So maybe the best way to think about it is, again, our goal is always to outgrow the growth of the installed base, capturing more revenue per chamber. And so you can model it Lam with expected Taber growth rate plus some – it’s probably best way to think about it. And so we will move to our next question from Timothy Arcuri of UBS. Hi. It’s actually Dana Chen on for Timothy Arcuri. I was wondering if you could touch based on – you previously talked about like the GM, gross margin headwinds from Malaysia. Can you just help us quantify how should we think about the impact from there in the next few quarters? And is the timing for the new Malaysia manufacturing to shift from like headwind to tailwind maybe in the second half of this year? I just wanted to understand the gross margin impact over there? Yes. Malaysia will be a tail in the gross margin. Certainly, as we get into the second half of the year and in my scripted remarks, I basically said, as I look through the rest of calendar year ‘22, I expect gross margin will improve from the levels that we are at today. Part of that will be Malaysia. Part of it will be the mitigation of the supply chain and part of it will be new products coming out and the positive mix factor of that. So, I will give you a few things to think about there. Got it. And maybe just touch base on the domestic China WFE, can you just talk about where you think 2021 that came in? And how do you think about that like into 2022 from domestic China? Yes. The way we have been talking about it is that it was a growth year in ‘21. We didn’t quantify how much, but it was very much in line with the expectations. We described 2020 is roughly $10 billion indigenous Chinese WFE grew last year. It’s going to grow again this year is what I would tell you. Alright. Thank you very much. You’re welcome. And we will go next to Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research. Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. I had a question on your segment mix with regard to your WFE forecast for the year. Just given where you guys do tend to focus, do you think that, that segment is a potential disadvantage with regard to your ability to grow in line with how you view the WFE market itself growing in 2022? Yes, Stacy, it’s a good question. I do think when I look at growth in ‘22 that you are going to see that the highest level of growth in foundry/logic. That’s just what’s going on. I think that’s pretty well understood. And you are right in your observation, I think, inherent in your question is, historically, we been somewhat less represented there, I guess in terms of share of spend as compared to memory. Having said that, though we have made a nice step up there in the last couple of years, we continue to – 2021 was a good share position year for us in foundry and logic. So, that’s going to benefit us. And also, when I look at ‘22 WFE, I think you are going to see nice growth in memory, and I will let Tim add on to. Yes, Stacy, I guess I just wanted to mention, I mean we have maybe gotten that question a lot of times about how we are doing in foundry and logic and what our plans are – and what – I think we have done a nice job of, and it will play out over the next several years is we focused on a lot of our product portfolio and product development on products that put us out in front of that technology roadmap. And just to name a couple of the products. I mean you look at what we have done in atomic layer deposition, selective etch, the low RC materials, dry EUV resist and heterogeneous 3D packaging. All of those are quite tied to ramps in foundry/logic spending. Now the good news is many of those also play over into our strength in memory like ALD does and selective etch will. But again, we have been very cautious about trying to position the portfolio such that our exposure to foundry/logic ultimately is a positive for the company, and I think we are making progress and we will continue to fulfill. Got it. So, does that suggest you see the share gains that you saw in ‘21 in foundry and logic continuing into ‘22? Yes. I think the momentum is going to continue in ‘22, Stacy. Yes. Got it. Helpful. Thank you, guys. Thank you. And we will go to our next question from John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Hi guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question like many I am juggling multiple calls. So, I apologize if it’s a little bit repetitive. But just relative to kind of the first question and your ability to meet demand, Doug, and maybe this is a little bit longer term, but you have got a situation where the semi industry took 50 years to get to $0.5 trillion of revenue, and there is many models out there that suggest in the next 8 years, we will get another $500 billion and be $1 trillion in revenue. What do you have to do incremental over a multiyear period to invest to make sure you have – should the support kind of that kind of demand for supply. And is that already in the backlog for what you guys are doing in Malaysia? And is it already sort of contemplated in some of the OpEx sort of targets you gave us at Analyst Day? Yes. Let me take a shot at it, and Doug can add. But as I kind of went – and you might not have heard this if you are jumping between calls. But our manufacturing strategy, we have been playing out for the last several years, I think, is really what gives us confidence that we can meet this demand going forward. And that is Malaysia, as you pointed out, but also expansions across our Korea manufacturing facility. This past year, we bought out our joint venture for manufacturing in Taiwan. We expanded all of our U.S. manufacturing sites in a pretty big way. And we also grew our output from our Europe facility. And so I think that when you ask the question, what is it that prepares us for the industry to add another $500 billion in Lam to meet that output, it’s the ability to tap into this global supply chain, which gives us access to larger talent pools, largest supplier bases for many of our parts. Some are very critical, but many of them are sourceable locally to those factories. And I think that’s going to help us increase not only our own capacity, which I think we are making good progress on, but also the capacity of our global supplier base. And that’s something that I would say we are pretty far down that path, but clearly, as evidenced by the current limitations, we still have more room to go, and we will be making progress in the next coming quarters. And then, Tim, as my follow-on, giving us visibility 90 days out, given all the logistical issues are hard enough, thinking about the entire year as you did with your WFE comment even harder. But I am kind of curious, clearly, logic/foundry grows faster than memory this year, but we are sort of in this odd position where it kind of looks like from a cyclical perspective, the memory companies tend to be – or seem to be spending at a much more constrained level than maybe their logic/foundry partners for the first time ever. If you look at CapEx to rev ratios and growth of CapEx off the bottom, is that how you see it? And I guess, importantly, if it is, what implications might that have for memory spending as we go from ‘22 into ‘23? Okay. Well, I mean it’s – constrained is always more in the eye of the builder for the customer perhaps. But I think you are right that we are seeing a fairly balanced in fact, maybe more balanced spending profile within the memory space, at least is our current view. Maybe back to your original point, though, about visibility, our visibility at this point is much – we feel further out in terms of demand side. Our challenge is not understanding demand 6 months, 9 months, 12 months out, maybe even longer. It really is about growing the supply capability of our supply base and also our own capacity to meet that growing demand. But I think the implications are that we exit this year still perhaps with robust demand going into 2023. It’s too early to – we are not going to give a guide at this point for 2023, but I would say is whether it’s in memory or it’s in logic/foundry, a lot of big investments planned, fabs under construction, many of those don’t take the equipment even until starting in ‘23 or maybe even beyond. And so I think we are going to see robust WFE for the industry for years to come at this point. Thanks ,Tim. Thanks, John. And we will go to our next question from Mark Lipacis of Jefferies. Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. First question and I apologize, I am kind of new on the Lam call, so I apologize if this is elementary. But if we have the semiconductor shortages globally that are causing different vertical markets to lose tens, if not hundreds of billions of dollars in revenues. And you guys make the equipment that actually can solve that problem. Why aren’t Lam and your peers, the absolute number one priority customers for the semiconductors that can make the equipment that solve these challenges. It’s surreal to hear you guys talk about component shortages are preventing you from shipping product that can solve everybody’s problems. That’s the first question. I have a follow-up. Okay. I am not sure it’s such an elementary question, it’s quite a complex one. But I – boy, I guess, I would say that we try to make that point quite clear. And I think there has been a lot of discussion between companies like ours and the manufacturers just as there are many, many industries talking to those same suppliers about the urgent needs that they have. And so I don’t think we want to make this – we certainly did not say it’s all about chips, and that’s what’s limiting our supply. It’s one element of some of the component shortages and subsystem shortages, but it has been several other things as well. But I do believe that as we increase both our supplier capacity and our own capacity and output goes up, then that is key to alleviating the problem. And so maybe it becomes a virtuous cycle where more our output goes up, the easier the constraints get and therefore, our outlook goes up even faster. It’s certainly our objective to drive that and we are in close conversation with the semiconductor chip manufacturers who happen to be our customers as well about how they can help. And I would say that in most cases, those customers are stepping in and doing everything they possibly can to help because they want the equipment that we are shipping to them. Yes, Mark, I think the only thing I would add is, is typically, we wouldn’t be in the business of buying semiconductors, right. And that’s our suppliers or sometimes even the suppliers of our suppliers that would be procuring those chips. And because we know that group of our customers, their suppliers really, really well, that’s why we are stepping in. Maybe that helps. And we clearly have access to those guys. So, we can make this better quicker, I think is why we are pointing this out right now. Okay. Got it. That’s helpful. And a follow-up, if I may. I appreciate that you have – it sounds like you have very good visibility this year. What is – what kind of conversations do you have with your customers about 2023, appreciating that they may not be giving you hard orders that far out or maybe they do. But I mean, do you have those kind of planning discussions with your customers about what 2023 might look like? Can you give us any sense of how those conversations go? That’s all I have. Thank you. Yes, it’s a good question. I mean obviously, we have sufficient conversations for very long lead time decisions that we have to make. So, as I talk about our expansion of manufacturing facilities and hiring rates. One of the components, it’s not a – that has a relatively long lead time is the hiring of engineers that go on site to support those new customer facilities and projects. And so I would say we are already having discussions with customers about 2023 in earnest. But it’s a little too early to get as precise as many of you probably like in terms of what does the number for 2023 WFE looks like, and we are not going to have that conversation today. But I would say customers are giving a lot of just they want us to be ready. We are having those same conversations with our suppliers because we need them to be ready. And so you can just believe that we are having those conversations quite frequently and quite some temp with customers today. Thanks. Yes. Thank you. And we will go to our next question from Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Great. Thank you. Certainly understand the gross margin pressures based on the costs that you guys are taking on to sort of deal with all these issues. But your customers are kind of dealing with some of the same stuff and are raising prices and passing that on to their customers. If this ends up being a persistent situation where you have high freight costs and component costs and things like that, do you see gross margins kind of getting back to the level they were a couple of quarters ago? Yes, Joe, I do. I specifically – and you might have been jumping between calls as well. In my prepared remarks, I specifically said I believe gross margin will improve for us as the year progresses. Meaning the March quarter, I believe is a low point for the gross margin in the year. A lot because of these freight logistics and other things in the supply chain that we just need to go fix it, and that’s what we are doing. Okay. That makes sense. I mean I guess, just – you are fixing it because those costs are going away, or are you able to actually charge your customers expedites and things like that to deal with all of it? I think our objective is probably to do a little bit of both. As you mentioned, some of the issues may become persistent and built into the cost structure of the history, in which case those ultimately have to be accounted for in the pricing for the industry. And yes, obviously, we are very sensitive to the fact that customers in certain parts of our market are cost sensitive, and therefore, we will try to eliminate as many of the costs first. So, we are not taking the easy way out of just trying to pass the costs on trying to first eliminate them and then those that are persistent will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. Great. Thank you very much. Thanks Joe. And we will go on to our next question from Patrick Ho of Stifel. Thank you very much. Most of my questions have been answered. But maybe for Doug, with the supply chain issues that are going on right now, I know it’s difficult to give a granular answer. But how do you look at the allocations between what’s needed for new shipments and new tools versus your installed base business, which also has a lot of those type of components as well. And obviously, a lot of the customers are at high utilization. What’s the balance there that you are trying to do at least in the near-term to keep your customers as happy as possible on both ends? Yes, I am going to actually give this one to Tim, Patrick. Well, I think that’s because what I am going to tell you is that the most valuable tool for the customer is the one that’s in this fab in running. And so – of course, it doesn’t – we prioritize today keeping the installed base operating and outputting. And to one of the earlier questions, if we don’t do that, then problem just gets worse because chips aren’t being produced. So, we are having to make that call at certain points, but what I can tell you is that priority is the installed base and keeping tools in manufacturing and output in a way for us and have chips for the industry. But Patrick, I can either or we are mitigating both at the same time, and it’s not exactly the same supply group that is creating a spare part and new equipment. So, it’s maybe as much an overlap as you might say. Not yet. Not every constraint right now exists on a part that would be a spare. Certain subsystems and our tools are not field replaceable spares units. So, there is some overlap but not entirely, as Doug said. Great. Thank you very much. Thanks Patrick. Operator, we have time for one more question, please. And we will go to that last question from Atif Malik of Citi. Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Tim, you mentioned the gate all around selective edge revenues to double this year. I am curious about the size of this opportunity this year? Yes. To be more specific, what I actually said was – yes. What I actually said was that the selective etch revenue would double. The selective ventures actually used in more applications than just get all around, and I don’t think we are going to quantify the exact size of the business yet. Got it. And then is it possible for you to kind of quantify your exposure of sales to advanced packaging, heterogenic computing just in the ballpark? Yes. We – I don’t know that we have actually quantified it. But what I would say is that we provide a number of the very critical steps there. Obviously, some of the processes that we have talked about in the past are electroplating. Our etching processes are both critical to some of the high aspect ratio of processes like through-silicon via or other parts of the process to go into 3D packaging. So, it’s a priority market for us, and we have been doing quite well for a number of years in that space. Thank you. Thanks Atif. And I will now turn the call back to Tina Correia for any additional or closing comments. Thank you, operator, and thank you all for joining our call today. We appreciate your support. And so this concludes today’s call. We thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",the Lam Research quarterly earnings conference call is scheduled to last until 3 o’clock p.m. Pacific time . today's financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified .,0.0
2022-04-20,20,4,2022,466.3871765136719,-0.18275576878280864,0.0,1.0,Earnings Call Transcript Q3-2022,"Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the March quarter 2022 earnings conference call.
At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Tina Correia. Please, go ahead. Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the Lam Research quarterly earnings conference call. With me today are Tim Archer, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Doug Bettinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
During today's call, we will share our overview on the business environment, and we'll review our financial results for the March 2022 quarter and our outlook for the June 2022 quarter.
The press release detailing our financial results was distributed a little after 1:00 PM Pacific Time this afternoon. The release can also be found on the Investor Relations section of the company's website, along with the presentation slides that accompany today's call.
Today's presentation and Q&A include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factors disclosed in our SEC public filings. Please see accompanying slides in the presentation for additional information.
Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in the accompanying slides in the presentation. This call is scheduled to last until 3:00 PM Pacific Time. A replay of this call will be made available later this afternoon on our website.
And with that, I'll hand the call over Tim. Thank you, Tina. Lam reported revenues of $4.06 billion and earnings per share of $7.40 in a severely supply-constrained environment. While we were able to deliver results within our guided ranges, I am disappointed that we are not performing better in a very strong demand environment for our equipment and services.
Continued component shortages, along with new challenges that emerged, including COVID-related lockdowns, along with exacerbated an already stressed supply chain situation. As a result of the larger range of issues, our original expectation for the timing of output recovery proved to be optimistic.
In response, we have intensified the focus across Lam. We are committing the financial resources and workforce required to both meet our customers' priority tool needs in the short term, as well as increase the long-term resiliency of our global supply network.
Our recovery efforts span from embedding Lam experts at key suppliers to collaborate on shortages, to increasing field resources to accelerate installation of tools once shipped. Customers are partnering with us to qualify additional component suppliers, and we have assigned more engineering resources to work on design and sourcing for alternative parts to improve supply chain flexibility.
Despite the issues we still face, I am thankful for the tremendous efforts from Lam employees, our suppliers and our customers through this challenging period. While the near-term pace of supply chain recovery is difficult to assess, we are confident that our actions will result in progressive improvement in our performance on a go-forward basis.
Our deferred revenue balance exiting the March quarter was over $2 billion, as we shipped systems to customers to accelerate tool installation, but could not recognize this revenue within the quarter due to the lack of certain critical components. Doug will elaborate more on the deferred revenues in his prepared remarks.
On the demand side, the environment remains very strong. While continued supply-related delays could potentially limit how much wafer fabrication equipment investment can be executed in 2022, our current WFE view is still in the $100 billion range. We see unconstrained demand exceeding $100 billion in 2022 and any unmet demand should flow into next year. Our confidence is rooted in the fact that the powerful secular drivers of WFE spending are unchanged. Greater semiconductor content, rising device complexity and larger die sizes all contribute to a healthy setup for sustainably strong WFE levels. An example of this can be seen in the smartphone segment, where unit growth may be flattening year-over-year due to inflationary-driven softness in consumer markets, but the average NAND and DRAM content is increasing around 20% year-over-year, driving demand for WFE.
In servers, we see overall growth in both units and content with server DRAM content per CPU growing in the 20% range from the prior year. On top of this, the drivers of Lam-specific growth are also unchanged. Etch and deposition are critical technologies required to transition semiconductor manufacturing to higher performance and more scalable 3D device architectures in memory, foundry/logic and advanced packaging. Lam's leadership position in key enabling technologies for 3D devices, evidenced by our installed base in leading-edge fabs worldwide, is a solid foundation for long-term outperformance.
And with our continuing investment in an exceptional pipeline of new products and services, we are increasingly well positioned to win at the 3D inflections. On the technology front, we are winning new applications across etch and deposition and across all device segments. We are strengthening our overall market position by delivering differentiated solutions that enable higher aspect ratio structures, enhanced device performance and increased manufacturing productivity.
Over the past two calendar years, Lam's total revenue growth has exceeded that of our large peers. This is in part due to our gains in the foundry/logic market, where we were historically under-indexed. And it is also a result of our success in expanding our CSBG installed base opportunities. Through innovations like Lam's Equipment Intelligence solutions, we are helping address our customers' capacity constraints by utilizing vast quantities of tool data to improve system performance and enable faster tool installations.
In the March quarter, we expanded on our selective etch wins at a large foundry/logic customer. At the same time, we have added new wins in our conductor etch business. In one example, we are set to double our conductor etch share at a key foundry/logic customer as they transition to their next node. At another leading foundry/logic customer, we have successfully replaced a competitor's tool at a critical step by helping the customer accelerate their move to the newer node.
Key to our traction in these wins is our ability to enhance our product offerings with Equipment Intelligence solutions to deliver the best etch uniformity and improve yield, thereby addressing customers' cost and performance requirements as they execute their scaling roadmaps.
In deposition, we continue to see significant momentum for both our ALD metals and dielectric solutions for leading-edge foundry/logic nodes. In DRAM, where the highest performance devices are adopting more advanced CMOS technology like high-K metal gate transistors, we have leveraged our foundry/logic success to win new applications in the DRAM 1b [ph] node. As customers ramp capacity on these nodes, our etch share in this segment is set to expand.
In deposition, our critical spacer applications enable lower-capacitance thinner films to support further device size and power scaling. In the March quarter, we secured two wins for critical spacers at a large DRAM customer for their leading node. In the NAND segment, we also won a highly contested decision at a key customer where we demonstrated a superior ALD solution for a critical transition to a next-generation low-resistance enabling film for their Worldline applications.
Shifting to our CSBG business, results were down modestly in the March quarter, predominantly due to the global supply constraints that impacted our reliance and upgrades businesses. While CSBG is subject to quarterly fluctuations, we believe our expanding installed base over a longer period offers a stable platform for revenue growth.
During the March quarter, we secured fairs contracts at two of the world's largest IDMs with the cumulative contract amount exceeding $1 billion. We see calendar year 2022 to be another strong growth year for our CSBG business.
So, to wrap-up, we believe we are making progress on the extraordinary industry supply challenges, but overcoming the breadth of issues that have emerged is taking longer than we initially expected.
We are focused on meeting the critical needs of our customers and have committed both the financial resources and workforce required to recover as quickly as possible. With continued strength in the equipment demand environment and progressive improvement in our supply chain, we do expect Lam to post another solid year of revenue and EPS growth.
With that, I'll turn it over to Doug. Excellent. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our call today during what I know is a busy earnings season. In the March 2022 quarter, we delivered results within the guidance ranges for all our financial metrics. However, we missed the midpoint for all numbers.
As Tim discussed, we experienced broadening supply chain issues that negatively impacted our revenue as well as our profitability. Delays in securing critical parts needed for shipments of our tools hindered our ability to meet our revenue objective and led to increased spending as we focused on initiatives to mitigate these constraints.
Deferred revenue grew by over $600 million. The magnitude of the increase reflects the heightened degree of part shortages that we're experiencing, which impacts our ability to recognize revenue on tools that we've actually shipped. Our inventory balance also increased as we're procuring the parts that we can in building to meet the growing unmet demand that we see.
On the margin side, we have headwinds from adding resources to address the supply chain challenges as well as to be prepared for the higher volumes we see in the second half. Additionally, we have ongoing supply-related inflationary pressures. We were able to partially offset the gross margin headwinds through operating expense management during the quarter. As a result, March operating income and earnings per share came in closer to the midpoint of our guidance. We see ongoing cost and supply constraint challenges continuing to impact our guidance for the June quarter.
Let me now turn to the details of our revenue for the March quarter. Revenue came in at $4.06 billion, a decrease from the December quarter. The memory segment was sequentially stronger in the March quarter with concentration of 66% of systems revenues. This was up from the prior quarter level of 58%. The strength in memory during the quarter was led by the DRAM segment where we had a record level of revenue for the company and a percent concentration at 27% of systems revenues. This compares with 23% that we saw in the December quarter.
The DRAM investments were primarily for 1z and 1-alpha node additions as well as conversions. The NAND segment was 39% of our systems revenue, higher than the 35% in the prior quarter. Our NAND customers are investing in tools for 128-layer to 192-layer devices.
In foundry, March quarter revenue comprised 21% of our systems revenue versus 31% that we saw in December. The decrease quarter-to-quarter is related to the timing of customer investments. There continues to be solid investments in this segment to address end demand drivers such as AI, IoT, cloud, high-performance computing and 5G. I would expect to see increases in this segment as we progress through the year related to both leading as well as mature node device investments.
We see continued progress in the Logic/Other segment, which contributed 13% of systems revenue in the March quarter and is a record in terms of revenue dollars. We're seeing good traction here, notably in etch, as we expect continued growth in this segment during calendar year 2022 as our customers invest to meet the demand requirements in the market for microprocessors, image sensors and advanced packaging solutions.
I'll now turn to the regional composition of our total revenue. The China region came in at 31% of total revenue. The split of the China revenues was fairly balanced between the domestic and multinational customers that have fab locations in China. There was also a strong concentration of investments by our customers in the Korea and Taiwan regions, which comprised 24% and 16% of our total revenues, respectively, in the March quarter.
The Customer Support Business Group revenue was approximately $1.4 billion, which was down 5% from the prior quarter. CSBG was 8% higher than the March quarter of calendar 2021. Our reliance and upgrade product line revenues were negatively impacted in the March quarter by the ongoing supply chain constraints.
Nonetheless, there continues to be healthy demand in the specialty market across numerous customers as well as investments by our customers for upgrades across their installed fleet of tools. Our spares business remains strong, given the high utilization levels in the industry, and we're also seeing solid customer pull for services for the same reason. As we've noted in the past, CSBG's can fluctuate on a quarterly basis but our expectations continue to be that this business will grow annually.
Let me now shift to our gross margin performance. The March quarter came in at 44.7%. We are experiencing a multitude of cost pressures with increases in freight and logistics rates, raw materials costs driven by commodities such as nickel and aluminum, as well as increased integrated circuit costs. Our June quarter guidance reflects our expectations for a sustained level of cost headwinds, as we manage through and adapt to this inflationary environment.
Operating expenses for March were $621 million, down from the prior quarter level of $627 million. We managed our overall spending levels during the quarter, while continuing our focus on supporting our emerging customers' technology road maps.
We are also deploying incremental R&D resources towards qualifying new supply sources to help improve our supply chain challenges. Incentive compensation expenses that, as you know, are tied to the company's profitability, were also lower in the quarter.
The March quarter operating margin was 29.4%. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was approximately 10%. And as I've shared with you in the past, the tax rate will have some fluctuations from quarter to quarter.
Looking into calendar year 2022, we expect the ongoing tax rate to be in the low teens level. And I just mentioned that we continue to monitor potential tax changes in the United States that are under discussion. But given the uncertainty there, we've not yet reflected the impact of any changes in our modeling.
Other income and expense came in for the quarter at approximately $44 million in expense. And I'll just remind you, in the December quarter, we had income for this line item due to a gain in one of our venture investments that had raised capital in a public offering.
We also had favorable results from our venture investments since the time we set guidance that contributed positively in the March quarter by approximately $0.11 in earnings per share.
OI&E is subject to market-related fluctuations that will cause some level of volatility in this P&L line item. We're forecasting a more negative OI&E impact in June's guidance based on what we currently see in the equity markets.
We were active in our buybacks during the March quarter, allocating over $1.2 billion towards share repurchases. The cash was deployed in a combination of open market repurchases, as well as an accelerated share repurchase program. The ASR will continue to execute during the June quarter.
We paid $211 million in dividends during the March quarter as well. March quarter diluted earnings per share was $7.40. Diluted share count was 140 million shares, which was lower than the December quarter and less than our March quarter expectation due to the increased share repurchase activity.
Let me shift to the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash, ended at $4.6 billion, which was down from the prior quarter level of $5.6 billion. The decrease was primarily driven by the capital return activities that I just spoke about.
Additionally, operating cash was at a somewhat lower level this quarter due in parts to the investments we're making in inventory to help mitigate some of the supply challenges.
Inventory turns were down from the prior quarter level, coming in at 2.6 times. Also, due to the timing of customer shipments occurring later in the quarter, our days sales outstanding came in at 83 days, which was an increase from 73 days that we saw in the December quarter.
Non-cash expenses for the March quarter included approximately $69 million in equity compensation, $64 million in depreciation and $20 million for amortization. Capital expenditures in the March quarter were approximately $145 million, which was fairly flat with the December level.
Capital expenditures were mainly focused for growth activities such as our silicon spare parts facility in Ohio, the Malaysia factory expansion and the new Korea Technology Center. We had approximately 16,900 regular full-time employees as of the end of the March quarter, which is an increase of approximately 600 people from the prior quarter. We had headcount growth primarily in the factory and field organizations to address supply chain constraints, while supporting customer deliveries and installations.
Let me now shift and look at our non-GAAP guidance for the June 2022 quarter. We're expecting revenue of $4.2 billion, plus or minus $300 million. While customer demand continues to be strong, we see ongoing supply chain constraints. Gross margin of 44.5%, plus or minus one percentage point. Our guidance reflects expectations of an inflationary cost environment and the continuing need to very tactically manage the execution in the supply chain. Operating margins of 29.5%, plus or minus one percentage point. And finally, earnings per share of $7.25, plus or minus $0.75 based on the share count of approximately 139 million shares.
So then let me wrap things up. Our execution in the March quarter came in a little short of our expectations. While we work through incremental challenges with our supply chain that is continuing to limit our output, demand remains robust. Exiting the March quarter, we had our sixth consecutive quarter of growing backlog. Visibility to end demand is high. We have a solid foundation in our share position, with strong traction to-date and new opportunities going forward in all market segments.
Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. Tim and I would now like to open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. We tend to think about the supply chain challenges as slowing the growth of new capacity or new technology migrations. But as the supply chain challenges have continued to broaden out, is it now to a point where it's starting to potentially impact your customers' installed manufacturing operations to your CSBG business, either capping shipments of spares, targets? I know CSBG was down about 5% sequentially in a period where your customers continued to run pretty much full out of manufacturing utilizations. And I know that you said CSBG was mostly impacted by reliant and upgrades. So, is it fair to assume that the services segment, that part of it which supports your customers' installed manufacturing operations, is not being impacted by supply chain challenges? Yes, Harlan, that's a -- it's a good question, and I guess I'd just remind everybody that the CSBG business is made up of four different product lines, as we just mentioned, spares, services, upgrades and then the reliant, which is the more mature node systems. And each of those is kind of impacted differently. If you look at what is the top priority for customers and the top priority for Lam is to keep all of the installed base, which now numbers something over 75,000 systems running every single day inside of those fabs. And so we're not going to compromise normal customers on spare parts, for instance. And so as we think about priorities here, you put the -- in terms of the spares and installed base runs services.
I talked a little bit about Equipment Intelligence. We're looking for ways where you can work around some of the constraints. I mean, Equipment Intelligence, using data to determine when do I really have to replace parts? How do I -- how frequently do I really have to do preventative maintenance to keep the performance of the tool where I need it to be? And so I would say services actually, there's probably a little bit of an uptick in demand for us to do more services on the tool.
But what does get impacted, Reliant Systems, those are tools. They are affected by the same constraints as our leading-edge systems. They need all of those components. They have communications, they need chips, they need other things. So, those are impacted just the same way as leading edge.
And then upgrades, similarly, most of the upgrades we're doing are actually components that would also go into new systems. So, we work with customers to see which is the right priority call. Is it to put the new system on the particular quarter, you can see that we're talking about some impact to the upgrades business.
So, hopefully, that helps explain how kind of those different segments get affected. But as I said, over the longer period, the installed base will continue to grow. It grows every single quarter, and we expect the CSBG business to expand in line with that. And Harlan, maybe the only other thing I would add is spares, I think, is in a better situation because our customers hold some inventory. We hold inventory. There's always been a historic level of inventory. And so I think that's part of the reason why we don't believe we're impacting the installed base. Probably has got a little bit of inventory sitting there. Great. No, thanks for the insights. That's very helpful. And Doug, I know the situation is still pretty fluid, but given yours and your suppliers' purchase commitments on components, you're boosting support and logistical resources and then you've got the ramp of Malaysia, which I'm assuming has continued to go as planned, and then you also have your forecasted shipments for the second half. You put all of that together, like how should we think about gross margins through the second half of this year? Yes. Harlan, as I sit here today, I do believe that gross margin will improve as we progress through the year. I'll remind you that I said that same thing last quarter and then we ticked down a little bit and missed our number a little bit in March, so I'll acknowledge we don't always get it right. But as we sit here today, I expect it will improve as we progress through the year and as we improve the supply chain output capability, Harlan. All right. Thank you. Thanks Harlan. We'll take our next question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Yes, good afternoon guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. My first one, Doug, is just implied in your June quarter guide, do you expect deferred revenue to go up, flat or down? And then I guess as you think about maintaining the $100 billion WFE for the full calendar year, does that sort of imply that the $1 billion buildup you've seen in deferred revenue in December and March comes down by $1 billion in the back half of the year? Just help me understand how that dynamic works. Yes, John, I mean, if I was guessing right now, I think deferred probably grows a little bit again in June, and then I hope begin to work our way through some of it as the supply chain gets caught up. I mean, there's $2 billion sitting there at the end of the quarter that we just need to ship parts to things we've already shipped. The base tool, too, in revenue will benefit from that. That's helpful. And then my follow-up for Tim. Tim, I'm struck a little bit by, in the PowerPoint, you talked about maintaining the $100 billion for this year but you talk about unconstrained WFE being above that. I guess, what's the risk that oftentimes constraints create its own demand and customers, because they can't get what they want, they're just placing significantly larger orders into your backlog than they would be otherwise? And I guess, is there a significant financial consequence if a customer comes back and reschedules delivery and timing later on? Yeah. So it's a good question. And I think first of all, I mean, we usually get a question around whether that order is placed with multiple suppliers, which is not very common in the equipment space. So to your point, perhaps instead is the demand being overstated to try to drive a sense of urgency. I think that's kind of what you were pointing out. We have very close and frequent discussions with customers. And I think what we're pointing out is that even if there is a little bit of that, which I don't actually believe there is, but if there were, unconstrained demand is well over what can be supplied this year. And therefore, we felt comfortable saying that, we're driving for that execution to the $100 billion WFE level.
From a financial implications perspective, either to Lam or the customers, it depends on how close you are when the rescheduling occurs. If we're talking about tools that are and a forecast that's now through the remainder of this year, and some of these forecasts are now pushing into second half of 2023. There is really no financial implication to Lam other than we're driving to ensure that our capacity and our supply chain would have capability to ramp up to those levels. And so that's – it probably depends on very much the timing of the change and that would affect kind of the implications. Perfect. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Yep. Thank you, John. We'll take our next question from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Please go ahead. Yeah. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I'm trying to get an idea of what the second half calendar year ramp might look like. If you assume your share just holds steady with WFE at $95 billion to $100 billion, it's implying a tool ramp of like 25% to 40% half-on-half. And so I guess, what are you capable of doing, given the resources you have? And should we be thinking about a pickup in Q3 and then a larger one in Q4 and how should we think about the progression of gross margins as the recovery unfolds? Well, I'll take the ramp question. I mean, clearly, we – as I mentioned, kind of feel like we're underperforming in the first half of this year to the capacity of Lam's facilities. We invested in expanding every factory we have around the world in 2021, and we talked about the fact that we can ramp those factories further. We're constrained by supply. We are qualifying additional suppliers. We're working and investing with our suppliers to ramp up their own capacity. And maybe we need to distinguish a little bit too, and I'll let Doug confirm, but it's – as we look at the deferred revenue piece versus the work that's actually being done.
As Doug mentioned, we're actually shipping at a much higher rate than we're recognizing revenue in the first half of this year. So as we look to execute that $100 billion WFE for the entire year, the second half doesn't have to ramp up quite as much from a Lam factory perspective. We need to keep shipping, show progressive improving in output and also clear the critical components that are needed to recognize revenue for that deferred balance. Yes, exactly right. Nothing to add on that. And C.J., on the gross margin thing, I tried to answer it when Harlan asked. As I sit here today, I think it gets better in the second half. As we increase our output capability, our supply chain increases its output capability.
We work to mitigate some of these constraints and absorb somewhat more of the fixed cost. I think it gets better. And then, I'll remind you that I told you the same thing last quarter and I was a little bit wrong in March, but that's what I see right now, C.J. Great. And I guess as my follow-up question, for CSBG, you talked about expectations for another strong growth year. Can we infer from that, that you expect a minimum of double-digit growth? Yes, I'm not going to quantify it for you. All the same dynamics are in place, right? Chamber counts grew nicely last year. It’s going to grow nicely again this year, given the strength in WFE. Utilization in the industry is very high. Investment across all aspects of that business are doing well. We're just a little bit behind on the supply chain stuff. Thank you. Thanks, C.J. We'll take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead. Thanks a lot. Doug, I had two. The first is a follow-up from this prior question. So if I just flow through the excess deferred revenue, which you have about $1.5 billion worth of just excess deferred revenue, because you're always going to have some deferred.
So if you assume that you get that all during the back half of the year, which maybe you don't, but you should get most of it, I would think, then that would assume that systems revenue would grow at least 30% in like the back half of the year, half-on-half.
So I know that you don't want to provide guidance for the year, but I'm just wondering if you can maybe hold our hand a little bit on, sort of, what the back half of the year revenue would be. Is it reasonable to say that, yes, systems revenue will grow at least 30%, something like that? Yes. Tim, you know I'm not going to give you a number. We always do this dance with the numbers, but how you're thinking about it is consistent with what I see. Yes, that deferred revenue is up above that amount that you described. There is a run rate of it that's always there, probably in the range that you're suggesting.
We need to get the supply chain caught up with it, right? We need to work our way through making it better, get caught up with the stuff that's sitting there, improve what we're shipping, so that there's less of it, and that's very much what we're investing dollars and resources to do. Thanks. And then I guess, Doug, just a question on gross margin. That's the lowest since 2015 and it's on triple the revenue versus then. And I'm wondering if maybe you can do two things: one, break down the headwinds.
I know there's a lot of different things going on, but if you could break down the headwinds. And then also, I guess, the question is, is it possible for you to pass some of these costs, because you're going to have to now invest in your supply chain and whatnot? Can you pass some of this on to your customers or are you just going to have to eat that? Yes. Tim, your observation's right. The way I think about this is, our long-term profitability objectives from a margin standpoint are unchanged to what we had in that model two-plus years ago at this point, right? So don't change your thinking on that.
Some of these upticks in inflation are permanent, and for that, we must get paid, right? We must get paid for the value we're creating and what it takes to create that value. We've done some of that and we need to continue working at that.
Some of these cost increases are transitory in nature. And for that, we've got to work our way through beating the cost back a little bit. We have to be able to do both. So when you go in and talk to your customers, you explain, hey, we're doing our part and we need a little help on this other part. So, it's very much how we're thinking about it. You're right, margins are below where we want it to be. Part of it is absorbing fixed cost and part of it is freight and logistics are expensive, integrated circuits are expensive right now. We'll get paid where we need to get paid, and we'll work the cost down where we need to work the cost down. I don't know, Tim, anything you want to add? No, I think that pretty much captures it. I do believe we can get paid for value. We also look at ways in which we can develop, in this era and period of rising costs, we can kind of find true win-wins with the customers. And so, we are focused on solutions that drive productivity. Those are areas where you can try to take cost out, you can make the tool more productive for the customer and get paid a higher value for that as well.
And again, back to mentioning Equipment Intelligence Solutions, these are things where again, you're truly removing some of the cost of operating the system by using data. And that allows us to get paid for those services and also perhaps charge fair value for whether it's the spares or the service work that's being done. And the customer also gets productivity and it feels like they came out on the good end of that as well. Awesome. Thank you. Thanks Tim. We'll take our next question from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking the question. I guess I had two as well. The first one, I realize it's a supply-constrained year, Doug, but curious if you've seen any fluctuations in customer pull across different device types, if you can speak to DRAM, NAND, leading edge, logic, foundry lagging edge. To the extent you've picked up any changes to the upside or the downside, I'd be curious to hear? Yes, Toshiya, really no changes. Demand continues to be very strong across every segment of our business, memory, foundry, logic. We haven't really seen any change in that at all. Got it. And then as my follow-up, I wanted to ask about the Logic IDM business. Really nice to see you guys make new highs here. I think you spoke to microprocessors and image sensors and I think advanced packaging in your prepared comments. I think a lot of us are focused and looking forward to continued traction in the MPU business. And I realize you don't want to talk about specific customers. But if you can kind of remind us where you are kind of in the progression there from a market share perspective, particularly in etch. To the extent you can comment, that would be super helpful? Thank you. So Toshi, as you said, we don't want to talk about any one specific customer, but I gave you several proof points within foundry/logic. I mean, it's an area we know that we've been underexposed because of our product portfolio and perhaps market share. We've been working hard to introduce new products to expand our opportunity, but also to win more with the products we have. And I think that's exactly what you're seeing in, every time a transition -- a node transition occurs, our served market is getting bigger and we're gaining market share. And that's not just true for certain customers. It's true, we think, for all the customers in terms of -- especially the opportunities and our portfolio is serving.
Yes, I talked about -- on the last call, the work we've been doing in selective etching, the new portfolio of products there, targeting gate all around for instance, and I talked about that expanding this quarter as well. Those are the things that we're doing to try to make sure that our foundry/logic future is better than the past. Thank you. Thanks Toshiya. We'll take our next question from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk about what the supply constraints are. Is it the same constraints that you saw in December or is it new stuff? And how much of it is semiconductors versus non-semiconductor products? Yes, I can take a shot at it. I mean, it's pretty broad-based. I mean, clearly, we've talked about the fact that ICs themselves are a big component of the shortages and maybe one of the very long lead-time parts of that -- of the shortages.
Our systems are incredibly complex and they use a lot of semiconductors inside of subsystems that go into our tools. So, that is a big part of it. But we also talked about the broadening. Some of the broadening was in other types of fabricated parts, subsystems that go into our tools, that require materials and skilled labor that found itself in short just working with each of those suppliers to either shore up their capacity or working with those suppliers and customers to qualify alternative parts, components and where necessary, alternative suppliers.
And so that's what gives us confidence that as time moves on and those qualifications take place and customers can accept those new suppliers and those new components, that the flexibility and resiliency of our supply chain improves throughout the rest of the year. Great. Thank you. And then as my follow-up, the comment that you made a few minutes ago that deferred revenue would be up kind of slightly in June, I guess I'm a little surprised by that, given that you -- your revenues are up $150 million. And this quarter, you had $600 million of kind of unfulfilled demand. So, I would have thought that the overall demand in June is at least flat. And so with revenues up $150 million, that the deferred would again be up quite a bit, is there something I'm missing there? Like I said, I'm not going to get into guiding a whole bunch of numbers on the balance sheet because it's hard enough to get the numbers that we just missed a little bit, right? I do think it will be up somewhat, Joe. That's what I said. I didn't put a number to it. Great. Thank you. Thanks Joe. We'll take our next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Thanks for taking my questions. For the first one, I'm curious if the lockdowns in China are playing a role in the constraints that you're seeing. And I think, Tim, you mentioned that some of the constraints are due to long lead time ICs. What is your line of sight into that? Any improvement on that side?
Because I guess my real question is, should we be assuming a gradual improvement as we get into calendar Q3, or is this more of a weighted -- kind of, backup weighted large catch-up improvement? So, just any views on whether China's lockdowns are playing a role, and what these long lead-times on the IC side tell you about when you can start to see any recovery on the supply side? Yes. Well, we've talked about progressive improvement, so we do believe that things get better in the supply chain as a whole. We break it down -- your question about the COVID lockdowns in China, anything that was a new issue, anything that disrupts freight and logistics in and out of an important location where we do have suppliers, obviously, you lose time, either due to delays in getting parts in or out of those locations. So, that did have some impact in the quarter. But more broadly, I think each component, each constraint within the supply chain will likely recover at a slightly different pace, though I mentioned that predicting the exact pace for every component will be difficult. But from a – when I talked about the long lead time ICs, really, what I was meaning was that I think that the few shortages in ICs, it's a multi, multi-quarter situation before we really feel that anything you order has normal lead times as it used to in the past.
Other elements of the supply chain that were more related to either lockdowns or maybe labor shortages or some shortage in materials, I think those recover more quickly and that's built into our outlook for the year where we see this progressive improvement through the rest of the year. All right. And for my follow-up, maybe Doug, one on gross margins, kind of two parts to it. I'm very curious, others in the semiconductor industry have been able to raise prices and pass along almost every kind of cost inflation, right? You look at the gross margins for all the semiconductor companies, they are doing better than before. So what has prevented the equipment makers to pass along these higher costs if demand is so strong and so high? Like do you have flexibility to raise prices in the future, right, to recover these costs? And are there certain aspects of costs that are more structural in nature that could prevent Lam from recovering the three or four points, I think, the delta in gross margins that you should be operating at, at these revenue levels? Yeah. No, Vivek. Nothing, like, restricts us from adjusting pricing or doing that. I mean, there's a cadence with which you talk to customers about things, how your output's improving, my inflation is doing X, Y and Z, we need to work through this together. But nothing restricts us from doing that. And we have done some, right? It's not as if we haven't done some of that. We have. New things have emerged. I mean, freight rates continue to be a challenge. That should get better. I mean, frankly, it's back to what I said earlier.
The costs that are more permanent in nature, we're going to get paid for. The stuff that is transitory, we got to kind of work our way through managing the cost. We have a responsibility to do both and we are doing both. I wouldn't want you, in the long term, to think of our profitability objectives any different than we've communicated them before, right? We're 300 basis points where we want to be, 250 to 300, and we're going to go work our way back to that level. Thank you. Thank you. We'll take our next question from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one, look, I understand it's a very fluid environment and things are getting worse, and I get what happened in the quarter. But I guess looking forward, given the overall environment is tougher, are you taking that higher level of potential caution in line when you're actually giving your guidance? Maybe a better way to ask is, do you feel better about your June guidance now at this point versus how you felt about your – when you gave your March quarter guidance in December? Like do you have more confidence in that June quarter outlook versus how you felt about the prior guidance, just given the deterioration in the broader environment? And how are you taking that into account? Yes, Stacy, I'll try first and then Tim can then add. We never communicated some numbers we intend to miss, let me describe that. To the best of our ability, we comprehend risk, opportunity. I look at ranges. I look at things that could happen. Frankly, what happened in March is things got worse than we expected in the supply chain.
Some things we didn't anticipate. Just they got somewhat worse, right? And do I feel like the number I just gave you, the $4.2 billion is a good number? I do, based on everything I see and the linearity of shipments and what we're doing with the supply chain and all the task force we have working through things with suppliers.
As I sit here today, I’m -- I have confidence in that number or we wouldn’t have given it to you. So things can change though and that's what happened to us last quarter. We're working real hard to ensure that, that doesn't happen in June, and I don't expect it to. I don't know, Tim, anything you want to add on? No, I think I would just reiterate, I mean, the amount of focus and attention and effort and investment to ensure that we're recovering the supply chain and recovering our output and supporting our customers has never been higher.
And so, I think, that as Doug said, we have confidence that we have a good line of sight to the numbers that we -- and the tools and the parts and everything that's needed to make that up, and that's what we plan to go execute. All right. Thank you, guys. For my follow-up, understanding you're obviously shipping below apparent demand and demand is obviously strong, do you have any way to quantify the gap between the apparent demand that is out there and your ability to supply that data?
I mean, like is it -- is demand 20% above where you're able to ship right now? Is it more? Is it -- any kind of quantification or color you can give on somewhat above and beyond just where the deferred revenue is sitting? Yes. Stacy, that's why we give you an annual WFE outlook, because that actually is a proxy in some ways for what demand on the entire industry looks like to the best of our ability. That's why we try to communicate it and that's the $100 billion, still somewhat supply-limited, though, as Tim said.
We think demand is actually so much stronger than that. But the WFE is what we're -- when we give you that annual number, that's what we're trying to help you think or see what we're seeing, I guess, is what I would say. Got it. That’s helpful. Thank you, guys. Thanks, Stacy. We'll take our next question from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company. Please, go ahead. Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. My first one is for Tim or Doug. It seems like Lam has been more impacted by the supply constraints versus your large-cap peers. And is this because you're a dep etch company? So due to the vacuum nature, more complex components the dep etch products have, you're more impacted?
And if so, whenever the supply eases, do you think there's a pent-up demand for dep etch equipment relative to like process control or CMP or Epi, since it seems like your customers are buying whatever tools they can get their hands on? So I'm kind of curious, would love to hear your thoughts on that. And then I had a follow-up. Okay. So it's a good question. I mean, obviously, I can't speak in great detail to other people's supply chains, but ours is quite complex. And it's just as you said, we -- if you think about etch and deposition equipment, it has a lot of requirements for very complicated gas delivery systems, vacuum systems, power generation and delivery systems.
And those things not only require, as we talked about, a lot of ICs and control capabilities, but also just a tremendous amount of subsystem fabrication, high-purity gas line fabrication, a lot of complexity there.
And so, I don't know if we are or are not uniquely impacted in that way. But clearly, we are focused on shoring up each of those areas where we see impact. And as I mentioned, the main point is where we can find qualification of additional suppliers who can meet our requirements for the parts and quality that's needed, then we're qualifying those and that increases our capacity. Over the long run, what it also does is, it gives us flexibility.
As I look forward, this investment we're making today to increase the resilience of our supply chain will pay off in the long term because we'll have more suppliers. We'll have suppliers in the regions closer to where our factories are. And I think in the future, that's going to give us some ability to respond to demand in a much more cost-effective way as well. And so, to the long-term gross margin, as I think about that, the investments we're making today are actually good from that perspective. Got it, got it. Thanks, Tim. And then a follow-up for you Tim is, clearly it seems like everyone is in the same boat. Constrain that supply demand is much better than supply. But do you think there are like any market share shifts happening currently due to supply constrained misses, or do your customers take a much longer time to make the shared decisions compared to the last nine months or so, supply-constrained environment we've been living with? Well, I think obviously, it's hard to speak to what the customers would do, but it is very difficult to -- most of these decisions on pooling, the process qualification work is all done far in advance of the production needs. And so, I think part of the reason why everybody is feeling so stressed in this environment, from customers to equipment suppliers, maybe even to our own suppliers, is all of those parts, choices and tooling choices are made very far in advance, and to requalify is incredibly difficult.
And that's even why our output recovery timing is longer -- is taking longer than we might have anticipated. It takes a while to qualify an alternative supplier. I think the same thing would be true for customers and semiconductor manufacturing equipment. So, a long way of saying, I don't believe you're seeing market share shifts in this near term due to these capacity constraints. Got it. Thanks a lot, Tim. Thanks, Krish. We'll take our next question from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please go ahead. Hey, thanks for taking my question. I had two. Just one, maybe I'm looking at this the wrong way, but you called out reliant and spares as being the big source of the miss. I guess, versus the midpoint, you missed by 200 in March and June. I think CBG is down like 80 and products down. So maybe just -- maybe I'm not understanding why reliant is the biggest issue? Yes, Blayne, maybe you misunderstood us. We didn't intend to communicate that. I didn't specifically say we missed because of one thing or another. Frankly, we missed because of supply chain constraints for equipment across the board that's in new equipment. It's also in the Reliant product line in CSBG as well as upgrades in CSBG. So it's across all of that is what we tried to, maybe not very well, but that's what we tried to communicate. Got you. And then just a broader question. I think everybody's asked everything they can on the supply constraints. I'm just kind of curious, I don't expect you to be the only one, you haven’t than this quarter already and you went first. I'm assuming this is going to be a massive supply chain problem for your customers.
And I'm just curious if you've seen any indications that they've pushed their capacity addition plans out to the right as well. I don't know everybody is going to try to figure out like the last question asked, in terms of how each company lines up? And I'm just kind of curious how things are handled. Do you think they'll just take whatever equipment they can and try to piece it together, or do you -- will you see capacity additions kind of push commensurate with the equipment they can't get? I guess the simplest way for us to answer it is that, we've seen no change in demand or no change in the pressure we receive from customers to deliver to their original schedule. And so that's why when we look at the investments we're making to try to accelerate recovery of our output to meet their demands, that's because their demand has not changed at all.
To your point of, will they take different tools at different times, I think that there's a lot of things that we're working on with customers to try to meet their capacity constraints if we can't get them the tooling on the exact date they want. We talked about accelerated installs. I talked about increasing like services to get a little bit more output from tools they might have already installed into that fab.
I think there's just a lot of partnership and creativity going into how to work through these constraints over the next -- that have existed for a couple of quarters and likely will continue to exist as we move through the next couple. Thanks Tim. Thanks Blayne. Appreciate it. We'll take our next question from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Hi, thanks for taking my question. I have just one. Do you guys have a view about what industry capacity in wafers is going to grow this year or next year based on the wafer fab equipment expectations you have?
Obviously, there's a debate out there about how much capacity could come online, given the magnitude today of wafer fab equipment versus five or seven years ago. So, I was wondering if you had a view on that. If you don't have a view for the industry, I'm wondering if you have a view for maybe a set or a subset of your largest customers, if you have some kind of sense about what wafer capacity is growing this year and next year. Mark, I'll talk maybe a little bit about this year. These aren't numbers we normally give out. But I would tell you, when I look across the totality where investments are occurring, I see wafer capacity growing everywhere, almost everywhere; in memory, in foundry, in logic and probably across nearly every process node in foundry as well, right? I mean, things are tight.
The ICs we're trying to get are across every different process node and everybody is investing to try to get caught up with demand. So, while we don't share those numbers, I think everything is ticking up somewhat or trying to anyway, based on the investment plans they have. Got you. Thank you. Yes, thanks Mark. Operator, we'll do one more question and then I think we're about out of time. Okay. We'll take our last question from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead. Yes, thanks for taking my question. Doug, in January, I believe you guys were talking about growth in wafer fab equipment next year. With all the scenarios going on with global GDP contraction and macro corrections and even recession next year, curious what your thoughts are about WFE next year? Yes, Atif, you know we don't do more than one year at a time. I mean, clearly, you've got a softening in the economy for a variety of different reasons. And I do observe when we look across all of the semi industry, the more consumer-oriented kind of consumption in semis is probably softening a little bit.
Smartphone units aren't as strong perhaps as we thought. PC is probably the same thing. High-performance computing is still very strong. So, it's kind of what I see happening. When Tim and the sales guys talk to our customers though, everybody is full steam ahead with their investment plans in terms of equipment. So that's what I see. I'm not going to quite tell you at 2023 yet. But the fact that we're under shipping what customers want this year, that stuff's I know is going to roll into next year. So sit tight. We'll talk about 2023 as we get a little further through the year. I understand. As a follow-up, I get the component and the subsystem supply constraints. Are you seeing impact to your shipments from material shortages like neon and coolant using etch and deposition tools are the – is availability of those materials impacting your shipments or your customers have enough buffer on those materials? So far, it's – I would say that, we haven't identified those yet as significant constraints. But we're obviously watching every new issue that comes up and assessing its impact. But so far, we wouldn't identify those as key issues right now. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you, Atif. Operator, that's about it for time for us. Appreciate everybody joining us on the call today. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. We appreciate your participation.

At this time, I’d like to turn the conference over to Tina Correia. Please go ahead. Thank you, operator and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to the Lam Research quarterly earnings conference call. With me today are Tim Archer, President and Chief Executive Officer and Doug Bettinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
During today’s call, we will share our overview on the business environment and we will review our financial results for the June 2022 quarter and our outlook for the September 2022 quarter. The press release detailing our financial results was distributed a little after 1:00 p.m. Pacific Time this afternoon. The release can also be found on the Investor Relations section of the company’s website, along with the presentation slides that accompany today’s call.
Today’s presentation and Q&A include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factors disclosed in our SEC public filings. Please see accompanying slides in the presentation for additional information. Today’s discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in the accompanying slides in the presentation. This call is scheduled to last until 3:00 p.m. Pacific Time. A replay of this call will be made available later this afternoon on our website.
And with that, I will hand the call over to Tim. Thanks, Tina. Good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. Lam’s June quarter results were much stronger than we originally anticipated. Revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share achieved new quarterly records and we are well ahead of our guidance for the quarter. Industry-wide shortages continue to impact output and the efficiency of our operations. However, specific actions we have taken in our supply chain in recent quarters are allowing us to execute more effectively in the supply-constrained environment. I want to thank our global Lam teams, including our supply chain operations and engineering groups as well as our suppliers and customers for demonstrating incredible dedication, agility and partnership in the face of significant challenges. In the June quarter, we continued to see good momentum with our product and installed base initiatives with foundry logic systems and CSPG revenues both reaching new highs.
Our performance this quarter adds to my confidence that Lam will emerge from this period of industry disruption, stronger, more resilient and even better positioned in our markets. As suggested by our guidance today, we expect to see incremental improvement in supply chain conditions in the September quarter, but our view is that industry-wide output will continue to be constrained through the rest of this year. Consequently, we are lowering our outlook for calendar year 2022 wafer fab equipment spending to be in the low to mid-$90 billion range.
Overall, semiconductor demand remains robust, but with some macro-driven pockets of weakness, particularly in consumer-focused markets. We see strong foundry logic spending outgrowing both NAND and DRAM investments. In the longer term, we expect industry growth to be driven by the increasingly vital role semiconductors play in the global economy. This, along with expanding semiconductor content in end devices, rising device complexity and larger die sizes will help sustain strong WFE levels.
Most importantly, for Lam, technology inflections will continue to drive greater etch and deposition intensity. Across our company, we have been prioritizing investments to benefit from these trends and prepare for the growth ahead. Over the last 2 years, Lam has devoted significant attention to the disruptions that have impacted semiconductor ecosystem, but at the same time, we have used this period to accelerate a strategic transformation of our operations and product focus.
We have significantly expanded Lam’s capabilities and resources closer to our customers and ecosystem partners, both in the U.S. and globally to deepen collaboration, accelerate the introduction of new products and drive greater operational flexibility. Compared to pre-pandemic times, Lam now has a more globally diverse manufacturing and supply chain infrastructure, designed to leverage unique regional capabilities while servicing worldwide demand. A notable example is Lam’s new Malaysia facility, which takes our manufacturing, supply chain and logistics operations to the next level in terms of scale, automation and efficiency. Over the last 2 years, we have also increased our technology infrastructure investments across the U.S., Asia and Europe, which has included a new development center in Korea and a soon to open engineering lab in India.
Our vision is to be the premier technology collaboration partner in the ecosystem, leveraging Lam innovation to bring customers, suppliers, peer companies and consortia, together to create disruptive solutions for the industry’s grand challenges. Productivity and extendability of EUV patterning has been one such area of focus. And in the June quarter, we announced that SK Hynix has selected Lam’s innovative dry resist fabrication technology as a development tool of record for two key steps in the patterning process for advanced DRAM chips. We also announced the expansion of partnerships within the EUV ecosystem. In collaboration with Entegris and Gelest, we look to provide our customers with reliable access to precursor chemicals for Lam’s dry photoresist technology. Together, we will also be working to accelerate the development of dry resist solutions for high numerical aperture EUV patterning.
With customers, we are using data-driven equipment intelligence solutions to deepen our engagements. An enormous amount of equipment and process data is being generated from our installed base. And together with customers, we are using key learnings to drive fab productivity. Lam’s Sense.i platform was launched in early 2020 with the goal of combining Lam’s innovative equipment intelligence solutions with our market-leading edge technology. The Vantex dielectric etch system built on the Sense.i platform has seen tremendous momentum since launch and has become the fastest ramping etch tool in Lam history. We expect the installed base for this product to approximately triple this year alone.
Furthermore, we are seeing increased demand for Lam solutions in new advanced packaging architectures. Our Kiyo plasma etch products with Hydro have a proven record of delivering the productivity and uniformity requirements needed for cost effective front-end device scaling. Leveraging this expertise in high-volume manufacturing, we have now achieved multiple new etch tool of record positions for advanced packaging at a leading foundry logic customer. As customers further develop these architectures in support of greater system performance, we see a growing opportunity for Lam’s etch and deposition solutions.
And the final element in our transformation over the past several years relates to our emerging leadership in sustainability. In late June, we released our 2021 ESG report where we outlined how we integrate ESG throughout our operations. We are proud that we were one of the first in the semiconductor industry to set a net zero emissions goal. I encourage you to review the report to see the great progress we are making across several important areas, including environmental sustainability and our commitment to diversity and inclusion in our workforce.
So in summary, I am very pleased with the solid results posted by the company for the June quarter. Our results are an indication of our strong business foundation built on a large and growing installed base, a differentiated product portfolio and a commitment to ecosystem-wide collaboration and success. We are in a great spot to benefit as secular drivers push the semiconductor industry to new heights over time.
Thank you. And I will now turn it over to Doug. Great. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining our call today during what I know is a very busy earnings season. I am pleased to share our June quarter results with you today. We had our second consecutive fiscal year of record levels of revenue and diluted earnings per share. Revenues increased year-over-year for the fiscal year by over 17% and diluted earnings per share rose by more than 21%. We delivered solid performance in the June 2022 quarter. Our results across all financial metrics came in at the high end or above our guidance ranges due to our improved execution and the continued strong demand for our equipment.
June quarter revenue was a record at $4.64 billion, which was an increase of more than 14% over the prior quarter and over the high-end of the guidance range. While we are making progress on addressing the supply chain challenges we’ve previously talked about, it will take more time for them to be fully resolved. Despite the supply chain improvements and higher factory output levels, we still exited the June quarter with $2.2 billion in deferred revenue, which was an increase of $129 million sequentially.
From a segment perspective, memory represented 54% of systems revenue in the June quarter, which was down from the prior quarter level of 66%. The NAND segment came in at 40% percent of our systems revenue, which was roughly consistent with the prior quarter. Our NAND customers are investing in tools for 17x layer and beyond devices. On the DRAM side, revenues were 14% of systems revenue, which is a decline from the prior quarter level of 27%. DRAM investments are focused on the 1z and 1-alpha node addition and conversions.
In the Foundry segment, June quarter revenues increased quarter-over-quarter and represented 26% of our systems revenue compared with 21% in the March quarter. The increase is related to the timing of customer investments with broad-based spending across both leading as well as specialty node devices.
The Logic and Other segment had record performance in the June quarter coming in at 20% of systems revenue higher than the March quarter amount of 13%. Our performance here not only reflects the demand in the market for microprocessors, analog components, image sensors, and advanced packaging solutions, but it also demonstrates the progress we are making in the leading-edge foundry logic inflections that Tim talked about earlier.
Let me now turn to the regional composition of our total revenue. The China region came in at 31% of total revenue, which was flat with the March quarter percentage. China domestic customers were the majority of the China regional revenue in the June quarter. There was also a strong concentration of investments by our customers in the Korea and Taiwan regions, which comprised 24% and 19% of our total revenues respectively in the June quarter.
The Customer Support Business Group revenue was also a record at approximately $1.6 billion which was up 16% from the prior quarter level and 18% higher than the June quarter in calendar 2021. There was strength across all parts of CSBG, but notably in spares with our customers’ fabs running at high utilization levels as well as in our Reliant business, with customers investing in specialty market areas such as RF and power devices. While quarter-on-quarter growth rates in CSBG can vary based on customer investment patterns, I believe CSBG is well positioned to again deliver annual growth in 2022.
Let me now pivot to our gross margin performance. The June quarter came in at 45.2% above the midpoint of the guided range. Our fixed cost absorption improved somewhat with the higher output levels. However, we continue to have cost challenges in the areas of freight and logistics, semiconductors as well as in other critical components. We will continue to drive progress on improving our operational efficiencies. However, we expect inflationary pressures to be a persistent headwind in the second half of the year. Our September quarter guidance embeds our views on these factors.
Operating expenses for June were $635 million, up slightly from March quarter. The increase was mainly in R&D across all of our business units as we are investing in development of technologies to support our customer’s long-term roadmaps as well as to mitigate some of the supply chain challenges we are having.
The June quarter operating margin was 31.5% coming in over the guidance range as a result of the stronger than expected revenue performance. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 11%, generally in line with our expectations. We estimate the tax rate for calendar year ‘22 to be in the low-teens level. This estimate doesn’t reflect any impact of any potential U.S. tax policy changes. And this is obviously something we continue to monitor closely and we will update you as appropriate. And just to remind you, as we have discussed in the past, you should expect the tax rate to fluctuate on a quarterly basis.
Other income and expense for the June quarter was approximately $87 million in expense consistent with what we noted on our call last quarter as well as what was included in the June quarter guidance. We had an increase in expense this quarter related to market declines in one our venture investments that recently went public. The OI&E P&L line item is subject to market-related fluctuations that will cause some level of volatility due to items such as foreign exchange as well as impacts in the equity markets.
We continue to execute on our capital return objectives during the June allocating $868 million towards share repurchases. We paid $208 million in dividends. Our share repurchase activity was a combination of open market repurchases as well as an accelerated share repurchase program. This ASR will continue to execute during the September quarter.
I’d also like to highlight that since calendar year 2012, when we brought Lam and Novellus together, we have returned approximately 115% or more than $20 billion of our free cash flow to equity holders. Our stated plan is to return 75% to 100% of free cash flow through a combination of buyback and dividends. June quarter diluted earnings per share, was $8.83. Diluted share count was 138 million shares, which was lower than the March quarter and lower than our June quarter expectation due to the increase in share repurchase activity.
Let me turn to the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash, totaled $3.9 billion, which was down from $4.6 billion at the end of the March quarter. The decrease in the cash position was attributed to our capital return activity as well as our usage of cash for growth in working capital as well as continuing capital investments. We increased the level of inventory we are carrying to support our growing business volumes. Inventory turns were flat with the prior quarter level coming in at 2.6x. Days sales outstanding come in at 85 days, which was essentially flat with the March quarter. It again was a somewhat back-end weighted shipment quarter.
Non-cash expenses for the June quarter included approximately $70 million for equity compensation, $69 million in depreciation and $19 million for amortization. Capital expenditures for the June quarter came in at $126 million, down by roughly $20 million from the March quarter level. Capital expenditures are supporting the company growth in manufacturing in multiple geographies, including the United States and Malaysia as well as research and development infrastructure investment in California, Oregon as well as our new technology center in Korea.
We ended the June quarter with approximately 17,700 regular full-time employees, which was an increase of approximately 800 people from the prior quarter. We had headcount growth, primarily in the factory and field organizations to address the higher output levels, to manage supply chain constraints as well as to support increasing customer delivery and installation.
Looking ahead, I’d like to provide our non-GAAP guidance for the September 2022 quarter. We are expecting revenue of $4.9 billion plus or minus $300 million; gross margin of 45%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. This gross margin outlook reflects ongoing inflationary challenges that we are seeing in the supply chain. Operating margins of 31.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point; and finally, earnings per share of $9.50 plus or minus $0.75 based on a share count of approximately 137 million shares.
So then in summary, Lam demonstrated an improved operational execution in the June quarter and delivered record financial performance both quarterly as well as on a fiscal year basis. While the semiconductor industry is not immune from softening macro factors that we see, Lam’s technology leadership, along with our robust installed base is a solid foundation for continued long-term growth for the company.
And with that, operator, I will conclude my prepared remarks. Tim and I would now like to open up the call and take questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question and great job on the strong operational execution. As you mentioned in your prepared remarks, we have seen weakness materialize in the consumer-focused segments of the market, so PCs, smartphones, gaming. For your memory customers, that accounts for about 55% of their total revenue. So they are being disciplined here in the second half and into next year. They are focused on supply side discipline, a lower profile of CapEx spending. And then on the flipside, Foundry and Logic and IDM customers are seeing, I think a bit more diversified set of drivers, where demand is still relatively healthy. So given that your lead times are stretching into next year, if your customer base is becoming more cautious on the macro demand environment, I assume that they are modulating their orders down for shipments next year. Have you started to see this in your profile of your recent orders? And then maybe more near to mid-term, have you guys seen any major changes in cancellations or push-outs on scheduled deliveries for this year? Okay. I will take that question, Harlan. It’s – I think, as you said, we clearly are seeing some weaknesses in certain parts of the market, and we have customers in the memory space and others have been publicly sounding the tone on being a little bit more cautious about their CapEx and spending going forward. I believe that we’ve also been saying, though, for several quarters now that we believe the memory customers have generally been quite disciplined in their spending and how they look at the market. I think it’s one of the things that has made that particular segment of the industry quite healthy in recent years, and that is that they respond fairly quickly to changes that they see in pricing and in demand. So that’s something I think we’ve become accustomed to dealing with. Frankly, what I’d say though on the demand side is that we really haven’t seen any significant change in the demand signals from our customers. And some of that could be, as you pointed out, that lead times remain stretched and I think people want to take some time to look at how this market is evolving from different drivers. But we certainly acknowledge that ‘23, there is a fair bit of uncertainty and there are different scenarios that could play out. But I think that Lam is well prepared to execute through whichever those scenarios actually transpire. Yes. The only thing I might add, Harlan, is we know how to run the company whatever the environment is. We’ve been doing it for a really long time. We know what the playbook needs to be. When it’s up, down or sideways, we will respond accordingly. And then when I think about the things Tim talked about, our positions are in stronger. We feel really good about the business we’re winning, the growing installed base, the company is executing really well. That’s the stuff we feel great about. At the end of the day, the market will be what the market will be, and we will manage the company in the right way depending on whatever that looks like. Yes. Great insights. Thanks for that. And then supply chain-wise, I mean, the team did a great job of unlocking more component availability and subsystems availability given the strong upside in June. So given more availability, do you anticipate deferred revenues coming down in the September quarter as a part of your strong revenue guidance? And where are you seeing the biggest supply improvement? Is it component availability? Is it subsystems availability, freight and logistics or maybe all of the above? Yes, I’ll take the first part and let Doug speak specifically maybe the deferred revenue. I think that we talked in the last couple of calls about having somewhere in the order of about 40 task forces deployed out to our critical customers. So we said the constraints were pretty broad-based. I mean clearly, things like IC component shortages have gotten a lot of attention. But instead it was broader than that. We’ve seen improvements across a number of those constrained commodities. But we still have constraints. And that’s – you see it in how we’re still spending, managing our supply chain in the numbers Doug talked about and also in the fact that deferred revenue actually continue to grow a little bit in the June quarter. So we’re nowhere near to where I would say that the supply chain overall is executing like it had in the past. But we’ve seen kind of broad improvements as a result, we think of specific actions Lam has taken. And I’ll let Doug talk about the September deferred revenue. Yes, Harlan, it’s hard enough to forecast a revenue number, let alone the deferred. But if I was going to give you some color around it, I kind of think it’s flattish, plus or minus a little bit. And again, it will depend on how well we progress with the supply chain, honestly. Great. Thank you. Thank you, Harlan. We will take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead. Thanks a lot. So I had a question just on overall WFE. So Tim and Doug, you beat on June, you’re guiding better in September, and you’re getting a little bit, a bit of improvement in terms of some of these constraints, yet the full year WFE is coming down a bit. So can you sort of square that a little bit. Is some of that maybe some demand driven that’s bringing the year down or is even that mid-90s still a supply-constrained number? Yes, Tim, it’s – in our view, it’s primarily an adjustment we’ve made based on supply constraints and challenges. Since we gave our last guidance, which we had put at $100 billion of WFE, not only have we seen kind of how we’re performing, but we’ve also heard from others in the industry. And so we have to – in trying to give a WFE number look to how the entire industry is executing and not just how Lam is performing. And so we felt it prudent to lower that WFE outlook based on what look to be still a lot of industry-wide constraints. And so from a demand perspective, as I just said in the last answer, I really haven’t seen any meaningful change that’s really embedded in that lowering of WFE. There is always some tools and projects that move around. But right now, as you see with our deferred revenue and the fact that we’re not meeting all demand, if anybody slides out a little bit, somebody else is sliding right into that slot. So we’re fully utilized at this point at the numbers we just gave. Got it. Got it. Awesome. Thank you. And then, Doug, I’d be remiss if I didn’t ask about gross margin, someone’s going to ask about it. So I guess it’ll be me. So can you just… Go ahead, Tim. Sorry, Doug. Can you just – can you walk us through sort of maybe quantify the headwinds? And would we be at 48%, 48.5% if sort of absent some of these headwinds, can you sort of like normalize all that for us? Thanks. Yes, Tim, the way I’ve been describing it actually for a while now is the long-term profitability model of the company is unchanged. My expectation of where we’re going to perform isn’t any different than it was pre-pandemic, pre-inflation coming through. The inflationary stuff that’s permanent. We got to work on getting fairly paid for and the stuff that’s temporary, maybe we get paid for a little bit, but then we got to go on the cost back. And so what was embedded in a financial model that we gave, I guess, over 2.5 years ago or something was kind of 200 basis points above where we are guiding right now, and that’s still the way you should think about the long-term profitability of where we’re going to drive the business. And Tim, the only thing I would add on that point is there is a – there are a lot of questions obviously coming about is the industry slowing or there are some pockets that are going to ease up think if that’s the case, some of the things that are headwinds to us in gross margin right now. I mean, a lot of the expedites and premiums that we’re paying on things like ICs, you would expect those to begin to moderate if some of the outlooks are that some of this demand either gets caught up or maybe or slows down a bit going forward. So I think there is room for gross margin improvement, as Doug said, over the longer run. Definitely, yes. It’s a natural hedge. Thank you very much. Yes, thanks, Tim. We will take our next question from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Please go ahead. Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. A follow-up question on gross margins. Your favorite subject, Doug, would love to isolate just on your factory ramp in Malaysia. Can you speak to how that’s going, whether that’s a headwind or beginning to be a tailwind for you? And how we should think about that escalating into a real tailwind for you guys? Is that a first half ‘23, second half, ‘23 or later type of story? Maybe I’ll let Tim talk about how the ramp is going and I’ll describe the numbers a little bit, C.J. Okay. Yes, sure. So C.J. is actually just out there not too long ago. I’d say from an execution perspective and a lot of the improvement we’re looking at, I’d say the Malaysia ramp is going extremely well. We’re still in a ramping phase there, still in the mode of building out and developing the supply chain. Some of that, especially the supply chain development might be a little bit behind where we would have wanted to be at the volumes. And that’s simply because supply chain globally is struggling to ramp. And whether that’s raw materials or component shortages or labor. But I think it’s coming up very nicely. And I think what Doug gives you the answer about how it contributes, I mean, what we have to remember is that Malaysia is ramping at the same time as we’re ramping all of our global facilities. And so perhaps in the short run, you’re seeing an easily isolatable impact of Malaysia because we’re ramping all other global factories at the same time. But from a ramp perspective, I couldn’t be happier that right now with the scale of output and the efficiency I see starting to come out of that facility. Yes. And then C.J., just how to think about the numbers. I think maybe a year ago, I was talking about it being somewhat of a headwind to gross margin. It really isn’t any longer. We’re kind of at the point where it’s neutral-ish. And as Tim just told you, we’re ramping everywhere as eventually that will be the biggest factor in the network. And as it gets to be a bigger percentage of the total, it will become a benefit to gross margin, not just from cost of labor, but the fact that our freight lanes will be shorter and the supply chain will move along with us. So I’ll keep you updated as we progress. Yes. I think actually just – I want to emphasize that one point Doug just made because in my prepared remarks, I made this comment about part of our strategic transformation over the last couple of years was to put capabilities closer to where they ultimately need to be. And that’s – in the case of development, closer to customers. And in the case of the factories closer to supply chains and also customers. And in a period when we’re seeing high freight and logistics costs, I mean, I think that ultimately having a large factory close to our customers in Asia is going to be a big benefit for us. So that was a very conscious decision. And I think it’s going to pay off as – we don’t know when freight and logistics costs normalize, but that’s a hedge against those remaining high for a while. Very helpful. Thank you. As my follow-up, I guess I was hoping you could speak a bit to Reliant. And to clarify, do you include Reliant when you break out the percentage of exposure logic, foundry memory? And then, I guess, bigger picture there, the trends you’re seeing, particularly as it relates to 200-millimeter 40-nanometer and above and domestic China. Can you kind of walk through the trends you’re seeing there? Thanks so much. Yes, I’ll take the beginning, and then I’ll let Tim take the second part. Yes. C.J., when I talk about the percent of systems revenue in my scripted remarks, that includes Reliant as well as the more leading-edge equipment that we’re selling. So it’s all conclusive in terms of system revenue. Yes. I think just in terms of markets – end markets and the demand, I mean, I think we can speak as a user of many of those chips where we still see severe constraints and also very high premiums for those chips in the marketplace. I think customers are investing to try to alleviate what today is clearly a mismatch in terms of supply and demand. And that’s across all different types of applications. I mean when I look at the list of ICs that that we’re looking for just as one user, it’s a broad list from a very broad number of manufacturers. So it’s hard for me to pin it down, but I feel like today, we’re still in a pretty broadly expanding and growing market. Thanks so much. Thanks, C.J. Yes. You bet. We will take our next question from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk about any potential for export controls. There is been some press focus really on some incremental controls on exports to China for advanced logic and things like that. Do you guys get any kind of sense for what’s coming on the pike there and how that might affect you? Yes, Joe. So to tell you, we were recently notified that there was like – there was to be a broadening of the restrictions of technology shipments to China for fabs that are operating below 14-nanometer. And so that’s the change I think that people have been thinking might be coming. And our – we’re prepared to fully comply. We’re working with the U.S. government and any impact on Lam’s business it’s contemplated in the September guidance that we just gave. September guidance as well as the full year WFE outlook, Joe. Great. And that – is a 14-nanometer logic that doesn’t include DRAM? Yes, to the best of our understanding, it’s foundry focused, yes. Okay. Thank you very much. Yes. Thanks, Joe. We will take our next question from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I was wondering if you could give us a little more color on the drivers within the customer service business, particularly around strength in spare parts and 200-millimeter tools? I’m just trying to get some feeling for those pieces, especially just given the broader environment and some of the other news that we’ve heard around the macro and potential customer order cuts and things like that? Okay. I’ll take the first shot at that. The – maybe as best to step back and just remind everybody, the CSBG business is comprised of four components, spares, services, upgrades and Reliant. One of the nice things about this business and what said we really like about it is those often kind of move in somewhat of a non-correlated way. I mean, spares clearly just moves with our installed base. And as I look forward, lot of people wondering what does 2023 look like, we’re not going to give guidance, but one thing we always feel pretty comfortable about is we have a very strong equipment shipment year this year. There will be a lot more tools requiring spares and consumables next year. And so that part of the business, it grows.
And in fact, what we’ve said is, as devices become more complex, and our applications become more critical, the fact that the need for spares and the importance of spares just continues to grow. So spares is just a robust and growing. The services business has been also strong. I talked about the shift in strategic transformation we’re making towards more equipment intelligence type services. And as customers kind of look forward, if customers start focusing on productivity and costs and really trying to squeeze the output from their fabs without having to spend additional CapEx, they turn to things like productivity services, results-based contracts, use of data off of the tools. So I think services has been doing well. And I think can continue to do well even in an environment where maybe you see a little bit of impact of macro or spending pulled back.
Same for upgrades. Upgrades business actually, I’ve often said over the years that upgrades tend not to do so well when customers are busy adding lots of capacity because they are actually adding capacity, new tools really focused on that. if they pull back a little bit, the way they save CapEx and still manage their technology road maps as they turn to upgrades and tech conversions. And so the upgrades business gets a little bit stronger. And so that business, we think, can continue to do well and maybe even improve in next year’s environment.
And then Reliant, as we just said, a lot of catch-up to do I think there have been significant underinvestment for quite some time in that area as evidenced by the fact that many of us can’t get the chips that we actually need to meet demand. And so there is some catch-up still there. Eventually, maybe that gets caught up we don’t really have a view on when that fully happens. It’s a very diverse set of end markets and application drivers. So it’s hard to predict. But clearly, at some point, it probably moderates in terms of growth, and it’s back more towards the steady grower tied kind of to the overall application expansion in the economy that we’ve seen for in past years. I guess maybe I should have asked more explicitly what drove the sequential strength in services? So which one of these pieces was the biggest? It was both spares as well as Reliant, that’s why I called that out in my script, Stacy. Got it. Got it. Thank you. For my follow-up, I’m going to ask – this is going to come across a little snarky, but I think I’m going to ask it anyways. I get the inflationary pressures on gross margins. But all of your customers seem at this point to be inflation proof in terms of their input costs going up and their ability to pass the long out. Why aren’t you? So Stacy, I think – and I’ve been saying this, I think, for a quarter or two. I don’t want you to believe that we’re not raising prices, because we are. I think maybe to our detriment, inflation has been bigger, stronger, more pronounced than we expected that it would be, honestly. And there is some latency to kind of renegotiating prices and whatnot, and that’s very much what’s going on. And it wasn’t a star comment. I get the comment all the time. It’s an appropriate comment. We’re working on getting fairly compensated for what we need to and we will. So how much of a driver do you think of I’m looking at like a year or two as that latency goes away? I mean, is it 100 bps? Is it more like how much can we be or is that what helps you kind of get back to the model range? Yes. It’s what helps us get back to the model range. What I said earlier is the long-term profitability expectation for the company is unchanged, even though we’re working our way through this inflationary environment, it’s probably 200 basis points from where we are to where we need to be. Got it. Okay, thank you, guys. Appreciate it. Yes. Stacy, thanks. We will take our next question from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Yes. Hi, thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. The first one for Doug. Clearly, the last several quarters have been really strong. You’ve grown your headcount a lot. Hypothetically speaking, if next year was down in terms of revenue, say, 5% or 10%, how should we think about the earnings model and operating leverage? And then I had a follow-up for Tim. Yes, Krish, I guess the best thing I would point you to is just look at the history of the company’s performance over the last decade, right? We know how to run the company in an up environment, in a down environment, we have a highly variable cost model here. We employ temporary resources, we outsource things. The best thing I would point to is just look at the last downturn and the same management team running the company, we will do the same things. It’s a well-worn playbook that we know how to dust off and use when we need to. Got it. Got it. Fair enough, Doug. And then a question for Jim, maybe this is the first time. I’m noticing you’ll talk about advanced packaging on the earnings deck. I’m kind of curious on your advanced packaging strategy. Some of your peers have partnered with back in companies that were looking into panels. How should we think your advanced packaging portfolio should evolve? Are you looking at organic development, M&A or partnership with a back-end company? Well, I think that we’re looking at – look, advanced packaging is an important area for Lam to participate in and we have for quite some time. So I actually don’t know if it’s the first time we’ve talked about it because I have to believe we have talked about it in the past. But we’ve talked about it primarily from the standpoint that etch and deposition play an incredibly important role in these new architectures. And we have a strong position, especially in applications like – well, both the etch as well as the copper electroplating. As form factors change, we look at that as still our market, and therefore, we will evaluate and pursue whatever the best means is to win in those emerging segments, whether that’s organic or inorganic. Got it. Thanks, Tim. Thanks, Krish. We will take our next question from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Great. Thank you so much for taking the question. It’s really nice to see your action in logic and other show up in your numbers in the quarter. To level set, I was hoping you could sort of quantify where you are from a market share standpoint across those markets today vis-à-vis the corporate average in etch and dep? And where do you see that going in a couple of years, given the current application win funnel? Yes. If you look at logic specifically, it’s probably our lowest exposure across the markets that we described. However, I will remind you, Toshiya that we have been talking about a specific share gain customer that we continue to progress very nicely with, which is part of the strength you saw in the results from June. Yes. And Toshiya, I guess I would just add, I mean there is a couple of things to think about with respect to the foundry logic space. And one is our exposure is lower from a SAM perspective and has been. But actually, some of the technology inflections that are currently underway are actually allowing us to participate with some of our more advanced equipment to displace some of the older technologies that have typically been used in foundry logic. And so you are seeing a lot of traction for our selective etch. We didn’t list all of the wins this quarter. We continue to see new selections for our selective etch tools. That’s only going to be used at very advanced logic and it’s kind of new markets, new opportunity for us, and we are doing well there. ALD of both dielectrics and metallization used to deal with like the RC inflection, the back-end interconnect inflection. That’s creating opportunities for us. And so I think that we are seeing a little bit of like share gain at certain customers, as Doug mentioned, but also an expansion of our opportunity, and that’s driving a lot of our new product roadmap. We have an objective to improve our position in foundry logic for more advanced notes. Yes, that’s helpful. Thank you. And then as my follow-up probably one for you, Tim, just on dry resist, it’s great to see you guys have traction there as well. Obviously, SK hynix is public. I am pretty sure you are working with other customers on this as well. But help us quantify how significant this business or this product could be in a couple of years? And as you partially sort of displace traditional track or coated developers. What percentage of the market do you think you can capture in a couple of years? Thank you. Okay. Well, I think I don’t want to get out with sort of the new disclosures here, but I think we are – we have quantified it in the past is roughly about a $1.5 billion opportunity over a 5-year period. And you are just starting to see us – we talked about development tool of record wins. So, obviously, we are not yet putting this into a production fab and developing revenue, so we would be at the very first stage of that. But that should give you some kind of sense maybe in the next 5 years of kind of revenue impact you are talking about. But this is still a much longer play for us. And I talked about this idea of accelerating the development of the driver is for the high NA EUV. And so if you think EUV is going to be around for the next 10 years, 20 years as the primary patterning capability for advanced logic, then our opportunity just continues to grow throughout that period. So, it starts off in the next 5 years, about $1.5 billion and then just continues to grow with layer count and application. And we think that as you get to high NA EUV, I think it’s we have a good just to capture a lot of the market. And Tim, sorry, when you say 5 years, I know you guys initially talked about the, say, your 2022 Analyst Day, is it 5 years from then or 5 years from today? Well, I don’t know – I guess I will just start the clock now because, as I said, we have only reported a development tool of record positions today, obviously, which we haven’t yet started to generate revenue from. So, it’s – yes, I think you could call it 5 years from today, it’s a safer bet than 5 years from our Analyst Day. Sounds good. Thank you. Thanks Toshiya. We will take our next question from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead. Yes. Thank you for taking my question. I have a question for both of you. It looks like Senate has passed the CHIPS Act. Tim, you along with Intel and Micron CEOs, you spoke to Congress in March about the importance of passing this legislation. So, assuming it goes through Congress and the present signs off. Can you talk about what this bill means for the U.S. equipment makers? And Doug, if you can talk about what – how will it impact Lam in terms of tax breaks or in terms of market share growth in logic foundry areas? Thank you. Okay. Well, obviously, it’s a significant benefit for the U.S. semiconductor manufacturing industry overall. I think most directly, what I would say is that Lam’s benefit from this will come in two ways. One is as our customers invest in capabilities in the U.S. and capacity, and obviously, we are hopeful that we will garner a large share of the equipment that’s purchased for those fabs. And so that’s one way in which money is from that flow through ultimately into business for Lam. Specifically, when I was in front of the Senate, one of the things that I talked about is, I think long-term, if you think about long-term improvement for U.S. companies and U.S. semiconductor manufacturing has to do with some of the R&D money that’s in that, I believe, in the CHIPS Act, which is going to fund longer term capabilities that help semiconductor device makers, but also equipment makers develop those next-generation technologies that keep us incredibly competitive on the global stage and allow us to create those technologies without having to necessarily fund and take on all of that risk ourselves as individual companies, which is always hard to do for technologies that might be 7 years, 8 years, 10 years into the future. So, that’s the other way I would say that companies, both device makers and equipment makers can benefit. We need to see all the details, but that’s my financial take. Are there Atif any follow-up? No, I am good, Doug. Okay. Alright. Thank you. We will take our next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Thanks. I had two questions. First one, is this $4.9 billion that you are guiding to for September? Is this kind of the new quarterly baseline? So, all else being equal, should we expect December sales and gross margins to potentially be flat or up? I appreciate you are not giving December outlook, but is there anything that could make you deviate from this new trend line that you have June stronger and then September even stronger than that? Yes. Vivek, you are right. I am not going to guide the December quarter for you. Listen, I think we are pretty pleased with the progress from a supply chain standpoint we made in the June quarter. It continues to be reflected in the September quarter, barring something new coming up. I think our execution will continue. And that largely has been what has limited the revenue generation of the company. And you see – you heard me mention the $2.2 billion in deferred revenue. So, that’s there for us to follow-up on. But I am not going to give you a number for December quite yet. Understood. And then the second one is just a clarification. What is your sub-14 nanometer exposure to China? I didn’t think there was any or not that much. And do the restrictions apply to just China domestic, or do you think they could apply to the multinationals with fabs in China? At this point, we would assume that it applies to all sub-14 nanometer activity in China. And we are not going to quantify what we might have or had in our plans for sub-14. But Tim, just to clarify, September, you said is de-risked, i.e., there is zero sub-14 nanometer China business for you in your September outlook? Vivek, the guidance fully reflects everything that we just described. Okay. Thank you. You’re welcome. We will take our next question from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I had a clarification and a question. The clarification, Tim, I think it was an earlier question about whether you were seeing push-outs or cancellations. It sounded like you said that you are not seeing any impact on your demand, but I just want to make sure I understood your response to that question? And then my question is, can you help us understand the mechanics of your manufacturing operations or how you deal with the slots that you have before you allocate to your different customers as the orders have come in. If somebody – what kind of latitude do your customers have as they come in and say, well, I don’t know if I want the tool now, I prefer it in three months, do you guys split up slots in the queue, or do you just send people back to the end of the line. If you could just kind of review the mechanics around how you treat the orders as they come in and what happens to customers who ask for the push-outs? That would be helpful. Thank you very much. Sure. I can try to address both of them. So, yes, just to be clear, my comment was at this point, we have seen no push-outs and changes in demand, no push-outs, no cancellations that are all meaningful. However, I mean I want to acknowledge, I mean it’s with long lead times and stretching through ‘23 and a cautious tone being struck by some of our customers quite publicly. I am not saying that we might not ultimately see those changes come. So, just saying that we have seen none doesn’t mean that, that might not happen. And so at this point at – the commitments that we have today are being met, and that was what I was trying to signal. I think with those long lead times, it moves into your second question, which is, so what if a customer does come and say they would like to push a project by a few months or even longer or we treat it the same way we are doing right now when customers come and have asked us to pull in the slots. We work with all of our customers to see where people really are in their projects and their demand. And we have not ultimate flexibility within our manufacturing, but I talked about the fact that we are – we have invested in the last 2 years to try to create greater operational flexibility. And part of it is so that we can respond in that way. I mean we are – we treat our customers very much like partners and need to push for a couple of months because maybe it’s either demand or likely sometimes if the facilities aren’t quite ready or there is a change in their plans. We have got to work with them and make those adjustments, if it’s possible. Got it. Thank you very much. Very helpful. Yes. Thanks Mark. We will take our next question from Patrick Ho with Stifel. Please go ahead. Thank you very much and congrats on the nice quarter. Doug, maybe for you in terms of the supply chain, obviously, you have seen some improvements in the past quarter that will carry incidents next quarter. Are some of the issues now just related to the quantity of shipments because it’s still going to be a more second half weighted year for you guys. So, even with some of the incremental improvements on the supply chain, it’s now just trying to I guess, continue to keep pace with the high demand levels that you are seeing near-term? And that’s why the deferred revenues are staying at the same levels at least as you are forecasting to the September quarter? Yes, Patrick. That’s clearly part of it, right. We have got unmet demand. We have got partial shipments that shows up as deferred revenue. Each supplier has a unique situation that we are working through with them to the extent that they are not meeting what we need from them. But yes, we increased – improved the output last quarter, and we see that continuing as we go into September. Great. And as a quick follow-up, maybe for Tim. Obviously, you have been working with a leading MPU customer for some time now, and we are starting to see the share gains and the higher quantity of volume as they start ramping new products. But you have been working with them for some time. As you work with them and given their more accelerated roadmaps in terms of technology nodes, can you maybe not quantify, but qualitatively say that you have seen some incremental new market opportunities, and that’s what gives you confidence with that customer on a going-forward basis? I guess I brought it to all customers. I mean to speak to the one, but I think what we have always said is that Lam’s greatest opportunities get created as those technology changes, those technology transitions occur. And I spoke to a couple of you, just as an example, you think about somebody implementing gate all around in, say, their next technology node or future technology. It does create new opportunities for us, and we have designed equipment kind of ahead of where the roadmaps are. And so the faster those technology changes come, the sooner we get the opportunity to insert those new applications into their production lines in a bigger way. And so we have talked about some of those selective etch, some of our new ALD tools. Of course, it’s some of our etch systems that are designed for – to really support the fine pitch patterning associated with EUV. So, EUV like at each technology node, we use more and more layers of EUV that grows for us. And so every customer, the faster they transition technology, the greater stems Lam’s sort of market is growing and the greater our share opportunity is increasing. Great. Thank you. Thanks Patrick. We will take our next question from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please go ahead. Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to follow-up on the demand outlook. I mean I hear you said you haven’t seen much. I mean I am just looking at the areas that you mentioned being strong. And I think we have seen a lot of those same areas see weakness image sensors and MCUs, APs, I mean, Qualcomm that they are caught up on supply. So, I know that’s not your forecast. You get them from the customers. But I am just kind of curious, you have been through this before. When you look downstream, you definitely see weakness. I am just kind of curious if you – what you have actually seen yet, obviously, memory same story, you are hearing about the CapEx cuts, just trying to fit all this into the picture versus I know you are still catching up. So, I don’t know what the right starting point is, but clearly, you are seeing downstream weakness. Yes. Blayne, obviously, as we acknowledge, we are clearly hearing customers strike a more cautious tone. We see what’s going on around – within the macro. And so we haven’t given the 2023 outlook, to be clear. And I think what we are saying is that if as demand – if demand changes and as demand changes, Lam is set up to operate effectively within whatever that environment is. And clearly, we have different scenarios. But the key is, as we look forward, things like our larger installed base business will be helpful for us, regardless of what the environment looks like. The improvements we have made, say, in our foundry exposure with new share gains and SAM expansion, that will be a positive regardless of what the end demand looks like. Higher etch and dep intensity due to the technology inflections, it’s true regardless of what the end demand is. And the fact that we have a more diverse and more efficient and more effective global manufacturing infrastructure. That will also be helpful regardless of what the demand is. So, I think what we are trying to highlight is we are not going to be the best at forecasting probably no better than anybody else and really know exactly what 2023 is going to be looking like. So, we do believe we have a pretty good view of how Lam can execute very well within whatever that environment is. Thanks for that. And then you might have answered this before, but just on the deferred revenue balance. I was just curious, you are seeing people start to catch up. I know you mentioned that it could be flat in September, but just trying to understand the challenges, are you still having certain subsystems that you can’t get, or is it more like you are just getting high orders in the door and the balance keeps going up? Just trying to understand why that hasn’t started to work its way down? Well, it’s just – one, it’s a higher volume of output we are trying to achieve. And quite frankly, it’s just all components. And I would say, everything is sort of improving. But in general, there is quite still a number of quantities that aren’t able to meet down that new higher level that we want for the output. And so it just continues to increase. So, I couldn’t point to one specific thing, but I would say that in general, I am happy with the improvements we are seeing across a broad array of our suppliers. And so I said I thank them for their efforts because I do see that incremental improvement and expect further improvement as we move to September. Thanks so much. Thanks Blayne. Operator, we have time for one more question, please? Okay. We will take our final question from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Another question on the Reliant business, it’s pretty well known that the third-party reseller market for tools has been pretty limited on supply. How do we think about that market competing against the Reliant business? And then how should we think about that if that supply of tools, used tools maybe increasing if demand does start to slow from the end market semiconductors perspective? Joe, I guess the first thing I would point out to you was, yes, historically that’s been a segment of a market service by a lot of used equipment today. There isn’t any used equipment or very little. And as a result of that, we are selling older modeled new equipment into the Reliant product line, right? Demand is – there isn’t anything coming to be refurbished today. So, I don’t know, Tim do you want… Yes. No. I think that’s clearly the case. Most of that, if not all of that equipment at this point is being fully utilized. But I guess do you see that changing if demand were to slow from an end semiconductor perspective? Do you see the amount of tools coming in to be refurbished somewhat changing, or do you think customers maybe continue to kind of hold that capacity? I don’t see that changing in a very significant way. I mean these assets once they are into these fabs, I mean we tend to see our tools used for 20 years to 30 years producing tips of some different technology nodes. So, I think as far as it’s been to get equipment, anything many of these customers will definitely keep hold of those systems. Thanks. Thanks Joe. This concludes today’s question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back to you presenters for any additional or closing remarks. Thank you, operator.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Tina Correia. Please go ahead, ma'am. Thank you, operator and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to the Lam Research quarterly earnings conference call. With me today are Tim Archer, President and Chief Executive Officer and Doug Bettinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
During today’s call, we will share our overview on the business environment and we will review our financial results for the September 2022 quarter and our outlook for the December 2022 quarter. The press release detailing our financial results was distributed a little after 1:00 PM Pacific Time this afternoon. The release can also be found on the Investor Relations section of the company’s website, along with the presentation slides that accompany today’s call.
Today’s presentation and Q&A include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factors disclosed in our SEC public filings. Please see accompanying slides in the presentation for additional information.
Today’s discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in the accompanying slides in the presentation. This call is scheduled to last until 3:00 PM Pacific Time. A replay of this call will be made available later this afternoon on our website.
And with that, I will hand the call over to Tim. Thank you, Tina, and thank you to everyone joining the call today. Our September quarter results reflect continued strong execution by Lam, with revenues topping $5 billion for the first time in the company's history. Gross margins came in at the higher end of guidance and operating margin and earnings per share both exceeded the guidance range.
As you can see from our press release today, we also expect solid performance in the December quarter despite the challenging environment. Recently, the United States government announced new export regulations for US semiconductor technology sold in China, including wafer fabrication equipment and related parts and services. We have taken the necessary steps to ensure full compliance with the rules and have ceased shipments and support as required.
Our financial guidance issued today for the December quarter includes the impact of these changes. For calendar year 2023, we estimate the total revenue impact from these restrictions to be in the range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion.
Turning to the broader demand picture, we see wafer fabrication equipment spending in calendar year 2022 in the low $90 billion range. This outlook includes the impact of new China-related restrictions and lower demand, partially offset by improving supply chain conditions.
As some of our customers have indicated recently, there has been a rapid deterioration in demand fundamentals, particularly within the memory segments. Customers are adjusting investment plans into next year to bring channel inventories down to more normalized levels.
As a result, we see memory bit shipments tracking below end demand for the next few quarters. In our normal cadence, we would provide our first view of 2023 WFE on our January earnings call. However, given the current environment, today, we are providing our preliminary estimate for calendar year 2023. Inclusive of the China restrictions, we expect next year's WFE to be down more than 20% with memory investments accounting for a large portion of that decline.
We will provide more detailed color on our outlook in our next earnings call. But for now, we believe that customer actions to reduce memory bit supply growth it will create a favorable setup for memory mix to increase as a percent of overall WFE beyond 2023. As cyclical adjustments play out, the structural factors supporting a long-term WFE growth remain unchanged. These include expanding semiconductor content in end devices, rising device complexity and larger die sizes. These factors create tremendous opportunity for Lam, as they require greater etch and deposition intensity to enable higher performance and more scalable device architectures, including the transition to 3D structures.
To ensure we are best positioned to win long-term, we are focused on three key strategies: First, continue to demonstrate our commitment to customer success by ensuring that the rapidly growing installed base of Lam tools at our customers is operating at maximum efficiency. Second, be a trusted R&D partner for our customers by sustaining our investment in the technology development that is most critical to their long-term device scaling road maps. And third, accelerate innovation and deepen our customer and supply chain partnerships by fully leveraging Lam's recently expanded global R&D and manufacturing infrastructure.
Our installed base is now approaching 80,000 chambers in the field. This is over 30% higher than in the 2019 memory-related pullback in WFE. Lam's growing installed base continues to drive strong performance in our CSBG business, which hit another record in the September quarter with approximately $1.9 billion in revenue.
While we won't hit new records every quarter, our installed base has become ever more important to our business model, particularly in WFE spending downturns. During such times, customers can continue to advance their technology, while optimizing capital efficiency through upgrades to their existing tools.
We are also engaging with customers to find other efficiencies, including yield enhancement. An example of the opportunity this creates can be seen in our Coronus product line. Lam's Coronus double-etched process is employed by customers to help prevent process-related defects, which can impair cost per bit scaling. As a result, we have seen a steady increase in the number of double-etched passes used at each successive NAND technology node.
Another opportunity to help drive efficiency can be found in enormous volume of equipment and process data being generated from our large and growing installed base. Together with customers, we are using key learnings to deliver services and upgrades that positively impact our customers' operations. For example, we recently deployed Equipment Intelligence Services to support new equipment installation at a large memory manufacturer. Using these capabilities, we were able to shorten the time to release tools to production by more than 20%.
While the near-term demand dynamics warrant an increased focus on operational efficiencies, the strong pull for technology advancement from our customers and the growth opportunity it creates for Lam continues. We made solid progress in the September quarter with key technology wins across multiple customers.
For example, our ability to deposit critical films to lower device capacities and improved lithography overlay performance led to wins for these layers at a leading DRAM customer.
For both applications, we leverage learning from our 3D NAND leadership position as well as ecosystem partnerships to bring innovative and cost-effective solutions to our DRAM customers.
In foundry logic, we secured multiple new ALD application wins at a key customer by delivering purpose modifications and film characteristics required for building and integrating gate all-around structures.
Whether it is our focus on operational efficiency or our collaboration on advanced technology, we believe our long-term success will be rooted in an R&D and manufacturing infrastructure close to our customers, close to our ecosystem partners and with access to world-class talent.
Consequently, over the past two years, we have made strategic investments to expand our global footprint, including the addition of a manufacturing facility in Malaysia, an R&D lab in Korea, and just last month, the opening of Lam's India Center for Engineering in Bengaluru. This center is a valuable addition to our global Lam network, specializing in the design and testing of hardware and software used across our product lines.
So, overall, I am pleased with how we are continuing to strengthen our foundation in technology, manufacturing, and service. This foundation puts us in a very good position to both navigate the current cyclical dynamics and emerge stronger as we look to capture the exciting opportunities we see over time in the semiconductor industry.
Thank you again for joining today. And I'll now turn the call over to Doug. Excellent. Thanks Tim. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining our call today. Lam delivered solid results in the September quarter with record levels of performance across multiple metrics, including revenue, operating income, and earnings per share.
The September financials reflect our focus on operational excellence and our ability to deliver and meet the needs of our customers in a dynamic industry environment. Revenue in the September quarter crossed the $5 billion mark for the first time in our history, coming in at approximately $5.1 billion.
We continue to ramp output levels, delivering nearly 10% revenue growth over the prior quarter. Supply chain issues have begun to ease somewhat. They have not gone away completely, however. We continue to deal with certain inflationary pressures as well as output constraints.
Deferred revenue was $2.8 billion and grew in the September quarter by approximately $550 million. This growth was primarily due to customer cash and advanced deposits followed by the timing of shipments on outstanding orders.
With macro conditions weakening and wafer fab equipment spending declining, I expect deferred revenue and backlog levels will come down as we exit the December quarter. I'll provide more information regarding our December guidance and focus for calendar year 2023 later in my scripted remarks.
Let me now turn to the segment details for the September quarter. Memory represented 52% of systems revenue, which was slightly down from the prior quarter level of 54%. Included in Memory, the NAND segment represented 39% of systems revenue compared to 40% in the prior quarter.
We see capacity adds and conversions occurring by NAND customers mainly for 192-layer class devices. The DRAM segment concentration was consistent with the prior quarter coming in at 13% of system revenues, compared to 14% in the June quarter. The DRAM investments were primarily for 1z and 1-alpha node conversions.
Foundry investments were respectable in the September quarter, comprising 34% of our system revenues reaching a record level from a dollar standpoint. The increase in the quarter from the June quarter concentration of 26% as a result of the continued strength in investments for both the leading and mature node devices across a myriad of customers. These investments are supporting areas such as AI, IoT, cloud, automotive and 5G.
The Logic and Other segment contributed 14% of systems revenue in the September quarter compared with 20% in the prior quarter. I'll remind you that we had record results in this segment in the June quarter, and we continue to have positive momentum in the Logic segment. Our customer base here is investing in microprocessors, image sensors as well as advanced packaging solutions.
I'll now turn to the regional composition of our total revenue. The China region came in at 30% of the total, relatively flat with the prior quarter level of 31%. The China September revenue was more concentrated towards the domestic Chinese customer base and as Tim discussed, we now have additional restrictions for certain domestic Chinese customers and expect the revenue in this region will be significantly lower as we go into next year. The Taiwan region increased to a concentration of 22% in September versus 19% in the June quarter. Korea decreased to 17% of our total revenue from 24% in the prior quarter. I expect these two regions to continue to be strong for us based on the plans of our customers in those regions.
The Customer Support Business Group results were strong in the September quarter. Revenue here reached a record of nearly $1.9 billion, which was up 16% from the June quarter and 37% higher than the September quarter in calendar 2021. All parts of the CSBG business delivered good performance in the quarter. Notably, the Reliant and spares product line revenues were at record levels. Reliant was the biggest contributor to the sequential growth in September.
As we have noted in the past, CSBG revenues will fluctuate on a quarterly basis, while the macro set up creates the likelihood of a decline in trailing edge demand, the strength of our installed base and value added services provide a platform to offset potentially softer specialty WFE spending. We do believe, nonetheless, that the specialty segment will weather next year relatively better than WFE in total.
Moving to gross margin, the September quarter came in at 46% at the high-end of our guided range and it increased from June's gross margin of 45.2%. We benefited from higher output levels as well as favorable customer and product mix. We do continue to have cost pressures and freight logistics, as well as in certain raw material areas like semiconductors. I see headwinds coming in our December quarter related to customer mix, which I'll talk to when I address our guidance.
Operating expenses for the September quarter were $647 million, up from the prior quarter amount of $635 million. The increase in spending was in R&D, which comprised nearly 68% of our spending, which was a high water concentration level for the company. We're focused on supporting our customers' manufacturing plans for both the short and long-term and investing with those objectives in mind.
We're committed to managing spending next year as we see a decline in calendar year 2023 wafer fab equipment spending, which will obviously negatively impact our revenue levels. The September operating margin was 33.3% and was over the guidance range due to the higher levels of revenue and improved gross margin.
Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 13.8%, slightly higher than expected due to geographic mix of income, coupled with the impact of the required US R&D capitalization rules. Our estimate for the December 2022 quarter and for 2023 is for the tax rate to be in the low to mid-teens level.
Please note, this estimate does not reflect the impact of any potential US and global tax policy changes being considered. The minimum tax provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act are not effective for us until the second half of calendar year 2023, which is our 2024 fiscal year. We do not expect any meaningful impact to our tax rate related to this policy change, however. And also, as a reminder, as we've discussed in the past, you should expect the tax rate to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter.
Other income and expense came in for the quarter at $30 million in expense. This was an expected decrease compared with the $87 million of expense in the June quarter. I'll just remind you that we incurred a loss related to market declines in one of venture investments last quarter, we have now liquidated that position.
Other expense in the September quarter was a little bit better than we expected, mainly because of higher interest rates and an increasing cash balance and slightly favorable foreign exchange impacts. The OI&E P&L line item is subject to market-related fluctuations that will cause some level of volatility due to items such as foreign exchange, as well as impacts from the equity markets.
From a capital return perspective, we allocated approximately $105 million to share repurchases during the September quarter. The cash was deployed in open market repurchases. The ASR from the June quarter also continued to execute in the September quarter. We paid $206 million in dividends during the quarter.
And just to remind you, we continue to target returning 75% to 100% of free cash flow as our long-term capital return plan. September quarter diluted earnings per share came in at $10.42, which was above our guided range because of the strong revenue and improved profitability performance that I spoke about. Diluted share count was 137 million shares, which was lower than the June quarter and was in line with September quarter expectations.
Let me now pivot to the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash totaled $4.6 billion, which was up from the prior quarter level of $3.9 billion. We generated solid cash from operations in the September quarter of $1.2 billion, which was partially offset by the share repurchases and dividend payments.
Inventory turns were consistent with the prior quarter level, coming in at 2.5 times. Days sales outstanding was 82 days, which was a slight decrease from the 85 days in the June quarter. Non-cash expenses for the September quarter included approximately $71 million for equity comp, $64 million for depreciation, and $12 million for amortization.
Capital expenditures for the September quarter were $140 million, a little bit higher than June, which was $126 million. Capital expenditures are supporting growth in manufacturing facilities in the United States and Malaysia. Additionally, we're investing in research and development infrastructure in California and Oregon as well as our new technology centers in Korea and India.
We ended the September quarter with approximately 18,700 regular full-time employees, which is an increase of approximately 1,000 people from the prior quarter. We had headcount growth primarily in the factory and field organizations, and some in R&D to address higher output levels to manage the supply chain constraints, and to support customer deliveries and installations. We've decided to slow down hiring to only critical positions as we assess the business trajectory going into 2023.
Overall, we're executing well in the short term. While we plan to prudently manage the business for a down WFE year in calendar year 2023. I'll remind you that we know how to manage this business during a down cycle. Our operating model has been constructed and tested for many years in different business environments.
With that backdrop, I'll provide our non-GAAP guidance for the December 2022 quarter. We are expecting revenue of $5.1 billion, plus or minus $300 million. This includes our current estimate of the impact of new regulations on our ability to supply products and services to certain customers in China. This revenue guidance would have been decently higher if not for these new regulations.
Gross margin of 44.5%, plus or minus one percentage point, this is down from the September quarter, primarily due to customer mix. We have lost more profitable business from the China region.
Operating margins of 31.5%, plus or minus one percentage point; and finally, earnings per share of $10 even plus or minus $0.75 based on a share count of approximately 136 million shares.
So let me just wrap it up. Throughout 2022, we've demonstrated the ability to deliver record financial performance and profitable growth. It's been a year of volatile supply chain constraints, inflationary pressures and regulatory changes. We're confident we're prepared for the challenges we see in the industry in calendar 2023, and we've built a solid foundation for continued success evidenced in our technology leadership and robust installed base.
Operator, that concludes my prepared remarks. Tim and I would now like to open up the call for questions. Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] We will take the first question on the queue from Timothy Arcuri. Your line is open. Please, go ahead. Hi. Thanks a lot. This is Jason on for Tim from UBS. I just have a couple of questions. So my first question is on your December guidance. You just guided to deferred revenue to come down. So I was just curious whether you can quantify for us how much of excess deferred revenue you're realizing and contemplating into your December guide. Then I have a follow-up. Thanks. Yes, I'm not sure I completely heard you. I think you asked what we think deferred revenue in December is going to do. And all I'm going to tell you is I expect it to go down. I'm not going to quantify it for you. Got it. Thanks a lot. Yes, so my second question is on the gross margin for December quarter. Could you please quantify how much of a headwind you're still facing in December for things like elevated freight costs in Malaysia facility there? When can we expect the gross margin to normalize eventually? Thank you. Yes. No, I'm not going to quantify that for you either. It's still a headwind, otherwise, I wouldn't have put it in the scripted remarks. As we go into next year, and I think supply gets caught up with demand in terms of some of the supply challenges we're having. I expect some of the inflationary headwinds there to mitigate. I expect the same thing in freight and whatnot. So I'm not going to put a number on it, but I do expect that, that will get better as we go into next year. Thanks a lot. We will take the next question from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please, go ahead. Yes. Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Given your commentary on a $2 billion, $2.5 billion impact next year from the export controls in China, it looks like near-term you are offsetting some of that with your significant deferred revenue and order backlog with some of your non-China customers. But, I guess, my question is, could you quantify of the $2 billion, $2.5 billion impact, what percentage is systems and what percentage is services? And then, I have a follow-up question. Yes. You go ahead. Yes, Harlan. I guess, we wanted to give some sizing for that in 2023, since we knew there would be questions that, we're not going to break out the difference right now. That's inclusive of both systems and spares and service for those customers in China that are impacted by the restrictions.
I think that we talked a little bit about improving supply chain conditions. And so, where possible, we talked about December, including some impact of, of course, China restrictions, offset partially by supply chain easing, offset as well by some decreases in other customers due to the demand elements that we talked about. So we're not prepared to break each of those items out, but we're doing best we can to essentially meet customer demand requirements where we can as early as we can. I appreciate that. And then my follow-up, the team only just started recently breaking out services or your CSBG business, obviously, it's becoming a more ratable base, a multiyear service contract focused business, a lot richer in terms of value-added services and solutions. I think you guys put in your presentation like chamber shipments are up significantly over the past three years. So in thinking about a weaker WFE environment next year, like if you look back over the last three or four WFE downturns, has the Lam -- has Lam services business remained stable or grown through most of those downturns and would you expect a similar profile in a weaker WFE environment next year? Well, Harlan, in my comments, I specifically said it's a very important part of our business model, especially during WFE downturns. It's also been a very deliberate strategy of Lam. I think if you attended the last couple of investor conferences, we've talked about an intention to increase revenue capture per chamber. And so I mentioned that just in the time from the last WFE downturn in 2019 from now we've managed to grow the installed base in chamber count by more than 30%. At the same time, we've also increased the breadth of our portfolio and the services that both in terms of the types of equipment intelligence services, the spares, the upgrades that has also meaningfully improved our opportunity for each of those chambers that's in the installed base.
So each element of the spares of CSBG, whether it's spares, upgrade services, Reliant probably moves a little bit different through each of the kind of WFE up cycles or down cycles. But generally, spares, as we've said, holds up pretty well as most customers continue to run all of the tools that they've got installed. Upgrades sometimes can actually do a little bit better as customers have a little bit more time in a downturn to make the improvements that they want to make so that they come out of those downturns stronger with their installed base.
And then services especially with our expanding offerings around equipment intelligence sources I talked about efficiency, productivity those are all things that they're important to customers at all times. But the really important customers as they're thinking about squeezing everything they can out of the installed base they have and being able to then maybe delay additional capital purchases or expenditures for just a bit longer. So I would say that we see CSBG as a very important part of stabilizing the company's performance through cycles. Harlan, the only thing I would point out incrementally. Yes, the only incremental thing I'd point out incremental to what Tim said is, I've been talking about how strong Reliant has been the last several quarters. And in fact, last quarter, it was the biggest sequential grower in CSBG. And as we look into 2023, we're not going to parse all the different components of WFE, but I know there's some people out there that think specialty segment of WFE will soften next year, and that would impact Reliant along with that offset by the things that Tim talked about. No, great insights. Thank you. Thanks, Harlan. We will take the next question from C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Yes. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question relates to deferred revenues. So when you gave us your early view for 2023 WFE, how are you kind of reflecting deferred revenues for you as well as the rest of the industry in that more than down 20%? And as part of that, should we be thinking about your deferred revenues getting close to zero exiting calendar 2023? Yes. Let me take a shot at that first, and let Dough to add in. Obviously, we contemplated that, always we're talking about what we think the industry is able to do from a ship perspective. And ultimately from a revenue perspective. But -- so that number next year or kind of think about it as a little bit of a like for life this year. But I believe that we will see ultimately the year play out in a way that deferred revenues do come down as supply chain continues to ease. And there is a normal level, though, I'll let them speak to that.
What that normal level of deferred is that we'd expect? So it won't come to zero, but we will see a meaningful portion of that deferred revenue that really represents the systems that we've been unable to satisfy this year as that plays out this year as we have. Ramped our capacity, supply chain capacity caught up and therefore we get caught up on deliveries and revenue recognition. Yes, I mean, C.J., you know that, deferred revenue is never a zero number because we always have these cash in advanced payments, volume purchase agreement credits, a whole bunch of different things, spares and service credits that are there. If you look for the supply chain challenges we had, a normalized level of deferred revenue would be somewhere between 500 and a $1 billion. It bounces around, it's lumpy sometimes, but that is kind of the normalized level that I think about. And it's elevated right now because of the backorder stuff and the incomplete tools that we're shipping. It will come down in December and then it will come down more as we go through 2023, is our outlook right now. Very helpful. And as my follow up, you've grown your headcount by 30 plus percent over the last five quarters. And I just curious, as you contemplate the coming kind of correction, how are you thinking about headcount? How are you thinking about OpEx and operating leverage? Well, I think that obviously, as Doug mentioned in his comments, it's not our first downturn. And the reality is we really had no choice but to expand the company as we tried to meet what was really unprecedented, the gamble for last couple of years and no choice in doing that. And as you see, not only did we add headcount, we also expanded our facilities.
Obviously, as you move through cycles, we then look at the resources that are required to meet the business level in the year and going forward and beyond. But I made a couple of comments. One, we think it's incredibly important that we sustain technology development through any cycle. Our customers expect for us to be continuing to advance the products and technology they're going to need on the other side of the demand cycle.
And two, I talked about some very strategic investments that we've made to expand our global footprint, to put us closer to where some of our key customers are, to create capabilities closer to ecosystem partners and our supply chain. And we think those investments are incredibly important to the long-term business model of the company. And so, we'll be sure that however, we're thinking about the resources in the company that we sustain those types of investments as well because it's not only how you act to the downturn, it's how prepared you are for the next upturn and what performance you can deliver in that cycle as well.
So those things are all under consideration now. And it's also why we gave you some look ahead to 2023 to give you a sense of how we're thinking about how this business can run through the near term. Very helpful. Thank you. Thanks, C.J. Next question from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your time is open. Please go ahead. For my first question, you've -- obviously, you've got backlog and deferred carrying you through December. -- you've got calendar 2023, you're guiding WE down, if I do the math, like somewhere in the ballpark of $70 billion. How do I think about the transition from where we're running right now to that environment? But can you give us any color, even qualitatively just on like for March quarter, does March quarter sort of -- are you sort of at that run rate of where you expect WFE to be next quarter? Like what does that transition look like? Yes, Stacy, I mean we gave you color beyond what we would normally do at this point in the year, and I'm not going to do any more than we've already provided. That's the best we're going to be able to do for you right now. All right. Yes, I'll take that. For my follow-up. If I look at the WFE guidance for next year, again, down 20% or more from the low 90s, puts at about $70 billion. You said it includes the China sanctions, would it have been higher without those China sanctions? Are you assuming that some of that China capacity gets redeployed to other players? Like is that -- what do those puts and takes look like? No, we that -- that makes an assumption that the vast majority of that China WFE just comes out of -- and I don't -- if your question is, could somebody else spend what those customers were going to spend to put the same equipment or capacity in place. Our view right now, I mean, is that, that probably wouldn't take place in 2023. Yes. I guess what I'm asking is if it wasn't for the transactions, would you be looking for WPF like $80 billion or $75 million instead of the $70 million where it seems to be coming out? Yes. It would have been a little bit higher, Stacy Yes. Yes, it would have been a little bit higher. Got it. Okay. Thank you guys. Yes, thank you. We will take the next question from Krish Sankar. Your line is open, please go ahead. Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. So, the first one, thanks for the color on CSBG. I'm just kind of curious, you shipped a lot of tools this year. Most of them are under one-year warranty. So they won't necessarily contribute CSBG revenues. WC down 2% or higher and the customer utilization rates come down, is there a way to think about what utilization rate below which actually CSBG revenues don't grow? Well, I think it's a tough question because as I -- that's why I pointed out, there's really four components of CSBG and not all of them are completely utilization-driven. But just to your comment about the number of tools we've shipped. I mean, over the last two years, as we mentioned -- since 2019, up 30%, a significant expansion in chamber count. So, therefore, our opportunity has grown.
There are some components of CSPG and the spare space and on consumables that actually start kind of on customer usage. And so that 1-year delay doesn't quite exist for every part of CSBG spending. But I don't think we've done the calculation of where you would have to come down -- utilization would have to come down in order for certain elements not to grow.
I think we anticipate that, again, customers are going to be motivated to run the tools to a great extent for the tools that they already have installed. And again, you'll see probably heightened interest in upgrades versus new capacity additions, which is also beneficial for not only our CSBG business, but Lam's capture rate per dollar of investment spend. So, again, just CSBG being an important part of our business. Pointing out Doug also commented some elements like Reliant are subject to kind of overall macro environment, and we just have to watch that as we go through next year. Got it. Got it. Tim, that's very helpful. And then as a follow-up, it seems like the first time your foundry revenues crossed $1 billion in a quarter. And you mentioned about some ALD wins for gate all around, et cetera. So I'm curious how much of the foundry strength is share gains versus just underlying cyclical strength from the foundry purchasing? Over to both, Krish, frankly. Obviously, I think you understand, like I'm sure everybody on the call does, foundry investment is pretty strong this year. So that's a part of it. But there's incremental positions that we won. Tim every earnings call talks about some of those. So -- and you talked about a couple of just now. Yes, Krish, I'm usually trying to focus on how we're doing versus what are -- some of the longer-term inflections that we've highlighted. When you think about foundry logic where we've been focused, it's ALD, which clearly, we've made significant progress. It's areas like the EUV patterning module, which includes hard masks and the ability to etch very fine pitch features with incredibly uniformity across the wafer and wafer-to-wafer, tool-to-tool, chamber-to-chamber. And that's -- so I've been -- usually, I'm talking about a little bit further ahead, but that gives you some sense of the momentum of the company that's independent of the cycle. It's really -- those are positions we're winning and when the customers buy, those become big opportunities for the company. Got it. Thanks, Tim. Thanks, Doug. Thanks, Krish. Next question is from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. please go ahead. Great. Thank you. In terms of the business that's impacted by the export controls, you said $2 billion to $2.5 billion for next year. Can you talk about what that is kind of like on a run rate basis? Or just -- I'm trying to get a sense of, is that 2 to 2.5, was that projecting some growth relative to where the numbers have been? I'm just trying to understand how much the negative impact is versus the trailing numbers? Yes, that's a good question. I mean, obviously, we're giving a 2023 a little earlier that we probably have a great look at 2023, but in that number, $2 billion to $2.5 billion, we did anticipate some growth in 2023 over 2022. So we won't say how much, but it's incorporated some growth from the run rate we see today. Okay. Thank you. And then within the service spares in particular, part of that business, I assume you'll be impacted in your ability to ship spares going forward as well. Should we think about those customers being similar in size to their overall capital spending? Or have they been sort of purchasing spares ahead of this? And could they be outsized exposure within your services business because of that? Yes. No, Joe, there's not an enormous amount of it. There's been a little bit of inventory. I think the entire customer base built up with some of the supply chain constraints this year, including the local Chinese customers, but it's not like a crazy amount. Great. Thank you very much. Thanks. Joe, thanks. Next question is from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Great. Thank you so much. I was hoping, Doug, you could help us think about your systems revenue into 2023 vis-à-vis how you're thinking about WFE? Obviously, you're over-indexed to memory where you guys expect the bulk of the decline to come in 2023. You've been really successful in China and chunk of that is coming out on the positive side, you seem to have really strong momentum in both logic and foundry. So, net-net, is it fair to assume, you guys can kind of perform in line with WFE? Or do you think '23 is going to be a relatively challenging year, just given your mix? Yes. I think in many way especially, you answered your own question. We're a little bit over-indexed in memory. We're very strong in terms of share there, and that's going to be down more overall WFE next year, but that's also offset by the strength of our CSPG business, which I believe to be the highest quality installed bases in the industry. So that's going to benefit us. If you really want to kind of see what it might look like -- go back and look at '19, where you had a similar profile, where memory was quite soft and foundry logic was pretty good. And we weathered that period pretty well. That's helpful. Thank you. And then as my follow-up, a question on gross margin. So you're guiding December down 150 basis points, and Doug, you spoke to customer mix. One of your competitors, they've talked about inventory write-downs and costs associated with repurposing tools. Curious if anything like that is negatively impacting your December quarter guide? And I guess, more importantly, how should we think about margin beyond with volume declining? Could gross margins decline further from here? Or do you think there are enough offsets in pricing and hopefully, freight and semiconductor pricing that could help you on the upside? Thank you. Yes, let me unpack it a little bit. I don't really think we're going to have a meaningful inventory exposure. So no, there isn't anything from that. We believe we're going to be able to meaningfully rework any inventory we had that might have been targeted for those specific customers we can no longer ship to. And I don't think, as I sit here today, that's a material number. So the softness, sequential softness in December gross margin is because we lost some very profitable customers in the China region, and that's going to persist, obviously. So that was kind of the first question.
Unpacking next year, I mean, the way I think about it, first, I think, as everybody on the call does, this isn't really a fixed cost business. It's highly variable. And so as volumes vary, a lot of cost of goods sold varies. You've seen that from us over the years. So that hasn't changed. The model here hasn't changed. As we go into next year, the benefit, I think we'll see in gross margin is. I believe we'll see the mitigation on some of these inflation pressures. I think supply gets back caught up with demand in terms of our supply base in areas like semiconductor. I believe freight gets better next year to what magnitude. I'm not positive, but I think that gets better. And then we ramp supply chain in Malaysia, so we're flying things shorter distances and whatnot. And so, we're going to see the benefit of that offset then by we've just lost some very profitable customers. And yes, volume will be down. There is a little bit of fixed cost in the factory and field that we're going to have to deal with. So, I'm not going to quantify it for you, but those are the puts and takes. The only thing I would add is there's been a lot of our actions. Again, I spoke to some of the repositioning. I mean effectively, your question is about next year, but we're really thinking about, again, long-term trajectory for profitability in the company, which both Doug and I have said over time, we want to drive it meaningfully higher. And so, Doug mentioned and I mentioned the investment in Malaysia. We talked about the engineering activities in India, talk about the technology lab in Korea. All of these things are designed to make us faster and more efficient in our operations over the long-term. And so how much of that shows up next year and kind of how the effect is going to see how next year plays out. We're going to be focused on it.
As I said, we go back to look in 2019, we do pretty well in these periods. But really, what we're trying to message is that the investments we've made over the last couple of years, taking advantage of this very strong growth period in the company really sets us up for the remainder of this decade to really drive the strategy of the company towards, again, speed of mission and efficiency and delivery of our products and services. Thanks, guys. Yes. Thank you. Next question is from Vivek Arya, Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Thanks for taking my question. For the first one, I'm curious, Tim, when do you see your ex-China memory customers getting to some level of supply demand equilibrium? Is it sometime in Q1, Q2, Q3, just what's your sense of how much inventory do they have? And how much time would it take for them to clear it out, so that your orders can resume? Yes. Well, now we're starting to talk a lot more about 2023. And so again, we incorporated our view there into the 2023 guidance. I think we'd like to wait until we get little bit closer to the year to be able to speak to that. It's -- the customers are taking action. And I think that you're hearing from customers about some pretty aggressive action to try to bring those inventories and the supply demand better into balance.
I don't really want to speak for them, but I think that, as I commented, I think as we exit 2023, we're going to be set up in a pretty good place for memory spending as a percent of total WFE to actually rise from that point. How it plays out through 2023, we’ll let you know our view is to get a little bit closer. And Vivek, maybe just an observation for me. I mean, these cycles have similar timeframes associated with them, almost just walk back in history and look at it. With the caveat, though, I think as we came through all the supply chain challenges this time, maybe a little more inventory gotten built up, when I look at things in the industry, so it might be a little bit longer than typical, but these things are pretty consistent on a historical basis. So you just go look at history, you'll have to answer your question. Right. And from my follow-up, I'm just trying to reconcile the more optimistic comments about growth made by your lithography peer this morning, who is expecting to grow next year with your comments that WFE could decline over 20%, so if the litho part of the wallet is going to grow, does it mean that the part that applies to you declines a lot more than 20%? I'm just trying to reconcile such a big difference in how two important players are thinking about next year? Yes. Hard for me to tell you what another company is saying, especially because it was just this morning, and I haven't really been able -- Tim and I haven't really been able to look at what they said. But I think you understand, you don't just buy one tool just for the fun of it.
If you can't buy all the process tools to complete the manufacturing line, it makes no sense, right? And so if you’re buying a litho tool, eventually, you need edge step and everything else to complete the wafer. So I can't help you reconcile what they said because I haven't actually been able to go study it, but I think you understand what I just commented on. Understood. Thank you, Doug. Thanks, Eric. Next question from Blayne Curtis, Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to ask you all the restrictions. I mean, I guess just optically looking at it, it seems like you're taking out the domestic memory vendors. And I know there's very little leading-edge logic. I'm just curious, at least some debate as to whether the multinationals, whether you could still ship to their Chinese facilities. I know there were some licenses, maybe for services, but just kind of curious if you could just quantify your understanding of the restrictions and what you're taking out, and whether it includes multinationals and if you can still ship to facilities that may make leading-edge foundry processes even if the equipment is not being used for? Bunch of questions there. First of all, maybe the simplest is we've taken out, obviously, the shipments that were destined for applications or customers that are restricted, which primarily means right now domestic Chinese customers that are manufacturing restricted technologies, which in NAND and DRAM have certain specifications and in foundry logic and others. The multinationals, as you noted, were given an authorization to receive shipments and service and so our business there effectively remains unchanged as a result of that. And so we are continuing to include that in our outlook for 2023.
To your point about a facility, it's our understanding that a facility that would have mixed use would likely fall under the restricted category. And so, therefore, if a customer were to want to manufacture and take shipments and receive support for unrestricted technology, you would have to be in a facility that was clearly not also doing restricted activities. And I think that that's something that's being worked through by our customers.
We've contemplated all of those, as well as what we believe will happen in China and to that $2.5 billion estimate. And so that's our view right now of the restrictions on how they affect customers and our business. Thanks. And then just on December, I was little confused. The impact you laid out is 500 plus million per quarter that you can't ship to, your sales are flat. So I'm just curious, are you making it up with other customers? I'm just curious how fungible is equipment that you thought you were going to be shipping to Chinese memory, whether it needs to -- can be repurposed in the quarter, and you're doing that, and that's why you're not seeing the impact or whether you're expecting to ship to some higher level. And we just didn't know that, and that's why the sales are flat? Well, I think that, as Doug said, the December guide would have been decently higher if the China restrictions had not been put in place. So I think that answers the question. There was a comment about -- that we made about -- perhaps we made up a little bit because of easing supply chain conditions, but that would have happened independent. So in any case, December would have been higher had the Chinese restrictions not been put in place. Okay. Thanks. Yes. Thanks, Blayne. Next question from Joe Quatrochi, Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Yes, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to go back on the expectation that deferred revenue declines in the December quarter. Is there any part of that that's related to the export restrictions where customers that are now restricted had tools that were incomplete, that are now, I don't know, more or less stranded? No, Joe, there's not. We cannot ship anything to those restricted customers. But tools, I guess, that were previously shipped that are just incomplete like they were shipped last quarter or two quarters ago? If that situation existed and I'm not saying it did or didn't. We can't ship anything to them. Got it. Okay. And then just trying to think about bit shipments in the cycle, relative to prior cycles, how do you think about your customers' willingness to hold more inventory on their own balance sheets this cycle relative to prior cycles? Does that change the way you think about maybe like the -- the snapback in terms of like bit supply growth? Yes. It's a good question. It's definitely one that's better relative to their tolerance of holding that inventory. I think everybody's view of inventory probably changed a little bit as a result of shortages and the ability to respond to what -- over the last two years, we've seen a relatively sharp changes in demand. But I really can't answer for them about their willingness to hold more inventory. I think we're going back and as Doug said, looking at kind of historical behavior and these kinds of downturns, what we're experienced with, and that's how we kind of like project out what we think will likely happen. Got it. Okay. Thank you. Yes. Thanks, Joe. Operator, we have time for one more question, please? Understood. We have the last one from Quinn Bolton, Needham & Co. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Thanks for squeezing me in. Tim, there's some confusion is the interpretation of the market it seems like on the license requirements for US citizens in China. I wonder, if you could just clarify -- does the support license requirements affect just the same set of customers as the equipment license? Or is there a broader impact on US citizens operating in China? On US citizens operating in China, I'm not -- yes, I mean, there is a restriction on US citizens as defined by the government -- providing support for the development of restricted technologies. Right. But is that just sort of the same set of customers that require export licenses on the equipment side. So, the advanced NAND, the DRAM and 16-nanometer and below? Or is there a broader set of customers you cannot support under the export control? No, I believe it is the same step that spelled out. Fundamentally, customers that are either on a restricted list or producing restricted technologies for those that are affecting. Got it. Thanks for the clarification. And just quickly, you said you're going to manage OpEx next year, kind of wondering if you might be able to provide any sort of qualitative color. Is that sort of -- you expect it to look similar to what happened back in 2018, 2019 in a downturn? Or would you look to be more aggressive and try to manage OpEx more in line with the decline you see in WFE in calendar 2023? We'll give you that guidance in the January earnings call. I think what we're just trying to signal is that, we're well aware of what we believe is coming next year. And therefore, we'll take the appropriate actions -- as we see fit, as I mentioned, to manage the company through the downturn. But also be ready for what we believe is a robust future for the company and the industry. Great. Thank you. Thanks, Quinn. Okay. Operator, that will conclude our call. I’d like to thank everyone for joining us today. Have a good day. That concludes today’s event. Thank you for your participation.

And with that, I will hand the call over to Tim. Thank you, Tina and Happy New Year to all that are joining us today. Lam ended 2022 on a strong note. We posted record revenues and earnings per share for both the December quarter and the calendar year. Systems revenue growth in our Foundry Logic segment exceeded foundry logic wafer fabrication equipment growth, demonstrating our continued progress launching new tools and winning applications in that space. In our installed base business, our CSBG revenues expanded faster than the growth in installed base units. We also generated more than $3.5 billion in cash from operations and returned over 100% of free cash flow to stockholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks.
Overall, Lam executed well in 2022. We delivered solid results in an environment of acute supply chain constraints and strong inflationary pressures. Still, there are elements of our performance where we recognize the opportunity for additional focus, and with the pressures of the COVID pandemic and the global chip shortage of abating, our attention this year is on the actions needed to hit our long-term growth and profitability objectives we laid out in March 2020.
Beginning early in the COVID pandemic, Lam and others throughout the supply chain quickly ramped investments in infrastructure and resources to meet unprecedented demand driven by remote work trends and the accelerated digitization of the global economy. As seen in our results today, these investments have enabled Lam to achieve revenues of greater than $5 billion per quarter, approximately 70% higher than what we saw in the last up-cycle.
As we look forward into 2023, however, we see a substantially weaker demand environment and the corresponding need to make prudent changes to our near-term operations and priorities. Customers across all segments are exercising caution, especially those in the memory markets. Inventory levels in both NAND and DRAM remain very high, and customers are not only reducing new capacity additions, but also lowering fab utilization levels to bring excess inventory into balance as quickly as possible. In addition, the U.S. government’s new restrictions on sales of equipment, parts and services for specific technologies and customers in China are further impacting equipment demand in a declining market.
In 2022, WFE spending ended the year in the mid-$90 billion range, slightly higher than our prior view due to easing supply chain constraints. As we indicated in our last earnings call, we expect calendar year 2023 WFE to be in the mid-$70 billion range. Given the decreased business levels expected this year, we have made the difficult decision to reduce our overall workforce by approximately 1,300 employees by the end of the March quarter, about 7% of our global employee base. While the reductions are broad-based across the company, we have taken special care to preserve, and in some cases, increase our investments in the critical R&D efforts which I believe are key to Lam’s long-term growth and competitiveness.
Despite reductions in overall company spending, we expect R&D as a percentage of operating expenses in 2023 to increase compared to 2022. We will also be taking specific actions to transform our business processes and enterprise systems to ensure that with stronger WFE spending returns, the company is well-positioned to scale quickly and efficiently across our global infrastructure. These actions will contribute 100 basis points of improvement to our gross margin from March quarter levels as we exit calendar year 2023 and we expect the operating margin benefit to be slightly higher than that.
Over the past few years, we have been executing on a set of strategies that we believe strengthen our ability to capitalize on the robust secular demand trends we see ahead in our business. In just the past 2 years, we have opened a state-of-the-art engineering center in India, brought online a new technology development center in Korea, and ramped our new manufacturing operation in Malaysia. These strategic investments place critical Lam capabilities closer to customers and ecosystem partners, a benefit for stronger collaborations, greater scalability and increased resilience, all of which would be of greater importance as we see more than 50 new fabs being built over the next few years globally. They also provide wider access to talent critical to supporting Lam’s growth longer term.
We have also been drawing on learnings from our rapidly growing installed base to support our customers’ manufacturing roadmaps. Our installed base of approximately 84,000 chambers is more than 30% larger than in the prior down cycle. A solid installed base business not only provides a platform for stable revenue growth long-term, but also delivers data and learnings that are key to an efficient product innovations process. At this scale, there is a tremendous opportunity to extract value for our customers and for Lam. The data we generate from our installed base helps drive fab productivity improvements and the capabilities of our equipment intelligence products are helping us migrate from standard service offerings, like engineer onsite labor, to more comprehensive results based contracts and predictive smart solutions. The number of chambers [Technical Difficulty] in 2022 with another strong growth year expected in 2023.
We have been strategically focused on technology inflections, notably in foundry logic devices, with the goal of broadening Lam’s positioning in a market segment where we have been under-indexed. In 2022, we continued to make progress. We have doubled our conductor etch share node to node at a leading Foundry Logic customer through the success of our Kiyo product, which uses equipment intelligence to deliver best-in-class uniformity and improved yield. In the selective etch business, our recently released Argos, Prevos and Selis tools, are gaining increasing traction. Our Argos product is in roughly 20 applications and a leading foundry logic customer, and in adjacent selective applications at another customer, our Prevos and Selis tools, our production tool of record for gate-all-around applications. Continued scaling of foundry logic devices from existing nodes is expected to increase etch and deposition intensity around 25% to 30%, thus creating tremendous opportunity for us to gain share through new innovations for future devices.
Lastly, we have continued to make both organic and inorganic investments to expand our market. Lam’s innovative Driver Assist fabrication technology has won development tool of record positions at multiple customers for key steps in the patterning process and we are actively engaged with customers across both the memory and foundry logic segments. We expect to announce more on this in 2023.
In Advanced Packaging, our recent acquisition of SEMSYSCO, we have expanded our capabilities within the leading-edge logic and chiplet segments. We are rapidly integrating SEMSYSCO technology with Lam’s market-leading capabilities in plating and wet processing and we have already achieved a key win in this area. Customers view advanced packaging solutions in both wafer and substrate formats as critical to enabling future high-performance computing and AI applications and Lam is well positioned to benefit from this trend.
So to wrap up, 2022 presented many challenges. With our team’s focus and strong execution, we were able to meet our customers’ needs, deliver record revenues and expand our product and technology portfolio. This coming year represents a reset in the market and in our business, but it’s also an opportunity for us to make the changes needed to accelerate our strategic priorities. I am confident that by taking the difficult actions we have announced today, we are putting Lam in a stronger position to capitalize when industry spending growth returns.
With that, I will pass it on to Doug. Great. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining our call today during what I know is a busy earnings season. We had a record financial year in calendar 2022. Our revenue came in at $19 billion and we delivered an all-time high for earnings per share of $37.31, which was a 15% growth in earnings per share over calendar year ‘21. Overall, I am pleased with the operational performance we achieved this past year delivered while navigating a challenging business environment with global supply chain constraints, significant inflationary headwinds and fluid regulatory restrictions.
Lam also achieved record levels of performance in the December quarter across multiple metrics, including revenue, operating income dollars and earnings per share. Revenue for the December quarter was $5.28 billion, an increase of just over 4% from the prior quarter. We delivered higher levels of system sales in deposition and etch offset somewhat by a decrease in CSBG revenue. Deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $2 billion, a decline of $770 million from the September quarter. Supply chain constraints have improved and we were able to fill shipments of many critical parts that’s required for revenue recognition. Our expectations are that the deferred revenue balance will continue to decrease in the March quarter as we fully complete shipments related to outstanding backordered systems. The deferred revenue balance decrease I just spoke about was partially offset by some increases in deferred due to customer cash and advanced deposits, which I also noted last quarter. As we sit here today, I expect to have some level of these type of deposits in the deferred balance throughout calendar 2023, keeping deferred revenue at somewhat higher levels than we have historically seen. I anticipate that the deferred revenue from backorders will be at a normalized level as we exit the March quarter.
Let’s turn to the revenue segment details for the December quarter. Memory represented 50% of systems revenue, which is slightly down from the prior quarter level of 52%. Included in memory, the NAND segment represented 39% of our systems revenue, flat with the September quarter. The spending was primarily focused on 192-layer and above class devices. The DRAM segment concentration decreased sequentially from the prior quarter, coming in at 11% of systems revenue compared to 13% in the September quarter. The DRAM investments were mainly targeted towards 1z and 1-alpha nodes. I expect that we will see both NAND and DRAM revenue decline meaningfully in the March quarter. For calendar 2023, I expect NAND spending to decline more than DRAM.
We continue to see strength in the Foundry segment with the December quarter concentration comprising 31% of our systems revenues. While this percentage is a little bit lower than September quarter level of 34%, the dollar amount was flat with a mix of investments in both leading and mature node devices. The Logic and Other segment revenue came in at a high watermark for the company, contributed 19% of systems revenue in the December quarter compared with 14% in the prior quarter. Investments were focused on microprocessor, image sensor and advanced packaging technologies. Lam had strong momentum in Logic and Other throughout calendar 2022. I expect we will continue to perform well in this segment. I’d mention that this was a record revenue level for us in microprocessor related revenue. We have been talking about momentum here for a while and it’s clearly showing up.
With respect to the regional composition of our total revenue, the China region was 24% of the total, down from the prior quarter level of 30%. This reduction was due to the U.S. government sales restrictions for certain domestic customers which were put in place in early October of 2022. Rounding up the top region of revenue locations, Korea comprised 20% of total revenue, up from 17% in the prior quarter and Taiwan decreased to a concentration of 19% compared to 22% in the September quarter.
The customer support business group results in the quarter were approximately $1.7 billion, which was down 9% from the September quarter, though it was 16% higher than the December quarter of calendar 2021. As I have noted in the past, CSBG revenues will fluctuate on a quarterly basis. And in the December quarter, we experienced declines in the CSBG product lines with reductions in utilizations and system spending. Going into calendar 2023, we have the impact of China regulatory restrictions in addition to memory spending at well below historic levels and elevated customer device inventory. These factors are resulting in customers having underutilized factories and taking actions to manage their supply levels in 2023, negatively impacting our spares and services business. While we continue to believe the mature node segment will perform better than overall WFE spending, we are in an unprecedented business environment and expect the CSBG business could be down somewhat in calendar year 2023.
Let me now pivot to our gross margin performance. The September quarter came in at 45.1% over the midpoint of the guided range, but down from September quarter’s gross margin of about 46%. The decrease from the September quarter was tied to customer and product mix. With the decline in business volumes in March 2023 quarter, we expect lower factory and field utilizations to unfavorably impact our gross margin on a sequential basis.
Operating expenses were $686 million in the December quarter, up 6% from the prior quarter amount of $647 million. The higher spending was mainly in R&D projects, which comprised nearly 67% of our total spending. Supporting our customers’ roadmap continues to be a top priority for us while we focus on managing other areas of discretionary spending within the company. December quarter operating margin was 32.1% over the midpoint of guidance due to the higher level of revenue and gross margin. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 11.9%, in line with expectations. Looking into calendar 2023, we believe the tax rate will be in the low to mid-teens with some fluctuations quarter-by-quarter. This rate estimate does not include any impacts from potential U.S. or global tax policy changes.
Other income and expense came in for the quarter at $38 million of expense, approximately $9 million higher from the prior quarter, mainly due to negative foreign exchange fluctuations which was somewhat offset by higher interest income because of increasing returns on our cash and investments. OI&E will continue to be subject to market-related fluctuations that will cause some level of volatility quarter-by-quarter. On the capital return side in the December quarter, we allocated approximately $483 million to open market share repurchases. Additionally, we paid $236 million in dividends in the quarter.
For the 2022 calendar year, we returned 119% of our free cash flow, totaling $3.5 billion which was somewhat higher than our long-term capital return plans of 75% to 100%. December quarter diluted earnings per share, was $10.71, which was at the high-end of our guidance range. Diluted share count was 136 million shares, which was lower than the September quarter and in line with our December quarter expectations. During 2022, we lowered share count by nearly 6 million shares through our share buyback program.
Now moving to the balance sheet. Our cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash, were up to $4.8 billion versus the prior quarter level of $4.6 billion. Operating cash flow of $1.1 billion in the December quarter was offset by cash allocated to share repurchases, dividend payments and capital expenditures. Inventory turns were 2.4x. Days sales outstanding were 70 days, a decrease from maybe 2 days in the September quarter due to strong collections and improved linearity within the quarter. I would point out that we expect 2023 to be a strong cash-generating year as working capital comes down with lower business levels. Our non-cash expenses for the December quarter included approximately $73 million for equity compensation, $73 million in depreciation and $12 million in amortization.
Capital expenditures for the December quarter were $163 million, a slight increase over the September quarter spending of approximately $140 million. The expenditures were in R&D and manufacturing, including our Korea Technology Center and our Malaysia factory. We ended the quarter with approximately 19,200 regular full-time employees, which was an increase of approximately 500 people from the prior quarter. Our growth was in the factory and field to support the manufacturing as well as installation of tools at our customers’ fabs. Also included in this headcount growth were 150 employees from the SEMSYSCO acquisition that was completed in the December quarter.
As you heard from Tim and saw in our earnings release, we will be reducing our regular full-time headcount by approximately 1,300 employees. We expect these reductions to be largely reflected in our June quarter ending headcount. In addition to the full-time reductions, we expect to be lowering our temporary workforce by approximately 700 people in the March quarter. We’ve already adjusted our temporary workforce down by 700 people in the December quarter.
Let me now turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the March 2023 quarter. We’re expecting revenue of $3.8 billion, plus or minus $300 million. I’ll also just mention that we currently think revenue will be somewhat first half weighted this year as we consume the reduction in deferred revenue in the March quarter. Gross margin of 44%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. The decrease in this is the result of lower business volumes. Operating margin of 27.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point; and finally, earnings per share of $6.50 plus or minus $0.75 based on a share count of approximately 135 million shares. We will be taking a charge of approximately $80 million in the March quarter from headcount reduction. Including this impact, and the other near-term actions that Tim spoke about, we are anticipating a total of $150 million to $250 million in charges to be incurred over the next 12 months.
In addition to headcount, we anticipate potential charges from facilities restructuring, business realignment and transformation and product rationalization. On top of the cost savings activities, we are driving a greater focus from our senior leadership team through inclusion of additional profitability metrics in our annual incentive compensation structure. Currently, we’re at low volumes given the business environment. These initiatives will structurally improve our profitability. As Tim already laid out, we expect gross margin to be higher by roughly 1 percentage point and to expand operating margins by a little more than that as we exit the calendar year and complete these activities.
Over many years in cycles, Lam has established a proven track record of successfully managing this business. With the actions we plan to execute throughout the year, we expect to strengthen our operations and technology leadership and further enhance our profitability profile with the company’s returning growth. When business improves, and we know it will, Lam will be a stronger, better positioned, more efficient company.
Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open up the call for questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Given the 20% pullback in WFE spend this year, significant memory spending pulled back within that, does the team still believe that the memory mix and spending expansion in memory will accelerate exiting this year? What’s your view? And then what’s your view on the supply-demand environment in memory and normalization of excess inventories in the industry? Yes. Harlan, I’ll start on that one. I think that the memory market and our market in general is difficult to predict from a timing perspective. So when you try to put a ending the year kind of time on it, it’s hard. But as Doug laid out, there is a couple of points. I mean, one, we’ve seen extraordinary measures within the memory market in terms of reductions, not only in spending but also cuts and fab utilization, and in some cases, even delays of technology investments. I think these are somewhat unprecedented in terms of trying to bring this market into balance. We also see memory as a percent of the total WFE mix that’s at levels that we haven’t seen in 25 years. And so I guess what we walk away with is a lot of confidence that memory spending will accelerate, but we’re not at this point ready to put an exact time frame on that. A lot of the actions that we talked about that we’re taking in the company are to ensure that in the next up cycle, will actually be far more nimble to respond to changes in demand than we were when we were impacted by the ramp that came around the COVID pandemic. So that’s really where we’re spending a lot of our time thinking about, less on timing but more about how is the company going to be prepared to respond to that ramp in memory spending, when it inevitably comes, and how do we ensure we can do that in the most efficient and profitable way positive. Perfect. And then on the impact from China regulatory and export controls, YMTC was formally put on the entities list in mid-December. Did this move change your prior view of a $2 billion, $2.5 billion impact to revenues this calendar year due to the China restrictions? No. When we put out the $2 billion, $2.5 billion fundamentally comprehended an inability to ship to the customers that at that point were operating at the technologies that were restricted by China, so it didn’t change it. I would say today, our view is still in that $2 billion to $2.5 billion range impact. No change at all, Harlan. Perfect. Thank you. Thanks, Harlan. We will take our next question from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Great. Thank you. I guess I wanted to ask about the deferred. And if you draw it down to sort of normal levels in March, it implies shipments that are kind of well below the revenue level. I guess with CSBG running at close to $1.7 billion, it doesn’t seem like the June quarter could fall that much. But can you just kind of give us a little bit more clarity on what it means that you’re drawing down that much deferred in March? It just means there is no more left at the end of the March quarter, Joe. I don’t really have any more than that to tell you. And yes, shipments are lower than that revenue number as we get the deferred kind of back to, what I would describe as, normalized level from a back-order standpoint. Okay. And I think you’ve described normal in the past as being around $700 million, and you said it would be a little higher than that? Is that the right math? Yes, that’s right, Joe. What I see happening right now is we’ve got, I call them customer cash and advanced deposits, which we haven’t yet shipped the tools. And I think as we go through ‘23, it’s going to stay at a slightly higher level from that category than it’s been in the past. So I think it’s a little bit higher, somewhat higher than that number that you just mentioned. Great. Thank you very much. Thanks, Joe. We will take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with UBS Securities. Please go ahead. Hi, thanks. Doug, I had two questions. First of all, is sort of on Joe’s question that you just asked. And it sort of is the profile, not in your revenue, but more in your system shipments through the rest of the year. You said slightly first half loaded from a revenue perspective, but I would assume that your system shipments are going to be – like March is probably the bottom and it sort of like flattens off from there. Is that fair? Yes, that’s fair, Tim. I think maybe I’ll answer a slightly different question. When I think about WFE in the mid-70s that Tim described, I think it’s fairly balanced through the year. Revenue somewhat first half weighted because we’re drawing down that deferred revenue balance. So I just wanted to point that out, which is why I scripted it that way. Perfect, Doug. Thanks. And then just on that point, you guys are usually 13%, 14% of WFE and your system shipments in March would imply that WFE is sort of 16% to 17% in March. So that’s more like mid-60s versus the mid-70s number for the year. So is the answer that lists making up the difference because, obviously, all of us heard SML today and systems are up 20% plus this year. So is the story this year really that you’re going to get to mid-70s predominantly because you’re adding an extra xxx billion is of litho year-over-year. Is that the math? Thanks. Yes, Tim, I think that’s part of it. When I look at WFE down more than 20% this year, memory is down a good deal more than that. Foundry Logic, a lot less. Litho is a heavier percent of the Foundry Logic spend. And I want to specifically point out the biggest decrease from a segment standpoint is in NAND, which, as you guys all know on this call, is our strongest segment and position at Lam. So that’s kind of important to understand, I think, and why I specifically pointed to that as I went through the commentary. Thank you, Doug. Thanks, Tim. We will take our next question from C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Hey, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question, I was hoping you could provide perhaps a little more granularity on the restructuring. You talked 100 bps gross margin and a little bit more than that. Is there any way to kind of give a sense of how we should see that play out throughout calendar ‘23? And what kind of leverage should we see specifically on the OpEx side? Yes. There is some in OpEx, Tim. Obviously, we’re taking reductions in every spending category. So you’ll see everywhere. That’s why Tim and I said operating margin would be more than the improvement in gross margin. Is there any way to quantify what that might look like? That’s all we’re going to give you right now, C.J. I mean the other thing you can back into, obviously, is the implied spending guide in the March quarter comprehends some of this headcount activity that we’re describing. So that’s – you’re seeing some of it in the March quarter, I think, if you go – decompose the guidance. Okay. Great. I guess a follow-up question. As you think about the moving parts for CSBG, obviously, you’ve got a year-over-year China headwind, you talked about Reliant. I guess, how do you see the rest of that core business? Does that core business grow? And is there a way to maybe perhaps rank order what’s doing well and then what’s doing worse? Yes, C.J., let me take that. Just to remind people, four segments in CSBG spare, service, upgrades and Reliance. And so I think kind of in terms of your impact really, if you think China impacted both spares and service, it made it impossible for us to provide spares and service to customers that previously had a pretty sizable chunk of tools in their installed base. So impact on both of those product lines from China. Those same two product lines impacted by memory customers cuts in utilization. So you’ve seen and heard from our customers talking about the number of tools they have taken offline in their DRAM and main fabs. Obviously, if you’re not running the tools, you don’t need spares and you don’t need service, so again, those same two product lines impacted by those changes. The Reliant business, obviously, just in that trailing edge Foundry Logic, I would say, we’re pretty comfortable with that business that we see continued strength there, maybe not enough obviously to offset the other the other two impacts, and that’s why I do said. We’re in a little bit of extraordinary times and that we would have previously thought that, that business couldn’t go down, but the combination of both China plus utilization hit those two product lines harder. Now we know that as customers begin to spend again, the first thing to do is to bring the tools that they already have in their installed base back online. And so we would expect that the spares and service business that was impacted by utilization cuts to recover quickly and we could immediately service that as soon as the business starts to improve. Very helpful. Thank you. Thanks, C.J. We will take our next question from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Yes. Hi, thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. First one, either for Tim or Doug and thanks for the color on calendar ‘23 WFE and I understand it’s too early to talk about ‘24. But if you look at some of your memory customers, they have publicly spoken about taking the utilization rates down. So could there be a scenario where next year, they could improve the utilization rates, improve wafer and bit output without necessarily adding WFE? Or do you think on a quarterly basis, WFE bottom sometime this year, and next year, hopefully, is a better year? And I have a follow-up. Yes. Okay. I’ll start and let Doug add I think that, obviously, there have been utilization cuts. I mean I think right now, if you look – at least by our estimate and listening to what our customers say, we’re at very low levels of supply growth this year as a result of the lack of additions and utilization cuts, so I don’t think you could quite get to the scenario you’re talking about where you just bring utilization – unutilized tools back online. There is a second factor though, which is, remember, I mean, customers make investments also to move their technology forward. And that’s a pretty substantial portion of why WFE gets spent, not often just about capacity addition. And so I think that customers are going to only go so long before you have to invest in the technology to move to that next node and gain the efficiencies that you do there. So I think that, of course, we will work with our customers to bring tools back online and get utilization work on productivity, but I think there’ll be – I think spending will return at some point. Got it. Got it. Thanks for that, Tim. And then a quick follow-up for Doug. I just – thanks for the comment on the back-half revenue as first half. How do you think about gross margin, given the fact that the top line is decelerating you’re also ramping up Malaysia, China seems to be a mixed bag. So I’m just kind of wondering how to think about gross margins or how to think about where they could potentially draw. Thank you. Yes, Chris, I hope we’re kind of bouncing along the bottom right now. I can’t guarantee that, but specifically, what we try to describe both Tim and I, is that with these actions we’re taking, we believe there is upward momentum to gross margin as we exit the year. We’re trying to get kind of capacity right staffing of the capacity rights so that as we exit the year, we think there is a point of gross margin upside, plus or minus where we’re at. Got it. Got it. Thanks a lot, Doug. Thank you. Yes. Thanks, Krish. We will take our next question from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one, I just wanted to touch on the deferred again. I just want to make sure I have it right. So you’re running $2 billion now. It sounds like you think normalized deferred might be $1 billion. So you got $1 billion that’s potentially coming out in March? Is that the right way to sort of think about the underlying demand, like where it is just like $1 billion like short of where we are or short of where the guide is and then going forward… Stacy, I think deferred is going to be higher than that $1 billion because of these cash invented payments I was referencing. It’s not going to go that well, I don’t think. And I think it’s going to stay. I think I’ve previously led everybody to believe deferred revenue would be in that high multiple hundred-million-dollar range. I think it’s decently above $1 billion now because of this other category of stuff I see. It’s like $1.5 billion? Or can you give us a little more color on that? Yes. It’s like $1.5 billion. Okay. That’s helpful, thanks. My follow-up, I just – I do want to ask a little more philosophical question on the workforce reductions. And maybe as it relates to WFE, I mean, like we probably did, I don’t know, $40 billion in memory WP in ‘22 and it’s going to be down a lot in ‘23. Like, even if it grows in ‘24, how long does it take to get back to that sort of ‘22 level, like if ever? And do the cost cuts that you’re doing, are they in some sense, a function of how you might view like that long-term sort of steady state WFE for memory versus where we’re coming off in ‘22? Yes, Stacy, maybe it combines a little bit maybe the last question we had as well, which is, we’re making these cuts and taking this action to make the company efficient and profitable at this level of business. And so therefore, we’re not really looking and saying we need a big increase or rapid increase in business to justify what we keep afterwards. But I did mention the focus that we have on ensuring that as we make cuts and as we reposition, especially the global operations infrastructure, we think about how quickly we can ramp up because we know when memory comes back, it often comes back much faster than people expect. And so I can’t tell you when it gets back to these numbers. But what I want to make sure is that when it does return to stronger spending in the memory side, we’re able to ramp that up and do it efficiently. So we don’t have a lot of the profitability headwinds that we’ve been talking about for the last really 12 to 18 months. And so that’s the way I think about it and get the company to the right size now for this level of business. But with the idea that we have, the infrastructure and the business systems available to us and the supply chain infrastructure to ramp more quickly, more efficiently should the market overshoot where our estimate is. But why don’t you need to cut more than because the cuts only take you back to where headcount was like six months ago, right? Stacy, I am comfortable at the profitability levels of the business at these revenue levels. We are getting things structured in the right way so that the P&L looks acceptable. I think Stacy, not all those heads were added in the volume side of the business as well. And so I talked about – and I think you will see when you look at the P&L, where we are trying to preserve what is strategic spending on the R&D side and the products that we think are important for the future growth of the company and competitiveness of our business. We are still committed, as I have said at the beginning, through our model of gaining market share in both the memory and the foundry logic side of the business and some of the spending is there as well. So, these are the cuts we think that are appropriate for how we think the business seems to be run through this cycle. Got it. That’s helpful. Thank you, guys. Thanks Stacy. We will go next to Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Great. Thank you so much. I had one clarification and then a follow-up question. On the clarification, last quarter, I think you guys sized the potential impact from China export restrictions to your business in calendar ‘23 at $2 billion to $2.5 billion, I believe three quarters on the systems side, a quarter in services. Are those numbers still your expectation for calendar ‘23? Any change there? Yes, no change. Got it. And then my question probably for Doug in terms of gross margin, last year, you talked about freight and component costs being a headwind and you also talked about pricing as a potential lever to offset some of the headwinds. How should we think about those dynamics as we progress through ‘23, any progress? Thank you. Yes. Toshiya, I guess what I describe is in some of the inflationary buckets I have been talking about for over the line talking about it, some of it’s getting somewhat better. And some of it, I think will get better, but we are not seeing it yet. So, that’s in what we have been talking about. And then relative to pricing activity, we continue to work on that. There are some things that’s already showing up in the P&L in the March quarter, but we continue to have ongoing conversations with customers about the right level of pricing, and that will continue as we go forward. And when you talk about the 100 basis point improvement exiting the full year, is that an all-in number, embedding all those factors? Yes. To the best of our reception as we sit here right now, yes, that’s all in of the pluses, the minuses, from business going down and the adjustments we are making in terms of the footprint of the company. Got it. Thank you so much. Yes. Thanks Toshiya. We will take our next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead. Thanks for taking my question. I am trying to gauge what is kind of your trough quarter of this year conceptually, right? I understand that you don’t give exact forecast. But if I go through this deferred revenue math, so let’s say another $500 million comes out suggest that your March shipped revenue conceptually is about $3.3 billion. Does that reflect all the China and memory CapEx cuts so that is sort of pure trough revenue quarter, or do you think there is more to come? So, the trough revenue quarter might be later this year, closer to $3 billion or some other number. I am just trying to conceptually gauge what is the trough quarter for this year, so we can get a sense for what trough earnings power could be. Toshiya, I guess sorry – Vivek, the best I can do is just say what I have already said. Revenue is somewhat first half weighted, largely because we are pulling the deferred down in March. In March, it’s pulled down to where it’s going to be. And so you got to kind of think about that plus the fact that I told you, we think WFE is fairly balanced first half, second half. And I think if you think that through, you will get it pretty close to where it should be. Got it. And then second question that I have is, China sales were 24%, I believe of total in December. But could you give us a sense for how much of that was China domestic? And then what do you expect China to be as a percentage of your sales in March and if you have a number roughly for calendar ‘23? Yes. In December, trying to remember the number. More than half of it certainly was domestic China. I forget the exact number, Vivek, to be honest with you, but more of it was domestic China. As we go through, China is going to be impacted to the $2 billion to $2.5 billion from the customers we can’t ship to. I think – when I think about China WFE, that means China WFE is going to be down somewhat in ‘23. Okay. So, this $2 billion to $2.5 billion, is that kind of run rate reflected in your March outlook? That’s what I wanted to just get a sense for. Yes. The things that we have kind of lost from that $2 billion to $2.5 billion, there is nothing in the March quarter. So, that’s part of the $2 billion to $2.5 billion. There isn’t any more reduction from March as we go forward. I am not sure I am making it clear to understand it, but Vivek, there is always timing of different customers spending money. It’s not that China is going to be up and China will be up and down as we go through the quarter, I expect. But the impact from the regulations is already fully in effect in the March quarter is what I am trying to describe. Got it. So, basically, Doug, just to kind of let it down. If I take the March ex deferred $3.3 billion, right, and kind of assume quarterly run rate is at level, that’s sort of how the shape of calendar ‘23 revenue should be, right? Listen, we only guide revenue one quarter at a time. I will guide June when we get to the next quarter earnings numbers. Thank you. Yes. Thank you. We will take our next question from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead. Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Doug, is the equipment demand now below the supply that you can receive from your suppliers? Is it below – sorry, is the question about supply chain constraints? Right. I mean are they fully removed now and the demand has fallen below the supply line? Yes. Well, as we said, we saw a significant improvement in the supply chain constraints in the December quarter, which is partly why we were able to deliver higher than the anticipated revenue. So, I would say that supply chain constraints are easing. There is always – and remain in some parts of the supply chain that are still not fully recovered. But I would say that if you went back and compare where we are today versus 12 months ago, dramatically improved. I think that we will continue to work on that through probably the remainder of this year on those remaining issues. Got it. And Tim, in your prepared remarks, you talked about conductor edge market share doubling node-to-node at one logic maker and gate all around, presumably is a big technology infection that should help you guys. Can you talk about the timing of the production ramp for gate all around? Is it second half, next year story, or is it more like a 2025-year event? Yes. I think that – I mean you see customers starting to talk about and announce kind of limited production. Yes, obviously, there is a qualification cycle, probably better for them to talk about their own timing. But it’s not a material issue for our 2023 numbers, let’s just say. So, it’s a 2024-and-beyond event. But those are the types of things that, again, if we think about where we want to take this business. Part of this is about increasing our exposure into that market where there is tremendous need, and I talked about the increasing intensity for etch and deposition in that space and foundry logic. And most of those big technology inflections where our tools are most suitable, things like selective etch, things like high-aspect ratio critical edge. The use of those tools are just increasing in these new 3D architectures. The increased use of advanced packaging in foundry logic and AI applications, those are, again, areas where Lam can bring our etch technology to bear. So, timing again, hard to predict, but we are making great progress of the development tool record and early production tool of record stages. And I think that as we see those markets ramp, that’s good for Lam. Thank you. Thanks Atif. We will go next to Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Zaman Khan [ph] for Sidney. And just on CSBG, I apologize if I might have missed this, but can you guide us on how you see each of the buckets that play into CSBG? How these will contribute to the segment’s overall performance in 2023? And I have a quick follow-up. Sure. Yes. I kind of hit on that a little earlier, but it was basically the four segments spare, service, upgrades and Reliant. And again, in a normal year, we would actually always see spares in particular, expanding with the growing installed base. I talked about the fact that our installed base is substantially larger than it was during the last down cycle. We just grow the installed base, spares grow along with that. And the impact this year to that business was somewhat unique, in that, the China restrictions did pull spares business immediately out of our revenue plan given that we cannot sell spares to certain customers and technologies in China. So, that’s a unique reset to that business. And then the second thing that impacts spares is when customers cut utilization, those tools are idled, obviously, don’t need spares. So, I would say the spares business is impacted by those two impacts. Service, similarly, we can’t service the tools in China that are restricted customers and technologies and also utilization customers tend to look to save money by doing the service themselves during these times or when tools are offline, they don’t need service. And so those two product lines are kind of the most impacted, I would say, by these changes, reliant, again, growing because trailing edge still grows and upgrades. While I said some people might be delaying again, just to – from a CapEx sensitivity perspective, some upgrades I would say there is a less impact in that part of the business. Got it. That’s pretty helpful. And then one more of a long-term question for me. I guess one of your major customers noted like very elevated infrastructure cost, roughly 4x to 5x when they build out fab capacity outside of Asia. I guess what are the implications to equipment spend as customers try to obviously diversify capacity across the regions? It’s a good question. I mean obviously, there is – all customers are cost sensitive regardless of where they are building fabs. I mean we certainly know as people move into costlier regions, I think the story is the same. We compete and we win business based on building tools that deliver excellent technology with high productivity. And I think that if I thought about what probably that means from an equipment trending perspective, I talked a lot about equipment intelligence. You think about it, if you are moving into a region where already some of the base costs are higher, you are going to want tools that require less human interaction, less servicing tools that can do predictive work in order to try to keep them up and utilize more at a higher rate. And so I think that you will see those types of customers pull for some of our smart solutions where you can kind of pull some of that labor content down if you can keep tools up and running more often and therefore, extract more from the capital that you have invested. Thanks for the color. Tim, that’s very helpful. Thanks. We will take our next question from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please go ahead. Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in. I had two questions. One, I just wanted to – obviously, a lot has transpired over the last 12 months and clearly a huge correction in memory. You are saying foundry logic down something less than the group the overall is. I am just kind of curious how you are thinking about that. I mean obviously, memory had to work through low utilizations and now they are pulling back on the capacity odds and same end markets. So, kind of just how are you thinking about foundry kind of progressing over this year or next? Yes. I guess right now, obviously, we still see, as we said, memory or foundry logic being down substantially less than the memory this year. We have also made the comment that as a percent of total WFE memory is at levels that we haven’t seen in 25 years. And so therefore, I guess we look at it and it’s either we see strong founder logic spending, but we actually think that with that foundry logic spending in the devices and applications that are created, that will be another one of the drivers that pulls through memory usage and causes and perhaps accelerates a memory recovery. And so I think that the two are intricately tied in terms of the end applications, but sometimes the timing of the capacity additions and such are absent I think that’s what we see right now. Blayne, I guess what I would describe is – go ahead, ask your next question. I want to hear what you would say, Doug. I was just going to say at the end of the day, you need all of this in the system architecture. When you look at hyperscale architecture, you don’t just have logic devices and accelerators without memory, right. It’s all got kind of all go on the same motherboard, if you will. What we have got going on, at least my perspective right now is we are should on excess inventory in the memory area to a significant extent, and it’s just got to get consumed. We are at a different point in the classic cycle is what I was going to describe Blayne. Okay. I guess – I mean it’s a question – I am going to – I want to follow on to my own question, but it’s also one for yourself. I mean you look across the industry in semis inventories are going up. I think you have seen this in memory, but also with semiconductor companies and your inventories as well, right? So, it suggests capacity exceeds demand, right? So, I guess one, I guess that’s why question why foundry logic can kind of continue and I think memory might be leading the show there. But I guess as it relates to you, inventories are at a very high level. So, I am just kind of curious as another play on gross margin, where do you think your inventories need to go? And if you have to dial back your production, is there any kind of headwinds to gross margin to think about? Yes. Blayne, our inventory is going to go lower, I guess is what I would describe, right. Business is coming down. We will need less inventory to supply a lower level of business, it will come down, that I can tell you for sure. And does that have any impact to gross margin? Yes, a little bit. But when I describe an expectation, I mean I describe an expectation that as we exit the year, gross margin is a point higher, that contemplates the fact that factory absorption, utilization and so forth is going to be lower, and we will be bringing inventory down. Awesome. Appreciate it. Thank you. Thanks, Blayne. Operator, we have time for one more question, please. Thank you. And we will take our last question from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Yes. Thanks for taking the questions. Last quarter, you had talked about the Reliant business or kind of one does with the decline in WFE and just kind of weakness in consumer electronics that, that business could also be negatively impacted. And it sounds like maybe this quarter, you are a little bit more constructive on that business. Is that, I guess the right way to think about it? And then two, maybe what’s driving that? Yes. No, Joe, we didn’t mean to describe it any differently. I think last quarter and this quarter, we said we expect that segment of foundry and logic to be somewhat better than overall WFE. I think we said that last time. I am pretty sure we did and we are saying that again. I think they may have come across – Joe, just a little bit – maybe a little more constructive than the other product lines that were within CSBG, I think why I think there was a question about kind of ranking them or stacking those. It’s the least impacted by the changes like time restriction and utilization. That was – that was maybe why it came across that way. No intention to send a different message from last quarter, though. Got it. That’s helpful. And then just in terms of the total CSBG business, when we think about the impact from the China export restrictions, obviously, the utilization coming down just across the board is a negative impact. But would that business be, I guess closer to flat, it’s just kind of like-to-like without the China export restrictions? It’s certainly being doing better and we described it as likely down somewhat. And historically, I have always said, this is a business that should grow every single year. I wish I wouldn’t have said that because I couldn’t envision the environment we are in with utilization in China and so forth. So, we are just giving you kind of the lay of the land right now, Joe. Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you, operator. I think that concludes the call for us. We are wrapped up here. Thank you all for joining. Thank you. This concludes today’s call.

A replay of this call will be made available later this afternoon on our website.
And with that, I'll hand the call over to Tim. Thank you, Tina, and welcome, everyone. Lam's March quarter results reflect strong execution with revenues, operating margins and EPS all exceeding the midpoint of our guidance. Foundry-related system revenues achieved record levels, demonstrating our solid progress in both leading edge and specialty technology segments. We continue to prioritize investments in long-term technology road maps, customer support and operational transformation while prudently managing near-term spending and profitability.
As our June quarter guidance indicates, the near-term demand environment remains challenging. We expect 2023 WFE spending to be in the low to mid $70 billion range, with additional weakness primarily from memory customers, partially offset by domestic China-related demand. On the China front, we see incremental strength in mature node logic and memory segments. Recently, the U.S. government notified us of a clarification to the rule issued last October governing exports to China.
This notification allows us to ship certain products that we had originally excluded from our expectations. We expect to ship these tools in the second half of 2023. Overall, Memory customers continue to lower fab utilizations, slow technology conversions and reduce investments in capacity additions to limit bit output and drive inventory down to normalized levels. We expect memory spending for the year to decline approximately 50% from 2022, and led by NAND.
Memory spending in 2023 is at a historic low as a percentage of total WFE. We believe this level of investment is unsustainable to support long-term growth in bit demand, especially considering the data-intensive applications such as AI, are still in the early stages of adoption and can have approximately 3x the DRAM and 8x the storage content of a regular server. In addition, advances in memory architectures such as DDR5 are driving process technology evolution and larger die sizes.
As these trends accelerate, Lam's established leadership in memory, positions us to outperform as we benefit not only from investments in new tools for capacity, but also from the technology upgrades to our large installed base of tools. Our installed base for memory has increased close to 40% compared to the last down cycle. It is a valuable platform for growth when memory customers begin to ramp utilization back to normal levels, and convert existing lines to next-generation nodes.
While Lam clearly stands to benefit when memory conditions improve, this is the one aspect of our growth opportunity. Rising manufacturing complexity tied to key technology inflections is positive for both overall capital intensity and more importantly, Lam's areas of product strength. For example, EUV patterning and gate all-around devices are two important inflections where Lam has made significant investments in new products for processing at the atomic scale.
We are gaining traction with these new products, yet they are in the early stages of the ramp with the majority of growth still in front of us. If we look at patterning, it is already a multibillion-dollar opportunity for Lam. We have a leading share position in this segment, and we are broadening our footprint as EUV adoption scales. Lam's edge solutions have been developed to enhance productivity of EUV by creating well-defined smooth patterns with minimal EUV photon exposure.
Our pulse plasma capabilities help reduced line width roughness, which is a particularly challenging problem as EUV resist become thinner at future nodes. Lam's etch portfolio is on track to win close to 75% share of these EUV patterning applications. Also, as the pattern is etched into the film stack, the hardness and stress in the films has a strong influence on Pattern Fidelity. Precise control of film properties is a hallmark of our deposited hard mask films. We are already the process tool of record for critical applications in the foundry logic segment for EUV patterning with continued growth expected as EUV adoption expands.
Addressing EUV scalability challenges is also the central goal behind our dry resist technologies. Last year, we saw the first adoption of our drive development and underlayer plusses for EUV applications by a major memory customer. Our progress extended to include a second large memory player in the March quarter. Today, I'm pleased to provide another update. A key foundry logic customer is set to adopt our dry resist deposition, drive development and underlayer solution for their EUV applications, and we will start recognizing revenues for these products in calendar 2023.
Looking ahead, the challenges of EUV patterning will continue to grow at every technology node, and in particular, when high NA EUV adoption dictates the need for even thinner EUV resist. With our differentiated pattern etch, hard mask and drive resist solutions, we see our product portfolio becoming increasingly vital to the industry's scaling road map. Moving to gate-all-around, this inflection introduces what we consider to be the first true 3D logic device from a processing perspective. It requires new etch and deposition capability to address the geometric complexity performing the all-around characteristics of the transistor.
Processing for gate-all-around, just as the name implies, must take place on top of, underneath and inside the device, where reactors need to reach spaces that are perpendicular to the usual reaction direction. The 3D nature of gate-all-around architecture is well suited to atomic layer deposition and atomic layer etching solutions, making a key inflection that plays to our strengths. For Lam, the transition to the gate-all-around node is close to $1 billion incremental opportunity per 100,000 wafer start per month capacity. Our expectation is for our share in this market to be at least as good as our overall goals for the Company.
To address the manufacturing challenges of gate all-around devices, Lam has launched several new products including our Selis, Prevos and Argos suite of selective etch tools with more to come in the future. These tools can etch and treat all surfaces of the device with ALE like precision. Our selective etch tools have achieved process of record positions at multiple customers for gate-all-around applications, and we saw continued momentum in the March quarter with additional shipments to key customers.
Atomic-level control is also increasingly critical in depositing films in the complex geometries very close to the transistor. Our differentiated approach uses a radical based plasma ALD reactor to deliver high-performance films with high-volume manufacturing ready productivity. Multiple customers have now adopted Lam's ALD low-case spacer and nitride films and we see this demand growing in future nodes.
In summary, we are working through a lower WFE year in 2023 by managing near-term expenses, strengthening our operational capabilities and prioritizing R&D investments tied to critical manufacturing inflections. Our focus remains on ensuring that when WFE growth resumes, the criticality of our products to our customers' plans and the value of our installed base, which has grown nearly 40% since the last downturn, put us in a strong position to outperform. Thank you.
And now, I'll turn it over to Doug. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. Our March 2023 quarter financial results came in at or over the midpoint of our guidance ranges for all financial metrics. We generated over $1.6 billion of free cash flow during the quarter, which was a record level for the Company. Overall, we not only delivered financial performance in line with our guidance for the quarter, but we also made great progress on our business transformation and cost-saving initiatives.
Let me now move to our revenue and profitability results. Revenue for the March quarter was $3.87 billion, down 27% from the prior quarter. Systems revenue was the main driver of the decrease given the decline in WFE investments most notably in memory. As expected, with the improvement in supply chain constraints, we are exiting the March quarter having completed shipments for nearly all of our outstanding back order systems.
Back orders are now at what I would characterize as normalized levels. However, our deferred revenue balance is higher than historic levels remaining flat with the prior quarter with a balance of $2 billion. This deferred revenue balance reflects the impact of increased customer cash and advanced deposits tied to orders from newer customers, which is offset by the decline related to the completed back orders. The advanced payments will remain in deferred revenue until we ship the related tools. And I would just mention that we do expect the majority of these deposits to convert the revenue during calendar year 2023.
Looking at the revenue segment details for the March quarter. The percentage of systems revenue in memory was 32%, which is a decline from the prior quarter level of 50%. I would mention this is the lowest level of memory concentration for us in a decade. Within Memory, the NAND segment represented 23% of our systems revenue, down from the December quarter level of 39%. And DRAM decreased sequentially, coming in at only 9% of systems revenue compared with 11% in the December quarter.
With the current weakness in memory investments, we anticipate a further decline in both NAND and DRAM revenue in the June quarter. In foundry conversely, we had a record dollar level of revenue in the March quarter, representing 46% of our systems revenue, higher than the percentage contribution in the December quarter, which was 31%. We had positive momentum in both leading and mature node devices.
And I'm pleased with the progress we've made in this segment of the market. We are seeing particular concentration in the mature node investments this year. The logic and other segment had continued strength with a contribution of 22% of systems revenue in the March quarter compared with 19% in the prior quarter. Investments were from a broad array of logic IDM in multiple regions.
Let me now shift and discuss the regional contribution of our total revenue. Korea and China were at the top of the list with each coming in at 22% of the total. The Korea region had a slightly higher concentration in the March quarter, up from 20% in the December quarter. China was down from 24% in the prior quarter, and the reduction was largely attributed to the U.S. government sales restrictions for certain Chinese domestic customers which were put in place in early October of 2022.
Notably, in the United States, we had a record revenue from a dollar perspective in the March quarter, which represented 16% of our total revenues an increase from the prior quarter level of 10%. And finally, Taiwan decreased to a concentration of 18% as compared with 19% in the December quarter. Our Customer Support Business Group generated revenue in the March quarter, totaling approximately $1.6 billion, which was a decrease of 7% from the December quarter but 14% higher than the March quarter in calendar 2022.
CSBG continues to be a resilient part of our business model, representing over 40% of our March quarter revenue. We saw utilization level -- excuse me, utilization levels decline at the memory customers which negatively impacted both spares and service businesses, but Reliance Systems and upgrade revenues increased in the March quarter given the demand strength we're seeing in mature node devices. The specialty technology market is performing better than overall WFE, and I expect this part of the business to continue to perform well during calendar year 2023.
Let me now pivot to our gross margin performance. The March quarter came in at 44%, right at the midpoint of our guided range and down from 45.1% in the December quarter. The quarter-on-quarter decrease was tied to lower business volumes as well as customer and product mix. The Company is focused on improvements in cost and efficiency to enhance profitability which is aligned with our plan to expand gross margin by at least 1 percentage point exiting calendar year 2023.
Operating expenses were $608 million in the March quarter, down 11% from the prior quarter amount of $686 million. We executed on cost savings actions and have managed spending across the Company while prioritizing investments in support of our customers' road maps. R&D expenses comprised nearly 70% of our operating expenses, which is a high point for the Company.
The March quarter operating margin was 28.3% and above the midpoint of guidance, mainly because of the cost saving actions and expense management that we undertook. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 13.1% and in line with our expectations. Looking into calendar 2023, we believe the tax rate will be in the low to mid-teens with fluctuations expected quarter-to-quarter.
Other income and expense came in for the quarter at $8 million in expense lower by approximately $30 million from the prior quarter. The decrease in expense reflects increased interest income due to the higher cash balances as well as rising interest rates. OI&E will continue to be subject to market-related fluctuations that will cause some level of volatility each quarter. On the capital return side of things in the March quarter. We allocated approximately $483 million to open market share repurchases.
Additionally, we paid $234 million in dividends in the quarter. We continue to track towards our long-term capital return plans of returning 75% to 100% of our free cash flow. March quarter diluted earnings per share was $6.99 and at the higher end of our guided range. Diluted share count was down to 135 million shares on track with our expectations and obviously lower a little bit than the December quarter.
For the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash at the end of the March quarter totaled $5.6 billion up from $4.8 billion at the end of the December 2022 quarter. The increase was largely due to collections offset by cash allocated to share buyback and dividends and capital expenditures. Days sales outstanding were 77 days in the March quarter, an increase from 70 days in the December quarter.
Inventory turns declined from the prior quarter to 1.9x, and we ended the March quarter with a slightly higher inventory dollar balance. We will continue to manage inventory balances during the calendar year. Non-cash expenses for the March quarter included approximately $74 million in equity compensation in depreciation and $14 million for amortization.
Capital expenditures for the March quarter were $119 million, down from the December quarter level by approximately $44 million. March quarter investments were mainly for our Malaysia factory, the Korea Technology Center and other product development activities. As we discussed in the January earnings call, we had a workforce reduction within the March quarter of approximately 1,400 people.
Additionally, we reduced 700 temporary workers. We incurred a charge for the workforce actions in the March quarter of approximately $99 million, primarily reflecting severance-related payments. This charge was somewhat higher than our original estimate due to more impacted people with a somewhat higher seniority level.
We also incurred other one-time charges in the quarter for product rationalization decisions as we prioritize technology investments within the Company and for transformation costs related to projects to improve our systems and operations. We anticipate we'll incur one-time costs in the range of $250 million within calendar year 2023 and which is inclusive of the $144 million that we expensed in the March quarter. We ended the March quarter with approximately 18,700 regular full-time employees, which is a slight decrease in the prior quarter.
Due to the timing of our quarter end and our restructuring actions, a significant amount of the head count reduction we undertook won't be reflected in the headcount number until the June quarter. Now let's turn to the non-GAAP guidance for the June 2023 quarter. We are expecting revenue of $3.1 billion plus or minus $300 million. The sequential decline reflects a soft memory environment and the normalization of back order systems that occurred in the March quarter. Gross margin of 44%, plus or minus 1 percentage point; operating margins of 25.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point; and finally, earnings per share of $5, plus or minus $0.75 based on a share count of approximately 134 million shares.
So then let me summarize. 2023 is proving to be a challenging environment for our memory shipments, but I'm pleased with the progress we're accomplishing against this challenging backdrop. We continue to make progress on growing our technology leadership and focusing on our operational efficiencies. We will emerge from this memory-led downturn, is stronger better positioned, more efficient company. In closing, I just mentioned one more thing. that as we look at the profile of WFE spending this year, it now appears to be a little bit second half weighted.
Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. Tim and I would now like to open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from C.J. Muse with Evercore. I guess the first question would be on deferred revenues. Exiting last quarter, I think you talked about trying to get to $1.5 billion and then we'd normalize there, whereas on this call, you said you expected to revenue the majority of these deposits in calendar '23. So can you help us understand the moving parts there? And what kind of contribution in the June quarter guide will come from a deferred revenue line? Yes. C.J., I got a little bit wrong last quarter is what I would tell you. The cash and bank deposits from some of our newer customers ended up being a little bit more than we expected. Offsetting that, to a certain extent, was the decline in back orders. So we got that part exactly right. But what I didn't give when I told you 1.5 would be the normalized level was this cash in advance deposits I think that is going to be around for a little while. And like I said, I think the majority of that will revenue during calendar year '23, clearly in the second half. I don't think a whole lot of it shows up in the June quarter, if any of it. Okay. Very helpful. And then I guess to follow up on your last comment around WFE being a little bit more second half weighted. That seems like a seismic shift. I guess, is that just the magnitude of the cuts that you've seen kind of in the first half? Or has anything else changed? And I guess as you think about that, if you do have the benefit of deferred revenues in the second half and WFE higher, it certainly would suggest that second half total revenues should be nicely higher than the first half. Yes. C.J., I mean, I think that commentary on second half being a little bit higher, I think has something to do also with the effect that we talked about incremental weakness clearly, our June quarter has been weaker than what we probably thought as we came into the year. And so, some of that shows up in the back half, I think it is a case of customers continue to make pretty aggressive adjustments, both the utilization of tools as well as overall spending. That's what we're seeing here in the first half. We also talked about the fact that with the some clarification on the time restrictions, there would be additional shipments that occur through China in the second half that weren't originally anticipated. So that does help us with WFE in the second half as well. And the next question will come from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Tim, if I take your comments and I combine them with Applied and ASML earlier today, obviously, there's this huge explosion in demand coming from China lagging edge. How sustainable do you think this is? It sort of feels kind of like given the restrictions they're just taking what they can get, which is now they're pouring all their money into lagging edge. So does that worry you that maybe that's not sustainable? Or is there something going on there where there's real demand backing that? Well, I believe that there is real demand. I mean every region, I think, is trying to build up a regional capability to manufacture all types of semiconductors. And as you just said, I mean, in China, this is one area that they have the ability to create that capability and also they have the demand to consume it as well. And so I think from that standpoint, it's good demand for us and for others in the industry. But I think in a bigger sense, this regional self -- call it self-sufficiency or regional resilience that's being built, I think, is going to have a long-term impact on spending in the industry.
And so we're not trying to sort of play the game of is it or is it not sustainable? We're talking to our customers, and in some cases, these are new projects that are coming up. We do our own assessment of whether or not they will be able to invest if they have the technology. And I think that with not only U.S. chipset, but recent news on the European chipset, I think that this is something that it's going to have a positive impact on spending to the industry across both leading-edge and these trailing and specialty ecology segments for quite some time. And then I guess, Doug or Tim, can you just provide more color on -- you said that there's been some clarification of the export rules. Can you give an example of what can ship now that was assumed to not be able to ship in the past? It's exactly the same as what was issued in the October 7 rules in terms of technology limits. We want to be very clear on Lam staying compliant with the restrictions. And so, at the time we had given the guidance for the year, we said $2 billion to $2.5 billion of impact. We knew we were looking for clarification on how to determine whether some shipments that were in there could be made. That's why there was a range. And so now with that clarification on how you determine what can and can't ship, we've added those tools back into our forecast the year. But if you look at the rules that are there, it's exactly what was printed on October 7. Yes, Tim, just to put some numbers around it, it's a few hundred million dollars, I think, as we look at revenue for the year for Lam. And our next question will come from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. I do the first one, just a follow-up on the China question. Doug, just like trying to like put all the comments together with back half loaded WFE some of the relaxation of China constraints and strong demand from lagging in China. Is it that assumes June quarter is a trough quarter for you from a revenue standpoint? And heading into back up, your gross margin should improve as you start shipping more China? And then I have a follow-up. Yes. I mean, Krish, what I said is it's a slightly second half-weighted WFE year. And by the way, I just clarify if there's any confusion about the deferred cash and advanced deposits that are sitting there, that's in the WFE number. So that's part of the second half weighting as well, just so everybody's clear about that. And then, Krish, yes, when I look at what we're doing with the cost structure and how we're sort of pivoting where we do what we do, I've been talking, I think, the second quarter about a view that we should exit the year at least a percentage point gross margin higher than where we are. I still believe that is the trajectory that we're on. Got it. Super helpful. And then just a technology question for Tim. You had the slide on gate-all-around, and you spoke about the opportunity in ALD and ALE I'm kind of curious because ASM International is a leader in ALD. And why would customers shift to someone else versus the incumbent just because of gate-all-around. Is or are there any gate-all-around specific technology issues that your ALD is addressing that the incumbent is note? Thank you. It's a good question because I guess the point is we have a very strong position in ALD across a number of different types of films. And what I tried to speak to is there are specifically new types of challenges to introduce. And in the end, customers select tools based on the film performance, the deposition capabilities, the tool productivity reliability and manufacturing, lots of different factors. And I think these are areas that just over the years, Lam has excelled, and we -- I think we can in ALD as well. Thanks, Krish. And the next question will come from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. I think you mentioned you saw some impact from utilization on the CSBG business in the March quarter. Can you talk about what that looks like for the next couple of quarters? Are you seeing impact from lower memory utilization within those numbers? And then as a follow-up, can you give us some sense of as Reliant keeps getting presumably bigger, how much of the -- what's in CSBG is actually kind of more on the Reliant tool side? Yes. Let me take a crack at the utilization. I mean, obviously, you've heard a lot within the memory industry about utilization cuts and even some throughout the different segments of the markets. That clearly hits our spares and services business as customers look to save money in the near term, the idle tools. They also burn off some of the inventory they might have built up over the last couple of years. And so that's clearly showing up in CSBG. Eventually, that runs its course, and our expectation is that there's going to be -- especially on the memory side, you'll start to see CSBG revenues improve likely long before you start to see us talk about much higher WFE.
And that's because customers will start to bring those tools back online, and you'll see CSBG revenues increasing. You'll then also see customers start to do some of the technology upgrades that they've been kind of holding off on doing in the installed base that will also show up in our CSBG revenue. And then finally, we will ultimately see increases in WFE for capacity additions. And so, I think that's where we'll see continuous improvement in CSBG. We're not going to cure a time frame on it, but it is it is causing us to be a bit low now. And I think we'll get back to that point when we say CSBG is a business we think grows kind of year-on-year, just not this year with utilization cuts. Great. And then sometimes of the Reliant as a release qualitatively, how much of the business is from Reliant now? Yes, Joe, I'll chime in on that one. I think I heard saying last quarter that the two biggest components of CSBG are now Spares and Reliant, and that continues to be true in the most recently reported quarter. Reliant is doing extremely well with the more mature specialty note investments that we've been talking about. So that's benefiting and the utilization stuff that Tim talked about is a little bit of a headwind for Spares. So -- but they're still the two largest components to CSBG. And the next question will come from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your North American business again drove strong growth, right? Part of it is your share gains. But how much of the growth is simply -- you've got the one big U.S. customer that wasn't contributing to WFE intensity for six years because they were stuck on one node, but now they're back on track, right, trying to drive five node migrations in four years, so strongly contributing to foundry and logic, WFE intensity. How much of the growth is share gains versus just this customer back driving WFE intensity. Yes. Harlan, I think we're seeing -- we're obviously seeing a combination of both. I mean share gains, and it's not isolated to any one customer when I dedicated a lot of my prepared remarks to was the progress we're making, expanding our SAM and our product portfolio primarily focused on foundry logic. We recognize and we've said that this is an area that we've been under-indexed, which means that it's an area of significant growth opportunity for the Company. And you see just a number of new products we've introduced whether it'd be through the EUV inflection or it's the gate-all-around inflection. And so it's SAM expansion driving our growth, and it's also share gains within that expanded SAM. And it's across all foundry and logic customers had some element of both. I appreciate that. And then, Tim, you also mentioned in your prepared remarks -- I'm sorry, I missed some of that, but you announced some new wins with your dry photoresists process module system solution. Can you just talk more about that? And when do you expect customer adoption curve to start to drive some meaningful revenues for the team here. Yes. Well, yes, what I announced -- sorry, if you missed it, was the last year, we had announced on memory customer who adopted some elements of dry resist this technology solution. In March, a second memory customer did as well. And then more recently, a large foundry logic customer has chosen to adopt the resist deposition drive development as well as the underlayer processes.
And -- so those are -- that's a really nice expansion across both memory, which is obviously DRAM using EUV, memory and foundry logic. And I think it sets us up well for continued momentum. Customers, look, everybody knows that EUV adoption is growing. And as I commented, it's becoming more challenging as people look for better productivity. They look for better technology capability within the resist. And I think that these are trends that are setting up well for us.
I mentioned we'll be revenuing some tools starting this year, so that's a very nice milestone for us. And then I just would point you back, we have sized this at approximately $1.5 billion in revenue over a five-year time frame. And I think as adoption continues to grow the size of the subrogate and continue to grow for Lam. And the next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. The first on just the memory market, is second half better or worse than the first half for you in terms of your memory shipments? I'm just trying to gauge whether June is also kind of a bottom for memory? Or is there more to fall on the memory side? And I think related to it, one of your customers have said that for them, their WFE and memory could be down even in the next fiscal year. And I know it's a fiscal and not a calendar year view. But do you think that's an industry-wide view or just in terms of how customers are thinking about 24 WFE on the memory side. So, just kind of a near and longer term memory questions. Yes. Vivek, I don't want to get into which segment is doing what in the first or second half. I mean memory is at a pretty low level right now. And we did say in the prepared remarks, June is even lower than March, and March was at a 10-year low in terms of our shipment and revenue anyway into that space. Hard to see a whole lot lower than we're seeing right now. I don't want to get into the parsing the little bit of growth in the second half where it comes from, but memory is at a pretty low point right now, I would say. And on the 24 WFE, again, not trying to get a 24 view specifically, but I think one of your customers has been public about reducing memory WFE even in their fiscal '24. Do you think that's a customer-specific view? Or is that an industry-wide view that Memory WFE could stay under pressure next year? Or is it too early to make that assertion? Yes. I guess I could say that in 2022, you might recall, we gave you the 2023 outlook about a quarter early. I think three quarters early might be a little early for '24. So I don't think we're going to give WFE for '24. But what I'd point to is that, as I just said, you look at from we signaled last -- in the September quarter call, the $23 million would be down in WFE. I think we wanted the first to do so is because we saw this decline in memory, we're already -- our revenue from December 22 to the June guide we just gave down 40%. So we're well into this cycle.
And just as I laid out, I think we're going to see as we move through the remainder of this year and into next year, utilizations eventually come back, technology conversion start to occur. And then finally, WFE starts to tick back up. The great thing about the cost cuts that Doug talked about is we put ourselves in a position that we don't feel we have to be able to call the exact quarter when that's going to happen. But we think we're well into it and operating the Company well at these levels and with some upside to come. Right. And just a quick follow-up, Doug, maybe one for you. On the OpEx side, is this sort of reflecting all the OpEx actions? Or do you think that in September or December, OpEx could decline further. I mean that the last time you guys were at this OpEx level you were able to report revenues that were significantly higher. So kind of just two parts. Is this kind of the bottom in OpEx? And then should we see a lot more leverage, right, as the end markets start to grow? Yes, Vivek. I think the majority of the cost actions we've taken, certainly, I talked about $99 million of non-related severance. That's largely complete. So I think a lot of it is already kind of in the run rate. Certainly, if you look at where we're at in June, it's down again quite a good amount. So Vivek, I'd also just add to that. I spent a lot of time talking about the work we're doing to broaden our product portfolio and expand really Lam strength beyond memory into some of the fast-growing inflections that are occurring elsewhere. I think this quarter was nearly 70% of our OpEx spend in R&D. And so we're absolutely committed to supporting technology road maps to grow this company. And so we're watching that.
Obviously, if we see further deterioration, I think you can count on us to manage this business prudently. But at this point, we want to also be prepared for when the market does come back, and we know it will come back that we are prepared to support our customers with the engineering capabilities and the new products and all the technologies that they're going to want to buy at that time. So we're really working that balance and that's what you see in our spending levels right now. And moving on to Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. For the first one, I want to go back to these new customers that are in the deferred balance. I guess, are they all Chinese. And can you give us a view of which end markets that additional deferred revenue is in it? Like is it all foundry and not memory? Because I know you got one of the big Chinese memory places on the entity list. I'm assuming you're not able to sell anything to them. So just a little bit of color on is it -- is all Chinese are not and what are the end markets that are actually driving it? Yes, Stacy, the end markets are primarily foundry and logic, the mature nodes, Andre and logic. And I will acknowledge it's got a decent Chinese footprint to it. Got it. Got it. And so I guess you've got this -- I guess it's $500 million, right, because I mean, the deferred is like $2 billion in you said the $500 million reduction that you expected to be there before is actually there, and this was offsetting so I guess about $500 million. Is this coming back in the back half and this China revenue shipping? I'm trying to get -- are they the same things? Is the incremental China revenue that you've got like because you can ship more because of the sanctions? Is that the same as the incremental balances in the deferred? And as that kind of adds to the back half are those things -- I just want to make sure I'm not double counting anything. Yes, Stacy, there's a very large overlap is what I would say. And I said the majority of that cash and advance payment will revenue in the second half. I didn't say all. I said the majority. And then the other thing I said a moment ago, the incremental clarification we got from China was a few hundred million dollars. So you got to think through where I left. Got it. Okay. That's super helpful. Maybe if I could squeeze in just one more really quick. I know you said memory is down again sequentially, but there can't be very much memory in there at all, right? I mean, if you're guiding 31 I mean -- I mean your foundry plus logic in this quarter was almost 1.6%. And so if that was you can't be guiding equipment revenues much different than that. I mean, are we just literally taking memory kind of scraping the bottom of the barrel in June quarter at this point? I mean I know we don't know how long it stays there, but presumably it can't get much lower than it's going to be in June. Yes, Stacy, I told you in March, it was at a decade long low point for us, and it's down again in June. It's -- frankly, my personal thing, it's hard to see down much more than we're describing in June, frankly. It's at a very low level. I'd just add. I mean my comment, Stacy, I was just going to add that the fact that in many cases, the -- we see customers even delaying technology upgrades in order to, one, not necessarily make the investment, but also not add further bits into the market. That's a pretty rare case. I mean technology investments usually proceed because that's the path to lower cost and better capabilities. So I would agree if that's come out. It feels like we're about its lowest -- and that may be coming below maintenance levels I think here. So that's our view on memory. And the next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. As a follow-up to the last question, I'm curious how you're thinking about normalized levels of spending across the memory industry. When we look at your business, I think you did close to $7 billion in memory systems revenue in calendar. And given how things are going now, I don't know, maybe roughly $3 billion, this may be a little bit below that. Assuming, hypothetically, if you're customers are done shipping out of inventory exiting this year and DRAM bits are growing kind of in the mid-teens and NAND bits are growing kind of in the mid-20s. How significant how big would your memory business be in that sort of state? Is it kind of the midpoint between $7 billion and $3 billion? Or is it higher? How should we think about that? Yes. And I'll give it a quick response. It's hard for me to envision it being lower than it is this year. I mean, it's down 50% memory in total, right, Tim. I think had that in the scripted remarks. That's done a lot. I can't ever remember it being down that much on a year-over-year basis. You might say, hey, last year might have been a little too high or somewhat too high? Probably to -- it's -- I'm not going to get into a precise number, but it's certainly higher than it is this year, maybe not the size it was last year, though. I appreciate that. As my follow-up, Doug, just on gross margins, I appreciate the calendar year-end target of 45%. Curious, how you're thinking about gross margins beyond that. A couple of years ago, you guys were doing 47, some quarters close to 4 million you're introducing pretty differentiated product between EUV patterning and drive it. And I know those are pretty small businesses still. But you're putting out these products. You've got Malaysia, which hopefully with the recovery continues to ramp. Is there a path to, call it, 47-ish percent in calendar '24? Or are there headwinds that we should be aware of? Let me take a shot and Doug can clean up as needed. I think the question about gross margin. We're not backing off on the financial models we put out in the past. And as you pointed out, we were getting big close to operating there while Malaysia was still a headwind. And so obviously, it will require a combination of some increased volumes. We've done a tremendous work to transfer a lot of our volume into lower-cost regions, really get a much more efficient supply chain.
The COVID period was a real setback as you, again, sourced and grew in every possible location. But I think over the next period of time. And I hate to put a time frame on it again, to give a 24 outlook. But if we exit this year with the incremental improvement of 100 basis points, as Doug talked about or more and we have further volume and contribution coming through our new Asia facilities. I think that will drive right back towards those goals that we set back in 2020, which was in kind of that 47%, 48% gross margin range. And the next question will come from Atif Malik with Citi. Similar to the last question on gross margins, Doug, can you help us understand by the end of the year, what percentage of your manufacturing will be in Malaysia and what are the steps you're taking in terms of asset optimization? I'm not going to put a number on it Atif growth when it resumes, whenever that is, and we know it will resume, likely will pivot a little bit to that factory. We've said in the past, it will ultimately be the largest factory in the network. That is still absolutely the case. So that's part of what Tim just described getting back to the financial model is we'll just have a more efficient manufacturing footprint. Got it. And then generative AI is a topical topic these days. Are there products in your portfolio on high bandwidth memory or packaging side that you're seeing outside growth? Or is it roughly in line with your lodging exposure? Well, I would say we haven't seen outsized growth. I think that I could attribute directly to generate AI at this point. But clearly, Lam has been a strong player in advanced packaging. And we continue to make investments in that area to expand our product portfolio and not only on a wafer basis, but also different formats as well to make sure we're prepared for whatever the future might be in advance packaging. And we have a question from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. I want to ask on leading-edge foundry. Clearly, you're seeing strength in the trailing edge. You've heard reports about maybe TSMC cutting, definitely, utilizations are quite low at the leading edge. So maybe just comment on what you're seeing from your leading-edge foundry customers. Yes, I don't think we're going to comment about any specific customers, but I did make the comment that we see incremental weakness, I said, primarily from memory. And then I said we saw incremental strength in mature nodes. So obviously, primarily from memory, implies there's additional weakness elsewhere. So, I think leading edge foundry is a bit weaker. Obviously, our exposure and our insight into that market is a little bit less than it is in memory, but we are seeing some weakness there as well. It's a perfect lead in. I guess I'm just trying to understand the second half comment. If memory players are kind of talking about second half spending being near zero, so I guess it could go lower. And I think prior question said kind of down 24, we'll see. But if foundry logic is just starting the correction that memory just saw, I mean, I guess, could you still be up if it's just trailing edge? I'm trying to understand those moving pieces. Well, obviously, it's -- this is where we get a little bit stuck around the challenge of trying to forecast WFE for the industry. Obviously, we don't have product insight into every element of WFE, including tool lead times and demand in different markets. So we try to give you our best view.
But I think if you sort of translate this to what really matters to us in running the Company, we've talked about the fact that we see -- assuming -- we see at some point memory coming back in terms of utilization starting to tick up at some point, but that's in the second half or it's fun four, we'll see. Technology conversions in memory will be extremely good for Lam from the standpoint of how much we capture of every dollar of spending on technology conversions.
We talked about strength in mature node logic foundry, where Doug talked about these advanced payments, and we also talked about some trailing-edge shipments to China that we can now make after clarification of the rules. So all those things kind of contribute to how we think about Lam in second half. Then we try to translate that to an industry WFE, but I don't think we can spend a lot of time trying to dissect all of that low to mid $70 billion for you with great accuracy. And we have a question from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. First question is, can you give us an update on your expectations of revenue performance for the CSBG group? I think you previously said it will be down somewhat, but there seems to be some moving parts here with memory utilization lower, but China revenue being less restricted. Just want to get some color would be great. Yes, Sidney. I think what I said last quarter, and I'll reiterate the same thing. We expect CSBG will be down a little bit this year, but obviously, a lot more resilient than overall WFE. No new statement relative to that outlook. Okay. That's helpful. Maybe another question on the -- just thinking about the recovery in memory spending. Is the utilization level, the first thing you guys monitor ahead of the CapEx recovery? And how much of a lag do you expect memory CapEx to recover once utilization starts to improve? Yes, maybe I'll come and then Tim, feel for to add on. Normally, the way this works, Sydney, the first thing I'd say is I cannot remember utilization being as low as it is right now. Usually, the fabs keep running, right, and other stuff gets adjusted. But right now, utilization is obviously down. The first thing the industry would do to get output growing again will be to move that utilization back up. That will benefit our spares business and probably a little bit of the upgrades, maybe a little bit.
The next thing they will do is convert the installed base, which when that happens, the industry gets fairly cost-efficient output, and we get a disproportionate amount of that spending when it's in Memory, obviously because we tend to be the bottleneck tools. We get that upgrade business first, and then WFE comes back. So you got to think of that progression showing up in that order. We will benefit first in CSBG before you'll see it in WFE. Yes. I think it's difficult to put a time frame between -- I think what you're asking is when it starts to when you start to see WFE investments. I think that depends on the shape of that recovery, which, again, we are confident that we'll be probably the first and greatest beneficiary of recovery. And we'll see what the shape of the recovery looks like once we have a better in demand. Operator, we have time for one more question, please. We'll take that question from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Just a quick question on the China side. I know you mentioned China revenues were 22%. But it looks like there are some U.S. restrictions. As you look out, do you expect that segment exposure to go down or stay flat? Or if you can give some color to the puts and takes as to how you're approaching that? I think it's probably down a little bit in the June quarter from a percentage standpoint, although don't hold me to that. We don't always get that exactly right, but I think it's probably down a little bit in June. Got it. And on the Memory side, I know you mentioned spending is a 10-year low, probably comes in a little bit again in June. But in terms of where you see the bounds coming, do you think that's driven more by technology transition or capacity adds? How do you see that? Because I think broadly, memory OEMs are still hemorrhaging cash, I believe, but just wondering how you see that bounce? Yes. I think as we've described, clearly, technology conversions occur first since that's the most capital efficient way for customers to not only add some additional bids but also to get better cost structure. So clearly, capital -- technology additions will come before capacity additions. So operator, I think that concludes our time here. We can wrap the call up. Well, thank you. That does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation.

A replay of this will be made available later this afternoon on our website. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Tim. Thank you, Tina, and welcome to everyone joining the call today. Lam posted strong results for the June quarter with gross margin, operating margin and earnings per share well above the guided ranges. CSBG at 47% of revenues in the quarter, continues to stand-out as a key area of strength and stability for Lam in an otherwise weak wafer fabrication equipment spending environment.
Operationally, we achieved significant improvement in on-time delivery and critical backorder performance in the quarter and now see these metrics back at normalized pre-pandemic levels. Our focus on the resiliency of our global manufacturing and supply chain network is delivering greater predictability in the short term, but more importantly, positions us to scale more efficiently when WFE growth inevitably resumes.
Looking near-term, we see WFE spending in 2023 tracking to the mid $70 billion range with the upside coming from domestic China related spending as well as strong growth in high bandwidth memory or HBM related demand. By device segments, we expect overall memory WFE to be down in the mid-40% range compared to last year and non-memory segments to be down approximately 10%. We continue to see second half 2023 WFE tracking higher than first half.
While 2023 is a down year for WFE, the long-term growth dynamics for the semiconductor industry are strong. Emerging growth drivers such as generative AI are only in their initial stages of adoption and will be fundamental to driving increased investment in both memory and foundry logic fabs over the next several years.
Advanced AI servers have significantly higher leading edge logic memory and storage content versus traditional servers. And every incremental 1% penetration of AI servers and data centers is expected to drive $1 billion to $1.5 billion of additional WFE investment. This creates tremendous opportunity for Lam as greater etch and deposition intensity is needed to enable higher performance and more scalable device architectures.
To ensure we are best positioned to win long term, we have been making significant investments to broaden our product portfolio for processing at the atomic scale. Lam is the established leader in 3D NAND and we are well positioned to benefit from the move underway to 3D in other device segments. Gate all around, 3D DRAM and advanced packaging are important 3D inflections that are expected to drive strong SAM and share growth for Lam.
Advanced packaging is becoming vital to the performance, power and cost roadmaps of high-performance applications, including generative AI. Customers are increasingly adopting a wide variety of packaging schemes to enable logic and memory integration. Some of these schemes enable up to 50% improved memory density, 10 times improvement in bandwidth and 60% gain in power efficiency. Lam has a track record of excellence in the advanced packaging segment with a strong set of manufacturing proven products.
Overall, we have greater than 50% market share in deposition and edge solutions required for advanced 3D stacking of high bandwidth memory. More specifically, our SABRE 3D copper electroplating tool and Syndion etch system hold 100% market share across all leading memory customers for through-silicon via formation as a result of our long established expertise in etching and filling high aspect ratio geometry structures.
Overall, we expect our packaging SAM to double in the next five years. We also see our market position strengthening as we bring technology and productivity innovation to address emerging opportunities. For example, in the June quarter, we had a critical win for a new inter-die gapfill application at a key foundry-logic customer for their chiplet architecture. As this latest win ramps into production, we will have secured a leading share position for this application across the top three foundry-logic customers.
We won this application for a couple of reasons. First, we delivered higher productivity relative to the competition by leveraging our unique triple quad platform architecture and multi-station sequential deposition chamber design. This enables film deposition of greater than 20 microns in a single pass, allowing the customer to run more wafers between chamber clean steps. Second, we delivered superior on-wafer performance, including better film stress management, improved defectivity, and enhanced wafer to wafter uniformity versus the competition.
As we expand our position in newer high-growth markets like 3D packaging and specialty technologies, we have looked to leverage existing R&D and tools within the Lam portfolio to broaden our product offerings most efficiently. In the recent example, our long-established Kiyo etch platform has proven to be highly suited to applications which are critical to enabling new die-to-wafer hybrid bonding schemes.
By delivering better etch profile than the competition, we secured a key win in the June quarter at a leading foundry-logic customer. We are currently the tool of record for a suite of etches and resist strip steps at this customer and expect to start recognizing revenue for the new application in 2023. As this customer continues to shrink packaging dimensions with future hybrid bonding iterations, we have the opportunity to double our revenue with them over the next several years.
In another instance, Lam has been working with customers within the specialty segment to port key 300 millimeter etch solutions, including atomic layer etch, to 200 millimeter to overcome challenges in the manufacturing of gallium nitride devices. Adoption of GaN technology is accelerating across multiple applications ranging from high-efficiency charging devices for consumer electronics and automotive to 5G RF infrastructure. However, the fabrication of such devices is complex and requires ultra-low damage etch processes with atomic-scale precision.
With our suite of solutions, we can deliver a GaN etch process that improve surface roughness and other material properties that impact device performance. These solutions were developed as a result of Lam's deep understanding of the required technology, as well as key partnerships with customers and research institutions.
Longer term, we look to outperform in the trillion-dollar semiconductor industry forecasted for the end of the decade. At Lam, we are executing a strategy to create competitive differentiation by focusing on what we see as three key vectors of rising complexity. First is the technical complexity associated with enabling the transition to 3D device and packaging architectures across all market segments. Second is the support and workforce complexity arising from the expanding geographic footprint, as regionalization efforts build momentum. And third is the sustainability complexity as we responsibly manage the carbon impact of the semiconductor industry as the output grows to $1 trillion.
This quarter, we detailed one component of our strategy in a press release for our Semiverse Solutions portfolio of advanced simulation and modeling products. These products are designed to help engineers get to process solutions faster, develop new products at lower cost and collaborate across the global ecosystem with greater effectiveness. We believe that by combining the physical advantages of Lam's diverse global R&D and manufacturing footprint with the virtual development and digital twin capabilities of our Semiverse Solutions, we will be in an excellent position to innovate and outperform as our industry grows into the future.
With that, I will turn it over to Doug. Thank you. Excellent. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today during what I know is a very busy earnings season.
We executed well in the June 2023 quarter with revenue coming in above the midpoint of our guided range and our profitability metrics exceeding the high end of guidance. While we continue to work through a challenging WFE investment year, most notably with very low memory spending, our focus on improving our operational efficiencies is showing up favorably in our results. We're laser-focused on what's in our direct control and executing well.
Let me dig into revenue. June quarter revenue came in at $3.2 billion, a decrease from the prior quarter as we expected. Systems revenue declined quarter-over-quarter as we had reduced levels of deferred revenue with the improvement in supply chain constraints. We closed the June quarter with $1.8 million in deferred revenue on the balance sheet, which was a decrease of $165 million sequentially. We've got all the deferred revenue related to outstanding back order parts completely back to normal levels. As we discussed last quarter though, our deferred revenue balance is currently still at higher than historic levels.
The deferred revenue balance includes increased customer cash and advanced deposits tied to orders from newer customers. We expect a significant portion of these deposits to convert to revenue during the second half of calendar year 2023.
Let me now turn to the revenue segment details. Memory as a percentage of systems revenue in the June quarter was low at 27%, which was a decline from the prior quarter level of 32% and our lowest concentration percentage for this segment in the last decade. The DRAM segment within memory remained flat at 9% of systems revenue. And NAND came down to 18% of systems revenue, down from the March quarter level of 23%. We continue to expect NAND spending to remain at low levels for the remainder of the 2023 calendar year. And I just mentioned, NAND spending is at the lowest levels we've seen since the advent of the 3D NAND architecture.
Consistent with the prior quarter, we see strong concentration of systems revenue in the foundry segment with the June quarter revenue percentage at 47% versus 46% that we saw in the March quarter. Investments were biased towards leading-edge devices. There also continues to be robust spending to support more mature specialty nodes.
We had a record level of concentration in the logic and other segment with 26% of systems revenue in the June quarter, compared with 22% in the prior quarter. There was broad-based spending in areas such as advanced packaging, microprocessors, analog, image sensors and power applications. These are areas where we've demonstrated strong momentum with our technology solutions, and I'd just point out that they are broadly distributed geographically.
With respect to the regional composition of our total revenue, the China region was 26% of the total, which was up a little bit from the prior quarter, which was 22%. China domestic customers were the majority of the China regional revenue in the June quarter. The result was strong concentration of investments for our customers in the Korea and Taiwan region, which comprised 24% and 20% of our total revenues, respectively, in the June quarter. The US region declined from the record level that we saw last quarter, largely due to the timing of customer projects.
The Customer Support Business Group revenue in the June quarter totaled approximately $1.5 billion, which was a decrease of 7% from the prior quarter level and 8% lower than the June quarter in calendar 2022. CSBG represented 47% of our June quarter revenue. This is a historically high concentration percentage, driven largely by continued strength in the specialty node investments which are serviced by Reliant systems business. The Reliant and Spares businesses continue to represent the largest individual portions of CSBG revenues. Both our spares and service businesses had been negatively impacted by low fab utilization levels, particularly at our memory customers.
On the profitability side of things, our June quarter gross margin came in at 45.7%, above our guided range and up from 44% that we saw in the March quarter. The quarter-on-quarter increase was related to cost and efficiency improvements, as well as a favorable product mix. We continue to expect to make further progress on our operational execution as we go forward.
Operating expenses for June came in at $590 million, which was down from the $608 million in the March quarter, although it was a little bit higher than our original estimates coming into the quarter. Investing in research and development continues to be a top priority for Lam, with over two-thirds of our operating expense concentrated in R&D. We're focused on extending our product differentiation and ensuring that our competitiveness remains very strong.
The June quarter operating margin came in at 27.3%, which was over the guidance range largely because of our strong gross margin performance. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter came in low at 7.5% due to a more favorable jurisdictional mix of income and provision true-ups that occurred at the end of our fiscal year. We estimate the tax rate for the remainder of the 2023 calendar year will be in the low to mid-teens level. And as always, this rate will have some fluctuation quarter to quarter.
Other income and expense for the June quarter was approximately $7 million in expense, consistent with the prior quarter amount and primarily related to our strong cash balances, as well as higher interest rates. And I'd just point out, from a return on cash standpoint, we're now realizing higher interest rates on our cash balances than we're paying on the longer-term duration debt in our capital structure. And as we've discussed in the past, OI&E is subject to market-related fluctuations that will cause some level of quarterly volatility.
On our capital return activities, we allocated approximately $906 million to open market share buyback and we paid $232 million in dividends in the June quarter. We have $3.5 billion remaining on our Board authorized share buyback plan. For the June quarter, we returned 109% of free cash flow, and we're very much in line with our long-term capital return plans of returning 75% to 100% of free cash flow.
June quarter diluted earnings per share came in at $5.98, over the high end of our guidance range. This was enabled from stronger revenue, improved gross margin and that lower tax rate. Diluted share count was 134 million shares, on track with our expectations and down from the March quarter.
Let me now pivot to the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash, totaled $5.6 billion, which was flat with the March quarter. Days sales outstanding were 80 days in the June quarter. June quarter inventory turns came down from the prior quarter level of 1.9 times to 1.5 times. While we did bring inventory down slightly during the June quarter, the balance is elevated from historic levels.
As business volumes reduce, we need to cancel a significant volume of purchase orders with our suppliers. As we work through these cancellations, we're taking more inventory than we need in the near term. This ongoing process will keep inventory higher than we'd like this year, frankly. We do expect inventory to come down though, albeit more slowly than we may have historically been able to drive it to.
Non-cash expenses for the June quarter included approximately $68 million in equity compensation, $76 million in depreciation and $14 million for amortization. Capital expenditures were $79 million, which was down from the March quarter by approximately $41 million. Spending mainly centered on product development activities and our global lab infrastructure.
We ended the June quarter with approximately 17,400 regular full-time employees, which was a decrease of approximately 1,300 people from the prior quarter. Most of this decrease is related to the restructuring actions we took earlier in the calendar year, with the timing of the headcount reduction showing up in the June quarter. Overall, we're on track with our transformation initiatives to improve our operations. And as we stand at the end of the quarter, we incurred approximately $143 million year-to-date out of an anticipated $250 million estimated range for calendar year 2023.
Let me now turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the September ‘23 quarter. We're expecting revenue of $3.4 billion, plus or minus $300 million. Gross margin of 46.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. This improvement in gross margin is a function of our operational efforts as well as a beneficial mix. Operating margins of 28%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. We're purposely spending a little more in R&D in the second half of 2023. And finally, earnings per share of $6.05, plus or minus $0.75, based on a declining share count of approximately 133 million shares.
So, let me summarize. The results this quarter demonstrate, I think, that we're on a solid path to strengthen our operations and our profitability profile. We're improving and optimizing all elements of the company and solidifying Lam's business foundation to ensure we're well-positioned for outperformance when WFE growth resumes. And I'll just reiterate what Tim said. We continue to see WFE a little bit second half weighted this year.
Operator, with that, that concludes my prepared remarks. Tim and I would now like to open up the call for questions. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we’ll begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question. Hi, good afternoon and congratulations on the solid execution. As we progress through this weaker period for the industry, right, the activity level can be quite noisy, but there will come a period of stabilization of fundamentals and business trends, right, fundamentals being the things that you can track, like your customers' utilization and business-wise, the level of pushouts, reschedules and cancellations. So, I guess, with that, has the team seen utilizations starting to stabilize, albeit at low levels? And has the rate magnitude of shipment pushouts, rescheduling also come down to more normalized levels? Yeah. Thanks, Harlan. Yeah. I think that we've -- it probably varies by market segment, but clearly we've heard some of our customers, even just recently talking about more utilization cuts within certain device segments. Clearly, I would say it's slowing down as the majority of the cuts that were made in the first half of the year are kind of taking effect. I do feel like, and I made a comment about, in some ways, normalizing our operations is allowing the business to be more predictable. I think the same thing is happening on the end markets and customer side as well, where people are getting a sense of how the cuts that have already been made and how the capex reductions that have already been made are starting to flow through.
So I do feel like we're in that position. And just as we, at this point, ticked a little bit up on WFE from our prior guidance of low to mid-70s to mid-70s, yeah, you're starting to see little strength in certain parts of the market, HBM being one of them. And as also we mentioned, some of the domestic China spending. So, I would feel like things are getting to the point where people are able to predict the business a little bit better than, say, six months ago. And Harlan, this is Doug. Maybe the only thing I would add to what Tim said is we haven't really seen utilizations getting any better, quite frankly. You'll remember on the call last quarter we talked about, you'll see that from us in our spares and service components of CSBG. And as we sit here today, you're not seeing that at this point. So it's at a fairly low level and we really don't see it getting any better in the near term. And the only other thing that we have said that when you think about especially utilization improvements in the memory space, we would anticipate Lam being the first to sort of benefit from utilization turning back on, just given our exposure in that space and the impact that it's had on our spares and service business through the first half of this year. Appreciate that. And then, I also appreciate you guys highlighting the advanced packaging opportunity. I think it's quite timely right, because you guys called out a slightly better memory WFE trends due to strong HBM DRAM demand. So you guys benefit both in your core memory silicon tools and now your advanced packaging portfolio as you outlined, right?
But just given the overall sort of recent and strong demand pull for accelerated compute and AI capabilities, I mean this is driving advanced packaging demand across CPU, GPU, networking, memory, right? And so, your customers are capacity-constrained here. So do you guys anticipate your advanced packaging segment to grow this year? And can you just give us some sense on how big this segment is for Lam? Yeah. I don't think we've -- we haven't exactly sized this business externally, but we -- it is growing and, it’s in certain areas, especially as I highlighted things like etch for TSVs, copper plating for filling of those TSVs, pretty much anything related to the building of that advanced packaging structure through etch and deposition. So it is a strong area of our business right now, especially given the relative weaknesses that’s seen in the other parts of the market. Thank you. Thanks, Harlan. Our next question comes from CJ Muse from Evercore. Please go ahead with your question. Yeah. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I guess first question, Doug, last quarter you talked about expectations for 100 bps improvement at least exiting the year. You've clearly blown that away. So curious how much of that in the guide for September is due to mix versus kind of greater efficiencies that you've garnered? And what is kind of the new exit rate that we should be thinking about for calendar '23? Yeah, CJ. Actually, I think if you talk to the leadership team at Lam, we're all pretty pleased where we've been able to drive the operational efficiencies in the Company and its gone quicker, I think, than I expected certainly. We're obviously beyond that 100 basis point improvement. Having said that, though, I would point to -- we do have a component of the September numbers that are mix related. I'm not going to, like, quantify it precisely for you, but we're doing real well operationally. I'm not quite ready to guide December for you yet. Except, I'd say I think we're pretty pleased where we're at and we're well beyond that 100 basis point improvement that we talked about, I think on that January call, if I recall, the first time we sort of talked about it. Great, thank you. I guess the second question relates to CSBG. And how are you thinking about sustainability of Reliant? And then, as you kind of contemplate the timing of utilization picking up for memory, how do you see kind of a hand-off maybe from one part of the business to the other and how we should be modeling CSBG into September and beyond? Yeah. I think that as you pointed out, I mean, obviously there is a Reliant component that's right now is quite strong. I talked about sort of at specialty technologies, I mean we're seeing still quite strong demand for our products across all of those different segments. Utilization driving spares and service to much lower levels than we've historically seen. And so, I think as people talk and worry about roll-off in the specialty technologies, maybe that does come at the time that the utilization picks up in the leading-edge and the memory fabs.
But actually at this point, I would say we haven't yet seen demand for those trailing edge technologies to really be rolling over. I mean, demand is still quite strong for us, we're focused on new applications, new tool types and it's just not something that we're ready to forecast yet, although, again, as we've said nothing grows forever, but the broadening it feels pretty good to us right now. So we should be modeling CSBG up in September? CJ, I guided you to $3.4 billion in revenue, you can do whatever you'd like to do with the competition. You've got the total number. Thank you, Doug and Tim. Appreciate it. Yeah. Thanks, CJ. Our next question comes from Krish Sankar from TD Cowen. Please go ahead with your question. Yeah. Hi, thanks for taking my question. And I have two questions. First one, maybe for Tim or Doug. Kind of curious, at SEMICON West a few weeks ago, Tokyo Electron spoke about a cryo etch product and I remember you had spoken about it a couple of years ago. So I'm kind of curious how to think about your high aspect ratio etch market share. And my understanding was, lot of it is geared towards 3D NAND and obviously NAND spending is at very low level. So I'm kind of curious, number one, how to think about your high aspect ratio market share and the cryo etch product, et cetera in that route? And then I have a follow-up. Okay, great. Well, thanks, Krish, and I'll take it first. I think that relative to NAND, as you pointed out, I mean it's -- spending is at very low levels, down more than -- probably more than 75% year-on-year right now. But to this point of cryo etch, and I guess I would just say that at this point, Lam is the only company with cryo etch in high volume production. So it's an area where we do have strength, I mean hundreds of chambers of experience right now.
We're the leader in high aspect ratio etch. I know that at the recent conference, competition has been out talking about a DTOR position for one pass at a memory customer for future node. But I think as probably everybody on this call knows, customers regularly engage more than one vendor when you're in the R&D stage for all these critical applications. And in this case, our production decisions are still quite a ways off. I look at Lam and our competitiveness. I mean, we take all of that experience that we have from years of leading in this space. We've developed a robust technology roadmap. We're engaged with the customer on a variety of different hardware and process innovations.
But I think most importantly, when I think about our long-term competitiveness, we are still the only vendor that has this huge installed base from which every day we're getting learning about how to take processes from the R&D stage into high-volume production. And that's ultimately what really counts for affecting market share. And so, we've said in the past, we don't win every decision, certainly not always at the DTOR stage. But I think given where we are and where we've come from, we're very confident about maintaining leadership and market share in this space. Got it. Got it. Very helpful, Tim. And then just a follow-up on the advanced packaging. I understand you did mention the packaging SAM could double. And you spoke about the Syndion for TSV etch and SABRE 3D for metal dep. And if I remember, when I went back, looked at my notes, in 2015, you said it will be like a $200 million to $300 million opportunity. And then I think last you folks updated this in 2020 where you had said Syndion and SABRE actually doubled since then. I'm kind of curious. I understand a lot of it goes to HBM and all those things. So from that old realm of advanced packaging, how to think about like the opportunity from here? And also for AI, my understanding is some of your ALD for high k metal gate where DRAM can also be used. So if I put it altogether, is there a way to quantify where your Syndion, SABRE revenue numbers are today and how to think about it? And also, how to think about ALD for high k metal gate? Thank you. Yeah. Well, you threw out a couple of numbers. We used to talk about a couple of hundred million dollar opportunity, doubling from there, puts it in the hundreds. I mean, it's growing from that point. I mean, it's becoming a sizable business for us. We just haven't quantified specifically for those two products. I think what you can take away is we talked about our market share position. We know -- I think everybody knows HBM and 3D chip stacking, those products also play into other elements of advanced packaging. It's a very fast-growing part of our business. And so, without giving you our forecast for those markets, I think you can apply what you think about how chip stacking and 3D packaging is building momentum. You know we have 100% market share. I think just -- we're very happy to see what's transpiring in that part of the market. Yeah. And Krish, I would just add. You're right about -- I don't know how long back, we quantified it as few hundred million dollars, not billions of dollars, just to kind of frame it for you. But it is a very fast-growing component of the business as Tim pointed out. So, maybe that's a good way to think about it. It's something when you listen to every talk and everybody is very excited about high-bandwidth memory and its enablement of AI, we're right in the middle of all of that stuff from a packaging standpoint. Krish, what I would say is in this environment, it's the -- those are the tool sets that people are actually pulling for in terms of accelerated deliveries. And so I think that gives you some sense of demand in that market. Got it. Got it. Thank you, Doug. Thanks, Tim. And our next question comes from Tim Arcuri from UBS. Please go ahead with your question. Thanks a lot. Tim, there's been a lot of debate that I hear on NAND WFE. And obviously, you have the highest share of all the major vendors. And you used to give this model that suggested $14 billion to $15 billion per year to drive sort of mid-30% bit growth, and there was some sensitivity around it. But since then, a lot of the producers have been basically down ticking on long-term NAND bit growth, Micron is now saying low 20s.
So if you kind of use that old model, you get to something like $11 billion to $12 billion per year to drive low 20s bit growth. I know you've talked about more steps and so that number has gone up. But that's just optically, it's not a ton higher than the $9 billion or so that we're spending this year. And so I keep on getting a ton of debate in terms of just how much NAND WFE is going to come back. So I'm not asking you for a new model, but can you sort of like handicap what's changed vis-a-vis that old model in a market where bit growth seems to be lower going forward than what [indiscernible]? Well, I think there probably is equal debate about what long-term etch growth is in the NAND space with some of the new applications coming out. But I certainly am not going to get crossways with our customers in terms of their forecast versus ours. I mean again, it's a market where we have such a strong position that ultimately -- we look to satisfy the technology roadmaps and the volume requirements of our customers, and that's kind of where we are. So right now, we know this year, NAND is extremely low.
And without giving you our number, I mean it's -- I would say even if it gets back to something close to that model, it's a lot higher spending than where we are today. I think what's happened too is for Lam, specifically, is not only have we taken -- I mean, what might be different from that model of how much we capture of that SAM is the complexity of doing multi-tier stacking has increased our opportunity through a whole bunch of other steps that we've talked about in the past in terms of backside depth for stress management and gapfill -- ALD gapfills for plug fill, carbon sacrificial plug fills, lots of different types of applications.
And so I think even an environment where you didn't do a lot better than the model, Lam would do a lot better. and we do a whole lot better than where we are today in such a low NAND spending environment. So I think we will get Tim, a new model out once we see a better view of the end demand picture, but that's the best I can do for you right now. Thanks, Tim. And then, Doug, I guess just as a follow-up, how does your inventory situation play out? I imagine that it's still kind of a drag on gross margin, and you said it's going to come down, you said pretty slowly as you kind of get to the back half of the year. So can you quantify how much of a drag it is as you're -- as you still have pretty high costs, I would imagine, on these parts? And then when do you think it gets back to some sort of normalized level and it's not a headwind anymore to margin? Thanks. Yeah, Tim, I don't really think about it right now as a drag on gross margin, honestly. It will prevent improvement in gross margin as we have to consume some of the inventory sitting there, right, to the extent that we're negotiating costs of some of the stuff down -- the stuff that we have is already on the balance sheet, right? So you've got to consume that first. So that's the right way to think about it. I don't really think of it as a drag in the near term.
And Tim, it will come down, although what I tried to say in my script was it's going to come down a little bit more slowly than perhaps you've seen us be able to drive it to in the past because we canceled a lot of purchase orders, a lot of material in that as part of negotiating through that, you end up taking perhaps a little bit more than you need in the near term, we'll consume it over time. But it's just going to create a little bit of a delay in the reduction of inventory that you've seen us be able to do in the past. So it's going to be a little bit sticky, I think, Tim, through the year. And then I think it will -- it will come down through the year, but I think it's going to be a little bit sticky. And then you'll see it improve as we get into next year. Thanks, Doug. Yeah. Thanks, Tim. And our next question comes from Brian Chin from Stifel. Please go ahead with your question. Hi, there. Good afternoon and thanks for letting us ask a few questions. Maybe just to backtrack on the increase to WFE this year of the, let's call it, $2 billion to $3 billion increase, is that mainly situated in second half? How should we think about, I guess, timing between calendar 3Q and 4Q? And I guess how much of the upside is HBM oriented? Yeah, Brian, I guess what I'd say is it is a little bit second half weighted, and the things we pointed to in our scripts were little bit of upside in China, China domestic and a little bit of high bandwidth memory. I don't think we're going to put a quantification between the third quarter and the fourth quarter of the calendar year, except to say it's a little bit second half weighted. Okay. That's fair enough. Maybe for my follow-up, clearly, there's a lot of focus on high bandwidth DRAM. But Tim, I was wondering, could you interject maybe your thoughts on the role of the role that SSD and flash storage might play in generative AI? And I'm sure that's factored into sort of that 1% penetration for AI servers in kind of $1 billion to $1.5 billion WFE investment? It is. And I think that was even in my answer to the last question was, I think there's still a lot of debate as to how much storage really gets driven in this, but we're a believer that there is some element of demand driven there. I think that when we think about DRAM, there's a couple of things at play in terms of what drives it. One is, of course, the HBM also increases die size, I think, as you know. And that leads perhaps even greater WFE increase associated both with the silicon side of that as well as the packaging side. I'm not sure that same dynamic exists on the NAND side, but in terms of consumption, it feels like there should be some. But again, I'm willing to sort of let this play out a little further to see what the new model should be. And we talk closely to our customers to see what they're seeing in the marketplace as well. Yeah, Brian, this is Doug. I don't know if this helps. But when I look at like the composition of some of these AI servers, nominally, there's roughly eight times the DRAM versus an enterprise class server and three times demand from a storage standpoint. I don't know if that will help you get your head wrapped around it. But DRAM is clearly a little bit more enabling on the compute side, but storage picks up also. Okay. Got it. And probably scale out of these language models probably also could increase that storage potential over time. But thanks for your inputs. Appreciate that. Thank you, Brian. Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Tim or Doug. Just on China, I was hoping you guys could give a little more color in terms of what you're seeing on the ground. Doug, I think you said China was 26% of revenue and a big chunk of that was domestic. What’s sort of the makeup by application, foundry, memory and other? And I guess, importantly, how should we think about sustainability going forward? It's really hard to tell from our standpoint, just given the spend is so strategic, right? It's not necessarily tied directly to near-term economics. So it's hard for us. But in terms of what you're hearing from customers, what is the feedback? And how much visibility are they giving you going forward? Yeah. I think that it's split. I mean, obviously, on the domestic China side between some memory investments as well as a lot of specialty technologies, trailing edge focus on end markets, I think we're all familiar with automotive and industrial and those types of markets. As you mentioned, it's strategic. I mean, these are customers that are giving us long-term forecasts. Doug talked last quarter about deferred revenues are impacted by some of the down payments, at least within the visibility horizon that we need, we feel we have a pretty good view of a fair bit of investment that this continues in China, especially in those specialty technology markets where new fabs are emerging to try to capture some element of those trailing edge end markets. That's helpful. Thank you. And then as a follow-up, maybe one for Doug on gross margin. You talked about operational efforts and initiatives a couple of times. What exactly are you doing today? I know there's no ending to things like this, but which inning are you in, in terms of reaping some of the benefits? And you used to talk about Malaysia as a headwind a year ago, 1.5 years ago, where are you with the ramp there? And how should we think about the tailwind as volumes recover going forward? Thanks. Yeah. I think, Toshi, the way to think about it is business is down. Right now, we're not really growing anywhere. I think as we see growth come back, whenever that is, the pivot to that Malaysia factory, which has an opportunity to do more than it's doing today, will be largely what you see from us. Now maybe to help with the restructuring activities, we embarked on plans to kind of restructure the cost footprint of the company. And maybe the best way to think about it, I've given you a forecast. We think we're going to take charges of $250 million at this point. We've taken $143 million at the end of the last quarter.
So we still have some things we're working on. Although I would tell you the workforce portion of it is complete. We're done with that aspect of it. So that's behind us, we believe. So there's just some other things you're doing around looking at product, repositioning inventory, maybe a little bit of infrastructure stuff, we are embarked upon what will be a multiyear digital transformation initiative at the company, which will deliver efficiencies over the next several years. So there's a handful of things that are still coming in the future, I guess, is what I would describe. Appreciate the color. Thank you. Thanks, Toshiya. Our next question comes from Atif Malik from Citi. Please go ahead with your question. Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. I have two questions on leading-edge investments. I thought you gave an interesting data point that 1% AI server adoption leads to $1 billion to $1.5 billion incremental WFE. When I listened to the major foundry in Taiwan, they talked about 50% AI semi growth rate in the next few years but we did not really raise any CapEx this year. And we believe AI server adoption is probably like high single digit, 8%, 9%. So what explains the discrepancy in terms of not seeing a lift in leading-edge investments from the higher server adoption? Maybe it's just underutilization in other end markets. I guess what I think about, Atif, is these are longer-term statements we're making. I think you're right about the composition of AI servers. In the short term, you're not really going to see a meaningful uptick in WFE, frankly. This is going to occur over the next several years. As more of -- and you're right, I think server volumes largely, I don't know, mid- to, I'd call it, mid-single digit percent of total servers. I think that grows over time. But in the short term, it doesn't really show up as quickly as you might think. It requires sort of capital investments to occur for future demand. That doesn't really happen in a meaningful way in the short term. Got it, Doug. And then as a follow-up, you guys are very well leveraged to get all around, particularly on the edge side and they have been waiting for this technology inflection for the last three years. Your peer in Europe is talking about pilot line orders in December quarter this year. And Tim spoke about having better visibility versus six months ago. So my question to you is, when do you see the gate all around opportunity kind of grow meaningful for you? Is it the first half of next year or second half of next year? I think it starts in line with the timeline that you just talked about and it's first -- through the first half and second half of next year. I mean these things tend to ramp and I think we are at the point where gate all around is going to become more meaningful. We'll see that in growth in some of the traditional products that are sort of lumped in with everything else. But then there are specialized products that we talked about, like selective etch those -- that suite of tools that's very specialized for applications like gate all around. We'll see faster growth in those segments, I think, as we move through '24 and on into '25. So yeah, maybe we're at that key inflection point. How that overcomes the rest of the market dynamics in '24? We're not ready to guide '24 yet, but some of those technology trends are starting to move in our favor. Thank you. Thanks, Atif. Our next question comes from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question. Great. Thank you. I wanted to follow-up on the China question. I guess, how are you seeing the impact of last year's export controls? Is that your China business has obviously done pretty well since then given the headwinds? Have there been -- have the restrictions been what you thought they would be? Is there anything that's different? And then there continue to be rumblings of additional controls. Do you have any visibility into what that could look like? Yeah, Joe, we had talked last -- at the end -- towards the end of last year, right around the October 7 announcement that the impact to our business this year would be $2 billion to $2.5 billion. We clarified earlier this year that because we were able to make some shipments for trailing etch memory that we had not -- we weren't sure whether we could, that impact was going to be closer to the $2 billion mark. That is still what we estimate the impact of last year's restrictions, the October 7 restrictions on our business, $2 billion of revenues.
Now in the same time, as China has shifted its focus towards the areas they can invest, these trailing etch, foundry logic and some of the trailing edge memory, we've seen that upticking a bit as we've moved through this year, and that's what we just spoke about. So I can't really speak to future regulations that may or may not be contemplated. We have a team in Washington DC that's regularly engaged with the government, make sure they understand our business and the details of the semiconductor industry, and that's about the best we can do right now. Okay. Thank you very much. Thanks, Joe. Our next question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question. Thanks for taking my question. Tim, I'm curious, what should be the signs we should look for, for when memory utilization starts to pick up? And when orders to you guys start to improve? So if you look at historical trends, should we be waiting for like one quarter of pricing improvement, two quarters of pricing improvement? Just what are kind of the external metrics we should be keeping an eye on to try and predict when memory WFE should start to pick up? Okay, a little bit difficult, I guess, just from the standpoint that, obviously, pricing improvement in memory, we tend to start to get customers interested in greater utilization of the fab. I think easier, I was going to answer relative to what you'd see in Lam. Obviously, once we start reporting an uptick in our CSBG spares and service businesses, obviously, it's an indicator that fabs are starting to be utilized more, and therefore, consuming spares and service. That's why I mentioned a little earlier that we are expecting to be really one of the first beneficiaries of a recovery in memory because so much of the -- there have been such deep utilization cuts in the memory fabs, that the spares and service side of our business has been impacted to a greater degree than we would have expected. When they turn those back on, that revenue should come back, and that will probably be your first indications from Lam's reported numbers of what's going on. I guess that was really the origin of the question because from what I heard on the call, I think you were suggesting there is a scenario in which CSBG revenues do start to pick up sequentially in the next quarter. But then you mentioned that the visibility around memory utilization, right, is not there from an industry perspective. So is there still a delta between the two? Vivek, we did not suggest CSBG is picking up in the next quarter. That was not a statement anybody on the call made. So if we said something that led you did that conclusion, maybe we misspoke or perhaps you misinterpreted something else we said. Okay. Sorry. Maybe I misheard. Then maybe for my second question, Doug, the gross margin upside in Q3, right, it was quite sizable. I don't remember the last time you had such a strong gross margin upside. I think you mentioned something along the lines of mix. Is that mix unsustainable? Like is that likely to reverse, right, at some point? What is the right way to think about the sustainability of gross margins at these levels. So let's say if you assume that your sales continue to grow sequentially, then can gross margins continue to be at plus minus these levels? Or is there something that would dramatically change in the mix to change the trajectory of gross margins? Vivek, I don't know if there's anything I'd point to that is dramatic. I suggested two things. One, our operational efforts in terms of just efficiencies and whatnot, it is maybe a little further ahead of where I thought it would have been. And I did point to favorable mix in the current quarter. You always see mix up and down, both products as well as customer mix. We're benefiting a little bit in the September quarter. I don't know if you'll see that same magnitude of mix benefit in December. The operational stuff, we will. I wouldn't run too far away from where we are right now into the near term anyway. But I would tell you, I'm very pleased with what we've been able to execute and the things that are in our own control, we've done extremely well. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Please go ahead with your question. Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. For my first one, you talked about the bulk of the China $1.8 billion in deferred selling through in the second half. How much of that $1.8 billion actually is coming from China? And how much of that do you actually see yourself recognizing in the second half? And is it more in Q3, Q4? Do you have any idea on the timing of that? Yeah. I've never said how much of it is in China. I've described it as newer customers, right? Customers that are new that we're not exactly sure of the creditworthiness, we require cash in advance before we build the tools. I haven't put a number on how much of it is China. Although a decent amount of it is. And what I said on how much that turns to revenue, as I said, the majority of it turns to revenue in the second half of the year. So, like, you have $1.8 billion of revenue that will be recognized in the second half from that deferred? Like, what would be the normal amount [indiscernible]? No, Stacy, there's a normalized level of deferred revenue that's always here, always has been here, and you should expect to always be here. It's probably $750 million to $1 billion on a regular basis, I think, is what you've seen from us in the past. I wouldn't expect it to be too different than that. We've just got a lot of this cash in advance payments right now. That's why it's elevated. Got it. Thank you. For my second question, so you're talking memory WP down in the mid-40s. Can you give us a feeling for how you see DRAM versus NAND breaking out in that? And whether or not your views on both of those have changed over the last 90 days versus like where we were a quarter ago? Yeah, we've said that NAND is obviously by far worse. We said about -- about 75% year-on-year. So obviously, that was quite that. I mean DRAM then obviously less than down mid-40s. And I think that in terms of change, we've seen a little bit of improvement, as we've just talked about with HBM and some signs of, at least a little bit more optimism on our part that the DRAM would be the first to recover as a result of some of these trends. And again, just listening to our customers and talking to them, we've heard some customers talk about further cuts in NAND just in the last 24 hours. So... Like, do you think utilization in DRAM is still falling? It's still at a pretty low level, Stacy. Okay, got it. Thank you. You're welcome. Thanks. Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question. Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. Maybe just following back up on what Stacy just asked. I was just kind of confused, you raised the outlook for WFE by a couple billion dollars, and it seemed like it was memory, that was the inflection. But then when you talk about memory, it seems like NAND is kind of flattish. And I'm just kind of curious how much of the increase is there in DRAM? Or is really the growth you're seeing in September more kind of this China part that Stacy was just asking about? Yeah, Blayne, Tim pointed to two things. A little bit more in China and high-bandwidth memory as it's not a huge uptick in WFE, but those are the contributors. Got you. And then I guess, I just want to understand, there's two moving pieces in foundry logic, and you've seen some delays at the leading etch. Can you just some commentary between those moving pieces, kind of the non-China piece, what are you seeing for the back half of this year? We described in generally, when you look at WFE down, where it is memory is down mid-40s, and you probably know kind of where that is run rating suggested foundry logic, looks like it's down roughly 10%. And yeah, you're right, just been a little bit of a softening in leading-edge foundry logic. We talked a little bit about that last quarter. I'm not sure we're describing anything incremental. Perhaps we saw some things others didn't see sooner than they did. But that's how we see things setting up right now. Okay. Thanks, Doug. Thanks, Blayne. Operator, we have time for one more question please. And ladies and gentlemen, our final question will come from Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho. Please go ahead with your question. Yeah. Hi. Just a question on -- as you look at WFE for next year, any thoughts on how much some of these onshore greenfield fabs could contribute to CapEx for next year? Well, I think it's -- as we're just in the middle of this year, it's too early to talk about '24 from an absolute number. But clearly, as we move through the next couple of years, I talked about this regional -- these regionalization efforts building momentum. I do think that we'll see that becoming a meaningful contributor to spending, not only here but in other parts of the world. Got it. And then on the AI side, obviously, you have mentioned packaging as a big roadmap there. When you look at CoWoS packaging, any thoughts on how much -- what your exposure is there and how you see that growing next year, I guess? Thanks. Yeah. I mean everything related to advanced packaging is growing right now. And I would say Lam's exposure kind of across the board in etching deposition is very strong. So I called out specifically HBM, but you're right. I mean when you look at the importance of things like CoWoS-2 and AI packaged system, our exposure there even broadens further to the types of tools that we sell in there.
And I mentioned this point, if people caught it, even in advanced packaging, we're having to invest in new technologies for atomic scale processing. And so you can see things like ALD being used in advanced packaging now. And so we're really in a world where ALD is being used for advanced packaging, ALE is being used for 200-millimeter GaN. I think that it is creating tremendous opportunities for Lam to leverage our really broad portfolio of technologies for all these new emerging growth opportunities. And it's pretty exciting. Got it. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you. Thanks, Vijay. And with that ladies and gentlemen, we'll be turning the floor back over to the management team for any closing remarks. And management, are you able to hear me? Ladies and gentlemen, we'll be closing today's conference call. We thank you for joining.

Lam produced solid results for the September quarter. Revenues came in above the midpoint of our guidance. And for the second quarter in a row, our gross margin, operating margin and earnings per share all exceeded the high end of the guidance range. Our revenue and earnings per share are expected to improve further in the December quarter, demonstrating our continued strong execution in a cyclically soft calendar year 2023.
Turning to the wafer fabrication equipment environment. We see spending for calendar year 2023 in the $80 billion range. The adjustment in WFE from our prior view of mid-$70 billion is based on updated checks on non-Lam-related markets, as well as restricted fab spending in China. It does not change our assumptions on Lam revenues for the year. On the device segment side, NAND weakness continued in the quarter as customers adjusted spending levels down and further lowered utilizations to drive a faster path to supply-demand balance.
While NAND WFE is down significantly in 2023, supply actions are starting to have a positive impact. Customers have recently indicated that pricing trends have stabilized and NAND bit demand has increased from high single digits percent year-over-year growth to high teens as certain consumer markets are demonstrating greater demand elasticity and per unit content.
DRAM spending is modestly up relative to our prior view, driven by better trends in high-bandwidth memory related demand as well as further upside from domestic China customers. Meanwhile, the foundry/logic segment is down slightly versus our prior baseline due to weakness in both leading edge and non-China-based mature node investments.
Looking forward, it remains hard to call the timing and pace of WFE recovery, but we believe Lam is in a good position to benefit from both cyclical and structural drivers of demand. When memory investments begin to recover from current cyclical lows, we expect to see early benefits in our installed base business as fab utilization improves, driving increased demand for spares, services and equipment upgrades. Longer term, Lam's growth story is strong and is underpinned by the fact that etch and deposition are fundamental enablers of higher performance, more scalable semiconductor device architectures. To address emerging technical challenges, customers continue to identify new innovative use cases for vertical scaling. Backside power delivery is a good example as it is an emerging device architecture being developed to address the scaling limitations of traditional back-end-of-line integration schemes. Etch and deposition play a critical role in enabling this transition and backside power delivery is expected to add close to $1 billion of incremental SAM opportunity for Lam per 100,000 monthly wafer starts.
Today, power interconnects increasingly compete for space in the complex back end of line wiring while also taking up considerable area at the transistor level. Additionally, managing power loss between the external source and the transistors is increasingly challenging due to resistance. A backside power delivery architecture enables the separation of the signal and power delivery path to free up valuable way for real estate and minimize power loss.
Furthermore, customers are implementing changes, including the use of thicker metal layers in order to efficiently integrate backside power with their advanced packaging schemes. New etch and deposition capabilities are needed and the trends are favorable for Lam. Due to our existing strength in back-end processes, we have been able to quickly extend the capabilities of our copper electroplating and PVD deposition products to address the throughput and productivity requirements of backside power applications.
We now have tool of record positions at a leading foundry logic customer and expect these positions to continue to grow. As we approach the end of the year, our installed base is closing in on 90,000 chambers. As semiconductor manufacturing is becoming increasingly complex, our customer support business group is seeing more opportunities to deliver innovation, productivity and yield enhancement.
In the September quarter, we expanded our equipment intelligence offering at multiple customers to include the first big data application of high-resolution optical emission spectroscopy, or OES. The equipment intelligence capabilities we are delivering with OES are highly differentiated due to the complexity of collecting and interpreting plasma spectra in manufacturing over time and across a large fleet of tools. Our solution allows customers to resolve performance issues that would otherwise remain undetected. Recently, our CSBG team also put the industry's first collaborative maintenance robot, or cobot, into a production fab and a leading customer. Cobots helped execute complex maintenance tasks with precision and reliability, leading to improved tool-to-tool performance matching and higher equipment availability.
Also, we believe cobots as a new service offering can play an important role in addressing anticipated skilled labor shortages as semiconductor manufacturing expands and becomes more regionalized. Overall, we see tremendous vectors of growth ahead for the semiconductor industry and for Lam.
Scaling and complexity challenges are driving multiple inflections for 3D architectures, and, in turn, greater etch and deposition intensity. Lam has a strong track record of execution, and we are committed to making the strategic investments needed to position the company to outperform as the industry and our markets grow.
Over the last 2 years, we've been laying the groundwork for greater scale and efficiency with the expansion of our manufacturing, supply chain and warehousing capabilities in Asia in order to better serve our customers in that region. We are also increasing our R&D efforts to extend our technology differentiation and expand our product portfolio to capture new inflection-driven applications. While the current business environment remains challenging, secular industry trends play extremely well to land strengths, and we are excited by the breadth of opportunities we see ahead for the company.
Thank you, and I'll now turn it over to Doug. Excellent. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining the call today.
We delivered strong results in the September 2023 quarter. Our revenue came in above the midpoint of our guided range in gross margin, operating income and earnings per share all exceeded the high end of guidance. We're pleased with the company's execution during a year where memory WFE investment has declined by unprecedented amounts.
Let's look at the details of our September quarter financial results. Revenue for the September quarter was $3.48 billion, which was up 9% from the prior quarter and down more than 30% from a year ago. Our deferred revenue balance at quarter end was $1.69 billion, which was a decrease of approximately $150 million from the June quarter mainly related to revenue recognized tied to customer advanced payments. We continue to have a higher deferred revenue balance versus historic levels given these advanced payments. We expect to recognize revenue in the December quarter for a portion of these deposits, which is comprehended in our guidance. Within calendar year 2024, I believe the deferred revenue balance will trend to more normalized levels.
Let's now look at the segments. From a segment perspective, September quarter systems revenue in memory was 38%, which is an increase from the prior quarter level of 27%. The growth in the memory segment was driven by DRAM, which increased sequentially coming in at 23% of systems revenue compared with 9% that we saw in the June quarter.
As we've noted in prior quarters, nonvolatile memory spending is at historic lows in 2023 and for the September quarter, the segment represented 15% of systems revenue, which was down from the 18% that we saw last quarter. These spending levels in NAND are at dollar levels we have not seen since planar NAND was the predominant technology.
The Foundry segment represented 36% of our systems revenue lower than the percentage concentration in the June quarter of 47%. The decrease is related to timing of leading-edge investments within calendar year 2023. We performed well in this segment during the year, with this quarter spending coming mainly from mature node customers. And finally, the Logic and Other segment was 26% of our systems revenue in the September quarter, which was flat with the prior quarter level. Investments in this segment were heavily focused in the specialty device areas, including sensors, analog and power devices.
I'll now discuss the regional composition of our total revenue. The China region came in at a high watermark of 48%, up from 26% in the prior quarter. The majority of the China revenue this quarter was from domestic Chinese customers, and we currently expect we will have another strong China geographic concentration profile in the December quarter is low. Our next largest geographic region concentration, [indiscernible] Korea had 16% of revenue in the September quarter and that compares with the 24% that we saw in June.
Our Customer Support Business Group generated revenue in the September quarter, totaling approximately $1.4 billion, which was down 5% from the June quarter and 25% lower than the September quarter and calendar year 2022. Memory customers continue to operate their fabs at very low utilization rates and customers are holding off on upgrading tools until there's more digestion of the outstanding inventory that is in the industry.
The specialty technology market has been a bright spot this year and we see that part of our business up year-over-year as we close calendar year 2023. Spares and the Reliant product line continues to be the 2 largest components of CSBG.
Let me now turn to the gross margin performance. The September quarter came in at 47.9%, above our guided range and higher than the June quarter level of 45.7%. Our strong gross margin performance compared to the prior quarter was driven primarily by favorable customer mix. We've improved elements of our cost structure during the year and are on track with our plan to improve gross margin from the March quarter level by approximately 1 percentage point as we exit calendar year 2023.
September quarter operating expenses came in at $622 million, up from the prior quarter amount of $590 million. R&D as a percentage of spending was somewhat higher versus the June quarter, coming in at over 68% of our spending. The increased investment was focused on key technology inflections and development engagements with our customers. We will continue to invest in programs across multiple market segments to support our long-term strategic objectives for continued company outperformance.
Operating margin for the current quarter was 30.1% higher than the June quarter level of 27.3% and more than 100 basis points over the high end of our guidance because of that strong gross margin performance.
Non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 13.4%, in line with our expectations. Our estimate for the December 2023 quarter as well as for calendar year 2024 is for the tax rate to be in the low to mid-teens range. Other income and expense for the September quarter came in at $7 million in income compared with $7 million in expense in the June quarter. The favorable fluctuation in OI&E was due to a variety of factors, including rising interest rates, generating income on our cash balance. OI&E will continue to be subject to market-related fluctuations that will cause some level of volatility quarter-by-quarter.
Let me now pave the capital return side of things. We allocated approximately $830 million to open market share repurchases and paid $230 million in dividends in the September quarter. I'll highlight that in September, we announced a 16% growth in our dividend, in line with our plan to deliver disciplined annual dividend growth.
Since paying our first dividend in 2014, we have now raised the dividend amount 9x. We returned over 120% of free cash flow in the quarter and we have $2.7 billion remaining on our Board-authorized share repurchase plan.
Calendar year-to-date, we've returned 83% of our free cash flow to shareholders. September quarter diluted earnings per share was $6.85 over the high end of our guided range. Diluted share count was 133 million shares, on track with our expectations and down from the June quarter.
Let me pivot to the balance sheet. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the September quarter totaled $5.2 billion down from $5.6 billion in the June quarter. The main driver of the cash decrease was obviously our capital return activity. I just mentioned, we also purchased buildings at our company headquarters as well as our Bay Area, California factory for approximately $250 million, retiring the leases that were on the balance sheet. The [indiscernible] cash was somewhat offset by improvement in day sales outstanding, which were 73 days in the September quarter, down from the 80 days that we saw in the June quarter.
Inventory turns were flat with the prior quarter level of 1.5x. We continue to work to bring our inventory down. But as we've noted in prior quarter, we expect this to occur at a slower pace than we've done in the past. Our noncash expenses for the September quarter included approximately $67 million for equity compensation, $76 million in depreciation and $14 million in amortization. Capital expenditures for the September quarter came in at $77 million, which was flat with the June quarter.
Spending in September was primarily centered on product development activities, and lab expansions in the United States and Asia. We ended the September quarter with approximately 17,200 regular full-time employees, which was a decrease of 200 people from the prior quarter.
Most of this decrease is related to the restructuring actions we took earlier in the calendar year with the timing of the headcount reduction occurring in the September quarter.
Let me now turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the December 2023 quarter. We're expecting revenue of $3.7 billion, plus or minus $300 million. Gross margin of 47%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. This level of gross margin reflects a continued favorable customer mix, albeit not quite as favorable as we saw in September. Operating margin of 29.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point.
The operating expenses embedded in this guidance increased from the September level due to growth in R&D. I'd also just mention that the June 2024 quarter will be higher as it includes an extra week in the fiscal quarter, which occurs every few years. It's going to be a 14-week quarter in March. And finally, earnings per share of $7, plus or minus $0.75 based on a share count of approximately 132 million shares.
With our December quarter guidance, we see solid performance in both revenue and profitability. Lam is delivering strong financial results and technology leadership to our customers as we develop solutions for the next industry inflections.
And before I wrap up, I'd just like to mention 2 things as you think about modeling our business into 2024. The first is that we're currently experiencing favorable customer mix that may not continue at the same level going into next year. This may create near-term headwinds for gross margin. Second, given all the opportunities we see in long-term technology collections like data all around, dry resist, advanced packaging, changing metallization schemes and continued evolution of other 3D structures like DRAM, 2024 may be an R&D spending growth year to take advantage of these future opportunities that we see.
As a result, it's possible that historic leverage we've delivered takes a temporary pause. We will obviously continue to aggressively drive the operational efficiencies that we always have, and our longer-term profitability objectives remain unchanged. Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. Tim and I would now like to open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions]
And today's first question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. I had a question on China. Obviously, you've had a huge second half in China. Doug, it sounds like you think it's going to remain pretty strong in December. It sounds like maybe it's going to remain close to 50% of the mix. But it sounds like you're a little worried about it -- sorry, not worry, but you think that it could actually come off a bit during the first half of '24. Can you talk about that? What are the puts and the takes. I ask because if you sort of back into where they're running in terms of WFE, they're running probably in the high 20s, if I just take the back half of the year. So I'm wondering if that can sustain. Yes, Tim, let me start on that, and then I'll let Doug add. I think that when we think about China investment. Clearly, it has been strong as we've messaged. Part of the mix story and why it's such a high percentage of our mix right now also has to do with the fact that other customers not spending. And we all know that memory and NAND in particular, is a extreme lows. As we look into next year, and it's a bit too early for us to give 2024 WFE, so we're not going to do that.
We think about longer-term China and this overall move towards regionalization that you see people investing for long-term demand in mature nodes. And so we're not going to comment on whether we think it's sustainable in the first half or the second half of next year. But long term, we do believe that there's rolling demand in mature nodes that will drive China investment in a rather sustainable manner for the next several years. And yes, Tim, just to parse my comments a little bit. I said we believe China will continue to be strong. But I also said, albeit not quite as strong perhaps as we saw in September. And as Tim alluded to, the China investment is not going away. I don't know, if it's up, down, sideways next year, but it's not going away. They're investing for opportunities in the market that they see. I think we're hopeful the rest of the market begins to recover at some point because it's at pretty low points, and that will mitigate the China mix to a certain extent. Can you just talk also your major peer that makes [indiscernible] talked this morning about there being a handful of fabs now with these new restrictions that they can't ship into. It's predominantly a litho thing, but can you just talk about sort of where we are in terms of restrictions? And then also, when you're talking about that, what's the commonality in the etch and depth tool set for, let's say, 28-nanometer versus, let's say, 7-nanometer because technically, you can buy tools for 28-nanometer and you can use them to pattern 7-nanometer from a depth etch point of view. It's not as efficient, but you can do it. Can you just talk about that? Yes, Tim, I guess what I'd say is we've reviewed the details of the regulations and our early assessment is we don't see any material impact to our forecasted business. Now some of that has to do with the fact that we've already we've already been quite restricted into what we can ship into China relative to technology engagement. And I think to your other point about tools being purchased 1 node and used for another. I mean that's something that obviously we're we have to follow very strict regulations to adhere to the US regulation. So I don't know that, that's something that might be quite as common as what you're saying, but it's something that we make sure that we're fully compliant. And our next question today comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. On CSPG, down 8% year-over-year to the first 9 months of the year, it did decline, as you mentioned, 5% sequentially. I assume the sequential decline was driven by continued utilization declines by your customers, especially your NAND customers, as you pointed out. You did talk about improving bit shipments for these customers in the second half of the year, pricing stabilization. It sort of seems to be reflective of this sort of steadily improving supply-demand environment.
So does the team believe that utilizations have bottomed across your memory and foundry logic customers? Have they started to at least stabilize at current levels? Yes, Harlan, what we said was that those were the comments that, obviously, our customers are out talking about their business. There's clearly some time lag from when they start to see improvement in bit demand and in pricing before they start to, I think, bring some of that fab utilization back online. Our CSPG business, as we said, is affected by a couple of things. One is clearly, fab utilizations are at levels that we really haven't seen in terms of how much capacity has been taken offline in the NAND space. And that's affected spares. But also when you don't need to add bits and you're really trying to conserve your own spending, there's been quite a significant delay in technology upgrades to the installed base.
You have that -- those tools offline, you're not really upgrading them at this point. And so that has also hit the CSBG business in terms of our upgrades component. We anticipate that as the memory business starts to improve, which is what seems to be the leading indicators of playing to, we would think spares would start to come back and the technology upgrades will be done because in that next leg of growth, customers are going to want to be able to scale on that next technology node for their own efficiency of manufacturing. So we're not seeing that yet, but the leading signs are that it will come. And then you talked about this on the last earnings call, but you've got a strong position in stack chip architectures, advanced packaging. You guys have talked about this segment as being $200 million per year for Lam potentially with the past $1 billion business. On HPM, specifically, where you have very strong share, right, which began to HPM 2 to 3 to 4. I think that there's a doubling of TS fees per chip, every new generation of HPM, the DRAM stock hype is also growing from like $8 to like $24 at some point.
So is this all is sort of a very strong tailwind for the team. Do you guys anticipate strong growth next year for your HPM/advanced packaging business and some of your DRAM customers are also talking about HBM driving 10% of overall industry DRAM wafer starts. Is that how you guys are seeing it as well? We'll let them talk about how much it affects their business. But from what it affects ours, I mean everything that you just said, I think we're generally aligned with, which is trying to drive performance generally leads to more equipment needs and more sophisticated equipment needs. And so we do see a I talked about the uptick in our business that we've already seen from it.
This appears to be an area right now that is still undersupplied, and we're seeing strong demand. And so I don't anticipate, given the interest in AI that you hear so broadly in the industry right now that our HBM business wouldn't grow pretty strongly next year.
To characterize our overall advanced packaging, you mentioned a couple of hundred million. I mean, we basically said that we think that this could be a market in which our revenues actually exceeded $1 billion over the next -- sometime in the next years. And so it is a rapidly growing part of our business and one in which we have quite high share. And our next question today comes from Atif Malik with Citi. Tim, my first question is on the equipment spending. I know you guys don't guide WFE until January, but your positive peer was talking about maybe a softer first half and then things picking up into 2025. And curious if you're seeing a similar profile where first half is more in like a Lam and out like a lion. Like a Lam, likely a lion. I think that it's -- what we would say and without guiding 2024 at this point, I think it is reasonable to my prior comments that I think spending will come back cautiously. And so even though we may be seeing some of the leading indicators in some of our markets, I think people going to want to see sustainability of that condition before we start to see significant spending. So if we were to think and I believe that the general feeling is that [ '25 ] is probably -- I mean, a lot of fabs opening, a lot of a demand out in that time frame. It's not unreasonable to think that you would ramp towards that as you move through 2024. And Doug, on the gross margins, are you still guiding to year-over-year growth, but down sequentially because of the mix that you talked about. Can you walk us through which innings are we in terms of the structural gross margin improvement that you guys have been talking about this year? Yes. If you take yourself back to when we're talking about this in the March call, we're at roughly 44% gross margin, and we articulated a view that we would be able to drive a 100 basis point improvement in that from the operational efficiencies that we were undertaking during the year. And I'm super confident that that's absolutely already happened, frankly, and we'll continue to be in a good spot as we exit the year. Our next question today comes from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. I had 2 of them. First one, either Doug or Tim, I don't know [indiscernible] if you guys quantified in the past, you said like the export restriction was a $2 billion impact on your revenue. Is it a way to quantify with the new export restrictions, and I noticed that ALE was added to it, where to quantify the impact in calendar '24 or incremental dollar value? And then I have a follow-up. Yes, Chris. There really was nothing material incrementally in what was clarified, I guess it was yesterday, right? So you're right. When we came into the year, we said $2 billion to $2.5 billion. We got clarification. We could ship a little bit. We took it down to $2 billion. That's still kind of what we see this year and nothing incremental really came out yesterday. The reason for that, Krish, is that in many of those cases, while specific tools might have been now or technology is now called out, they were already the types of tools that were used to produce the technologies that were below the the limits that were already allowed. So we had already recognized that in our initial statement. Got it. Got it. That's very helpful. And then just a follow-up and to ask this question last time, too, kind of like with respect to the whole cryo etch, dielectric etch versus tell announcing a similar product. Can you give us like an update on where you are market-share-wise, on the dialectric etch side? And is the cryo etch having any impact? Because my understanding is cryo etch doe have the throughput, but it's probably a negative from selling not for dielectric etch NAND applications. I'm just trying to figure out how to handicap that. Yes. I mean there's no change from what we've said before. I mean Lam is leader in high aspect ratio etch without a doubt. And I think that also on the last call, I did point out the fact that while a lot has been made of cryo or the very cold etching conditions, this is already standard Lam condition. And so to a certain extent, many as we talk about our business and any impact that you talked about throughput, those are already factored into our commentary. So it's not something that's new to us. And I think that in general, our focus in NAND has been and always will be and memory in general, driving productivity at every technology node that goes into our projected growth outlook that we always talk about. And our next question today comes from Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. I wonder if you could talk about the DRAM uptick that you saw in the quarter. Can you kind of help us just understand qualitatively how much of that is coming from China? How much of that is from advanced packaging? Are you seeing kind of a resumption of technology spending? Just that kind of thing. What are you seeing that's driving that improvement? I guess, Joe, what I would point to, and I'll let Tim add. Yes, China was a part of it, but it's not all of it. There was an earlier question about, hey, where we have a [indiscernible] hide-bandwidth memory. Yes, it's getting pulled in. I mean customers want it sooner, we can ship. You've got a transition from DDR4 to DDR5 with these new CPUs that are out there. So that also is a little bit of a bright spot. So I guess I'd point to both of those things as part of what we saw in DRAM. Yes. No, I think that's pretty much it. I mean, as we've said before, you also have this transition to higher buy sizes, which ultimately will be a driver of of wafer outs and therefore, equipment demand and probably starting to see some of the initial phases of that right now as well. Great. And then in your upfront remarks, Tim, I think you had talked about trailing etch mature node somewhat weaker outside of China. Can you -- is there something there that could be a trend? Or is that just kind of more of a 1 quarter phenomenon? Well, obviously, since we're not guiding future quarters, I mean, I don't -- I think it's just somewhat natural in general. I mean, we've seen in certain segments, very high spend rates as companies have looked to bring on capacity to meet demand in these mature nodes. And our industry goes through digestion phases where those tools have then started going up, and you get output and you sort of figure out whether demand is there, that requires more and it's what makes our investment cycle somewhat lumpy. And I think that's what we're really looking at right now. And if long-term demand, which we believe long-term demand for semiconductors is growing, eventually, you come back and put in more more capacity into those fabs as well. And our next question today comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. I had a follow-up question to Joe's question on non-China trailing etch. And Tim, I apologize if I missed this, but can you point to any end markets or any device types that's driving the near-term weakness? And can you remind us how bigger smaller market, this is for you guys today? Toshi, I'll take it and then let Tim at on. It's a broad set of customers investing when you look at this, the specialty nodes. I mean, it's across multiple customers like [indiscernible] etch foundry as an example. And so I can't really point to any one or another for you. And quite frankly, I think we all know there's inventory out there in a lot of these device types, but these are long-term investments as well, right? This isn't something that comes in 1 quarter and then goes away just because of what's happening in the near-term marketplace. But it is in any one segment or another, Toshi, just kind of the broad set of customers. Yes. And Toshi, the only thing I would add is I think this is going to be an area that I think we're going to have to sort of acceptably a little harder to forecast from the standpoint. It's also a part of the market that is impacted by a number of the different chip stack type government support activities around the world. And so you may see as certain regions try to build up their capabilities. We may not be able to point in that moment to the demand being greater than the supply, and that's why they're investing. As Doug said, this is about long-term build-out what I think everybody sees is a much bigger demand for these types of devices over all these various types of applications in automotive and IoT and CMOS image sensors, et cetera, et cetera, over time. Got it. I appreciate the color. And then as my follow-up, 1 for Doug, on the 2024 model. You talked about mix normalizing and you guys potentially experiencing some headwinds in gross margin. You also talked about '24 potentially being a growth year from an R&D spending perspective. So I guess on gross margins, I guess what's the baseline that we should be working off of? Is the Q4 rate a good starting point? Or is that still kind of high given where China is and then from an R&D spending perspective, I guess, relative to answer if you can kind of hold our hand and quantify how low leverage could be in '24 versus history that would be super helpful. All right, Toshi, I'll give you a couple of data points, maybe for a little bit of color, but I'm not going to guide next year. Yes, we're still at an elevated level of gross margin from customer mix relative to where I think things normalize. Maybe a good way to think of it is go back to the June quarter, which was before we saw a lot of this China favorable mix. That's not an unreasonable baseline to start from for gross margin. So anyway, I don't know if that's helpful.
And then I guess what I described from an R&D standpoint. R&D, quite frankly, has to follow a cadence independent of the level of revenue sometimes. I don't know what WFE next year is going to be. I don't know what our top line is going to be quite yet. We'll give you some color next quarter. But I do know we see an enormous number of opportunities around these technology inflections that if we don't invest right now 3, 4 years from now, we'll look back and say, why didn't we, right? I'd be all around. Tim talked about backside power. There's high bandwidth, there's so many things that play to the strength of what we do well. So I think if you look at the December quarter and compared to September, spending up, the March quarter independent of the fact that we're going to invest more in R&D is a 14-week quarter. So you got to comprehend that. And then we're going to grow R&D as we go into next year, maybe a little bit independent of what revenue turns out to be.
I guess what I would want you to think about is, historically, when business grows at Lam, you've seen nice leverage in the model. It's maybe going to flatten out a little bit, honestly, is how I'm trying to like, come to you to think about it a little bit. And again, that's because we see a lot of opportunities that we think played at the strength and is going to set us up to win in the longer term. I don't know if that helps, Toshiya. Yes, it makes sense. I appreciate the color, Doug. Our next question today comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. For the first one, I'm trying to understand the usual delta between the recovery in your CSBG business and your memory systems. So how effective of a leading indicator is CSPG recovery? And what is it telling you right now about conceptually when memory system orders recover? Like is it in Q1, Q2, Q3, of next year, like what has been that delta historically? And what is that telling you right now about when your memory system orders can recover? Yes. I mean we've -- first, I'd point out the fact that it's been a long time if ever that we've seen fab utilization is quite this low. I mean our prior commentary had been that spares generally grows every year because the installed base continues to get bigger. One piece of that is true is the installed base continues to get a lot bigger. And in fact, we've said it's up more than 40% since the last cyclical downturn. And so the fact that we've seen spares and upgrades and all of these things sort of be off all at 1 time is pretty unique.
We are anticipating that as fab utilization starts back, we'll see spares come back. And I think the 1 thing that will come back, and it's a little hard to predict is certain is the technology upgrade portion of this. It's been now a couple of years since any of these tools have been upgraded, and that will have to happen.
In terms of your comment about offset, I think we'll -- typically, as customers start to turn the tools back on, you're probably a couple of quarters away from seeing further investments in the technology upgrades. And then I think when you're really talking about capacity adds, it's hard to predict what that time frame is because it really depends on many other factors about our customers' use of long-term demand.
So I think the one thing we're certain is that we're at very low points now. We would anticipate things like utilization and spares and upgrades to start improving next year. And beyond that, I think we'll wait until January to give you a better view. For my follow-up, another China-related question. Part of your second half strength came, I believe, from clarification of some rules. And I was hoping you would quantify how much of that strength you saw in your shipments came from just that clarification? And does that kind of spill over to early '24. I'm just trying to tease apart how much is sort of sustainable China strength versus how much is potentially from one-off clarification in rules? Or maybe those were not one-off, right? Maybe they're also sustainable. So just if you could give us some way to guide us to how we should think about China conceptually in your first half of next year. Yes, Vivek, we're not going to guide you next year quite yet. But the clarification of the rules we described isn't changing, right? So we understood one node that a certain customer was doing was okay to ship to. The rules didn't change. We just had to do a little work to understand that. Collectively, as an industry, that's not going to go away. Having said that also, what our commentary on the call so far has been, I don't know if China is up now on our sideways next tier, but it's not going away. When we talk to our customers in China, they all communicate roadmaps that have multiyear horizons in front of them. Nothing new came from the regulations that you saw yesterday. So I see a level of sustainability in China as we go into next year and frankly, beyond. They have long-term objectives. Our next question today comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. For my first question, you talked about in your WFE uptick on non-AM markets driving some of that. Am I oversimplifying? Are you just talking about litho or do you have something else in mind when you made that statement? Stacy, it's primarily litho. It's litho and these restricted fabs in China that we didn't have complete visibility into what they were doing, frankly. It was those two. Got it. You have better visibility now? I think we do. That's why we updated the number. We never get this exactly right, but we try to tell you what we think of it now. Stacy, some of our visibility comes from the fact that our peer companies are reporting on the business and really their markets. So as the year goes on, we try to give you a view of the whole market, but obviously, we're most accurate on the Lam business. Got it. Got it. But to be clear, I think you said there's no change to your forecast for the Lam business for the year, whatever that forecast is. That's right. Because we understand that WFE quite well. Got it. Got it. And so for my follow-up, I want to go back to the leverage question for next year. So I understand you're talking about like leverage, like maybe flattening out. Was that just a statement you just think OpEx, I mean, just to put on table OpEx growing with revenue, whatever revenue is? Or given the gross margin compression that we'll probably see at least from the current level, like do you think operating margins year-over-year could actually go -- could decline next calendar year? Or like just how do we think about those different pieces? Stacy, if you look at what Lam has done over the last, I don't know, a decade, frankly. We've expanded margin as revenue has grown. At this point, I'm not sure what revenue is going to be next year, but I know we're going to invest more in R&D. That's what I'm trying to describe because we see all of these opportunities. And yes, I referred to the fact that we've got pretty favorable customer mix that likely mitigates somewhat next year. And so when you think about those 2 things, it's possible to think about kind of margin flattening off for a period of time. Our long-term profit objectives are unchanged. So I do want to reiterate that point as well. Our next question comes from Srini Pajjuri with Raymond James. I have a couple of longer-term questions, Tim. I guess if I look at the last 5 years, your logic and foundry business has been growing almost at a 30% rate. And historically, your memory was close to 60%. And now I think we're at the bottom kind of moving from 27% to 38% or so this quarter. I'm just curious, how do you think about the mix longer term, I guess, when things normalize for you? And what is, I think, in your view, what do you think is the ideal mix for you? And what implications, if any, that might have on your top line growth going forward? Yes. It's a good question. It's a hard question to answer because the actual. Our view is we want more of everything. So we're not looking to reduce our position in memory just to make the mix look better. So we try hard every day. We have a fantastic position in memory, and we think there's still more to come there as over the next decade, I mean, NAND is going to scale customers saying to 1,000 layers, and that's a tremendous opportunity for Lam. DRAM going to 3D around the end of the decade, tremendous opportunity for Lam. So I'm afraid the memory side will keep growing simply because it's so well suited to our strengths. But you have heard us talk a lot about the fact that we see huge opportunity in the foundry logic side as well. And when Doug just talked about spending, I mean, I've tried to lay out for you in the last several quarters, the breadth of opportunities that are ahead of the company, many of which -- not all, but many of which are on the foundry logic side.
I mean just to kind of recap some of those, I mean, the dry EUV photoresist and develop. When we said that's $1.5 billion opportunity over 5 years. And when you get towards the tail end of that 5 years, I mean, that's a revenue that's growing with the number of expanding EUV layers at every technology node after that. That's primarily foundry logic business.
We talked about gate all around, about $1 billion incremental opportunity for Lam introduces opportunities to win new tools and selective etch and ALD. And so that's same expansion for us in foundry logic and opportunity to grow. We talked about advanced packaging. I mean you've already seen what's happened with not only the HBM side of AI, but also the entire formation of these big AI systems using interposers. Lam's invested now in panel processing as a way to ultimately bring down the costs of some of this chiplet -- these chiplet applications.
And then finally, today, I just talked about backside power distribution as a new way of being very creative about how you use that backside of the wafer is additional real estate and it opens up a lot of new opportunities for us, and that's primarily a foundry logic application as well. And so really, what we're talking about is Lam has a long way to go to expand our SAM, especially on the foundry logic side. That's what we're investing for. And each of these is a $1 billion-plus opportunity for Lam over the next several years. And so we're pretty excited about that. But we're not giving up on our strong memory positions. I appreciate that answer. And then my quick follow-up on the HBM, I guess, technology itself. A lot of questions have been asked already. Just on the capital intensity of HBM. Tim, I mean, I know you said the die size is larger and I guess, cycle times are longer, et cetera. But is there a way to think about capital intensity per wafer or per bit? How we should think about HBM versus traditional DDR? Well, I think it's a -- I don't know that we've quantified that number, but it's -- it obviously is a much higher performance die than our device, and it does -- it is bigger and takes more capital. And so therefore, it's a performance-driven application. From our perspective, though, what really is interesting is that many of the new tools that get added to enable HBM or Lam tools or tools that are in our market, things like silicon etch and copper plating for the TSV formation. And so that's what really makes it an even better transition for that massive [indiscernible] company like Lam. And our next question today comes from Brian Chin with Stifel. So about a week ago, the U.S. relaxed its licensing requirements for some foreign companies that operate more advanced fabs in China. I know it's fairly recent, but have you seen a positive impact yet from this change in the licensing policy. I did note that in talking about China remaining a good concentration in the December quarter. It sounds like maybe there could be some shifting there between local and maybe foreign domiciled companies? Yes. It's pretty -- that comment is pretty recent. But I think relative to multinationals, wherever they operate, whether China or certainty of being able to make the investment and benefit from that long term is very important. So obviously, in the last couple of weeks, we haven't seen any movement that we had talked about. I think long term, it allows people -- it allows our customers to ultimately make the right decisions for them about where to invest. And that is especially true when you think about our installed base and the upgrades to the installed base and a customer willingness to sort of move forward with those upgrades with certainties. That's helpful. And then a lot of questions have been asked about sort of service spares and utilization improvements. But just curious, if memory companies are kind of talking as is they'll realize some of that utilization improvement, not just through increasing wafer starts, but also through some reduction in wafer start capacity as they emphasize newer nodes or capital efficiencies on some wafer loss there. How are you thinking about how that impacts maybe the trajectory of your service and spares revenue growth in calendar '24? Well, I think that we have to see and we -- as we said about the -- it's difficult to predict the pace of the recovery. But what happens there is we're just trading off 1 part of our business that CSBG business for another. If upgrades happened before spares, you're right, it brings utilization down. But there's also something that we've said, which is as technology moves forward, many of those applications become more spares intensive because the processes are longer and more demanding. And so I would just say that we're going to see a rise in both parts of our business as fab operations recover and customers start to fully utilize the equipment in those fabs. Our next question today comes from Mehdi Hosseini with [ SFG ]. Yes. Just 2 quick follow-ups. Opportunities with the back side power rate. Should I think about it more of a 3-nanometer or extension of 3-nanometer? Or are those opportunities materializing when we migrate to 2-nanometer. And I have a follow-up. Yes. I think that it's still a little bit out in the future, I mean, you could go look at our customers' road maps and what they've said publicly, and I think that's probably the best way to put timing on it. I think what we're trying to highlight is the fact that our -- if you think about the challenges across almost every device, we're becoming more and more convinced that the technology solutions to those challenges involve vertical scaling, they move to 3D and you're seeing that backside power, advanced packaging, gate all around. These are -- it is something that is playing extremely well to our strengths in etch and deposition. And so timing is hard to predict, but the certain -- relative certainty of those changes happening is quite high. Got it. And a quick follow-up for Doug. What should we think of a normalized or normal deferred revenue level? Yes. Mehdi, in the past, I've suggested maybe something around $1 billion is a normalized level and we're somewhat elevated from that. the longer we remain elevated, maybe the normalized level picks up a little bit, but I'll leave that statement, what I said, maybe roughly $1 billion. And our next question today comes from Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. Question is about where your lead times delivery times are now and generally your ability to react when demand ultimately returns. You made some comments before that your customers you think would need to see some significant improvement before they started spending. Does this mean they have some -- a little bit of luxury of time to see things get a bit better before they start calling you and increasing orders. Yes. I think that if we were to go back and talk about lead times compared to pre-COVID, I would say that generally still extended, but for a variety of reasons. I mean I talked about the investments we've made in our supply chain and our manufacturing facilities. A lot of that has to be more responsive, but I think we will be able to respond when realistically when demand starts to come back. Now in certain areas, it's a little tighter than others. And I think that's where, again, we still continue to work very closely with our customers to make sure we have good forecast as we talked about. High bandwidth memory has been an area that I think has been in tighter supply. And the good thing about the investments we made in our global operations is that in certain cases, we're able to respond a little bit more quickly than customers have urgent needs. Got it. As a follow-up. If you give a little more clarity on the extra week you're expecting, I think it's in the March quarter, both on -- do you expect a revenue impact from that extra week? And what do you expect the cost impact to be? Yes. Usually, you don't really see much of a revenue impact, frankly. You kind of manage based on what customer wants when. But I know for sure, with an extra week, 14 weeks instead of 13, you got more salary expense, you've got more time to use project materials and whatnot. I don't know. I didn't give you a specific number, but I think it's pretty well chronicled about there. When people have a quarter coming in like this, how much spending grows just because of it. I'm not going to put a number on it, but just think about 14 versus 13. Operator, we have time for one more question, please. Our final question will be from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. In. In the past, you guys talked about memory spending recovery will go in several phases from increasing utilization to tech upgrades and then capacity expansion. One of the memory customers talk about converting some of this excess capacity to address the advanced note. Are you seeing that dynamics happening across other memory suppliers? And how does that change your view in terms of the timing of capacity expansion? Sidney, you were breaking up a little bit. I think you were asking about the cadence of when utilization comes back, what we think will happen, I think that was your question. And I think what I would tell you, first, spares comes back. Second, you'll see upgrades, and upgrades will have to happen obviously, some of the customer base has taken some things offline. So there's a spend that needs to occur to get that back online and up to speed and then eventually new equipment gets purchased. That hasn't changed. Okay. So my question was more about some of your customers actually trying to convert some of the excess capacity to address the advanced notes, meaning that it seems like the timeline is compressed. Are you seeing all the memory suppliers doing that? We don't talk about any one 1 customer or another, but that will show up in that upgrades commentary that I was talking about, the stuff that gets taken offline eventually needs to get upgraded. That's the upgrade spend in CSBG. Okay. That's it. Maybe last question for you. Given your position in gate-all-around, has your timeline changed at all in terms of when do you expect to see gate-all-around related revenue as compared to 3 months ago? Maybe just remind us when that is going to happen? And what are the leading indicators you watching to gauge that timeline. Well, yes, it's -- I don't know that our timing on gate-all-around around has changed much from 3 months ago. I think that, again, it's a means of scaling device performance and device performance is something is important to our customers and their [indiscernible] locations. So we're just engaged with customers to make sure our tools get qualified into those new nodes and when they decide to ramp them, we'll be ready as well. And this for our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn it back over to the management team for closing remarks. Thank you, operator, and we appreciate everyone for joining. Thank you for your time today. Thank you.

And with that, I'll hand the call over to Tim. Thank you, Ram, and welcome, everyone. Lam delivered strong performance in the December quarter. Revenues, gross margin, operating margin and EPS all above the midpoint of our guided ranges. Our results for December closed out a calendar year 2023, in which Lam executed well amid a decline in overall wafer fabrication equipment spending. Compared to the prior year cycle trough in calendar 2019, we achieved a near doubling of EPS.
There are a few reasons why Lam has evolved stronger cycle to cycle. First, we have improved our positioning in the foundry, logic and specialty technology segments through sustained investments in innovation and new products. As a result, we have grown our total non-memory revenue share, and we continue to gain momentum at key technology inflections. Second, we have delivered tremendous growth in our customer support business group. Lam ended calendar 2023 with approximately 90,000 chambers in the field, an installed base almost 50% larger than in the previous cycle. CSBG revenue has grown by more than 80% from 2019 levels. And finally, we have further improved our ability to manage costs and drive operational efficiency through cycles, delivering operating margins in 2023 that were nearly 2.5 points higher than the prior trough.
Turning to WFE. We estimate that 2023 spending ended in the low $80 billion range. This is up slightly from our prior view, driven by continued strength in domestic China spending predominantly in equipment segments where we do not participate.
Overall, memory WFE was down nearly 40% year-on-year, led by cuts in NAND spending of more than 75%. Non-memory WFE decreased in the mid-single digits range with mature node growth in China, partially offsetting declines in leading-edge node spending in the rest of the world.
As we enter 2024, the business environment remains muted. However, we expect a modest recovery in memory spending to drive a stronger exit to the year. Our early view of WFE spending for calendar 2024 is in the mid- to high $80 billion range. Growth in DRAM will be driven by capacity additions for high-bandwidth memory as well as node conversions. NAND spending increases will largely come from technology upgrades. We see foundry logic spend growing in 2024 with higher leading-edge investment, offset in part by declines in mature node investment outside of China. Overall, we believe domestic China spending will be stable in 2024.
Longer term, the setup for WFE investment is robust. With semiconductor revenues widely expected to reach $1 trillion around the end of the decade and device manufacturing complexity continuing to rise, we believe WFE spending will need to roughly double from today's levels. Lam's served markets of etch and deposition should outpace growth in WFE overall. For this reason, we have been executing a series of strategic actions to best position the company for the growth opportunity ahead. Importantly, we have remained committed to these initiatives despite the challenging spending environment over the past several quarters.
First is our commitment to R&D, including planned spending increases in calendar year 2024 to extend our differentiation in products and services targeted at next-generation semiconductor device inflections. This next era in semiconductors will be defined by the broad move towards 3D architectures and advanced packaging to solve scaling challenges. We believe this will, in turn, drive an increase in etch and deposition intensity over the long term. Our focus is on multiple billion dollar SAM expansion opportunities across memory and foundry logic.
We have profiled our advances in gate-all-around, backside power delivery, advanced packaging and dry EUV patterning over the past several quarters, and our solutions are continuing to gain traction with customers. In the December quarter, we secured additional advanced packaging wins for high-bandwidth memory, which is critical for enabling advanced AI servers.
Our SABRE 3D tools, best-in-class plating uniformity along with our ability to demonstrate an overall cost of ownership advantage made Lam the clear choice over a large competitor. In 2024, we expect our HBM related DRAM and packaging shipments to more than triple year-on-year and outpace WFE growth in this segment by a significant margin.
The specialty technology markets are also yielding a diverse set of new opportunities for Lam. For instance, we have recently delivered pulse laser deposition technology to customers targeting high-volume manufacturing of MEMS and next-generation high-frequency devices. We accelerated our entry into this market by integrating technology we obtained via small acquisition onto a production-proven Lam platform. Compared to competing deposition methods, Lam solution enables more highly doped scandium aluminum nitride films, which delivered the piezoelectric performance and cost our customers require.
The second area of focus for Lam has been our investment in facilities close to our customers. By establishing process development capabilities near our customers' R&D fabs, we are maximizing collaboration and accelerating time to solutions. We have also made progress ramping supply chain and manufacturing operations within our customer ecosystems. These in-region capabilities enhance our responsiveness and resilience for customers and create significant economic value for Lam as we leverage the benefits of global flexibility. Our new manufacturing facility in Malaysia is poised to fully scale in the coming WFE upturn, providing us the capability to nearly triple the percentage revenue contribution from our lower cost manufacturing locations versus a few years ago.
And finally, Lam is concentrated on reengineering our business processing systems to drive operational excellence at greater scale. Investments in digital capabilities like virtual twinning, advanced simulation and AI are helping us to accelerate problem solving, and we are building equipment intelligence capabilities and in-fab service automation into our most advanced product road maps.
As we complete our reengineering efforts, we are also intent on achieving organizational agility. In this regard, we are announcing a small workforce reduction predominantly at the executive level to align our resources with our execution priorities and drive efficiency and speed of decision-making.
In calendar 2023, Lam delivered solid results while investing to build strong capabilities for the future. Looking forward, I am confident that our strategic global infrastructure and differentiated technology portfolio provide Lam with the tools we need to capitalize on the robust semiconductor growth expected in the years ahead.
Thank you, and now here is Doug. Great. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today during what I know is a busy earnings season. We delivered strong financial results in calendar year 2023. Our revenue came in at $14.3 billion and diluted earnings per share at $27.33. We're pleased with the company's execution during the year where the memory WFE mix reached historic lows.
Let's look at the details of our December quarter results. Revenue for the December quarter was $3.76 billion, which was up 8% from the prior quarter and down 29% from a year ago. Our deferred revenue balance at the end of the quarter was $1.93 billion, which was an increase of $238 million from the September quarter, which was mainly tied to growth in customer advanced payments. We continue to have a higher deferred revenue balance versus historic levels given these customer advanced payments.
From a segment perspective, December quarter, systems revenue in memory was 48%, which is an increase from the prior quarter level of 38%. The growth in the memory segment was led by DRAM, which was at record levels on a dollar basis, coming in at 31% of systems revenue compared with 23% in the September quarter. DRAM is benefiting from growth in high-bandwidth memory capacity and the move to DDR5, which is needed to address AI-related workloads, and it's also benefiting from shipments to China.
As we've noted in prior quarters, nonvolatile memory WFE was at historic lows on a mix basis in 2023. For the December quarter, this segment represented 17% of our systems revenue, which was up a little bit from 15% in the prior quarter. The slight growth was predominantly related to investments in certain technology projects. NAND customers have aggressively reduced capacity throughout the year to bring inventory levels down.
The Foundry segment represented 38% of our systems revenue, a little higher than the percentage concentration in the September quarter of 36%. Growth was driven by new fab shipments in various regions across several process nodes. The Logic and Other segment was 14% of our systems revenue in the December quarter, which was down from the prior quarter level of 26%. The decline was driven by general mature node softness as well as the timing of customer projects. Overall, in the Foundry and Logic segment, we performed well, delivering on the share gains that we've previously been discussing with you.
Now I'll discuss the regional composition of our total revenue. The China region came in at 40%, which was down from 48% in the prior quarter. Most of our China revenue in the last 2 quarters was from domestic Chinese customers, and we expect spending from this region to be stable overall in 2024. China as a percent of our revenue is expected to stay relatively high in the March quarter, but it likely trend lower as the year progresses. Our next largest geographic concentration was Korea at 19% of revenue in the December quarter versus 16% in the September quarter. And finally, Japan and Taiwan rounded out the remaining of our top 4 regions.
The customer support business group generated revenue in the December quarter of nearly $1.5 billion, up 2% from the September quarter and 16% lower than the December quarter in calendar year 2022. Overall, the business was steady, and we continue to see our memory customers operating the fabs at very low utilization rates.
Given the strength of the installed base units, we have a strong foundation for growth with technology conversions and utilization rates resume growing. Spares followed by the Reliant product line continue to be the 2 largest components of CSBG.
Turning to the gross margin performance. The December quarter came in at 47.6%, which is above the midpoint of guidance and generally in line with the September quarter level, which was 47.9%. We've improved elements of our cost structure during the year and delivered on our commitment to improve gross margin from the 2023 March quarter level by approximately 1 percentage point as we exited calendar year 2023 from those operational improvements. December quarter operating expenses were $662 million, up from the prior quarter amount of $622 million. R&D as a percent of spending was higher versus the September quarter, coming in at over 69% of total expenses.
The increased spending reflects our ongoing focus on extending our product and technology differentiation across those critical inflections that Tim mentioned earlier. We will continue to grow investments across multiple market segments to support the long-term strategic objectives for ongoing company outperformance.
Operating margin for the current quarter was 30%, in line with September quarter level of 30.1% and above the midpoint of our guidance primarily because of a stronger gross margin performance.
Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 12.3%, generally in line with expectations. Looking into calendar 2024, we believe the tax rate will be in the low to mid-teens with the normal fluctuations quarter-by-quarter. Other income expense for the December quarter came in at $5 million in income compared with $7 million in income in the September quarter. The slight fluctuation in OI&E was mainly due to variations in exchange rates. OI&E will continue to be subject to market-related fluctuations that could cause some level of volatility each quarter.
On the capital return side, we allocated approximately $640 million to open market share repurchases, and we paid $264 million in dividends in the December quarter. For the 2023 calendar year, we returned 79% of our free cash flow, totaling $3.8 billion, which was largely consistent with our long-term capital return plans of 75% to 100%. December quarter diluted earnings per share was $7.52 over the midpoint of our guidance. Diluted share count rounded down to 132 million shares on track with our expectations and down from the September quarter.
During 2023, we repurchased nearly 5 million shares through our share buyback program. And I would just mention, we have $2.1 billion remaining on our Board-authorized share repurchase plan. 
Let me turn to the balance sheet. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the December quarter totaled $5.6 billion, up from $5.2 billion in the September quarter. The increase was largely due to collections, offset by cash allocated to share repurchases, dividend payments and capital expenditures. Overall, 2023 was a record year for cash flows from operations coming in at $5.3 billion. Days sales outstanding was 66 days in the December quarter, which was a decrease from 73 days in the September quarter. As a result of our operational focus and execution, I'm pleased to report that inventory turns improved to 1.8x from the prior quarter level of 1.5x. We will continue to work on bringing inventory down throughout calendar 2024.
Our noncash expenses for the December quarter included approximately $70 million for equity compensation, $78 million for depreciation and $13 million for amortization. Capital expenditures for the December quarter were $115 million, up $38 million from the September quarter.
Spending was primarily centered on product development activities and lab expansions in the United States and Asia, supporting our global lab investment strategy. We ended the -- excuse me, the December quarter with approximately 17,200 regular full-time employees, which was flat with the prior quarter.
Let's now turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the March 2024 quarter. We're expecting revenue of $3.7 billion, plus or minus $300 million. Gross margin of 48%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. This gross margin guidance is reflected -- reflective of continued favorable customer mix. I do expect this favorable mix to mitigate somewhat as the year progresses. Operating margins of 29.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. I would again highlight that the March 2024 quarter will have higher spending as it includes an extra week in the quarter, which occurs every several years. It's a 14-week quarter. And I will also remind you we will be growing R&D spending this year. 
And finally, we're expecting earnings per share of $7.25, plus or minus $0.75 based on a share count of approximately 132 million shares. We continue to be focused on improving our business operations to optimize efficiency and effectiveness as WFE growth occurs. Our profitability metrics reflect the progress we made during calendar year 2023, with business realignment and transformational activities well underway. We'll see these activities continue in the first half of calendar year 2024. Including the cost incurred for these improvement activities and headcount reductions that we saw in calendar 2023, I now expect we'll spend in total $300 million for these actions, which will continue to be reported in our non-GAAP adjustments.
I had previously told you we would spend $250 million over 12 months. It's now $50 million higher and 6 months longer.
So let me conclude. Over many semiconductor cycles, Lam has established a proven track record of successfully managing our business. With the actions we've taken over the course of the last several quarters, we expect to strengthen our operations and technology leadership and further enhance our profitability profile. When revenue scales into the next upturn, Lam will be stronger, better positioned and more efficient.
Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. Tim and I would now like to open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Tim Arcuri from UBS. I guess my first question for you, Tim, is I wondered if you could sort of translate. Obviously, you heard your big litho peer that reported today that had these huge orders and it looks like a couple of billion dollars in EUV orders for DRAM. So that sort of translates to an extra $9 billion to $10 billion, something like that. So it seems mostly for shipments during this year and even into next year for them. So like maybe you haven't seen that yet. But can you talk about what that tells you about the future of that segment? And I know you think it's going to be up, but it seems like it could be up a lot. And maybe any change in the planning outlook or the discussions that you're having with your DRAM customers? Sure. Thanks, Tim. And obviously, WFE is a tricky thing to forecast because generally, we have a very good view of certain segments of the market. And we try to give an overall view of WFE, and we do that based on listening to peers, talking to customers and making our own assessments. Yes, sometimes we get it wrong. And I guess we're always in a period of adjusting that. I think though -- I didn't -- I don't think there's anything out there that is completely inconsistent with what we've said. We've said WFE is up this year, modestly recovering because of memory. It's -- we'd see a stronger exit to the year. And I think to the magnitude, I think we're just going to keep watching it and having those conversations with customers.
In this period, lead times of equipment and the framework in which certain pieces of equipment need to be ordered and brought into fabs can differ equipment supplier to equipment supplier, and maybe there's something at play there. But I think it probably further reinforces our bullishness that memory has been at a historically low mix of WFE. We said that memory spending across both DRAM and NAND. We felt was at unsustainable levels. We said that on pretty much every call last year.
And -- so I think that it's not a surprise that, that eventually corrects itself. What I would point out is that we don't spend a tremendous amount of time trying to get the timing exactly right. In my script, I talked a lot about strategic actions, which play out over years and, in fact, catch the DRAM inflections that are coming now. The strength we have in high-bandwidth memory, the positions we have in applications in DDR5 and beyond. Those were established by us seeing DRAM opportunities years ago. And I think we're continuing to report more and more growth in that segment. And I think we'll just continue to do that. So we tend to take a long-term view of technology and spending patterns. And Tim, it's Doug. I'll just remind you something that I know you know very well that with those lead times are generally much longer than ours are in etch and deposition. And you never buy litho without eventually buying the process equipment that goes along with it. So if they're seeing something, we will see it, too. Totally, Doug. Yes, for sure. So I guess for you, Doug, super quick. So there's kind of a lot of moving parts, I know going on in gross margin. I know that the mix is helping you. And I know you're probably getting some tailwinds from some cost relief and things like that. So what's the right normalized margin? I know maybe 48% is not the right normalized number, but is it like is the mix helping you by 50 basis points, and that's what sort of goes away. Can you sort of help us there? Yes. Tim, I'll remind you what I said last quarter call too, still kind of the same thing. The customer mix is benefiting us again in the March quarter guide, maybe even a little bit more than it did last quarter. I took you back to that June quarter of last year before we had such a favorable geographic mix and that largely is what's driving the customer mix.
We were around 46% gross margin, 45.7%, I think, if I remember the June quarter specifically. That's not a bad place to kind of start when mix normalizes back to maybe more normal levels. So think about it that way. Somewhere in between there and where we are here. These operational improved install that we've been talking about are real things and as growth resumes and we know growth will resume at some juncture, we should benefit from like repositioning the company to these lower cost locations. So that's still on the come line. but it will require some level of growth in the business. The next question is from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Again, going back to your large litho peer that reported this morning, right? They called out seeing an increase in customer utilization of their litho tools, both in memory and in Foundry and Logic, appearing that this is the early signal of a positive turn in cyclical dynamics. I know you guys are also track in real time utilization, activity rates of your customers. I know they're at very low levels, but are you guys starting to see some pickup in utilization rates across your customers? And is that also maybe giving you further confidence in your modest growth outlook for WFE this year? Yes. We've said in the past that we -- obviously, we track that pretty closely. I think you've heard our customers talk about increasing utilization. We've certainly seen and heard from our customers talk of strengthening in pricing in those markets. How we said it would affect us? I mean, in markets like NAND, we said we would -- with so much utilization taken offline, we would see some uptick in our spares business. We see that start to flow through upgrades. And as I mentioned in my script, we anticipate that a big portion of the uptick in memory spending this year will be coming through technology upgrades where -- the installed base is Lam equipment and therefore, the benefit -- a lot of the benefit of that WFE spending will flow to Lam as we do those technology upgrades.
The other element of the spending will be coming from the additional equipment that needs to get added to enable things like high bandwidth memory. And we've talked about the fact that in high bandwidth memory, Lam has a 100% market share of the critical technologies needed for stacking the DRAM. So I'll let our customers speak to what their utilizations are but what I'd say is that all signs are pointing to the memory market beginning to come out of its pretty darn near historic downturn over the last couple of years. And so that's what we're looking at for this year. That's very helpful. And then you mentioned this, I mean, your CSBG business has grown at a 17% CAGR since 2019, right? That's significantly faster than I think it was a 10% to 11% CAGR target that you guys put out at your last Analyst Day. I know it's been weak over the past few quarters, just given some of the supply side discipline of your customers, lower utilizations, slowing tech migration. But assuming that you will see the pickup in activity sometime this year. You combine that with a strong continued growth in the installed base business, number of chambers continues to grow at a low double-digit growth rate. Like how should we think about the growth profile, puts and takes of CSBG this year and going forward? Yes, I don't know that we're going to put a number on the growth rate for CSBG at this point. But clearly, that business has been heavily impacted by the utilization cuts that occurred within our customer fabs. And we saw that both in spares as well as a curtailment of many of the technology upgrades that typically would just occur year in, year out. And so that did have an impact on CSBG revenues. I think that going forward, I talked about how much larger the installed base is now. That's a much larger installed base that because of the delay in technology upgrades, there's pent-up demand there. I mean those tools need to be upgraded to be operating at the latest and most efficient and most competitive technology node for our customers. And so I don't know the exact timing, but I do know that installed base will be upgraded and will actually generate quite a lot of revenue for Lam going forward. And Harlan, maybe just like to remind you, there's 4 components in CSBG, spare service upgrades, all of which will benefit from what Tim was describing. You also have the Reliant product line in there, which has just done amazing in the last year. That will ebb and flow to a certain extent with more mature nodes, specialty node WFE. So don't lose sight of that one. There might be a slightly different dynamic with the Reliant product line. The next question is from Atif Malik with Citi. First one, Tim, historically, you guys have benefited disproportionately when the NAND spending happens. And -- if you were to think about your position competitively when the NAND spending recovers, I understand this year there's more technology upgrades. But how should we think about your position coming out of this NAND downturn competitively, particularly on more layers than the whole edge process? Yes. I think that -- it's a good question, and that was what I pointed out. I mean I think what we're looking at in the near term in those first stages of recovery is customers are very cost sensitive. And the best way to achieve that next technology notice by upgrading the equipment that you have in place. And so Lam, we spend a tremendous amount of time investing in technologies that enable the upgrade and extension of our equipment, and that's really of high value to our customers. I think that will actually go on for quite a long time.
We have about 6,500 chambers of high aspect ratio etch, for instance, in the NAND marketplace. That creates a lot of next-generation technology through those upgrades. And beyond that, the learning you get from now running those upgraded chambers at that next technology node, tends to seed all of the ideas and understanding of the challenges that need to be solved at the mix node. And I think that's why the installed base positions and incumbent positions tend to be very difficult to break in this industry.
And we've tried to break many others -- break into others. And so we know that very well. What Lam has done extremely well is to collaborate closely with our customers. I talked about our close to customer strategy, putting R&D labs in very close proximity to our customers. And again, that's just the way in which we ensure that we're adequately meeting both their technology and cost needs going forward. Great. And then a quick clarification, Doug, on the OpEx. You said R&D will be up year-over-year. I wasn't sure if that implies total OpEx is also up or SG&A is down to offset the increase in R&D? Total OpEx is probably going to be up Atif, R&D will be up more, right? We had 69% of total spending in R&D in the last quarter. That's a high watermark. But we're purposefully growing R&D., primarily because of all those inflections that we've been talking about. I think the maybe the easiest way to think about it is the lead time for us to develop new products that we need to drive growth is unfortunately a little bit longer than the lead time for our spending revenue. So with an outlook that growth is coming and that we're entering this next upturn, where there are tremendous opportunities for the company, we feel very confident to invest ahead of that revenue showing up, and that's I think what we signaled through this year. But with the confidence that we're going to see that growth in new products and technology investment from our customers. The next question is from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. The first one on WFE. Doug, I -- forget if you mentioned this, but is there a first half, second half sort of bias that you're willing to share as we think about the trajectory of WFE this year? And more importantly, curious how we should be thinking about your rate of outperformance vis-a-vis the market? You guys have talked about obviously, depth and etch intensity growing across the memory space. You talked about advanced packaging in HBM. HBM things like dry resist. So assuming you're accurate with your WFE assumption and the market's up call it, mid- to high singles. What sort of outperformance can we sort of expect from you guys in calendar '24? Yes. Toshiya, I guess the first -- I think it's a little bit second half weighted year this year. I think it's going to be sort of the slow start to the year, maybe, right? We just guided to essentially flat revenues quarter-on-quarter. So that's part of what you're seeing, but we would expect it will be somewhat stronger in the second half. And then overall, we're not going to give you the individual components between NAND, DRAM, Foundry and Logic, what grows more. I think everything probably grows to a certain extent. When we look at all these inflections so in all aspects of those end markets, we see etch and deposition intensity stepping up as you walk from node to node to node. So that is unchanged. Got it. And then as my follow-up on China, Doug, you mentioned China as a percentage of your systems revenue to stay elevated in the March quarter. And then you went on to say that, that number should decline as you progress through the year. Is that just purely a function of your other businesses, other regions improving throughout the year? Or are you sort of sensing absolute decline in your China business? And if so, what are some of the areas or device types or applications you're seeing a slowdown? We are not seeing China slowdown. It's purely just timing of when spending is occurring, honestly.
Toshiya, we've preferably been using the word, and I think you heard it in both Tim and my comments stable, right? So that's a consistent description that we have been saying for a while. The next question is from C.J. Muse with Cantor. I guess I was hoping you could speak to kind of your vision for what a recovery might look like for NAND and where we might get to on a normalized basis, perhaps in 2025? And then -- and if you reflect on perhaps a lower normalized number and think about some of the new areas that you're investing in, whether it's memory or advanced packaging or changes in backside power gate-all-around. Is there enough kind of juice there to get you to where you can overall drive that rich WFE intensity and get us back to kind of those peak levels when 3D NAND was first adopted? Sure, C.J. I think the simple answer is, yes, we do believe that. I mean, we've -- let me address the NAND question first, which -- as I mentioned, this year, customers are primarily focusing on technology upgrades and what makes sense. I mean eventually, to drive the type of bit growth that we think we see longer term. Obviously, there are some additions that need to be made, but we're not forecasting that this year.
With each of those technology evolutions, etch and dep intensity rises simply because of the increasing number of layers. And in a technology upgrade, we've talked about the fact that Lam captures a much higher percentage of WFE because of the goal that etch and deposition play in the technology upgrade. So I think that as we see NAND growing -- recovering and growing at a certain percentage rate, Lam will actually significantly outperform that rate because of the fact that most of that is coming from upgrades.
Now longer term, I think we have turned to our attention and strategically, we've said we want to build resilience into our business by really capturing a lot of the opportunities that exist. Of course in NAND where we're very strong, but really outside of NAND and some of these other markets that are becoming more etch and dep intensive. And we've talked about those, whether it's gate-all-around or backside power or advanced packaging, dry EUV patterning. And each of those, we've characterized as a $1 billion-plus opportunity when fully scaled for Lam. So -- and those are SAM expansion meaning that they are incremental to where Lam has been before.
So I think when you play those out and obviously, we have to be successful in execution. That's why we keep talking about we're gaining traction, but there's still a ways to go before these inflections and all decisions are made. But we think those can certainly drive Lam to new highs in terms of revenue and obviously profitability as well. Very helpful, Tim. I guess a quick follow-up, Doug. I know you're hesitant to guide OpEx for the full year, but perhaps you could help us understand maybe the impact of the extra week on the March quarter? And how you're thinking about driving that R&D growth through the calendar year? Yes, C.J. I mean, it's 14 weeks versus 13. That's the right way to kind of think about it. You can just ratio it to understand kind of it's a longer quarter. So that's the piece from that. And then any delta to get to the 29.5% op margin is part of that beginning to step up R&D. As we go through the year, though, we will purposely be growing the investment in R&D so that you might not see the historic leverage that we've delivered is what I described a quarter ago, and that's still very much how you should be thinking about it. The next question is from Srinivas Pajjuri with Raymond James. Tim, you talked about your trough EPS doubling essentially, which is a tremendous achievement and execution. I think part of the reason was your services business did increase as a percent of the mix. I think that helped for sure stabilizing the cyclicality a bit. So as we go through the next, I guess, as we kind of look out to the next couple of years as business recovers, just curious as to how you think about the mix shaking out between systems and services? And how -- what sort of implications that might have for your top line and also your margin profile? And I guess, on the next peak EPS, if you want to talk about? Well, here's why it's always a little difficult to answer this question is because we're certainly investing to grow our systems business tremendously as well. And so we don't look at it as one trading off versus the other. And so in fact, one kind of begets the other. The better our systems business does the faster our installed base grows, and that's really the story from 2019 in that -- until now, when we talk about how much the installed base has grown. We shipped a lot of new systems that grew that installed base by nearly 50%.
So going forward, I think that we anticipate the ratio of CSBG revenue to overall revenue staying kind of in the historical range that it's been. And that's just going to be driven by kind of equivalent on success in both parts. But the CSBG revenue, the installed base business, not only gives us stability, but it also opens new channels for growth for the company. And I've talked about this on previous calls, which is we -- I think that when we think about how Lam leverages, things like artificial intelligence and data. It's in the installed base services business.
On the last call, I talked about even cobots, the use of collaborative robots to start to do some of the service that today is done by skilled engineers. Our customers in this industry have to find ways to be able to innovate faster and also provide manufacturing services at a lower cost. And I think that -- we can do that by innovating around the installed base and create new products and service offerings that help us grow at a faster pace than the installed base itself is growing. Got it. And then Doug, one clarification on the deferred revenue. I think it went up about $238 million this quarter. You talked about prepayments. Just curious, are customers still prepaying because of any supply constraints? Or is this an ongoing, I guess, trend that you're seeing? Just if you can talk about how we should think about deferred revenue going forward, that will be helpful. Yes, Srini. I guess what I described is you think about the advanced payment is when we have a new customer that we're just kind of understanding what their balance sheet looks like, especially if they're a private customer that we could see the balance sheet. It's not publicly reported. And the creditworthiness might be sort of questionable. We require cash upfront before we begin manufacturing the tool, and that's what's going on there. That's all it is. The next question is from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. For the first one, around the China BOP being stable in calendar '24. Do you see all market segments being stable? Or do you see some like being stronger and some being weaker? Like how do you see that interplay? Stacy, I don't really see a big change year-on-year relative to end market. I'll remind you, when China DRAM was second half weighted last year. It's probably a little bit first half weighted in China, maybe more than a little bit this year. But year-over-year, I don't think I really think about a significant change in contribution for the entire year. Got it. That's helpful. And I guess a follow-up on the China questions, and maybe it's a follow-up on one of the earlier questions. But it does sound to me like you are suggesting China mix should come down through the year. Maybe you can clarify that because if I've got overall stable China revenues like how does your China mix come down materially? It doesn't look like you're looking for overall like non-China WFE to grow a ton, right, in some of the other areas. So... Yes. Let me remind you, in 2023, China was a more modest amount of WFE that grew in the second half of the year. And so the comments we're making are year-over-year, it's relatively stable. Kind of the half-on-half stuff probably looks different in '24 than it did in '23 in China specifically. That's helpful. And so then exiting the year, you think you're back to that sort of normalized gross margin range as a result of that as China falls off in the second half? Yes. The customer mix stuff, I think, mitigates some as we go through the year, and it continues to be quite strong in the March quarter guidance. The next question is from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. For my first one, I'm curious, what's your assessment of NAND supply demand as it exists today? I think in your WFE view, you are assuming that NAND grows but more because of technology upgrades. But what are your customers telling you for as to when they want to start adding more tools? And what's Lam's opportunity to grow NAND right at a measurable pace in the second half of the year? Yes. I think that -- first of all, I wouldn't necessarily talk about what we are discussing with our customers on that standpoint. But things that are out there. We do know, and I think you know that the utilization cuts were pretty severe in NAND last year. And so there's a tremendous amount of capacity that is -- has been offline and we've said in the past that needs to be brought back online. And I think the question and the discussions we're having is that what technology node should that capacity be restarted. And in many cases, there is a very high likelihood that technology upgrade certainly will occur as that equipment is brought back into service.
And so in that case, we would actually begin to see a restart of some of the utilization driven revenue that we get from things like spares and services, as well as, at the same time, a restart of technology upgrade revenues. And that's why I think that from a NAND perspective this year, we think that will effectively represent the majority of the spend that occurs in this segment. Okay. And then, Tim, as many of the DRAM customers are saying that they plan to shift a bit more towards HVM from DDR. Does that have any positive or negative influence on your CSBG and the spares business? No, I don't -- I can't quite make that connection right now. I'm off to give us some thought. But clearly, we see an impact on our systems business, as I mentioned, where we're having to add the specific HVM related especially advanced packaging steps related to the stacking of HVM itself. And we're seeing significant growth in that area. But -- and so with that, given we're shipping additional systems, there is some incremental spares business and services business that goes along with that. But the systems portion of that kind outweighs from a dollars perspective. I guess maybe just to clarify, does your CSBG business start to kind of grow consistent with the growth in your tools business overall? Or do you think there is going to be a lag factor because it slowed down later? Does it start to regrow later also? Depends on the rate of growth in WFE to be perfectly frank, that are coming. See, spare service upgrades chug along, and we think that's going to benefit as utilization and whatnot begins to come back. Then to really answer your question, you got to go figure out what you think the pace of WFE growth is. I'm not going to put numbers on that right now. We're going to kind of wait and see. The next question is from Krish Sankar with CDT Cowen. First of all, for Doug. I think Doug has mentioned about a gradual recovery in WFE this year, kind of more back half rated. So I'm kind of curious, and Doug, I'm not looking for like guidance. What I'm just wondering is, is this better assume Lam's revenues in the calendar second half of 2024 is going to be better than first half? That's for my first question and then I have a follow-up. You're a little bit muffled, Krish, but I think you were asking about our performance along with WFE. And frankly, I think we will mirror whatever the trajectory of WFE looks like with an expectation that etch and dep outgrows to a certain extent. I think I answered your question, although you were a little bit muffled there. Doug, I was just trying to wonder if calendar second half '24 revenue for Lam is going to be better than calendar first half similar to WFE? Yes, I think it will be, Krish, I'm not going to put numbers on it yet, but we will mirror what goes on with WFE. Got it. Got it. Okay. And then my follow-up is for Tim and Doug. You spoke about HBM and AI and all the good stuff. I'm just wondering does HBM and DDR5, 2 sets for dep and etch differ from DDR4 and Legacy in a way, is it more like [indiscernible] from a margin standpoint? Or does it -- is it like a mutual standpoint? I guess what I'd say, Krish, from a margin standpoint, you shouldn't think about any differential margin necessarily. The incremental piece for the stuff that goes in high-bandwidth memory is a bigger die, you know that. The die itself, building a DDR5 die is largely the same equipment that builds DDR5 that doesn't go into HBM. The incremental stuff comes when you go into the advanced packaging stuff, the Syndion deep silicon etch and the electroplating are areas where we are extraordinarily strong in addition to some other things. That is clearly incremental equipment. Yes. And I think from an etch and dep intensity perspective, in general, I think you mentioned DDR5 to DD -- DDR4 to DDR5. I mean I think in general, with each technology node evolution, whether it's DRAM, NAND, Foundry Logic, we've said etch and dep intensity rises with technology advancement. And so I think you can imagine that there's more equipment being needed, and that's in addition to the fact that larger die sizes drive greater equipment per bid out. So there's a lot of factors that every time we move forward, there's more equipment and more Lam equipment required with those technology nodes. The next question is from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. If I can ask about your DRAM systems revenues in the December quarter. They were kind of back to the highs of a couple of years ago, but I know you had some China in there, I think there's some of the events packaging. Can you just give us a sense for what's kind of core DRAM within that? And then you're pretty constructive on where that's going. Can you give us a sense of the dynamics of China going forward versus other regions and other parts of DRAM? I guess, Joe, I would just to take you back to what I had in my script. Two things are driving the strength in DRAM in the December quarter, and you mentioned both of them, frankly. It's high bandwidth memory in DDR5. In addition to the fact that we've got a China customer in DRAM in the second half of the year. That includes September and December, that wasn't in the first half. So each of those things contribute to the strength you saw in December. Okay. And then looking forward, it seemed like you had more than 6 months of demand from that China customer in the second half going forward. Does that come down, but core DRAM comes up and HVM comes up? Probably. The next question is from Brian Chin with Stifel. Maybe going back to NAND, the best ever quarter for NAND spending was probably higher than the total level of NAND spending maybe for all of last year. And so even if it's off a low base, isn't it pretty logical that NAND WFE should exhibit the largest or highest rate of improvement in '24? I wouldn't necessarily draw that conclusion, Brian. I think all we're going to tell you is that I think every segment WFE grows this year, NAND, DRAM, Foundry, Logic, it's all up to a certain extent. I'm not going to get into the business of quantifying each individual one because frankly, at the end of the day, we'll get it wrong. But I think everything will grow to a certain extent with peers. Okay. Fair enough. And then just to kind of level set and DRAM and then also looking forward. How much did DRAM industry spending actually declined in '23? It seems to be better than what was initially thought based on HBM, et cetera. And also, can you give us a sense of the number of wafer starts or percent of the DRAM installed base that could be converted to more advanced 1-alpha or 1-beta like process nodes this year? I guess, Brian, what I'd say and Tim, I think had this in his script, memory overall was down roughly 40%. NAND was down north of 70%. The differential to get to the number is DRAM. You can do that. And yes, I think the second part of your question, HBM and DDR5 has been a big part of the strength in DRAM. Yes. Okay. And that was actually the second part was kind of more towards, what is the potential number of wafer starts or the percent of the installed base that's sort of game for those conversions to 1-alpha, 1-beta light nodes? For the most part, in memory, everything gets upgraded to the next node, all of it. That's always been the case. It's not a new phenomenon. The next question is from Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. The question is on delivery times. And you had mentioned, obviously, your delivery times may be different than some others in the industry. Where do they sit right now? And as a consequence, how much visibility do your customers need to give you? And with that, when we start to see some stronger perhaps memory spending, how quickly will you be able to react to that and turn that for revenue? Yes. So we don't obviously publicly telegraph our lead times. But we had talked about the fact that during the COVID pandemic, our lead times due to supply chain shortages, it stretched out quite long. And those have now come back to a much more normalized level, although they still are such that for us to make shipments within this year, we would have to know about those orders and that forecast pretty quickly. The one thing that's helped is I talked about our investments in new manufacturing and supply chain operations within our customer ecosystems. That's putting us much closer, it's diversifying our supplier base and I think it's going to -- through this next upturn make us much more responsive to customer needs.
So really, we worry less about lead time and more about our ability to respond in the time frame, which our customers need to place orders to meet their ramps. We tend not to be -- we tend not to be in the bottleneck, let's put it that way in terms of a lead time perspective, planning a new fab. Fair enough. As a follow-up question, I wanted to ask about backside power. And last quarter, you made some disclosures about the revenue impact to Lam as that happened. Could you give a little more color on that and specifically, we know that the different customers are having different implementations of backside power. At what point does that start to become a meaningful driver for Lam? I think given the important role that both etch and deposition play in that and our strong position in parts of the backside power process like copper plating where some of those layers are becoming quite thick and therefore the processes become longer. It's -- I would say, going to very rapidly become quite meaningful for the company. And again, it's just a further demonstration of how going 3D and essentially using those -- using etch and deposition to create more complex architectures allows you to reduce power, improve chip performance and also reduce cost. And we talked about it in the sense of backside power. You're seeing the same thing with chip stacking and HBM and energy integration. And that's why I said, I think the next era of semiconductor is characterized by all of these more unique 3D architectures. They're all good for the types of products we sell. Operator, we have time for one more question. And that question comes from Thomas O'Malley with Barclays. I was curious if you guys had a view on the HBM market. Clearly, with the accelerator market growing as quickly as some think. There's concerns that the HBM market may actually be shipping above peak in '24 and '25. Do you guys have a view internally on just how fast HBM is growing as a market segment? And just -- could you just give us the perspective of when you look at an acceleration of a tool road map with a customer on HBM. How much of that has pulled in, in the last 6 months from what you would typically see from a DRAM customer when they're looking for a tool? Well, I think that as a real key supplier into the HBM market, as I mentioned, the strong position we have in the processes required before the stacking, this is an area where we're seeing very, very strong demand. I think that whether or not at some point, it's shipping above peak, I think that this AI market is continuing to evolve at a very, very fast rate. And all we're focused on right now is ensuring we are building out our own capacity and capabilities. And ensuring that we maintain that technology leadership that's allowing us to hold 100% market share of the TSV formation in HBM. And so really, that's our focus is hold the position and let the market grow as fast as the market grows. Helpful. And then just one on the makeup of inventory. You guys have talked about working down inventory throughout the year. Is there any color you can give us on the makeup of that inventory? Is it more memory related or foundry logic related? I know you don't want to give specifics, but just where do you see that inventory coming down through the first half of the calendar year? Yes, Tom, it's -- the rate of decline in memory as we went into '23 was pretty dramatic, and we ended up taking more inventory than we needed specifically for memory. So there's a bigger component of it targeted at memory and as memory recovers, the inventory will come down. Thanks for the question. This concludes our question-and-answer session, and the conference has also now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

And with that, I'll hand the call over to Tim. Thanks, Ram, and thank you to everyone joining us today. Lam is off to a strong start in calendar 2024, with revenues, profitability and earnings per share for the March quarter, all exceeding the midpoint of our guidance. These results as well as our outlook for the June quarter point to Lam's solid execution in an industry environment that is progressing much as we predicted in our January call.
Today, we see industry WFE spending for calendar 2024 in the low to mid-$90 billion range, with the modest increase from our prior view, driven mainly by additional lithography shipments in China. We see no meaningful change to our outlook for Lam's overall 2024 revenue profile. From an industry perspective, DRAM remains strong with WFE spending driven by growing demand for high-bandwidth memory, and sustained investment in domestic China.
In foundry logic, growth in leading-edge spending this year is being partially offset by a decline in mature node spending outside of domestic China. Domestic China spending is running higher than we had previously expected. However, we still see it being first half weighted with Lam's revenue contribution from China declining as the year progresses.
In NAND, we continue to expect year-on-year growth in WFE spending in calendar 2024. Encouragingly, we have seen an uptick in fab utilization. And in the March quarter, this has translated into double-digit percent growth quarter-over-quarter in our spares revenues. As supply and demand continues to normalize through the remainder of the year, we see a strong setup of developing for 2025 NAND spending.
As we move toward a broader WFE recovery, Lam stands to benefit from powerful secular drivers of semiconductor growth and innovation. Generative AI and other emerging smart applications are built on a foundation of semiconductor technology and are expected to deliver trillions of dollars of economic benefit at a global level over the next decade. AI's transformative use cases, foreseen in both consumer and enterprise markets are only in the early stages of realization, and we believe that significant investment in semiconductor manufacturing capacity will be required to satisfy the coming demand for advanced compute, memory and storage.
In this environment, the winners will be the equipment companies that can accelerate the pace of technology advancement, while at the same time, deliver innovations that disrupt the rising cost and complexity of semiconductor fabrication. To this end, Lam is investing in 2 differentiated approaches: first, we are putting more capabilities and resources close to our customers to strengthen collaboration; and second, we are leveraging Lam's proprietary semi versus solutions, digital twin capabilities to reduce the time and cost of technology development.
Already, we are seeing Lam's distributed R&D footprint having a positive effect. In the past quarter, we've used our customer-centric lab investments in Korea, Taiwan and the U.S. to accelerate cycles of learning on new applications. resulting in important wins for Lam in both DRAM and foundry logic advanced packaging.
With respect to Semiverse solutions, we leverage a portfolio of digital twins created at the scale of the device the process and the reactor to model complex interactions that influence tool performance and productivity. Lam's engineers now regularly use these capabilities to optimize multidimensional etch and deposition process recipes faster and with less on-tool wafer experimentation.
Turning to demand related to AI. The early impact has been most prominent in DRAM and foundry logic. We believe, however, that AI's impact on storage is still ahead and represents a key vector of long-term growth for our NAND business. More advanced AI applications need faster, more power-efficient and higher-density NAND storage. NAND-based enterprise solid-state drives or eSSDs, are 50x faster in read right capability, 2 to 5x more power efficient and use 50% less space at the system level compared to hard disk drives or HDDs.
Today, over 80% of enterprise data is stored on HDDs. And we expect this mix to shift in favor of SSDs as NAND capability and cost continues to improve. This is where Lam is playing a key role by enabling technologies, which are critical for both performance and cost scaling. In deposition, for example, Lam is leading the transition from tungsten to molybdenum in the word line to improve device access time and reduce stack height per storage cell.
In etch, Lam is using high aspect ratio cryogenic etch to enhance productivity of memory hole formation. Today, we are approaching 1,000 [ cryo-etched  ]chambers in our high-volume manufacturing installed base. In partnership with our customers, we're using the tremendous amount of data coming from this installed base to rapidly improve technology and cost at each successive layer transition in NAND. Recently, we combined the learning from the installed base with the capabilities of our semi verse solutions simulation tools to further strengthen our differentiation. As a result of our accelerated innovation we have defended every NAND high aspect ratio memory hole etch production decision made so far by customers.
With respect to DRAM, AI servers use high-bandwidth memory or HBM to increase read right speed and reduce server power consumption. HBM stacks multiple DRAM dies using TSVs enabling 15x more data throughput than standard DRAM. However, HBM also requires an approximately threefold increase in wafers per bit compared to conventional memory. With this in mind, it's important that our SABRE 3D and Syndion tools not only provide best-in-class plating and etch capabilities, but also deliver industry-leading throughput and productivity to keep overall costs low for our customers. We are the leading player in TSV applications for HBM and expect our HPM related shipments to grow more than 3x in calendar year 2024.
Finally, on the foundry logic side. Lam tools, including selective etch and ALD, are well positioned to help enable the move from FinFET to gate all around, a key transition needed to improve transistor performance per watt by 15% to 20%. We see our shipments for gate all around nodes in calendar year 2024, exceeding $1 billion. Lam tools are also enabling foundry logic inflections such as backside power delivery, molybdenum interconnects and [ dry photoresist ] processes for EUV patterning. Our traction with customers is strong on these inflections. And together, they represent a multibillion-dollar growth opportunity for Lam as AI drives a greater need for faster, more power-efficient devices.
To conclude, the proliferation of AI, the global push for localized chip manufacturing capacity and the ubiquity of semiconductors in new consumer and commercial products represent powerful secular drivers for Lam and the rest of the semiconductor equipment industry in the years ahead. We are pleased with the company's execution and our results in the March quarter, and remain focused on our opportunity to outperform through this next leg of industry growth.
Thank you, and I'll now turn it over to Doug. Thanks, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you all for joining our call today during what I know is a busy earnings season.
We delivered solid results in the March 2024 quarter. Our March quarter results came in over the midpoint of our guidance ranges for all financial metrics. I'm pleased with the company's continued robust execution. We achieved the highest gross margin percentage since the merging of Lam with [ Novellus ]. We also continue to generate very strong free cash flow of $1.3 billion or 34% of revenue.
Let's dive into the details of our March quarter results. Revenue for the March quarter was $3.79 billion, which was roughly flat with the prior quarter. Our deferred revenue balance at the end of the quarter was $1.75 billion, which was a decrease of $182 million from the December quarter related to revenue recognized that was tied to those customer advanced payments. I believe deferred revenue will continue to trend downwards as we continue throughout the year.
From a segment perspective, March quarter, systems revenue in memory was 44%, which is a decrease from the prior quarter level of 48%. The decline in the Memory segment was attributable to DRAM coming in at -- excuse me, 23% of systems revenue versus the 31% that we saw in the December quarter. DRAM spending was focused on the 1-[ light ], 1-alpha and 1-beta nodes, spending largely driven by DDR5 and high-bandwidth memory enablement. As we noted in the last quarter, nonvolatile memory WFE is increasing in 2024 and but it remained at a subdued level on a mix basis for the March quarter. This segment represented 21% of our systems revenue, up from 17% in the prior quarter.
I do just want to mention one thing. We are characterizing 1 customer's investment in specialty DRAM as a nonvolatile investment since it has a nonvolatile component to the device. This might be different than what others in the industry are doing. NAND investment was driven by very modest spending in conversions to 2xx and 3xx layer devices. The Foundry segment represented 44% of our systems revenue, a slight increase from the percentage concentration in the December quarter of 38%. Growth was driven predominantly by domestic China shipments. And finally, the [indiscernible] and Other segment were 12% of our systems revenue in the March quarter, down from the prior quarter level of 14%. The decline was driven by continued mature node softness.
Now I'll discuss the regional composition of our total revenue. The China region came in at 42% and up slightly from 40% in the prior quarter. While most of our China revenue continued to be from domestic Chinese customers. This was the largest quarter for multinational spending in China since mid last year. We expect spending from this region to increase year-over-year in 2024. I believe it will, however, decline as we go through the year.
Our next largest geographic concentration was Korea at 24% of revenue in the March quarter versus 19% in the December quarter. Japan and Taiwan rounded out the remainder of the top 4 regions. Our Customer Support Business Group generated revenue in the March quarter totaling approximately $1.4 billion. This was down 4% from the December quarter and 13% lower than the March quarter and calendar year 2023.
Our Reliance Systems revenue decreased in the March quarter due to continued weakness in mature node investments, partially offset by a higher level of spares. Reliant is at the lowest revenue level in the last 2 years and spares is at the highest revenue level since the end of 2022. The spares business is seeing very early signs of positive impact from utilization increases from our customers.
Turning to the gross margin performance. The March quarter came in at 48.7%, above the midpoint of our guided range and above the December quarter level of 47.6%. The increase was primarily a result of favorable changes in product and customer mix as well as improved factory efficiencies. March quarter operating expenses were $698 million, up from the prior quarter amount of $662 million. This was due in part to expenses incurred for an extra week in the quarter I'll remind you, it was a 14-week quarter as well as our conscious growth in R&D spending.
As Tim mentioned, we remain laser-focused on investing in R&D to extend our product and competitive differentiation. R&D as a percentage of spending was at a high watermark coming in at 71% of total spending. Operating margin for the current quarter was 30.3% and in line with the December quarter level of 30% and at the high end of our guidance range. This was primarily because of the strong gross margin performance, which was somewhat offset by the growth in R&D investment. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 11.7%, consistent with our expectations.
Looking further into calendar 2024, we continue to believe the tax rate will be in the low to mid-teens, with some possible fluctuations quarter-by-quarter. Other income and expense for the March quarter came in at $10 million in income compared with $5 million in income in the December quarter. The increase in OI&E was due to higher cash balances and higher interest rates. OI&E will be subject to market-related fluctuations that could cause some level of volatility quarter-by-quarter.
On the capital return side of things, we allocated approximately $860 million to share repurchases, and we paid $263 million in dividends in the March quarter. Our share repurchase activity included both open market repurchases as well as an accelerated share repurchase arrangement. The ASRs continued to execute into the month of April. And I would just mention, we continue to track towards our long-term capital return plans of returning 75% to 100% of our free cash flow.
March quarter diluted earnings per share was $7.79 towards the higher end of our guided range. The diluted share count was 132 million shares on track with expectations and down from the December quarter. We have $1.2 billion remaining on our Board-authorized share repurchase plan.
Let me pivot to the balance sheet. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the March quarter totaled $5.7 billion, up a little bit from $5.6 billion at the end of the December quarter. The increase was largely due to collections with an extra week in the March quarter, offset by cash allocated to share buyback, dividend payments and capital expenditures. Days sales outstanding was 57 days in the March quarter, a decrease from 66 days in the December quarter. Inventory at the end of the March quarter totaled $4.3 billion down $107 million from the December quarter level. Inventory turns remained flat from the prior quarter level at 1.8x. We are making progress in bringing inventory levels down, and we will continue to work on this throughout calendar 2024.
Noncash expenses for the March quarter included approximately $77 million in equity compensation, $75 million in depreciation and $15 million in amortization. Capital expenditures in the March quarter were $104 million, down $12 million from the December quarter. Spending was primarily centered on lab expansions in the United States and Asia supporting our global strategy to be close to our customers' development locations. We ended the March quarter with approximately 17,200 regular full-time employees, which was flat with the prior quarter.
Let's now turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the June 2024 quarter. We're expecting revenue of $3.8 billion, plus or minus $300 million, gross margin of 47.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. This gross margin decline from March is reflective of a quarter-to-quarter change in customer mix. Operating margins of 29.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. This reflects our continued commitment to prioritize R&D spending. And finally, earnings per share of $7.50 plus or minus $0.75 based on a share count of approximately 131 million shares.
So let me wrap up. 2024 is a year of continued transformation for Lam Research. We're investing in our long-term strategy to expand our technology leadership and operational excellence while efficiently managing overall spending. We're encouraged that the long-term drivers of semiconductor growth such as artificial intelligence, are seeing accelerated adoption and we expect Lam to be a strong beneficiary of these trends. We're well positioned for the architectural and material change coming, such as gate all around, advanced packaging, backside power delivery, and the move to drive photoresist.
Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. Tim and I would now like to open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Krish Sankar from TD Cowen. First one for Tim. Tim, a question on high aspect ratio for NAND, where you have a very high market share. And you said in your prepared comments, you defended market share there. your company that [indiscernible] introduced a cryo etch product a year ago, but you also have 1 from 3 years ago. So I'm kind of curious, can you talk a little bit about the market share dynamics and high aspect issue [indiscernible]? And the fact that some of your customers are talking about using cryo etch for like 430 layer NAND. So can you give us some color there on high aspect ratio etch? And then I have a follow-up for Doug. Sure. Krish, on cryo etch, had a couple of data points in my prepared remarks. But one is we have an installed base of cryo etch tools used for NAND that's now approaching 1,000 chambers. So obviously, we've been in high-volume production with this application for quite some time. And my comment was that there always are customers exploring different options during the development phase.
But as my comment is, these are very complex processes to put into high-volume production. And so we continue to leverage the learning that we get working with our customers, the focus on technology extension and manufacturing readiness. And by that focus, we've been able to defend the decisions once they come to that point of the customer really having to decide which tool to commit their next fabrication line, too. And so that's all we can say is we're working hard to make sure we have the best tool for the application. And so far, it's winning the day. Got it. Got it. So good to hear that the share is still solid. And then a follow-up for Doug on margins. Doug, you kind of mentioned about the gross margin, maybe moderation in the June quarter due to the customer mix. Is that mainly a function of China? And how to think about gross margins in the second half? And maybe if I can extend that question how to think about OpEx into the back half of the year? Yes. Krish, I guess I'd say a couple of things. First, gross margin sometimes it's a little bit better when we're selling to smaller customers, and I'm not going to pin it to any one geographic region necessarily. But in China, there are some smaller customers, and they tend to because we have volume purchase pricing sometimes, they pay a little bit more. And -- but it's not because of a geographic regions, it's because of the size of the customer. So that's one thing to think about. And in my scripted remarks as well as what Tim said is we think that the China region will modulate a little bit as we go through the year. So that's part of what we need to think about. And I've been talking about this for a couple of quarters. So anyway, I have that in mind when you're updating your models.
Second, we've been talking, I think, for a couple of quarters now, maybe actually 3 quarters about the need to grow R&D investment this year because of these technology changes that we see like at all around, backside power, advanced packaging and so forth, dry [indiscernible] resist. And we're absolutely planning on doing that. You saw that in the March quarter, R&D as a percent of total spending was the highest that I have seen here at 71%, and we intend to keep investing in R&D. So independent of whatever the top line is, we're going to grow R&D investment this year. Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri from UBS. So I wanted to ask about China. So it's going to modulate through the year, the mix, but it sounds like it's still going to be up year-over-year for domestic China this year. So I guess my question is, we've seen some headlines on a few entities being potentially added to the entity list. And I'm wondering if these comments reflect the potential addition of these entities? Or does it basically say, hey, if the status quo remains, this is what your assumption is, meaning that if there were entities added that, that would be downside to these comments? Yes. Tim, I mean, obviously, we can't forecast changes in U.S. trade policy with respect to China that we don't know about. And so we're basically giving you our best view of what we think our China business will be through the rest of the year and recognizing that there could be changes that we don't foresee. Well, what I will say is we -- obviously, we've built up what we believe is a strong government affairs team were plugged into all the relevant discussions. And I think over the last couple of years, you've seen we have a pretty strong track record of working with the U.S. government responding to export control policy, and that's just what we plan to do going on into the future. Sure. And Doug, I just wanted to ask about service a bit. So there's much different dynamics happening in the spares and in the Reliant business. Can you talk about that because it certainly sounds -- I mean, this is kind of an odd situation that we'd have spares piece so strong and Reliant piece so weak. So can you sort of give us any read-throughs there? Like what does that mean for the future of that business? Yes. Listen, I think it's well understood right now that you've got 2 dynamics going on relative to thinking about the different components of CSBG. First, industry utilization is starting to get somewhat better. I would definitely say it's early days for that. But the reason I specifically talked about the spares level versus where it's been over the last couple of years is because of that. That clearly is beginning to show up in our spares business.
However, when we rate CSBG in total, we were down now because of the softness in Reliant. I also think that's pretty well understood in the industry, right? Mature note investment outside of the China region certainly is pretty soft right now. And so you have those 2 competing dynamics going on that's shown up in the CSBG line. If I was guessing, Tim, right now, CSBG is probably flattish this year from last year because of those 2 offsetting dynamics if that helps you think about it. I think the only thing I would add there is, I mean, when you think about the CSBG business a little bit longer term, I mean, clearly, we commented on utilization starting to tick up. But as we move into 2025, I think we also will see significant upgrade activity coming back in, especially in the NAND space. We've talked about the fact that there is a large portion of that installed base that has not yet been moved towards the technology nodes that are most useful for our customers. And so I think that will also flow through into the CSBG business in perhaps not so much this year, but clearly, as we move into '25 and beyond. Our next question comes from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. With an accelerated compute and AI semiconductor segment of the market, there still seems to be a lot of constraints centered around high bandwidth memory and tightness in [indiscernible] packaging. Obviously, you guys have a very strong position here, as you mentioned, Tim. You guys previously talked about this business, this opportunity as being potentially like $1 billion per year type of revenue opportunity. But just given the strong demand pull and some of the expanding use cases, I mean, is the Lam team already on track to drive $1 billion plus in advanced packaging revenues this year? And now that the trends are in place, right, what's kind of your new or maybe revised view on the revenue opportunity here for the team over the next few years? Yes, Harlan, I think that you're right, there is strong pull in. I mean, obviously, we're responding as quickly as we can to the demand. Our advanced packaging shipments this year will be over $1 billion. And so that's kind of an important milestone for us. I don't know how to give you like that next milestone. Obviously, we're seeing tremendous growth in demand in this area. Our positions are strong, not only as you said, in the foundry logic side of advanced packaging, but also as we talked specifically by our very strong positions in HBM related to what we do on the packaging side of HBM.
And so I think it's just an area where we'll see good long-term growth we are investing again in this area. We've talked in the past about our work in the panel processing space trying to look ahead to see where the packaging market is going to go to make sure that we are fully capable of taking advantage of what we see is a real long-term secular driver for semiconductors and the equipment industry. Congratulations on hitting that milestone. For my follow-up question, with your customers and their spending outlooks looking more constructive as cycle dynamics continue to improve, you've got strong tailwinds on manufacturing complexity trends like the growth outlook that is quite solid, right, for the team. So if I look out beyond this year and the ramp of your new Malaysia manufacturing facility, I mean, not only is it low-cost geography, like you guys have mentioned, but you've got highly skilled workforce. You also set up the supply chain support infrastructure locally as well. So I don't know if it's for Tim or Doug, but is there any way to think about the incremental gross margin benefit on incremental revenues that flow out of the Malaysia factory as you start to load it? Let me take the first part of it, and then I'll let Doug talk specifically about the gross margin comment. I think it's one thing that I think we're feeling very comfortable with, which is your last question was, boy, there must be a lot of demand in you've got to be ramping up for that. I think as we come into this next up cycle, we feel very well positioned relative to all the things you just talked about, the physical capacity, the trained workforce. The supply chain has been built up and made more resilience since the last big upturn in the industry where we saw lots of constraints. And so I think from that standpoint, we feel really good that we have executed on the operations side of the house. Now we just need to start seeing the kinds of new peak volumes that will demonstrate that externally. And I'll let Doug address your gross margin question. Yes, Harlan. I guess, I'll just remind you what I've said in prior quarters, which is I don't want you to run ahead of that financial model we put out in 2020. That's still the right way to think about it. Now obviously, right now, we've got quite favorable customer mix. I don't expect that to continue. I don't know, maybe I'm wrong about that but the benefit from Malaysia after we came through the inflationary stuff and whatnot, was completely how we intend to get back to the gross margin and better than that financial model maybe we can push a little higher. Certainly, we're not going to stop staying focused on that. But that's the way to think about it is Malaysia is still into the future. It will show up when we ramp incremental volumes, and we're ready for that. Our next question comes from Srini Pajjuri from Raymond James. Doug, I think on the China side, just one clarification. Were you expecting China to moderate in this quarter? Did it come in better than you expected? And then just to go back to your comment about China moderation through the rest of the year. Any particular segment within China? I mean, is it DRAM? Or is it logic? Or is it both? If you can add some color to that, that would be helpful. Yes, Srini. It came in pretty much as we expected. I suggested last quarter that it was going to continue to remain pretty good in March. So no, that was pretty much as we expected. And I don't know, like at a segment level that I've got any specific color for you relative to the China slowing a little bit in the second half. There's such a broad set of customers there that are in every segment. It's in DRAM, it's in foundry, it's in logic. And it's a broad set. So when we look at that in total, I do see it somewhat weighted here to the early part of the year, and it will modulate somewhat. But nothing specific I had to share with you from a segment standpoint. And then maybe for Tim, Tim. Some of your large customers got a pretty good amount of subsidies from the government recently on the chips Act and other stuff outside of the U.S. as well. So I'm just wondering what sort of impact should we expect in terms of your own business as I guess, that money comes in? And any, I guess, thoughts on the timing of potential orders from this incremental funding that they're getting? Yes. I mean, obviously, you've seen in just even the last few weeks, quite a few announcements about the [ TPSAC ] grants in the U.S. I'll also note that there are similar chips programs going on in places like Japan and obviously, a little bit further in the future in Europe and elsewhere. And so we've always said these are more of a 25, 26, 27 time frame for -- from the equipment side, especially the shorter lead time tools like we provide. So you see the fab coming up a lot of construction connectivity, you see long lead time tools go in. And then we know that our time will come. I mean -- and so I think it's still a '25, '26, '27 opportunity for us.
But the important thing is, while that's a lot of extra money maybe what's really exciting about is most of that is targeted towards to the leading-edge nodes. And one thing about Lam's story is that we have focused a lot of R&D investment to build our position in leading-edge foundry logic. In the next generations of DRAM and high-bandwidth memory as well as, of course, continuing our strength demand. And so as we see these new fabs come up, I mean, it's not only additional spending, but it's at nodes where we believe that we will actually do better from a SAM and market share perspective. And so we're patiently waiting. But we know it's going to come. You can go visit the sites, the fab buildings are there, and they're feverishly working to get them ready for equipment. Our next question comes from CJ Muse from Cancer Fitzgerald. I guess first question, I wanted to try to get a little bit more color on your updated WFE outlook. It looks like you're taking it up by about billion. You talked about that being really litho, not impacting you. So I guess should we infer from that, that you're still expecting WFE up kind of low to mid-single digits? And as part of that, how are you thinking about those 4 large drivers, particularly, I guess, 2 or 3 of them and the growth potential there and the relative outperformance that you expect to see? Yes, CJ, I mean, obviously, one of our peers in the industry reported last week, we took a look at it and just have a view that we missed a little bit of what was shipping into China. That is the vast majority, if not all, of the change in WFE from our point of view. There's always some moving pieces and DRAMs maybe a little stronger, trailing [etch] foundry logic is probably a little bit softer. But at the end of the day, the biggest change that we saw was -- let we just -- we missed it a little bit because it's not part of our addressable market.
I'm not sure I caught all of your -- the second part of your question, CJ. Try it one more time. Just as you think about those $1 billion-plus opportunities, particularly around advanced packaging and I guess, including HBM within that and also get all around how you think you'll fare relative to WFE in '24? Yes. I think given the mix we see in some of these technology transitions, it should be incrementally better than it was last year for sure. And then just as a quick second question, I guess, third question, if I could sneak it in. You talked about normalization of China into the second half. And getting back to maybe a 46%-ish type of normalized gross margin. It sounds like China, in your mind today is better. So I guess, what would that number be if that continues to be strong for you guys? I guess, CJ, you got to just kind of look at where we've been, right? You're absolutely right, and thanks for mentioning the 46%. That's sort of where gross margin was after we had done some of the Malaysia stuff and before China popped up with those smaller customers. And so the fact that we're above that level is largely customer mix. And so that's how you should be thinking about it. And if we have that mix wrong, then margin kind of -- you got a couple of data points in the last couple of quarters that you can kind of solve for to understand what it might look like. It will be in that 46% to 48-plus percent range depending on what the mix looks like. Our next question comes from Atif Malik from Citi. The first one for Tim. Tim, good to see some green shoots in the NAND market. You talked about double-digit far parts growth in the NAND and you also talked about that the AI storage inflection for high-density SSDs is in front of us. But we do not have the 3x wafer per bit offset that you're seeing on the DRAM side. So can you kind of paint for us the trajectory of the NAND improvement that you're expecting in the second half of the next year? We're not going to give you a '25 forecast quite yet. It's way too early for that. It will be better though, right? I mean, it's improving. Yes. Well, I guess without giving you exact numbers. I mean, clearly, we all know that the NAND spending has been incredibly weak for the last 12 to 18 months. And so we're in the very early stages of starting to see that recover. And I think if you look at what most of our -- we rely on our customer commentary that they make publicly for a lot of this, but they talk about the fact that maybe 90% of the bits they're shipping are at the leading edge.
But when we look at the installed base of our systems, that was my comment. I believe that there is still going to be a large portion of the installed base that will move forward to the next technology nodes. It's the most efficient way for our customers to to do that is to upgrade what they already have. And I think you'll see that move forward and therefore, NAND WFE move up in '25. But because it comes through a large -- to a large degree, through upgrades, Lam's capture rate of every dollar of WFE spend will be much higher than in a greenfield capacity added.
So when I think about Lam's opportunity to outperform in 2025, in NAND, I think it is obviously with high confidence because of the type of spending we would expect to be seen in 2025. And in the other market segments, it's also pretty high because of the -- as I mentioned, the technology inflections that are occurring. And it stayed all around where we -- this year, we'll actually have over $1 billion of shipments into the gate all around technology nodes. And obviously, as gate all around continues to proliferate, our tools like ALD and selective etch will do better. in backside power delivery. We already talked about advanced packaging and then we obviously have out there in front of us also the work we're doing for dry photoresist processes for EUV. And so I just feel like there are a number of growth drivers for the company besides the one that is the most obvious, which is a NAND recovery in 2025. Great. And then one for Doug. Doug, within your China 42% of sales, you talked about multinational picking up, which came as a positive surprise to me. Can you talk about what's driving that? Are those customers not worried about incremental restrictions? Or are they just trying to upgrade some of the older technology? I think it's just being responsive to the demand they see relative to the capacity that's there. And yes, I said it's the highest level since mid last year. Although I do understand over position it. The vast majority of the spending in China continues to be the indigenous Chinese customer base. But I just observed it as I was going through the numbers and knowing everybody was going to be asking about China, that was something I thought I'd just mentioned. Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. I wanted to ask a question on NAND as well. Tim, in your prepared remarks, you talked about the transition from tungsten to molybdenum potentially happening in the market. I suppose, over the next couple of years. Can you speak to the significance of that in terms of depth intensity and how that could impact your business over the next couple of years? Sure. Well, obviously, any time there's a material change requires a new system, it's an opportunity for Lam to provide that technology into the market. And so it's an important change. I mean we call it moly just because it's so hard to say molybdenum. But the change to moly has some significant device benefits and also I mentioned the important thing in NAND is -- I mean it's important in every element of semiconductor devices, but it's the cost and technology. And so one thing that sometimes lost is part of the transition to moly is also about enabling stack height reduction. So you can go to more layers and limit the stack height in a way that allows you to then have more productive etches, more productive deposition and other things. And so I think it's an important import inflection for the industry and an opportunity for Lam and we're well positioned to win that inflection, we believe. Got it. And then as my follow-up on HBM you talked about your business growing more than 3x year-over-year, I think. And I think that comment was consistent with what you had communicated last quarter. based on sort of the input you have, the market intel you have, what kind of bit growth or market growth in HBM do you think that increase in your business supports in '24? And obviously, demand is very strong, but how are you thinking about supply/demand from your perspective exiting the year and into '25 in HBM? Toshiya, maybe I'll get it to try. I mean when you look at overall bit demand, HBM was probably a 0.22% of it, although it's growing and adding to the broad market. But it's clearly requiring incremental investment of our SABRE 3D tool, our deep silicon etch tool. And I think it's something you're going to hear us talking about for many years to come. This form factor is going to continue to be important relative to AI enablement and feeding the GPU, the data that it needs, small today but growing quite rapidly. Our next question comes from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. I wanted to follow up. You had mentioned that there was a customer that you're classifying as NAND that others might be classifying as DRAM. I just wanted to double click on that, if you could talk to what's going on there. Is that customer sort of doing both and people just have different classifications. Should we be thinking that there's more NAND capacity coming on in China than I had thought before? Can you just talk to that change? I guess all I'd say, Joe, is sometimes there could be a little bit of confusion. And I felt that as I was talking to people over the last quarter. So the reason I said it was, it's actually a nonvolatile device. It's got nonvolatile components. And early on, because of that, and we put everything into nonvolatile memory. So nonvolatile memory is more than NAND. This isn't an enormous number but as big enough that I want people to hear us tell you where it is and you can go think about it. And you probably know who the customer is. I'm not going to disclose it here, but it is 1 customer in specialty DRAM. Got it. And then on the Reliant business, can you talk about changes in that business as we sort of move into a lower level of utilization in trailing edge nodes. Do you see that kind of returning to more of a refurbished tools business, where there's stuff that you're able to actually refurbish? And any ramifications we should think about for profitability there? Yes. I guess I'll just comment on -- we haven't -- I would be surprised if we move back towards a customer's divesting of equipment from fabs and us being able to refurbish those tools. I think you could see, obviously, the ebbs and flows with demand of how many new tools we ship, but I think I think it still remains mostly as a new tool, trailing-edge known business for us. Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Doug, I wanted to go back to something you just mentioned here around the relative capital intensity of upgrades versus greenfield investments for NAND as you get into '25. And I get the idea that you should take a larger share of upgrades. But am I thinking about this wrong? Like wouldn't be the absolute amount of WFE in an upgrade driven cycle to be a lot lower than if it was in the greenfield cycle? Like how do I think about the puts and takes of those 2 variables in the context of NAND growth into 2025? Sure, Stacy, I'll take that. I was actually the one that -- this is Tim. He said he needs to comment. Yes, no problem. I just wanted to own it in case you disagree, but it's -- I think you're thinking about it exactly right. I mean the reason upgrades are so attractive for customers is the total WFE spend is lower. That's why they upgrade the installed base. And so for my -- comment was specifically about Lam's outperformance relative to whatever WFE is for the industry next year. And so in an upgrade heavy cycle, which obviously we haven't had for the last 2 years, in that next cycle of NAND upgrades, we're saying we would capture a higher percentage of whatever that WFE is.
Now we've said in the past that Lam's opportunity actually because of that much higher capture rate, is not so different in terms of revenue for every bit added through an upgrade versus a greenfield. So WFE comes down, that's why it's attractive for customers. But for Lam, we capture almost the same amount of revenue because of the much higher capture rate. And so it kind of goes both ways. So you're indifferent to like an upgrade cycle versus a greenfield cycle? Well, I would say the only thing I would say is because there's been lots of questions about whether Lam's market share and defense and others, we're not quite indifferent because the power of the installed base is that, again, when the customers preferred path is to upgrade what they already have, means that the positions don't change. And so Lam's very strong position carries forward in that case. So agnostic from a financial perspective, but obviously, our position in the industry continues to strengthen through each of those upgrade cycles. Got it. Got it. That's helpful. My follow-up, again, I wanted to go back to the segment expectations in China. So I know this -- I think it was Doug who said you didn't have anything to tell us on segments. But if I look at your slide deck, on Slide 5, I'm -- unless I'm reading it wrong, it does seem to suggest that you see it says sustained investment in domestic China for DRAM in calendar '24 and weakness in foundry logic. So is that actually what you're expecting, the China degradation in foundry logic and DRAM sustaining? Or is this slide -- am I just reading the slide wrong? Yes. No. Stacy, you kind of have 1 customer in China DRAM. So I got to be careful talking about that. China is going to modulate through the year, right? It's not going to stay at 42% is the statement that I made, and it's going to modulate in every segment, I believe, in the China region. Okay. And the slide says, expect led by HBM's sustained investment in reference to China under DRAM. So that's not what's going to happen? Unfortunately, the slides is not in front of me right ow, Stacy. We're having some technical challenges. It's all going to model in. Slide 5, when you pull it up. Our next question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. I wanted to revisit your comment about spares doubling. How important is that data point? Like what were you expecting instead versus the actual result? And how much does it increase your confidence about NAND recovery? Because you're not really increasing the WFE expectations for this year, right? So on surface, this comment about spares doubling sounds like a very important data point, but I'm not sure how to quite put that in context of what it means for Lam this year. Okay. Well, first, we didn't say spares would double. We said that it was a double-digit percent growth quarter-on-quarter in our spares revenue, so not doubling. But I think that in general, I mean, the way we look at that and why we made that comment. Obviously, it's positive for us to see spares move up. If you think -- go back in our commentary previously about CSBG over the last few years, we've said spares revenue will grow year-on-year because the installed base itself grows. However, through this downturn, the cuts in fab utilization were so severe that we actually saw spares revenue come down, which surprised us a bit.
So maybe to your point of expectations. We knew that as soon as customers started to utilize the fabs and bring some of the tools back online, we would see spares increase. We said that would be the first sign that the end market was really starting to improve. And so the reason we called it out was that obviously, it's -- it further confirms, I think what you're hearing from our customers which is that utilization is starting to improve. It doesn't tie to WFE because utilization of what you have is one issue, when you choose to spend more to either upgrade technology or add capacity as a second decision. We've said that, that is likely still more of a 2025 event on the equipment spend side. But you have to get the first indication, which is utilization improvement, spares improving and then the rest would come. And then the other thing on the call, I believe, Doug, you mentioned CSBG will be flat earlier? Or did I not hear that properly? Or did you mean it sequentially? Or did you mean it for this calendar year because if it is for the calendar year, that implies pretty strong kind of mid-teens growth in the second half. So if you could clarify what you said about CSBG growth and whatever time frame you were referring to? Yes, I said flat-ish, plus or minus flat. And by the way, that's not a new disclosure. We said that last quarter as well. For this calendar year or for... Correct. For this calendar year, yes. Our next question comes from Chris Caso from Wolfe Research. I guess the first question is on DRAM. And could you perhaps talk about some of the moving parts that are going on with that right now? And I think in a previous question, you talked about the China part of DRAM expecting that to moderate through the year. Obviously, the direct revenue from HBM sounds good. But there's a broader capacity question going on in DRAM that's fungible with HBM. Could you talk about what your expectations are for that as the year progresses? Yes. Let me start. I think just to address this one point about the fungibility of capacity. You're correct. Obviously, if you're looking at DDR5, I think we've made a couple of comments in the past though. One, we're talking specifically about the additional tools that are needed to enable HBM. And so that's why we talk about our electroplating and our Syndion silicon etch tools because those are added to whatever capacity you might have for DRAM, you need to add those tools to make HBM possible. And so that's what we're seeing rise by 3x this year.
On the second side, when you add -- when you go from conventional DRAM to HBM, our customers have talked about and the industry has talked about the much larger die size because you've had to create the real estate that's needed to add the TSVs. And so while you may be able to translate some of the same DRAM equipment over to produce the same number of bits, you'll need more of that equipment as well. So there's -- those are the key drivers as you're moving for additional spending growth as you move into HBM DRAM. Got it. As a follow-up, you made in your prepared remarks a comment talking about $1 billion in revenue from gate-all-around this year. Could you talk about that in context of where the overall opportunity is for gate-all-around? Is this -- is that $1 billion represent what you would consider to be gate-all-around capacity? Is that just getting the processes started? Kind of where are we with that gate-all-around ramp? Yes. I mean I think it's -- we're really just starting at gate-all-around. Our comment was $1 billion of shipments into the gate-all-around nodes this year. And it's across all of our types of products that help enable gate-all-around smaller technology nodes. And so what we've said is that every technology node, etch and depth intensity grows and our SAM opportunity expands. And so gate-all-around being an important node where there's need for new tools from Lam like in our selective etch product portfolio or in our ALD product portfolio that might not have existed to the same degree in prior notes. And so that's -- those are the areas where we're seeing growth as well as just growth in the rest of our advanced technology products in [indiscernible].
Operator, we'll take 1 more question. Our next and final question comes from Brian Chin from Stifel. The company has previously discussed an incremental $1 billion to $1.5 billion increased the WFE for every 1% AI server penetration. Last year, given the underutilization of capacity and the focus on conversion activity, maybe the math was lower last year. But now that utilization rates for advanced foundry and DRAM nodes have recovered. Do you see AI growth, I guess, driving spending levels more consistent with that $1 billion to $1.5 billion? And do you already see that maybe playing out to some degree in your order? Yes, Brian, we're not going to talk about order backlog. But the statements we made and you've got it right, which was for every percent that is an AI server versus an enterprise class server because of the 8x DRAM, much bigger logic die, the GPUs and the 3x NAND, did so $1 billion to $1.5 billion incremental WFE. And that's absolutely still how we see it. And -- but you're right, like if things are underutilized, you don't need to spend nearly as much, but that's a temporary situation. Eventually, things get back to being utilized. Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just kind of a follow-up on the last follow-up. But again, of that $1 billion kind of shipment for gate-all-around in 2024 calendar year. How much of that is second half weighted? Is it more kind of pilot production? Or how much is it pilot versus high volume? Yes, we're not going to give color on exactly when we're shipping just because we figure that's more for our customers in terms of their expansion on those nodes. Okay. Fair enough. It's more second half bias. That concludes our remarks, guys. Thanks for joining the call. Ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll conclude today's conference call and presentation.

In the June quarter, Lam delivered another set of solid results with revenues, profitability and earnings per share, all coming in above the midpoint of our guidance. Our CSBG business posted strong growth with revenues up 22% sequentially, led by Reliant and [indiscernible]. On the manufacturing side, we achieved a key milestone in the quarter with our Malaysia factory shipping its 5,000th chamber. This is the fastest ramp of a new manufacturing facility in Lam's history, and we remain on track to achieve our long-term cost reduction goals through an expanded global manufacturing and supply chain footprint.
As previously communicated, 2024 is a year of strategic investment for Lam, where we are prioritizing product development for key technology inflections, global R&D infrastructure close to our customers and digital transformation for operational efficiency at scale. We believe these investments will put Lam in a position to outperform as the industry moves into a period of multiyear WFE spending expansion. Now turning to WFE, we expect this year's spending to be in the mid $90 billion range. Our customer investment profile is generally unchanged from our prior view, apart from slightly stronger domestic China spending and additional demand related to the ramp of high-bandwidth memory or HBM capacity. We see foundry logic, DRAM and NAND investments all up on a year-on-year basis. Global spending on mature node technologies is expected to be roughly flat year-on-year.
Looking ahead to 2025, we see a positive environment for continued growth in WFE spending. The power of AI is a transformative business tool is still yet to be fully realized. Today, the focus on AI model training is driving strong demand for GPUs and HBM. However, as AI use cases expand, we believe inferencing at the edge will spur content growth of low-power DRAM and [indiscernible] storage in enterprise PCs and smartphones. Investments for AI-enabled edge devices play particularly well to Lam's strengths. We anticipate that memory customers looking to scale capacity and lower bid cost will bias WFE spending toward technology upgrades of the installed base.
For NAND, the etch and deposition intensity of upgrades is significantly higher than in a greenfield investment. When you consider Lam's sizable installed base in memory, including roughly 7,500 high aspect ratio dielectric etch chambers for NAND alone, we are positioned to outgrow overall WFE when customers upgrade existing memory production lines to next-generation nodes. Longer term, etch and deposition are set to play an increasingly vital role in the industry's efforts to develop faster, more power efficient and lower-cost semiconductors to serve AI-related applications by delivering critical solutions for atomic level device scaling, new materials innovation and advanced packaging integration, we see tremendous opportunity for Lam to expand our served market and increase our share at each successive process technology node.
To this end, our R&D focus is yielding exciting new products, including this year, our first direct power coupled conductor etch tool with matchless power source and bias, known as Direct Drive. This new power source uses solid-state drivers to stabilize the plasma in the etch chamber 500x faster than current industry standards. By combining direct power coupling with Lam's unique plasma pulsing capabilities, our latest conductor edge systems are delivering best-in-class performance for newly emerging [indiscernible] DRAM applications. In [indiscernible] devices, the nature of the bitline placement requires precise etching of ultra-small high aspect ratio of silicon structures to avoid device shorts or leakage. With direct power coupling and plasma pulsing, Lam connects to vertically oriented [indiscernible] transistor architectures with unprecedented depth uniformity and profile controller. Similarly, conductor etch is becoming a critical enabler for EUV patterning for gate-all-around and DRAM due to the need to reduce [indiscernible] placement error. For nodes below 2 nanometers, the requirement is for roughly 40% tighter control than at 5 nanometers. Our new conductor etch tool delivers a 30% reduction in feature roughness, which is 1 of the main contributors to etch placement error.
In addition, we can achieve 1 to 2 orders of magnitude improvement in defectivity for a given EUV dose, further helping customers reduce the overall cost and improve the capability of the EUV patterning process. Turning to NAND. AI applications are driving demand for faster, higher-capacity enterprise SSDs. NAND makers are pursuing both vertical and lateral scaling of manned arrays as well as increasing bits stored per sell through implementation of QLC and PLC technologies. In support of these efforts, Lam is developing new dielectric etch and deposition capabilities.
Earlier today, we announced Lam Cryo 3.0, Lam's third generation of cryogenic etch technology. Building on our learning from nearly 1,000 cryogenic etch chambers, running in man fabs worldwide. This new patented cryogenic etch process delivers industry-leading control of the NAND memory channel hole profile. When a Lam Cryo 3.0 is deployed on our Vantec system, the etch are delivering the industry's highest available ion energy, we can create a 10-micron deep channel hole that has a top-to-bottom profile deviation of less than 10 nanometers or less than 0.1% relative to its depth. Such tight profile control allows customers to increase bit density by packing more cells per layer while also having the flexibility to add more layers per tier. Lam Cryo 3.0 also addresses our industry's need for more sustainable solutions, delivering a 40% reduction in energy consumption per wafer and a 90% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions per wafer compared to non-cryogenic textures.
Deposition technology is also advancing quickly to support increased bit density and lower cost through multi-tier stacking. Polysilicon and tungsten gap fill materials have typically been used to enable tier stacking in high layer count NAND. Integration of these materials, however, has resulted in poor control of critical dimensions and overlay, negatively impacting yield and performance. Ram's innovative PECVD-based pure carbon and gap fill process provides an attractive alternative material. With the unique combination of high etch selectivity, superior mechanical properties and simplified dry post process removability, it also reduces the number of process steps required in some cases by approximately 50% compared to traditional approaches.
Overall, etch and deposition are becoming increasingly critical to addressing the complex semiconductor requirements of a growing AI environment. We are excited by the breadth of opportunities we see ahead for the company, especially those created by technology inflections to gate all around backside power delivery, advanced packaging and [indiscernible] processing. All of these are etch and deposition intensive and each represents a $1 billion or higher growth opportunity for Lam. We look forward to sharing our progress on these fronts as well as our long-term financial model at our next Investor Day, which we are planning to hold in February 2025. With that, I'll turn it over to Doug. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. We executed well in the June 2024 quarter. Our June quarter results came in above the midpoint or exceeded our guidance ranges for all financial metrics. We were pleased with the company's strong execution. For fiscal year 2024, we achieved the highest gross margin percentage since the merging of Lam with Novelis in 2013, coming in at 48.2% and we generated quite strong free cash flow of approximately $4.3 billion or 29% of revenue. .
Let's look at the details of our June quarter results. Revenue came in at $3.87 billion, which was an increase from the prior quarter and over the midpoint of guidance. Our deferred revenue balance at the end of the quarter was -- or excuse me, $1.55 billion, which is a decrease of $194 million in the March quarter related to revenue recognized that was tied to customer advanced payments. As we sit here today, I believe deferred revenue remains stable at these levels for the foreseeable future.
Let's turn to the revenue segment details. June quarter systems revenue in memory was 36%, which was a decrease from the prior quarter level of 44%. The decline in the memory segment was mainly attributable to DRAM. DRAM came in at 19% of systems revenue compared with 23% in the March quarter as investments in mature nodes declined in the June quarter. DRAM revenue reached a new record in fiscal year 2024 with spending focused on DDR5 and HBM enablement as well as on the 1Y node. Nonvolatile memory came in at 17% of our systems revenue, which was down from the March quarter level of 21%.  And just a reminder, we are characterizing one customer's investment in specialty DRAM as a non-ball investment since it has a nonvolatile component in the device.
Net revenue was at a low point for this year, and I expect NAND investment to gradually improve as utilization rates return to more normal levels, our customers slowly increased spending in conversions to 2xx and 3 XX layer devices into the next year. The Foundry segment represented 43% of our systems revenue, which was roughly flat with the percentage concentration in the March quarter of 44%. Growth in shipments for data all around nodes was offset by a decline in mature node spending. The [indiscernible] and other segment were 21% of system revenue in the June quarter, up from the prior level of 12%. The increase was driven by strength in mature node spending in China.
With respect to the regional composition of our total revenue, the China region came in at 39%, down slightly from the prior quarter level of 42% and a little bit higher than our expectations from the previous earnings call. This was driven by domestic China spending. The next largest geographic concentration was Korea at 18% of revenue in the June quarter, versus 24% in the March quarter. Taiwan was 15% of revenue in the June quarter, which was an increase from 9% in the March quarter. The customer support business group revenue in the June quarter pulled approximately $1.7 billion, an increase of 22% from the prior quarter level and 14% higher than the June quarter and calendar 2023.
CSBG revenue represented 44% of our June quarter revenues and reached the highest point since the end of calendar 2022, driven primarily by an increase in Reliant systems, followed by growth in spares. Our Reliant Systems revenue benefited from strength in domestic China spending for specialty and mature nodes. Spares revenue increased largely due to continued improvement in utilization at our memory customers as well as a little bit of inventory stocking. I do not think CSBG will grow modestly in calendar year 2024.
Let's look at profitability. Our June quarter gross margin came in at 48.5% at the top end of our guided range and slightly down from 48.7% in the March quarter. June quarter gross margin benefited from continued improvement in factory efficiencies, which largely offset the headwind we saw in customer mix that we talked about on the last earnings call. Operating expenses for the June quarter were $689 million, down marginally from the prior quarter amount of $698 million. As Tim mentioned, we continue to prioritize spending in research and development to extend our technology differentiation as well as expand our product portfolio. I'd just point out that more than 70% of our total operating expenses were concentrated in research and development.
The June quarter operating margin was 30.7%, above the guidance range mainly because of that strong gross margin performance. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 11.5%.  We estimate the tax rate for the remainder of the calendar year 2024 to be in the low to mid-teens level, and this rate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. Other income and expense for the June quarter was approximately $19 million in income compared with $10 million in income in the March quarter. The increase in OI&E was primarily the result of fluctuations in the fair value of our venture investments. And as we've talked about in the past, you will see variability in OI&E quarter-to-quarter.
Let's [indiscernible] capital return. We allocated approximately $382 million to share repurchases, and we paid $261 million in dividends in the June quarter. During the quarter, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a $10 billion share repurchase authorization. We have $10.8 billion remaining in the plan at the end of the June quarter. For fiscal year 2024, we returned $3.7 billion or 88% of free cash flow, which was in line with our long-term capital plans of returning 75% to 100% of free cash flow. June quarter diluted earnings per share were $8.14, close to the high end of our guidance range. The diluted share count was 131 million shares on track with our expectations and down from the March quarter.
[indiscernible] balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $5.9 billion at the end of the June quarter, up a little bit from $5.7 billion at the end of the March quarter. The sales outstanding were 59 days in the June quarter, a slight increase from 57 days in the March quarter. June quarter inventory turns of 1.9x compared with 1.8x in the prior quarter. We are making progress in bringing inventory levels down, and we'll continue to work on this throughout the rest of calendar year 2024. Our noncash expenses for the June quarter included approximately $79 million for equity compensation, $74 million in depreciation and $14 million in amortization. Capital expenditures were $101 million, flat with the March quarter level was spending mainly centered on lab investments in the United States and Asia as well as manufacturing facilities in Asia, supporting our global strategy to be close to our customers' development and manufacturing locations. We ended the June quarter with approximately 17,200 regular full-time employees, which was flat with the prior quarter.
Let's turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the September 2024 quarter. We're expecting revenue of $4.05 billion, plus or minus $300 million. Gross margin of 47%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. This gross margin decline is reflective primarily of an unfavorable quarter-to-quarter change in customer mix. I expect this change to continue to be a slight incremental headwind in the December quarter. Operating margins of 29.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. Gross margin and operating margin included impact from ongoing transformation costs related to projects to improve our systems and operations.
As we communicated at the beginning of the year, we're focused on reengineering our business processes and systems to drive operational efficiencies and to implement AI at greater scale. And finally, we're forecasting earnings per share of $8 plus or minus $0.75 based on a share count of approximately 131 million shares.
Let me wrap up. As we finish the first half of calendar year 2024, I was pleased that we were able to execute to the objectives we shared at the beginning of the year. We prioritize investment to extend our technology differentiation while driving operational improvements. We're encouraged that the spares business recovery is beginning and upgrade activity should improve as we exit the calendar year. Longer term, Lam is well positioned to capitalize the increase in etch and deposition intensity by delivering new capabilities and multiple new manufacturing inflections that we see ahead. We look forward to talking to you in February at our planned Investor Day about the long-term opportunities for Lam to continue our outperformance in the semiconductor industry.
Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. Tim and I would now like to open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Tim Arcuri with UBS. Doug, I wanted to ask about the service system mix in the guidance. So you said that the service -- I thought you said but you now think it's going to grow modestly this year. But if I flatline service in September and December, it's up 8% year-over-year. So can you just clarify what you're thinking for service in the guidance? Yes, Tim, we don't decompose the individual components of the guide. I was clarifying, we now expect [indiscernible] to be up a little bit for the year. It was particularly strong in the June quarter. whether it is up, down or sideways from that as we go forward. I'm not going to give you individual components of the forecast. But I do think for the year, it's going to grow a little bit. Okay. Great, Doug. And then -- and then can you talk a little bit about -- just in DRAM, I think there's generally more excitement, Tim, about DRAM WFE among most investors out there about where it could go during this next peak. Obviously, you do very well in NAND. But in DRAM, you did talk about a lot of the investments that you're making. Can you just talk about -- I know your leverage to the advanced packaging part of the HBM dollars being spent but that's still a pretty small piece of it. So can you just maybe give a chance to kind of discuss some of the view that you're not very levered to DRAM and give us a sense of maybe where you're investing and where you think you can gain share in DRAM. Sure. Thanks, Tim. And as you said, we do very well in NAND. We still think NAND Day is coming, as I said. We've seen some of that -- those commentaries around the enterprise SSDs, et cetera. But on the DRAM side, the reason we highlighted the progress we're making, especially in this conductor edge mean, one, it's a new tool we've introduced. It's -- it's new capabilities that are very exciting for the industry and really targeted towards the types of ultra small structures that are going to exist in future DRAM nodes going forward. Lam is the global leader in conductor etch. And so we're applying all of that expertise and learning we have towards future DRAM challenges. And I think there's tremendous opportunity for us on those applications, as I pointed out. The other side of it, a lot of the excitement around DRAM is related to HBM. And there, as you commented, we play extremely well with our strong position in both TSV, etch as well as the TSV electroplating. And I think that we don't see any change in that strong position going forward. So we get the benefit both from the scaling and architectural changes that are occurring in DRAM going forward and from the advanced packaging and HBM related expansion. And all of these -- on both of those sides are multiplied by the fact that you get fewer bits per wafer. And so everybody recognizes you're going to need a lot more DRAM wafers processed going forward. And ultimately, that translates into more equipment from LAM. . Next question comes from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. My first 1 is for Doug. I think, Doug, you gave some color on China. Kind of curious how to think about China into the back half of this calendar year and into calendar '25. And along the same path, you kind of mentioned that December quarter, there could be a slight more gross margin headwind. Is there a way to quantify how much that -- how many basis points of headwind would be in December compared to the 47% in September? And then I have a follow-up for [indiscernible]. Yes, sure. Krish, I'll just remind you what we said last quarter. It hasn't really changed in this quarter and what that statement was that for the year, '23/'24, China is up. However, it is a somewhat first half weighted year this year as opposed to last year, it was somewhat second half weighted. I'm not communicating, hey, it's going away. It's not going away. It's just the spending because sometimes these customers are a little bit bigger than a bread box, it can be a little bit lumpy and that's very much what we're seeing in China. I'm not ready to tell you exactly what next year looks like from the China region. But I do think it's going to be a pretty solid year, right? Again, it's not going away. It's too soon for us to quantify things for next year, but 25% should be a pretty decent year in China, Krish. And then, Doug, any color on the December quarter gross margin? I'm not going to give you a number, Chris, but I've been signaling for a while that because of customer mix, margin will have a little bit of some headwind going into the second half of the year. I just guided you to 47% in September and suggested that there might be a little bit of incremental headwind into December because of customer mix is what I said in the script. Got it. Got it. And then, Tim, just a quick follow-up. When I look at all the upcoming tech inflections, like [indiscernible] on backside power delivery, maybe down the road [indiscernible]. You spoke within that, the transition to 4x [indiscernible]. I'm kind of curious, is this really that material? And if so, is there a way to size the opportunity for Lam at -- you spoke a little bit about 100 -- just kind of wondering if you can give some more color around how to quantify that number for the [indiscernible] architecture transition. Sure. Well, I don't think we're prepared to quantify it for you today. But I think that my comment was, though, we see each of these inflections. And 64 is a technology inflection that brings with it some important changes. I mean, one, the architectural layout of the device itself puts additional requirements on etch, which I think we're very well suited to serve. And that's why we've been developing new conductor edge capabilities to target those new requirements. So there is some incremental opportunity there. Clearly, the jump to 3D NAND is a much bigger step-up in etch depth intensity, but our goal is to increase our SAM and grow our share at every technology node. So we look at whatever is the new requirement and how we can best address that. .
You also look, as you look at DRAM going forward, another thing that's happening, whether it's [indiscernible] is the implementation of more EUV layers and how Lam plays in EV. Again, anything where effectively pattern transfer etches. The feature sizes are getting smaller. Precision is required. These are the kinds of high-tech etches that Lam excels at. And so we look at participating in those. And then on the deposition side, of course, we've talked about things like our dry EUV resist process and how that plays into EUV as DRAM and [indiscernible] transition from EUV to high-end AUV. And so we're just looking at every technology node as an opportunity for us to gain. Your next question comes from Srinivas Pajjuri with Raymond James. Tim, I have a question on DRAM. Obviously, the recovery has been ongoing and HBM is a secular driver that you talked about, and you do have a very strong position. in that market as well. Then I look at your revenue, I think it peaked around December of '23, and it's been kind of declining on a sequential basis. I'm guessing some of that is maybe mature now DRAM. Just wondering if you're kind of at the bottom and then given all the talk about HBM spending, I would think that it's going to kind of -- it should, at some point, come back strongly. So I just want to hear your thoughts on why it's been declining? And how should we think about, in particular, in DRAM revenue. Yes. I think you generally have it pretty correct. We had talked about the fact that some mature DRAM spending was a little bit heavily concentrated in the second half of last year through early part of this year even. And as that came off, there was some of a reset in what we would call kind of traditional or the conventional DRAM. That is being picked up at some rate by the growth in HPM, but HPM is still in its ramping phase. And I think that as we look into becomes an even bigger driver of wafers in DRAM. And so I think that explains probably the profile. And I think that as we look forward to the secular driver of HBM, the impact on wafer effectively, how many wafers require us to produce that number of bits due to the [indiscernible] size  and due to the complexity of stacking these DRAMs means that we see DRAM demand for DRAM equipment continuing to grow through 2025 and probably well beyond that. . Okay. Got it. And then on the CSBG business being up 20% sequentially, 22% I know you don't want to give us guidance going forward, at least for the next quarter. I'm just curious about the sustainability of some of the trends that you're seeing, Tim. And then what does that mean for the overall WFE? Is this a prelude to something? And is this just the utilization improving? And then does this usually follow in terms of WFE increasing in terms of new tech migrations or capacity additions. So any color on that would be helpful. Sure. It's a good question. And I guess, again, reminding people that the CSBG business includes our Reliant business, which sells into mature nodes. It includes spares. It includes upgrades. And services. And so each of those components move somewhat differently. And we talked about this quarter, particularly being strong as a result of Reliant and spares. We are starting to see a pickup in utilization in the memory fabs as we've talked about -- and I've talked a little bit about the fact that as we look forward, we think that upgrades will begin to become a much more prominent part of our customers' WFE spending as they look to upgrade memory fabs that they really haven't been upgraded in quite some time because of the severe downturn that we've seen in that -- in those markets over the last few years. And so I do think, going forward, you see a little bit more of a balance between those different segments.  Upgrades coming up stronger and spares continuing to grow simply because our installed base itself continues to get bigger.
Traditionally, we would have always said that we would expect the CSBG business to grow every single year, and that's simply effective every year, we ship more tools, and those tools then require services and spares and basically present new opportunities for Lam to capture revenue from those systems. So I think long-term CSBG will be returning back to that growth and next year, probably much more biased towards the upgrades business as customers start to do when we fab upgrades. Your next question comes from [indiscernible]. I guess first question I was hoping to focus on gross margins. A couple of quarters ago, Doug, you talked about kind of looking back to the June kind of '23 quarter has normalized. But given the guide today, it sounds like that was conservative and it's a higher number. So just as you think about calendar '25,  as you get to kind of a normalized China mix and you normalize to Reliant, what would be kind of the base level we should be thinking about for gross margins? And then can you talk to what kind of accretion we should be thinking about related to Malaysia and/or some of these higher-margin upgrade drivers? Yes, CJ, I mean, you've alluded to some of the things that move gross margin on, obviously. Yes, I had previously anchored you and other respect to that June quarter before the China mix improved or strengthened, I guess, maybe not [indiscernible] as the baseline -- I guided it down a little bit in September, described customer mix softening a little bit relative to moving that. And I'm not suggesting, hey, a little bit more in December potentially. It's all about customer mix. Too soon for me to guide you for next year, but the things you should be thinking about is what does that customer mix look like next year? I'm not sure yet, and I'm not ready to point you to numbers, but what will begin to show up in a more significant fashion is the accretion for -- from those Asia factories as we ramp output, that will be a benefit to gross margins. So those are the moving pieces to be thinking about. The customer mix, I'm not entirely sure -- but as we see a likely WFE environment next year, that's somewhat stronger, increasingly, the incremental volume will be supported from those Asia factories, which should be beneficial to gross margin [indiscernible]. . Very helpful. And then I guess as my follow-up, in your prepared remarks, you spoke to the 7,500 high aspect ratio edge chambers installed in demand industry. And just curious, as you see upgrades there, what kind of growth could that add to overall NAND WFE specifically to you guys? Is there a kind of percentage we should think about? Any help there would be great. . We haven't quantified that, but the reason I included it was simply to point out, the installed base itself becomes powerful driver of revenue during those upgrade cycles. And we do think that the next phase, we've seen higher memory fab utilization, particularly when we talked about NAND beginning to improve last quarter, and that seems to be continuing as we move through the remainder of this year. We get to next year and the upgrades start in earnest, to those tools represent opportunities for Lam to help our customers achieve both a technology upgrade and a bit cost reduction as they move forward and accrues quite a lot of revenue for Lam relative to the amount of WFE spend. Remind people the WFE Lam's capture rate of spending in an upgrade is significantly higher because etch and deposition represents so much of the upgrade.  [indiscernible] we point out the size of our installed base. The next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. I wanted to ask like if the NAND business next year is primarily driven by upgrades, what does that imply for growth? Like would it be conceivable that NAND WP could double year-over-year in calendar '25 that was purely upgrade driven? Or would you need capacity additions to get there? And are you seeing any signs at all of capacity additions right now? It doesn't sound like [indiscernible]. Well, Stacy, what I would say is that obviously, we're not going to guide what NAND WFE is next year. Frankly, I think it's still a developing story. But what we're trying to say is that as customers move to upgrades, whatever WFE is spent, Lam will be the primary beneficiary of that WFE spend. And so that's a year in which my comment was we would be confident that we would outgrow WFE in the NAND space if it was primarily upgrade spend. And upgrades represent a tremendous efficient way for customers to essentially advance their technology and lower their costs. And so we do think that will be the next phase of NAND investment based on our thoughts. Got it. Got it. I mean maybe to follow up on that just a little bit. I mean, if you look at your current like NAND outlook for this year, would you say that, that outlook has gotten better or worse or stayed the same versus like 90 days ago? It probably hasn't changed much, Stacy. This is Doug. Maybe a little bit better. We're certainly see a little bit of an uptick in utilization. But I don't think it's meaningfully different, Stacy. So got it. So it's kind of a noise. Yes, kind of a noise. Next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Given the strength in CSD, it looks like utilization by your customer base continues to rise. Did that also broaden out to start to include not just leading-edge logic foundry, DRAM and NAND, but maybe also start to include mature and specialty fabs as well? Or are at a minimum, mature and specialty utilization at least stabilizing in line with some of the cyclical improvements that we're seeing in the semi industry? . Harlan, [indiscernible] is still pretty soft, frankly. And I think you understand what's going on. I think just listen to everybody else's earnings calls in the analog, industrial, automotive space. And there's still a lot of inventory out there, it's still relatively soft. The statements we're making on utilization have more to do with what we're seeing in the memory fabs, quite frankly. I appreciate that. And then on HPM and advanced [indiscernible], I mean last night, we heard AMD talk about supply dynamics being tight on their AI GPU supply next year, [indiscernible] ASIC front, we hear companies like Broadcom keep getting upside orders from their AI customers like Google. Last quarter, you talked about doing $1 billion in advanced packaging and HBM revenues this year. Has that number moved higher and is the team capacity constrained on advanced packaging systems and are your lead times here for those tools starting to stretch out? Well, it has moved higher, and we're not going to requantify it just yet, but it is -- we're seeing very strong demand in those areas. I talked about the expansion of our global manufacturing supply chain footprint. And obviously, that's giving us more flexibility than we had during the last ramp. Our goal through all those investments was to be able to respond in this next few years of expansion better than we did in the expansion that we saw right around the time of COVID. And so I think that, that will position us. Sure, you're always a little bit short and customers always drop in tools within your lead time, which keeps you busy. But I think that we're doing quite a nice job responding to the urgent request from our customers. .
We actually like this. I would say that generally from running the business, we like this environment where all parts of our business are a little bit supply constrained. I mean, you hear a lot of our customers talking about being cautious about adding capacity. Other customers talking about having a little trouble getting tools. I think that's a good place for us to be because it means that I think we're setting up for more manageable long-term ramp of demand than sort of a short spike followed by, again, periods of digestion that always creates a little bit of chaos in the industry. Your next question comes from Atif Malik with Citi. Doug, if I look at the 2023 year-over-year China sales growth among the big 5 equipment makers. All of them are up quite well. [indiscernible] is up [indiscernible] and the U.S. peers are up in teens or 20%, but you guys were down 11% total China sales in 2023. And this year, you're expecting China sales to be up. So I'm just trying to understand the dynamics last year. Was this just a function of maybe NAND spending and the NAND project not being active -- or are there competitive elements in China that are working against you? Atif, I'll remind you that perhaps our largest customer got restricted when the regulations came out, our NAND customer in China. That customer was pretty strong in '22, went away in '23. So the year-over-year comparisons you're making, you've got to factor that in. And then the strength we're seeing '23 to '24 is a different mix entirely, really not any NAND in China to speak of, at least not domestic China. I don't know if that helps you, but make sure you're thinking about that. Yes, it all makes it. That's helpful. And then on the cryo improvement, Tim, that you mentioned, are those improvements or process tool of record is going to solidify your market share next year or the year after? That's -- well, I think that all of these things when you introduce something new, I mean I think what people kind of lose sight of this. Generally, we're working several years ahead with our customers on R&D. I talked about the investments we're making where we make -- we're building labs close to our customers in different geographies. That's because, in many cases, we're engaging those customers a good 5 years ahead of production implementation. That's not to say Lam [indiscernible] take 5 years to get into production. But it's not technology that's ramping, say, this year, but it really is looking out at the needs of our customers wanted to generations out and really solving their difficult etch challenges. So -- sometimes when the benefits are so good, and I talked about the fact that we get about 2.5x rate, tremendous profile control customers will often pull that in sooner. But really, this is designed for kind of the 400-plus layer may ultimately end up being pulled in earlier than that, but that's where you really start to see the needs for this kind of capability. Exactly I was asking about. It is 400 layers to 200 layers, but it sounds like [indiscernible]. Yes. And I think that what we -- you'll see in our press release today, we talked a little bit about we're trying to chart the path across not only etch, but also our deposition films towards where the industry needs to go to get to 1,000 layers because we truly see over the next decade that that's where you want to get in terms of satisfying bit density and cost as NAND demand continues to expand with AI. Next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. I joined late, so I do apologize if these questions have been addressed. Just on the third-generation cryo tool, Tim, that you spoke about. How is this technology or tool fundamentally different or better than your nearest competitor? I know you just spoke to some of the characteristics, but if you can clarify that for us to the extent you're comfortable, that would be really, really helpful. And then my second question, again, on the CSBG side, probably one for Doug. And again, you may have address this. For the full year calendar year, I think you previously said flattish, plus or minus. Is that still the view? Or given the strength you saw in June, is that -- should we be thinking about a higher growth rate for the full year? Maybe I'll take that one first, and then I'll let Tim comment on the [indiscernible] stuff. Yes. You might have missed my scripted statements. As we sit here today, we now expect that for 2024 CSBG, the word I used was modestly grow this year versus last year. And part of that is we saw particular strength in the June quarter in Reliant.  Little bit of an improvement in spares. And as we think about the utilization trends that are likely occurring with our memory customers, I think spares continues to be decent and we're optimistic that we'll start to see some of the upgrade spend that we've been talking about for a while. And I'll hand it over to Tim on the 3.0 stuff. . Sure, yes. I think, obviously, what I would just start with is the biggest difference between what we're delivering with Lam Cryo 3.0 and what our competitors do is in the results on the [indiscernible], which we talked about pretty amazing 10-micron deep holes with less than a 10-nanometer paper from the top to bottom. At etch rates that are 2.5x conventional [indiscernible]. So it's the results that are pretty amazing. We talked about the fact that the -- this is based on some new surface chemistries that are enabled in our tool -- and there's a whole combination of hardware issue -- hardware configuration and capabilities in our tool that I think allow us to achieve that result. And I can't go into all of those details today, but it is I did allude to one of them, which is on our Vantec system. The chamber design allows us to deliver a significantly higher ion energy than what is available from any other system available in the semiconductor industry. And that  does play some role in etching these very, very deep near with holes with near perfect verticality. So that's about all I can say today. . Your next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Great I wanted to ask you, I mean, there's been a number of press concerns about export controls with talking about the foreign direct product rule which doesn't seem like it would affect you, but also talking about entity list. And I'm just wondering, obviously, we don't know what would happen with any of that. But are you seeing any different behavior from your China customers? Are you seeing them push things in or pull things -- push things out because of any of those anxieties. Yes. Joe, I think that obviously, we we don't know exactly what's going to happen either just as you said, and so we can't really speculate on that. I have mentioned in the last couple of calls that there are ongoing discussions all the time with the U.S. government and regulatory agencies were part of those discussions and we'll continue to be. I think in terms of change in behavior by any of our customers, I don't think it's something that's noticeable nor would it be something that we would be able to easily react to. We've talked about how we deal with some of these new customers that emerge with down payments and other things to make sure that we understand the -- those customers as viable customers. But beyond that, we service them like others at this point as long as we can ship to them, I would say, 3x in responsiveness from our perspective same as we treat any customers of those [indiscernible]. . Next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Jeffries. Question. I actually -- I know you got a couple on this, Doug, on the China business. I'm just kind of curious, you -- I think you qualified as a solid year next year, and I just didn't know what that meant. So I know you've been hesitant to kind of call of China, I think you called it like flat, plus or minus, maybe up or down last time. Do you feel better about it, I guess, outside of this June  that's the other kind of part of the question. Just if you can qualify a little bit. I mean, you should have some idea of what you're going to [indiscernible]. So it was [indiscernible] kind of a cleanup and it might be a little bit lumpy and/or is China actually trending a bit better for you? I don't know, [indiscernible], that I'm trying to communicate anything any different than we said on the last call, to be honest with you. We described this year as somewhat first half weighted, really no change to that. The June quarter was maybe a little tiny bit stronger in China, but only a little tiny bit. It's too soon for me to -- for us to quantify 2025. But what I would tell you is I expect next year to be a solid year in terms of spending in China. I'm not going to give you a number yet because I'm not completely sure. But what I wouldn't want anybody to think is it's going away because it's not. Got you. And then I'm just kind of curious, the broad strokes was growth for next year. I know you don't want to give a forecast. But in terms of the moving pieces there, I mean, it's pretty clear leading edge is strong, DRAM spend is strong. I'm just kind of curious as you look into that forecast, if you're willing to venture kind of a view on the NAND business. Yes. I think NAND spending next year has to be greater than it is this year, right? We're off 2 years of quite low spending in NAND. I don't know what magnitude. I expect next year, we expect next year, you're going to see a lot of upgrades in NAND. But too soon for us to give you a number, but I would be shocked if it's not stronger than it is this year, it has to be. Next question comes from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. I wanted to try on the man side again. If we just think about your prior peak NAND revenue ex customers that are obviously now restricted, can capacity upgrade to just higher layer counts support your return to those levels, just given your higher share of higher etch and depth intensity for the transitions? Joe, if it just an upgrade your spending will be lower than when capacity gets added, obviously, our share of wallet will be greater. The fact that we lost a pretty large NAND customer in the China region, hard to replace that. I'm not ready to tell you what kind of next year is relative to previous peaks. But I know next year is going to be a stronger year than it is this year for sure. Yes. And Joe, I think that obviously, we're talking next year, it's very specific to the demand environment and the upgrade business in 2025. Longer term, I mean, we've we've laid out, in our view, is that NAND spending rises. And so it's just a matter of the time frame you're looking at. And from the standpoint of Lam's business, the etch and depth components and the complexity of tear stacking the precision that's required for implementation of QLC and PLC technologies, all of these skewed towards Lam's technical strengths and also SAM expansion opportunities. .
I talked about the [indiscernible] Pure Carbon gap fill process, which is a new addition to the portfolio for NAND scaling technology going forward. And so if I go back and I look at where we were in the portfolio, we had to sell, when people used to think of NAND is a very, very strong business for Lam, we've expanded that portfolio quite substantially with the gap fill, the backside stress management, the ALD oxide gap fill process plus the etch and stack debt that we've always had as well as metallization. So it's one of [indiscernible] in NAND demand, but also growth in Lam's portfolio and served market as well opportunities ahead. So I think that bodes well for us once the NAND business itself starts to recover. That's helpful color. And just as a quick follow-up. You talked about global mature node spending being roughly flat this year. Can you just help us understand just kind of how does that break down? I mean, I think clearly, the non-China piece is pretty weak. But just any kind of color there you could help us parse that out. Yes, you answered your own question, Joe. China is decent right now. Outside of China, it's pretty soft. And I think you understand what's going on on there's. Inventory that's built up [indiscernible] inventories still need to come down in the mature node, analog, industrial automotive space and investment won't meaningfully occur until that gets adjusted. So that's kind of what's going on. You sort of answered your own question. . Next question is a follow-up question from Krish Sankar. Doug, I just had a quick follow-up. It's a question on inventory. You spoke about bringing inventory [indiscernible] down. [indiscernible] kind of curious like how to think about inventory next year, especially you're planning for a strong WFE year in 2025? Or do you think most of this inventory would be in a bin, how to think about inventory next year? Yes. Listen, if you think back to when business declined for us last year, a big part of what fell off pretty rapidly was our NAND business. And so a lot of the inventory that we still have sitting on the balance sheet will support NAND. So when assuming NAND is stronger next year, and it will be, we will consume that NAND inventory that's been sitting on the balance sheet for a while. What will offset that to a certain extent is growth elsewhere, where we'll need to procure new inventory. So I'm not ready to give you an inventory forecast quite yet, but we're continuing to work as we go through the remainder of this year to kind of bring it down and then what we do with next year will depend largely on the timing of business, the mix of business, the geographic distribution of business, but we'd like to get turns back to where they historically have been and they're not there yet. So that's how you should be thinking about it, Krish. Next question is from Melissa [indiscernible] with Deutsche Bank. . I wanted to ask on the leading edge and specifically [indiscernible] nodes. I don't think I heard an update to your $1 billion get all around revenues in 2024 target. So  is that still the case? And then as we think about those nodes ramping through next year, like what's the trajectory of that ramp that we should be thinking about as you move from pilot lines into high-volume manufacturing? Yes. Thanks, Melissa. I mean we always make choices about what we do and don't include it in the prepared remarks and gate all around fell out this time, just no intended message. In fact, if I look at what happened in the quarter, Lam, again, as we've talked on previous calls, is really positioned quite nicely with our forward-looking etch and depth portfolios. We we really targeted those kind of markets with new tools in selected etch, which is a market we hadn't been in before. And in fact, in the quarter, we had additional selected [indiscernible] wins for data all around multiple customers. .
We targeted investment in ALD films that are specifically needed for things like spacers and gate all around, and we had additional wins in the quarter for those films.  Often with data all around, we think of those -- they are obviously different technologies, but kind of occurring at the same node, the backside power delivery. That's an area that is really right in our sweet spot in terms of deposition and etch. And in the quarter, we had wins in backside power in ALD [indiscernible] and so I would say net-net, I mean, given those wins and what you're hearing from the end markets about the need for high-power computing demand for AI, I think the $1 billion forecast we gave you, certainly, as we move through next year would be going higher. And so again, that's a combination of rising demand, but also a product portfolio that's both expanding and one in which we're winning share. And so there was no message about leaving it off, but thank you for asking the question so we could get that in right at the end. Awesome, operator, I think that concludes our call. I want to thank everybody for joining us today. We look forward to seeing you at a variety of conferences and interactions as we go through the remainder of the quarter. Appreciate it. . Thank you.
