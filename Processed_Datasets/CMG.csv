At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Coralie Witter. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our call today. By now you should have access to our earnings announcement released this afternoon for the first quarter of 2018. It may also be found on our website at chipotle.com in the Investor Relations section.
Before we begin our presentation, I will remind everyone that parts of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements as defined in the securities laws. These forward-looking statements will include statements regarding our strategy and initiative to build sales; sales trend and forecast for future comparable restaurant sales; expected new restaurant openings; estimates of future food, labor, occupancy, marketing, other operating and general and administrative cost trends; statements about our expected effective tax rate; plans for capital expenditures and stock repurchases; as well as other statements of our expectations and plans. These statements are based on information available to us today and we are not assuming any obligation to update them.
Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We refer you to the risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K as updated in our subsequent Form 10-Q for a discussion of these risks.
I'd also like to remind everyone that we have adopted a self-imposed quiet period restricting communications with investors during that period. The quiet period will begin on the sixteenth day of the last month of each fiscal quarter and continues until the next earnings conference call. For the second quarter of 2018, it will begin June 16 and continue through our second quarter earnings release.
Our discussion today will also include non-GAAP financial measures, a reconciliation of which can be found on the presentations page of the Investor Relations section of our website.
We will start today's call with some brief prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer. We will allow plenty of time at the end of those remarks for questions. In the room and also available during the Q&A period are Scott Boatwright, Chief Restaurant Officer; Chris Brandt, Chief Marketing Officer; Laurie Schalow, Chief Communications Officer; and, Marissa Andrada, Chief Human Resources Officer.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Brian Niccol. Thanks, Coralie, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm excited to be talking to you today on my first earnings call with Chipotle. Chipotle is such a strong brand with incredible equity built over the last 25 years, and I couldn't be more excited about our future. One thing is very clear to me, consumers love our great tasting food and appreciate that our food is made with integrity. I have admired Chipotle for many years and I'm excited to have the opportunity to lead the future direction of this incredible company.
Before I get into the details of this call, I'd like to start by recognizing Steve Ells for creating this amazing concept. And for the last 25 years, leading it to become one of the most important restaurant brands of our time. I thank Steve for the invaluable time he spent bringing me up to speed over the past several weeks, and I deeply appreciate him fully handing over the reins to me and giving me the autonomy to lead, innovate, and create the new strategy that will ensure our growth for the future. Going forward, Steve has embraced his new role as Executive Chairman. We're fortunate to be able to leverage his creativity and expertise as a culinarian, a visionary and our founder.
For those of you who don't know me very well, I'd like to share some of my key beliefs and leadership principles, so you know what to expect going forward. I believe it is important to focus on results over activity, to hold people accountable, and to be stewards of our business. I believe in the power of innovation and that to be successful we must create and lead change. I also believe in a winning work ethic and that to win we need to have an external focus with the ability to quickly read and react to change. And I believe in the power of people so it's important to me that we create a culture that is focused on running and supporting great restaurants, putting the customer first, living our purpose, innovating for today and tomorrow, and supporting and recognizing each other.
Before I share my view on what changes we need to make, I thought I would start by telling you what is not going to change. We will continue to serve high quality, great tasting food that consumers crave. We will also continue to focus on improving operations and fixing and modernizing the foundation of our company. With that said you will see us doubling down on our purpose and our guest experience. We will get better at innovation and putting customers front and center. We will focus on execution, which rests on simple choices, clear goals and consistent measures. We are also upgrading our capabilities to innovate across our business. Specifically, we will provide greater consumer access including through delivery and catering, enhance the digital experience, innovate around our menu, and improve our restaurant design. We're working on building a world class executive team and an organization built for growth. In the last year, we've added new leaders across operations, communications, marketing, and human resources.
Since our last earnings announcement, we added Chris Brandt as Chief Marketing Officer and just this week, Marissa Andrada joined Chipotle as Chief Human Resources Officer. Chris Brandt is a seasoned veteran and is quickly assessing the changes needed across marketing, so we can get back to emphasizing the craveability of our food and expanding brand loyalty among consumers. Having worked with Chris in the past, I can vouch for his proven track record of delivering innovation that is good for consumers and operations and that provides the financial outcomes needed to grow transactions and sales. I'm confident Chris will quickly find ways to increase our brand relevance and ensure our advertising spend is working harder for us. Marissa Andrada has extensive experience in senior human resource roles in prominent consumer brands and I'm excited that she has joined our team. Marissa's leadership will be essential as we look to strengthen our organization, and ensure we have the right structuring capabilities to achieve our strategy and build a culture of innovation and recognition. We are creating a path to performance and we are in the process of establishing the strategies to get there. I plan to share more details with you on a special call before our next earnings announcement with more details around how we will do these five things.
First, grow sales, transactions, margin, and restaurants. Second, elevate our brand relevance and further our brand purpose. Third, build the right structure and capabilities to sustain performance. Fourth, create a people recognition and innovation culture. And fifth, run great restaurants that deliver best-in-class financial performance.
In the coming months you will see us piloting various tests across key innovation focus areas such as consumer access, the digital experience, our menu and restaurant experience, and realigning the organization to support the go-forward strategy. I do want to acknowledge that there's a lot of great work underway and we are starting to get some traction. Curt Garner's work on the mobile app is paying dividends, and I'm excited about the continued benefits of the digitally enhanced second make-line, which is now in 237 restaurants. Order accuracy has improved in those restaurants, leading to a nearly 20% improvement in customer feedback.
Digital sales are our fastest growing area with growth of 20% year-over-year and now represent 8.8% of sales in the first quarter. The customer experience with mobile sales is also improving as our average wait times for mobile orders are down by more than half since launching Smarter Pickup Times. Curt and I are excited to continue driving progress in these areas which we believe will help us bring Chipotle to more people in ways that customers appreciate.
We are seeing improvements in operations under Scott Boatwright's leadership. I've spent a lot of time in restaurants with Scott over the last several weeks and I'm impressed with our teams and their dedication to operational excellence. The plans Scott put in place last fall have created a culture of accountability in the field, our design provide a great guest experience, and are built on a strong foundation of food safety. Most importantly, our customers are noticing and I'm confident we are focused on the right measures. We have a lot of work ahead of us, but I'm optimistic about the future of Chipotle. We have a strong economic model, a loyal customer base, and a powerful purpose.
With that, I look forward to sharing more details with you on the special call I mentioned earlier.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Jack Hartung to provide a financial update. Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased with our performance in the first quarter as comp sales accelerated slightly, margins expanded, and earnings per share grew. And though it was a solid quarter, we realize we have much more work ahead. Since Brian's arrival, we've been taking a fresh look at every element of our business. We're committed to running great restaurants; putting our customers first; staying true to our purpose; embracing innovation in menu, digital, access and restaurants; improving our execution capabilities; and strengthening our culture internally. We're confident that these are the right areas of focus to drive strong performance and increase shareholder value on a sustainable long-term basis.
Before I go through the financial results, I want to highlight some important operational accomplishments this quarter. As Brian mentioned, Scott's plan to instill a culture of accountability in the field is starting to get the attention of our customers, as internal customer satisfaction scores have increased significantly since last summer. Employee turnover at the crew level has improved to the best levels we've seen in many years. We have much more to do, but the culture of accountability, the heightened focus on training, and the improved leadership structure in the field is beginning to drive results that are precursors to sustained comp sales improvement.
Brian highlighted the strong improvement in our digital sales, which grew 20% year-over-year and now accounts for 8.8% of total sales. Mobile sales alone grew 41% year-over-year. And these orders are all fulfilled on our second make-line, which we believe to be a competitive advantage and that we will continue to invest in to make the customer experience as convenient as possible, allowing us to continue to grow digital sales. The majority of second make-line orders are app and web orders, but also include third-party delivery orders and catering. The surge in mobile sales since relaunching our app late last year gives us confidence that our customers appreciate the great experience. We're proud to say that we were notified just this week that we won the People's Choice Webby Award for best user interface for a mobile app. The Webby is an award for excellence on the Internet and is one of the most prestigious industry awards.
Catering is approximately 1% of sales and remains a large untapped opportunity on which we have increased our focus. We recently expanded catering delivery availability to 1,500 restaurants from 940, and on average, we see about a 15% lift in catering sales when we add delivery. And we're decreasing group size minimums and we're testing lower per person pricing options to expand our catering reach.
Our delivery sales continue to grow at a rapid pace. And when our delivery partners offer free delivery at Chipotle to build their customer base, our customers respond in a big way, as they did during Super Bowl weekend when delivery volumes increased nearly 250%. We'll continue to expand the number of delivery partners we work with, and we'll look to partner with them to offer compelling options to our customers.
Turning to financial results, we generated revenue of $1.1 billion during the quarter, an increase of 7.4% from last year on comp sales growth of 2.2%. And that's on top of last year's 17% Q1 comp sales. Restaurant level margins for the quarter were 19.5%, an improvement of 180 basis points from last year. And earnings per share increased 33% to $2.13. The Q1 comp of 2.2% is comprised of an underlying comp sales growth for the quarter of 2.7%, and that's before the 50 basis point impact from Chiptopia as we've lapped deferred revenue from Chiptopia in Q1 of last year. Comp sales were driven by higher average check, primarily from the price increase taken since Q1 of last year. The price increases averaged about 5% across the menu and resistance has been less than 20%. The check average also benefited from customers adding queso to their order which added about 200 basis points.
April trends have been impacted by unseasonably cold and wintery weather in much of the country as well as the Easter shift, but taking these impacts into account, underlying April comp transaction trends are similar to Q1. Now keep in mind that we started lapping the first price increase from last year on April 15, which accounted for about 1% of the sales comp. Based on comp trends through the first quarter, we are reiterating our full year comp sales guidance in the low single digits with lower sales comps expected in the first half the year due to tougher comparisons. Now this guidance does not include any projected impact from the sales growth strategies we're currently developing, as it is too early to determine the timing and magnitude of the impact these strategies may have on the comp.
We opened 35 new restaurants in the quarter and continue to expect 130 to 150 new openings for the full year. We're in the early stages of building our pipeline for 2019, and while it's too early to provide specific opening range for 2019, we expect to open at or above the 2018 opening level. We're pleased with the strong performance of our new restaurants this year, and we'll continue to emphasize high quality, high returning new restaurants as we build out the pipeline.
Food costs during the quarter were 32.4%, and that was down 140 basis points from the 33.8% last year, and that's down from 34.2% in Q4. The decrease from last year was driven by the menu price increase and efficiencies in paper and packaging. We expect relatively stable prices for the rest of 2018 across most items, resulting in food cost at or below the 33% range for the full year. Now this full year estimate is higher than the Q1 due to the seasonal shift to source avocados from California which will start in Q2.
Labor costs for the quarter were 27.8%, 90 basis points higher than last year. Wage inflation of 5% was offset by the price increase but deleverage from negative transactions along with the Chiptopia revenue deferral drove the higher labor as a percent of sales. We expect labor costs to improve in the low to mid 27% range in Q2 as we move into our seasonally higher sales months. And we expect labor for the full year to approach 28% as crew and manager merit increases combined with general wage pressures continue to outpace the comp. Occupancy costs for the quarter were 7.4% or flat with last year, and we expect full year to be in a similar range.
Other operating costs were 12.9% of sales, down from 14.1% last year. Our marketing and promo costs were only 1.8% in the quarter which is a decrease of about 150 basis points compared to last year. We still anticipate marketing and promo costs to be right around 3% of sales for the full year with elevated spending for the remainder of the year. And while Chris and the marketing team are still working on their plan for Q2 and the rest of the year, we would expect marketing and promo will be in the 3.5% to 4% range in Q2. Other operating costs included about 30 basis points of incremental maintenance and repair costs that we discussed on the last call. And we expect M&R to continue at this elevated level during 2018.
G&A for the quarter was $77 million, or 6.7% of sales, an increase from 6.5% last year. This was lower than expected due to stock comp forfeitures of around $4 million and the 2018 equity grant that was done very late in the quarter. With normalized stock comp in Q2, total G&A is expected to be around $7 million higher, around $84 million, and that run rate puts us on target to hit the $330 million G&A for the full year, which was communicated last quarter. Underlying G&A in the quarter increased $8 million compared to last year to support our growth as well as several initiatives including new formalized training programs and operational changes in the field. This increase comes after three years of flat G&A despite opening up 650 restaurants. As we fully develop our strategic plan to strengthen our unit economic and drive sustainable sales growth, we may need to adjust how and where we invest our G&A. As such these G&A estimates for the second quarter and the full year are subject to change and we'll update you on any known changes during the special investor call Brian mentioned earlier.
Depreciation was 4.1% of sales for the quarter, an increase from 3.7% last year. We expect depreciation to remain at about 4% for several quarters as we accelerate the depreciation for items expected to be replaced related to the maintenance and repair refresh, as well as other capital initiatives that we described on the last call. Our pre-tax income was $94.2 million, and our effective tax rate for the quarter was 36.9%. I'd like to spend a few more minutes than I normally would on this tax rate to put it in the right context.
First of all, the actual tax rate we expect to pay the government is around 28.8%, not 36.9%. This tax rate of 36.9% includes about 810 basis points, the bulk of which are non-economic accounting items related to stock-compensation issues in previous years. In essence, during the quarter we wrote off deferred tax assets related to previously issued stock-comp because the related performance shares either did not vest, and so they expired, or the shares vested at a much lower value. So, the related deferred tax asset on our balance sheet needed to be written off or written down and the write-off flows through the tax expense line. We expect no such write-off in Q2 and Q3, so our effective tax rate is expected to be around 28.8% in those quarters. During the fourth quarter, additional performance shares may expire, and if they do, we'll write-off the related deferred tax assets for those awards. Again, we'll not actually pay a higher tax rate, but the write-off will flow through the tax line. We expect the tax rate including this write-off in Q4 will be around 38.4%.
Before I leave the discussion on taxes I want to briefly walk through the components of our underlying tax rate. There are five key components that roll up to the underlying rate. First, our federal tax rate is the statutory 21%. Second, our state tax rate is about 5.6% and it's higher than last year's rate because of the lower federal rate. That takes our rate to 26.6%. Third, we lost part of the deduction for free meals we give to our restaurant teams which adds 1.3% to the rate. That takes us to 27.9%. Fourth, about 1.6% is added related to the tax law change, where all named executive officer compensation over $1 million is not deductible. And fifth, our rate is reduced by about 60 basis points for employer wage credits and other miscellaneous items. And that gets us to the 28.8% I mentioned earlier. For the full year, taking into account – taking all this into account and adding about 4% on an annual basis for the non-economic write-off of deferred tax items I talked about earlier, we estimate that the 2018 effective full-year tax rate will be around 33%.
We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, ending the quarter with $580 million in cash and investments, and we generated $200 million in cash from operations.
During the first quarter, we repurchased $68 million of our stock at an average price of $311 per share and we spent $58 million on capital investments outlined on the previous call. We still expect opportunistically to repurchase shares throughout the year, invest in the capital items we discussed on the last call, and maintain a cash and investments balance of about $500 million.
As I mentioned on the last earnings call, the overall guidance we provided then and we're reiterating today, does not factor in any potential strategic changes arising from hiring a new CEO. As Brian mentioned earlier, we will need to realign the organization in order to support and execute our updated strategy. We also plan to carefully analyze underperforming assets during the second quarter. This organizational review and the asset review will likely entail some one-time costs in 2018 that are too early to quantify, but these initiatives are intended to support and strengthen our economic model and set us up to execute our strategic plan and deliver long-term shareholder value. We'll share more details with you later this quarter.
We're encouraged by our first quarter results and we're optimistic about the direction we're headed. We're confident that the changes we're making to our leadership and the realignment of our organization will enable us to be more nimble and more innovative in all areas: customer access, digital, menu, and the restaurant environment, and will allow us to execute better to deliver on our commitments to our guests, our employees, and our shareholders. We look forward to sharing more details about our plans on our special investor call which will be scheduled some time before our Q2 earnings call.
Operator, we'll now open the line for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Nicole Miller from Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question. Thank you, good afternoon. Jack, a quick one for you. Did you reiterate CapEx? We were going pretty quick through the numbers, so I just wanted to check that. I wanted to check that real quick, and then ask Brian a quick question. Yeah, Nicole, the CapEx right now we expect will be about the same as we outlined on the last call. It's going to be in the neighborhood of $300 million. About one-third of that is new stores. The other two-thirds is existing stores. The big items there is the refresh that we talked about, which is about $50 million. Another big piece was about $45 million for the digitized second make-line, and then there's another – a number of other things that we outlined on the last call, but those are still intact now. Nicole, just like I mentioned, our guidance hasn't taken into account the impact of strategies. It's possible that we may refine that or adjust that throughout the year, and we'll give you a full recap on any changes when we talk to you before the next earnings call. Great, thank you. And then, Brian, just a big picture question for you, and thanks for your time. Do you see this as a recovery story or global growth opportunity, just curious how you see this playing out long-term? And you talked about five pieces you want to execute, could you give us any little detail before the next call on maybe some of the low-hanging fruit versus longer-term solutions? Thank you. Yeah, sure, Nicole. First, I think the opportunity is clearly a recovery story in the U.S. and we'll be focused on taking what I believe is a powerful brand that has really strong economics, strong purpose, that when we tie the elements that I outlined in my earlier comments, and we'll go into much further detail on our special call, I think the opportunity is really exciting for what this brand has in front of it. The innovation will be across the business, as I mentioned, in access, digital, menu, and frankly, we'll double-down on our fundamentals. So, I think it's a story of recovery, and then where that recovery takes us I think is also really exciting, but that's much longer-term discussion. Our next question comes from the line of David Tarantino from Robert W. Baird & Co. Please proceed with your question. Hi, good afternoon. Brian, just a couple of questions kind of high level how you're thinking about how this plays out over the next few years. Are you thinking, I guess, directionally that you're going to need to make a lot of investments in the business? I know you talked about realigning the structure, but do you think there's going to be a big step up in expenses related to that? And then secondly, I know Jack mentioned next year you'd open a similar number of units, or maybe a little higher, but how are you thinking about unit growth as you execute this turnaround strategy? Do you think you need to slow or moderate the unit growth in the out-years to accomplish what you're envisioning? Thanks. Yeah. Okay, thanks, David. Your first question, I think, we can get into all the details of how we see the plan playing out forward. I think some of the good news is, though, as I've looked into the business, like a great area of focus the people have been asking about is our marketing spend. And I think the marketing spend is one of those areas that we believe there's a lot of opportunity to take those dollars that we're currently allocating and make the brand much more visible with what we have. And then we're going to put in place more of a test-and-learn approach on the initiatives that will roll out, so, we'll have clarity on what we believe the return is for the investment that we're making before we make those decisions to go beyond our current plans. So, I think the recovery plan that we'll be putting in place, or as I talked about earlier, our path to performance will be based on leveraging the idea of testing, improving out propositions, while at the same token with our organization we build capability and we restructure to support the strategy that I believe will set us up for growth in the near term and longer term.
Your second question regarding units, the good news is the economics of the units that we're opening continue to look very strong, and as mentioned in the script, we see no reason for us to change the pace that we are experiencing this year, and obviously, as we get further into our plan, we'll give the appropriate updates as the time permits when it's right to do that. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Alliance Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Great. Thank you and congratulations, Brian, on the new role. I wanted to ask two, if I may. One is about the quarter that just passed, and then sort of going forward. So, in terms of the quarter that just passed, I guess I was surprised at what appears to be a fairly quick impact you might have be having, a couple of things that we've seen are maybe new creative around marketing and then a waste management initiative that looks like it has some pretty big opportunities in terms of – in restaurant waste management. So, I guess, from my perspective to what extent is this you, Brian, kind of putting your stamp already on that and do you see a lot of low-hanging fruit like what some of these initiatives seem to suggest, just in terms of sort of basic systematic approaches? So that was question one. And then question two, if you could just talk a little bit about what you meant by consumer meaningful innovation across the business in the context of what's always been a very simple, straightforward menu and the operations that go with that? Yeah, sure. So first, obviously thank you for the kind words. Very excited to be in the CEO role at Chipotle. It's loaded with opportunity, which I think is what you're asking about. And what I'll tell you is in the short-term, I think, there are real opportunities for us to make simple pivots to increase, I think, the appeal of our brands to those customers that are already very much big fans. One of the big surprises for me, frankly, even once it got announced that I was taking this role, was the amount of people that reached out just saying how much they love Chipotle and they love the food. And I think just with the most recent advertising we made a little pivot towards reminding people what is great about the ingredients.
This Food With Integrity purpose really resonates and reminding people why they feel good about eating Chipotle, I think, is always a good approach. So, you'll continue to see us make simple pivots like that while we also continue to push this brand forward in a big way from the standpoint of access, as it relates to digital innovation; menu, as it relates to menu innovation that leverages our operating model, which I believe is something very special in this industry and allows us to do a lot of exciting things, whether it's day parts or simple menu tweaks that I think will broaden the appeal. And then obviously on – I think, you were kind of mentioning your question about waste management and such. Look, there's always opportunities to be better on the cost side and we're going to continue to look for those opportunities along the way. Because that just frees up the ability to give the customer more of what they want and our team members a better experience to provide the experience we want them to provide. So, lots of opportunities I think in the short-term. We're going to be very cognizant of what are the things we pace in sequence in the near term and what are the things we put in to test to ensure we're focusing on the right things over the next 18 to 24 months. Yeah, that's very, very helpful. Thank you. Yeah. Our next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia from William Blair. Please proceed with your question. Hi, good afternoon. Jack, a quick question on the restaurant level margin. I know you've beat by a good amount in the first quarter. I think, some of that as you mentioned with marketing will catch up as the year goes on. Are you still looking for 17.5% to 18.5% for the year? And then longer term, I guess, with – Brian, with your leadership, I mean, how do you think about the long-term restaurant level margin at Chipotle as you talk about new day parts balancing sales versus margin? Yeah, Sharon. On the margin range, listen, we had a very nice quarter. It was aided by lower marketing – and the good news is Brian and Chris to the extent they came in and were able to look at what marketing was doing, they were able to redirect dollars, so they weren't spent. And so that's kind of dry powder. So that's dry powder that we have for future quarters. I think that's a very good thing. I would say the range of 17.5% to 18.5% now appears quite conservative. I don't know that I would change it. I think what I would do is say we're going to probably hit for the year at the high end that. Could we beat it slightly? Sure. I just wouldn't want to call it a victory just yet but getting out of the gates this strong does show that we have some great margin potential.
And then you wanted to know in terms of margin potential going forward. If you want general margin potential, Sharon, I can answer that. I still think that our margins are going to be highly contingent around volume. Like, for example, if we're in this 18.5% to 19% or so for this year, if we get up to $2.2 million volume, we could do a 22% margin. If we get to a $2.4 million volume, we could do a 24% margin. So, really the biggest lever to pull is bringing more customers in. If we bring more customers in we know that our model levers up pretty significantly. Our next question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Thanks very much and, Brian, good to hear your voice again. Congratulations. Two questions. One is when you look at the brand and you've looked at it from afar and now you're looking at it from the inside, how do you think about the price value relationship in this business versus the one you came from? Is there an opportunity for example to broaden the price value relationship so you can capture more customers? Are you happy with kind of the price value? So, think about just how you think about that price value equation for the brand going forward. And maybe just secondly, in your mind, what's the right timeframe for us to look at your initiatives that you're contemplating and how they're going to play out? In other words, is this a year of investment and the impact is really felt in 2019 or do you think there can be some meaningful impact and changes inside of 2018? Yeah, well, thanks and good to hear your voice as well. Look, here's what I would tell you is, the value proposition at Chipotle is tremendously strong. And now with that said, we will always be looking for innovation that continues to enhance that value proposition. The most important thing I think you can do for a healthy value proposition is to never get complacent on where you stand. So, we will be on the side of the consumer making sure that we give them the value proposition that excites them to come back over and over again. So, all the initiatives we'll be talking about, one of the ways that you make sure it's consumer relevant is it rings the bell for our customer on that value proposition. Whether that value proposition takes place in mobile, digital, loyalty, menu, access, those are all important things. So that's the one piece. You're second question about timeline. Look, here's what I would tell you is as opportunities present themselves, we will walk through those opportunities to grow the business. As we find opportunities that yield even bigger benefits through testing and learning and iterating, those things will probably take a little bit longer. But I think there are simple wins on our way to our path to what I think is going to be really accelerated opportunities in the future. So that's how I think about it. It's really a combination of both. We'll find some singles on our ways to finding home runs. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Hi, thanks for taking the question. So, obviously looking forward to the call that we're going to get in a month or two months with some more detail on this, but thinking about that call, is that something that's really going to be focused on where are the opportunities at the margin level, or to drive sales? Or should we be also thinking about there's going to be discussion of any sort of more structural changes, whether that's the balance sheet, is refranchising something that you're considering? How should we think about kind of what's on the table, or topics for discussion there? Yeah, what I would tell you is we're going to use that special call as the opportunity to give clarity even further into the strategy, the structure necessary to execute that strategy, and what those key focus areas are to put Chipotle on the path to performance that we believe is highly attainable. So, it will be comprehensive. And I think, you'll find it will be choiceful. And I think, there's power in simplicity, power in choice and power in a focused organization. So obviously it will be a comprehensive discussion and the good news is we'll have our entire leadership team present to be able to really discuss our path forward. Great. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Great, thank you. And congratulations again, Brian. Two things. One just on the comp recovery maybe from an outsider or actually most recently a competitor's perspective, I'm just wondering in your view what do you think's been the greatest impediment to the Chipotle recovery over the past couple of years? Hence, I guess, which of these initiatives you're talking about will be the most impactful I guess is a different way to look at it. And then the second question was just on the fact that you came from Taco Bell, which obviously there's lots of laterals, but the one thing that's quite different is Taco Bell being close to 100% franchise model, now you're in a 100% company operated model. Just wondering qualitatively how do you – how does the approach differ, whether you look at it as just pros and cons to the franchising versus the company operated side. I'm just wondering as you now come into your new role, how you have to think about things differently in that perspective? Thank you. Yeah, sure. So, look, I think to answer your first question, Chipotle, smartly, under Scott Boatwright's leadership has refocused the fundamentals in running these restaurants. We put clarity into roles. We've put focus on throughput and we've also put high expectations on the guest experience and the food experience we're going to provide. Those fundamentals are critical whether you own the restaurants or whether you franchise them to people. So there really is no tradeoff in what are the fundamentals to having a great restaurant? The other thing that I think Scott's done very well is he's put in a culture of accountability and a culture where people know they can count on each other to train, support and grow. And I think that is a foundational element for any upside that we will experience in this business.
We can never lose sight on running great restaurants and having great people that lead those restaurants and supporting them with a wonderful culture and tremendous opportunities. So that's the first piece. The second piece is I think the brand has been invisible. So, I think, if you combine great fundamentals in the restaurant with now a visible brand that has a powerful purpose and really craveable food, it's a recipe for a lot of opportunity that can play well in the ways that customers want to eat food today, and I believe how they want to eat food in the future. So, I'm tremendously excited about the fundamentals that we are maniacally focused on, coupled with identifying how we make this brand much more visible and get a narrative back out there in explaining what makes our brand different, what makes our brand connect with people, feel good about the way they eat and live, and why they can feel great about carrying the badge of Chipotle with them.
Oh, and I think, you had a question on franchising. You know, we see no need to go down that path right now, given the economic model that we have and the returns that we get with building new restaurants. So – but thanks for the question. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bitner from Oppenheimer & Company. Please proceed with your question. Thank you and, of course, congratulations, Brian, as well from me. I have two questions for you guys, both on just how you're thinking about the asset base. Jack, you talked about an asset base review. First of all, is there an initial smell test you are doing on the unit economic threshold required to earn the right to stay in the asset base that you can talk to us about? And then, Brian, you talked about looking at your unit base and improving the accessibility of it. Could the implementation of drive-thrus play a role in the accessibility strategy where it makes sense or is accessibility really just focused solely on digital? And I ask that question just in the spirit of where you came from, obviously seeing the benefits of drive-thrus. Thanks. Yeah, Brian, I'll address the first question on the asset base. No, we haven't changed our threshold for what is a high-returning asset. What we're looking at, though, is we had a number of restaurants that, before the drop in sales, were strong cash flow, strong returning stores. We opened a number of restaurants during a tough period where they got off to a slow start. So, our asset review is going to look at all the restaurants that are clear underperformers, and these would be negative cash flow stores. So, we're not looking at stores that are positive cash flow that the return is a little underperforming. We're going to look at stores that – restaurants are not cash flowing, that maybe we picked the wrong site, maybe they got off to a wrong start and made a bad first impression, and it's going to be difficult if not impossible to change that.
And to you give you an order of magnitude, the review, while we're still in the middle of it, we're looking at something less than 100 restaurants. So, it's not a huge list of restaurants, but that's kind of the total population that we're looking at. We'll review each and every one of them and we'll look at the whole story from a financial standpoint, from a real estate standpoint, from a what kind of first impression did we make, and then we'll make some very careful choices about what to do with the assets. Yeah, hey, Brian, this is Brian. So, your second question regard to access. You know, look, I think innovation and access, obviously you are not surprised by the idea that look, digital is a key piece of the puzzle, right? Whether it's through the mobile access, delivery as access, also kiosks as access, catering as access. I mean I love the list that I'm rattling off here. The trick for us is figuring out what comes first and how we prioritize it accordingly. Now, drive-thrus I think are an interesting proposition for Chipotle as an element. It'll be something that will definitely be a part of our access innovation program, but that's in the scheme of what's going to happen in the very near-term versus what's more of a longer-term access innovation play. Drive-thru would fall further on that longer-term scale. Our next question comes from the line of Matt McGinley from Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Hi. My first question is on the – for Jack, versus what you guided in February on the restaurant margins, it came in about 3 to 3.5 points better than expected, and we can see what is going to happen over the course of the year with COGS and labor expense, but a lot of that came from other operating expenses in this quarter, and I know that 150 bps was related to the ad spend shift, so, I'm curious what else in that line item would look better over the course of the year? Is that just not doing the maintenance or is there something else that's just looking better than you anticipated in that line item? Well, yeah, thanks, Matt. The food costs behaved really well. Avocados were something that took a bite out of our margins last year. They got better late in the fourth quarter and then they got better again. And you hear us talk about avocados kind of almost every year. It has a big impact when it goes up and down. Nearly 50% of our transactions include guacamole. And so, when prices shoot up, which by the way, they shot up from something below $30 a case to nearly $80 a case for part of the fourth quarter. So, they've come back to kind of normal prices. If they stay at normal prices, we should have a decent food cost during the year. Labor is kind of the same story in terms of wage inflation continues. We expect it to continue, and so, the guidance I gave you, I think, is very reasonable guidance. So, I think, we got off to a great start. I think the comments that Brian made about Scott and the field, our field teams did a great job of managing food costs to the extent that it was their job to order the right amount of food, to control food waste, things like that. They did great job. They've done a great job managing labor, as well. So, I think we're off to a great start. I think if we keep these kind of controls, the next big surprise or additive thing would be additional sales. And so, some of the things that Brian mentioned go into test and they test well, and if we put those into more restaurants and we get more sales, we know we have the ability to leverage our margins when we bring more customers in. And that would be the next thing to look for. Got it. So, Brian, I've heard a lot really from external people that when you look at the supply chain that Chipotle has versus other restaurant chains that just the way that food is prepped and the way that it flows through that supply chain, it always makes it harder to innovate at Chipotle versus other chains. Having been at other restaurant chains, do you feel that there's a big factor that sort of limits your innovation at that company? Or do you see it's kind of just green fields and there's a lot that you can do? Yeah, thanks for the question. Look, I actually think the -- I'll break up your comment. I guess supply chain meaning the ingredients that we use. I see no barrier to innovation. If anything, I see this great ingredients to be able to further distance ourselves from other restaurant alternatives. And then from the standpoint of then finishing that ingredient in the restaurant, it is a really powerful model. I mean if there's one thing that I've been really impressed by is the throughput capability of this line is something really special and unique. And I actually think it's an advantage to figure out how to do innovation that can build from a throughput machine. I don't think there are many places where you could say, well, I can have that great food, done at that speed, and then we can innovate on that foundation or that platform? And you'll see when we're talking about some of the innovation we're talking about. It just takes advantage of what I believe is a competitive advantage. So, I think, we're going to be able to innovate and distance ourselves and really put ourselves into what I believe is something very special that will delight customers and give our team members the ability to execute flawlessly. Great, thank you. You bet. Our next question comes from the line of Andy Barish from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Yeah, I was wondering on that – actually follow-up on a couple of those comments. If there is some throughput data you're willing to share kind of currently versus a year ago? And then secondly on innovation, not only supply chain, but just the physical plant and now the need for second make-lines. Is the space constraints make it more difficult to innovate or is that sort of an outmoded thought and there's ways to work around that with your fresh eyes viewing the business now? Yeah, thanks for the question. Because the second make-line is actually a huge enabler for our business to take throughput to the next level, frankly. And the reason is we've put digital capability into 250 plus restaurants, but the fact that we already have the second make-line physically there in all our restaurants is a huge opportunity for us to both innovate as well as drive throughput even further on our consumer-facing line as well as our second make-line. That second make-line has some efficiencies that we are delighted that we have in place because as we dial up the innovation in digital and we dial up that off-premise access, it presents a great opportunity for us to really enhance our throughput on both lines. Thank you. And then any throughput numbers you're willing to share or is it a little early for that? Look, we can probably get into those details. Scott will be available as part of the special call we're going to do and we're happy to take you through that then. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Great, hi, thank you. Hi, Brian. At Taco Bell, you guys put in both fourth meal, or the so-called late-night day part, as well as breakfast. And we've mentioned day part a couple of different times and I was wondering what that could potentially mean at Chipotle, whether it's different products at different times of the day which can happen certainly within a quick service or a fast-casual type of format, and whether it's possible to have breakfast without a drive-thru or maybe you can put breakfast in just the dense urban stores, while not necessarily putting them in suburban stores. Just thinking about what kind of potential you think day parts really means for the brand at this point. Yeah, sure. So, look, I think one of the things that's really exciting about the day part opportunity for Chipotle is today we're opening at 10:30, 10:45 and we're closing roughly around 10:00 PM, and there's opportunities to expand those hours and leverage our existing food and our existing platform in a very seamless fashion. Then when you look at the obvious day parts within those extended hours and you quickly see where there's opportunity where we have some down time where, frankly, I think with some marketing and some product innovation we could turn those down times into transaction-driving times. So, as I think about it right now, there is day part expansion opportunity with our current model and then you layer on some menu innovation coupled with some marketing communication, I see a real ability to drive the existing platform in those day parts without having to take the step today all the way through breakfast and introducing a whole new food platform. So, that's where our thinking is today. Not to say that in the future you may want to even expand those hours further and you need to think about new food platforms, but that's not in the plan right now. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Thanks. Hey, Brian. First a question on consumer scores. You mentioned something about becoming more consumer-centric. What is the consumer telling you about Chipotle today and the opportunities to improve, perhaps in ways that you've seen the brand deteriorated in those scores, and just in ways that you just feel like it's underachieving? And then separately, just building on that last thing that you mentioned, the operating model, everyone's always assumed that Chipotle's operating model, because they have those limited number of wells in front of us, doesn't have the ability to handle new menu news or even use price because of that simple menu. And those are two tools that you used with great effect in the past, and so, I think people are having a hard time understanding how you're going to use those going forward. So, that comment would be helpful, as well. Thanks. Sure. So, on your first question regarding the consumer. You know, what we see is a real opportunity to make the brand more visible and be more top of mind with people to remind them why they love Chipotle. When you remind people about the fact that they buy into this idea of Food With Integrity, cultivating a better world, they instantly feel better about the food they're eating. And we make good on that promise. So, I think there's a real opportunity to be much more visible on why you want to be connected to this brand, why do you believe in this brand. And based on the information I'm seeing, that resonates with how people want to eat today and how they will want to eat in the future.
Look, there's also huge opportunities to get people access – one of their biggest complaints, frankly, is access to the brand. The brand is not that convenient. I know we have 2,400 stores, almost 2,500 stores, we, as a result, are not that convenient to people. So, you've got people saying, hey, when can I do mobile ordering? When can I do delivery? When can I get Chipotle to me? And the good news is more than I think 50% of the people don't even realize that we started to do these things. So, there is tremendous opportunity of educating people on why they should feel good about the brand, why they will love the food, why it's craveable, because it gives them all of the customization, the abundance that they're looking for with the ingredients that they want. And then you combine that with now giving them more access and getting food to them on their terms, it's a really exciting proposition.
Your second question on our ability to innovate. The line has flexibility, so long as we first test and understand the demand that we're generating. If we prepare ourselves for what is going to happen, Scott and his operators will be capable to use our supply chain and our operating model to execute and meet consumers' expectations. Where you run into problems is when you get ahead of a forecast, and one of the things we're going to put in place here is when we are working on innovation, we're going to pilot that innovation so that we can have a prediction of what's going to happen and prepare the operating model accordingly to support it. So, I'm very optimistic about opportunities that just leverage getting more access to what Chipotle is today, and then you add some innovation and I think you broaden the appeal and we have predictability of what that's going to perform, Scott and the operators will be able to execute. Thank you. You bet. Our next question comes from the line of Gregory Francfort from Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Hey, guys. I have two questions. The first for Brian. Have you looked at portion sizing and your thoughts on whether or not consumers are paying you for your portion sizes now, if there's an opportunity to take that either up or down? And then I think you had also talked about employee turnover coming down recently. Any metrics around that and what do you think is driving that? Have you made any changes on the training front or -- the industry has been going up, and so that would be kind of impressive? I guess, I'm wondering what you guys are doing differently? Sure. So, the piece on employee turnover, I think that's a testament to Scott putting clarity of what you're supposed to be doing in your role, how you support each other in the restaurant, and then providing clarity of how you can grow in this organization. And people like to stay at places where they believe they're appreciated and they have the opportunity to grow, and that's the culture that we're putting into the restaurants and I think that's why you're seeing our turnover move down. And it's really exciting because the more we can push that turnover down, the more we don't find ourselves retraining the organization and we execute better. It's that simple. So, Marissa, who's new to the team, she's going to be laser-focused on how we drive this culture and training all the way through the restaurant while Scott partners with her to take from a culture of accountability to also a culture of growth. And I think you put those two things together, people will feel highly appreciated and believe that there's a future for them at Chipotle. What was your first question? The first question was just on portion sizing. Oh, portion sizing. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So, look, one of the things clearly that people love about Chipotle is the customization proposition and we're going to continue to figure out how we get more consistent in our execution for people, so that they don't feel like they got too much this time, or they got too little. But one of the things that I love about the experience, and the consumer knows, is we're a place that wants to get them the experience that they're after with their food. And that's not going to change. So, if people want a little more, we'll probably give them a little more. If they want a little less, we'll give them a little less. But regardless whether they're asking for a little more or a little less, one thing Scott is focused on is how do we continue to get more consistent, so people feel like they're getting the experience they got the last time as well then the experience they can count on for the next time. So, that's what we're focused on, is how do we get more consistent with that experience, but we're never going to tell the consumer you can't ask us for a little more or a little less. Understood. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles from Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question. Great, thank you, and just to echo, Brian, congrats again on the new role. Longer term question for Brian and a short-term one for Jack. So, Brian, as you think about the road ahead, can you help us compare and contrast the starting points? When you look at Taco Bell in 2011 and Chipotle in 2017, what do you think are the different factors at play here that help shape the turnaround, if you will? And then, Jack, you mentioned, as well, the similar comp trends that continued in April. How are you framing that? Just is that looking at it on a geometric three year or how should we think about that? Perhaps just for simplicity, if you just disclose the number, it might be helpful. So, why don't I go first, then I'll hand it over to you, Jack. So, look, here's what I believe for Chipotle. I believe the brand has been invisible and I think as the brand becomes visible and we lead culture, that's going to be a huge opportunity going forward. This brand needs to be leading culture, not reacting to it, and the people that are loyal to this brand, that's what they want to be a part of. The other piece that is very exciting about this company is, look, there is limited innovation happening in small scale and the opportunity for us is how do we take some of that innovation to pilot it and get it to a place where we can now do it at scale. And the opportunities, we talked about a few of them, right? They go from access to digital, to menu, to even the restaurant design opportunities going forward. That is huge opportunity.
A brand that has a lot of relevance, that's culturally right in leading, coupled with innovation, built on strong fundamentals that give people great food at a fast experience at a great value. I like the future. I really get excited about that because those are things that I think as we put together this leadership team here with Chris and Scott and Marissa and Jack and Curt and Lori, it is mission one to make this brand visible, and right next to it is be culturally relevant so all the innovation and the fundamentals that we put in place are going to, I think, attract people not only to work here but attract people to continue to be our loyal customers. And that's why I'm excited about the long-term. And, Andrew, in terms of what I looked at when I made the comments about April, we look at dollar trends, we looked at what our expectations were, based on what we expected with the Easter shift, what normal seasonality would bring. The weather definitely hit us during parts of the month. I'm sure that's not a surprise to you. From a comp standpoint, we looked at it mainly from a one-year comp standpoint. If you're going to do multiple years, you'd have to go back to three. A two-year trend will not give you anything meaningful. 2016 and 2017 lined up, 2016 was a step down, 2017 was a step up. So, if you wanted to do a three-year layer, you'll probably get in the same ballpark, but for purposes of what we did, we just kept it very, very simple, looked at April compared to where our previous trends were. And underneath it all, it looks like the trends were very similar when you factor weather out. Our next question comes from the line of Will Slabaugh from Stephens, Inc. Please proceed with your question. Yeah, thanks, guys. On the 5% pricing, and then maybe more specifically on longer-term pricing plans in general, I realize it's been a while since Chipotle has taken any meaningful pricing, but 5% is obviously a decent ways ahead of where the rest of the industry is. So, I'm curious, number one, if you plan to change the strategy to be more consistent in terms of low price increases, and number two, if you've seen any material difference in customer pushback to the pricing in some of the market that we've talked about as being lower performing markets in recent years, or if that 20% level that you talked about earlier has been fairly consistent. Yeah, the every three-year pricing, we've done it kind of three times in a row now. It's not necessarily strategy that we say, okay, no more price increases for the next three years. It just kind of happened this past time. We didn't want to do it while we were trying to bring customers back into the restaurant. Before that, labor inflation was very tame, and so we had strong comps and so we could lever our margin without resorting to pricing. It's a powerful advantage to have if you can continue to build your model, continue to expand leverage without constantly increasing menu prices. And so, we took advantage of that luxury. Going forward, we're going to do what we need to do. And if that means doing smaller, more regular price increases, we're certainly open to that. If we can lever our model, if we get the top-line going and we lever the model without a price increase, we think we can drive greater value to the customer. Customers always love it when they get greater value. So, we're not going to predetermine what and when we will do anything with pricing, but we're open to doing something other than kind of a three-year cadence.
And in terms of the resistance, we just don't see much resistance across the company. The only time we've seen it, and we've seen it in the past, as well. We see it a bit on the West Coast, and that's it. Otherwise, for the rest of the company, our customers think we provide a great value. And value is not just based on price. It's based on high-quality ingredients, it's based on a lot of food, it's based on an environment that they enjoy, and it's actually the value that we bring is a harder thing to bring, based on food, based on environment, based on the overall experience. Price is something that our consumers, sure, would they like to pay less? (1:02:27) Who wouldn't? But when they come to Chipotle and they get a great experience in a nice restaurant, the food is delicious, they call that a great value. Our next question comes from the line of Chris O'Cull from Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Oh, thanks, good afternoon. First, Jack, I apologize if I missed it, but what was the traffic decline in the quarter? And then secondly, Brian, several of the opportunities you mentioned to improve access for the brand seem to me, could take some time to build, but are there opportunities to quickly address the traffic declines you're seeing? Yeah, I'll answer on the traffic. The comp came from an increase in average check, and you can take the 5% price increase, it's less than 20%, which is rounded up to 20%. That added 4%. Queso added 2%. So, you can back into what the transaction impact was. So, you'd be in the 3.3% or so range, 3.3%, 3.5%, something like that, and so that's the underlying traffic. Yeah, and then to answer your question on what's my belief on the transaction opportunity going forward. Look, I think that's a real opportunity, and one of the things that Chris and the marketing organization are going to be centered on. And the good news is I believe the combination of the brand visibility, the innovation that I talked about, I think, there are opportunities in the near term that we can start putting into place and put into action that make it a material impact on our transactions. And then over time, you'll see the culmination of all these things coming together. I think, play an even bigger impact on the transactions and the number of people coming into our restaurants. So, it's really a combination of the digital, the menu, the access, programs like loyalty, those are all things that are going to be centered on making sure we are driving transactions as part of the proposition. Great. Thank you, guys. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Strelzik from BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Over the last couple years, there's been a shifting focus at different points in time trying to bring back sales among existing customers at some points and finding new customers at some points. I'm just wondering, Brian, do you think about the opportunity set in that way, the customer base in that way? And if so, where do you see the greatest opportunities over the next 6, 12, 24 months? Yeah, look. Here's what we know about our customers. Every age cohort loves Chipotle. Okay? And we over-index with young people. And this brand is a youthful spirit. It's a challenger, right? It's breaking convention of what accessible food done fast is. And that appeals broadly. So, our goal is not to be exclusive, our goal is to be inclusive, and our goal is to drive transactions with a youthful spirit, a meaningful positioning, and continue to leverage the strength of being a youthful brand that connects with youth. So, that's how I look at it. Obviously, Chris and I are digging deep into it because we need to understand the reasons why you either slowed down or increased your usage with us. And then we want to make sure we understand why all these different age cohorts are excited about being in the Chipotle business. Our goal is every category buyer to be coming to Chipotle. It's that simple. I probably won't get all of them in the near term, but I'm going to try in the long-term. Great, thank you very much. You bet. Our next question comes from the line of Brett Levy from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Hi, thank you. If you could share a little bit, Jack, this question is for you on the margins. You mentioned that you think you can get to the high end of the 17.5%, 18.5% range, and then you said you could possibly exceed it, but you also mentioned earlier that nothing is really being built into the plan with respect to what Brian's integration and his ideas can have. Can you just balance between what you were saying? Because it sounded like you said it's going to be without any implementation of Brian's strategies, but it also sounded like you were talking about some additional sales. Thank you. Yeah, I think you heard it right. We reiterated our guidance that comps will be in the low-single digits, so the margin comments deal with that assumption. To the extent we have strategies, that goes through pilot and are worthy of a rollout, meaning we expect to get a return on our investment. That's not included in the comp. It's just too early to know what those things might be or what the magnitude might be, so this is kind of a base case, if you will. Great, and, team, good luck. Thank you. Okay. Thanks, Brett. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session and I would like to turn the call back to Coralie for closing remarks. Thank you for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our special call in late Q2. Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Chipotle. Please go ahead. Hi, everyone, and welcome to our call today. By now, you should have access to our earnings announcement released this afternoon for the second quarter of 2018. It may also be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.chipotle.com.
Before we begin our presentation, I will remind everyone that parts of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements as defined in the securities laws. These forward-looking statements will include statements regarding the expected benefits from our strategic focus areas or specific business initiative; the potential opportunity for our digital sales; sales trends and forecasts for future comparable sales; expected new restaurant openings; estimates of future food, labor, marketing and maintenance and repair costs; statements about our expected effective tax rate and projections of the amount and timing of unusual cost items and stock repurchases as well as other statements of our expectations and plans. These statements are based on information available to us today and we are not assuming any obligation to update them.
Forward-looking statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements.

Our discussion today will also include non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which can be found on the presentation page of the Investor Relations section of our website.
I'd also like to remind everyone that we've adopted a self-imposed quiet period, restricting communications with investors during that period. The quiet period will begin on the 16th day of the last month of each fiscal quarter and continues until the next earnings conference call. For the third quarter of 2018, it will begin, September 16 and continue through our third quarter earnings release.
We will start today's call with some prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer, after which we will take questions.
In the room and also available during the Q&A period are Scott Boatwright, Chief Restaurant Officer; Curt Garner, Chief Digital and Information Officer; Chris Brandt, Chief Marketing Officer; Laurie Schalow, Chief Communications Officer; and Marissa Andrada, Chief Human Resources Officer.
And now, I will turn the call over to Brian Niccol. Thanks, Coralie, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report a solid second quarter with sales and restaurant level margins ahead of our expectations. Total sales grew 8.3% to $1.27 billion, driven by comparable sales of 3.3% and 34 new restaurants opened in the quarter. This positive comparable sales trajectory enabled us to expand restaurant level margins, which were up 90 basis points year-over-year to 19.7%. Earnings per share adjusted for unusual costs grew nearly 24% to $2.87 and our GAAP earnings were $1.68.
While Jack will go through the financials in more detail shortly, I'd like to put these results into context by discussing how the work our 70,000 employees do every day contributed to these financial outcomes.
Last month, we shared with you that we would execute our strategy to win today and cultivate the future by focusing on these five areas: becoming a more culturally relevant and engaging brand that builds love and loyalty; digitizing and modernizing our restaurant experience to create a more convenient and enjoyable guest experience; running great restaurants with great hospitality and throughput; being disciplined and focused to enhance our powerful economic model and building a great culture that can innovate and execute across digital, access, menu and the restaurant experience.
Today, I'll focus on how innovation in digital and access and how improving our operations contributed to this quarter's results. Let me begin with operations. We know that strong sales growth and margins are dependent on great operations, which is the hallmark of any healthy brand. This brand was founded on outstanding operations and real food. We're getting back to our roots.
When we have the right people leading the right teams and when those teams are well trained and operating with confidence, they execute great guest experiences. It takes time to build a culture of accountability and I'm pleased that we're seeing some encouraging signs of progress in key areas; namely our restaurant AB scores, a measurement system we implemented 1.5 years ago to drive greater accountability is trending in the right direction.
We are doing a better job staffing our restaurants to match sales volumes and we have lower year-over-year hourly turnover, which tells us we are making progress on training and building great teams.
Additionally, we have seen a meaningful decline in guest complaints and with that our guest satisfaction scores have improved since we started measuring them last year. This tells us that we made progress and that our guests are noticing the difference.
We know that when the food is delicious, the field of the restaurant is great and we removed the friction from the flow of the order process, no matter the channel we delight customers.
While I'm encouraged by our progress, we still have a lot of work to do. We have an opportunity to improve through-put, consistent execution of great food and consistent delivery of a great atmosphere. I'll outline some of the initiatives underway to address those opportunities.
We are halfway through our Big Fix initiative, which is designed to bring our restaurants back up to standards and make them uniquely Chipotle. This not only improves the guest experience as the appearance of our restaurants is clean and well-maintained for every guest, but the team member experience improves as well.
We overhauled our training materials several months ago and have retrained three quarters of our field leaders through Cultivate University. That's an in-restaurant and in-classroom one week training session that we launched in April, that investment in the ongoing development of our field leadership continue to drive crew member engagement.
We are supplementing that training with a new hospitality training program in the restaurants and we are in the early innings of refining our training to teach and taste the details, so that we achieve the winning combination of great food, feel and flow with every guest experience. We are zeroing in on how to get back to great through-put as speed of service is a foundational element of convenience that our guests truly value.
Late last year, we rolled out what we call the owner's path, a comprehensive review of our restaurants performance, equipping our field leaders with these tools improving their powers of observation and allowing them to focus on the critical details of delivering improved guest experience.
In addition, the tool creates teaching moments for their general managers and documents the corrective actions are taken when needed. We are currently rolling out a digital version for mobile phones and tablets of this previous paper-based tool, that should result in more consistent operations across our restaurants. We'll have this in place nationally by October.
We're also in the process of redesigning our forecasting and labor scheduling tool. This is significant undertaking, but necessary for us to have accurate sales forecasting and deliver the right amount of labor at the right time to meet the needs of our guests. The new tool will have a best-in-class sales forecasting component that will leverage machine learning to remove the guesswork of determining sales and labor needs for our business.
In addition, our team members will have the ability to see their schedules remotely and swap shifts from mobile phones, taking these tasks out of the hands of the manager. We believe leveraging technology such as this makes us a more desirable employer as we work to create a better experience for our crew members. We will continue to make investments in our restaurants because a better experience for our team members directly translates to a better experience for our guests.
I'd also like to talk to you about the progress we are making around the innovation in digital and access, as this was a real bright spot in the quarter. Today, our annualized digital sales are approximately $0.5 billion, and we are in the early stages of this multi-billion dollar opportunity. Our digital sales grew 33% in the quarter and now account for 10.3% of sales, an acceleration from 20% growth in the first quarter.
We now have 4 million active monthly users across our app and our website, a 65% increase since the end of last year. Delivery in group occasions were particularly strong this quarter. Delivery sales quadrupled in the quarter and we know from our customer research that improving access to Chipotle is an important growth lever, whether it be through adding more restaurants or enabling more convenience, like delivery.
Today, delivery is available from 1,700 restaurants and we expect that to reach 2,000 restaurants by year-end. We're also pleased that delivery is now an option available directly from our app.
Our group ordering business was solid in the seasonally strong quarter for catering orders. In mid-July, we expanded our Build-Your-Own catering offer nationally, whereby we lowered the minimum size and offered more price tiers for group orders, therefore expanding access for more occasions. We tested this enhancement earlier in the year and found that group order sales in our test stores outperformed the base by mid to high single digits. Delivery availability for catering expanded to two-thirds of our restaurants in the quarter.
As I've mentioned, Chipotle's second make-line enables the business to handle the incremental growth without any impact on throughput or the in-restaurant experience. I'm happy to see progress on digitizing our second make-lines, which are now in roughly 500 restaurants. We are targeting approximately 1,000 restaurants to be enabled with the digital second make-line by year-end and we are accelerating our rollout to reach completion by the end of 2019. These digital second make-lines have a direct positive impact on the team member and guest experience.
Also, the digital pickup shelf test in several New York City restaurants continues to show great promise and based on the results to-date, we will be expanding the test to a larger number of restaurants in several markets next month.
We've mentioned before that we are undertaking a wide-ranging consumer research project, with the results available this fall. I did, however, want to mention a few interesting highlights that we've uncovered so far. Access is the number one lever we can pull to drive sales, which supports our new unit growth as well as the innovation focus around access via our digital channels.
Additionally, we sit at an interesting intersection between fast food and fast casual, with many attributes such as value and speed that are typically associated with fast food and attributes such as quality and freshness, which are typically associated with fast casual.
We're particularly strong with Millennial and Generation Z customers relative to most brands and when these groups try us, our odds of repeat visits are much higher. These early insights give us confidence that new news and the more engaging marketing that you're beginning to see will allow us to drive transaction growth.
Also, I'm pleased with the speed at which we're getting transaction-driving initiatives across digital, access, loyalty and menu into test markets. The combination of these test markets and our early insights from our consumer research will inform our plans in 2019 and beyond.
Before I turn it over to Jack, I want to thank all of our team members across the country that are working diligently to serve our guests real food, cooked to perfection and prepared in our restaurants with fresh ingredients just the way our guests like it. This hard work is the basis for all of our future success and we appreciate it tremendously.
Now over to you, Jack. Thanks, Brian. I'm really pleased that our team is focused on our five strategic priorities, has contributed to a high quality quarter with comp sales of 3.3% and a 19.7% restaurant level margin. And underlying earnings were also strong after adjusting for a number of unusual costs during the quarter.
As we discussed on our call last month, we'll continue to see costs over the next few quarters associated with our restructuring, relocation and underperforming store closures. These charges also have a temporary impact on our tax rate, which I'll talk about in more detail later.
We generated revenue of $1.27 billion during the quarter, an increase of 8.3% from last year, on comp sales growth of 3.3%. That's on top of last year's strong 8.1% Q2 comp sales increase. Restaurant level margins of 19.7% expanded 90 basis points from last year and normalized earnings per share adjusted for the unusual items was $2.87. The second quarter had unusual expenses mostly related to the transformation and that negatively impacted EPS by about $1.19, leading to a GAAP earnings per share of $1.68.
In Q2, we expensed about $25 million in expenses related to restaurant asset write-offs, approximately $16.5 million related to office closures and $7 million related to the restructure of our organization and other unusual expenses. These charges were offset by a non-recurring benefit of about $6.5 million related to lower stock comp expense as a result of the restructure. As a result of these transformation expenses, our tax rate increased about 400 basis points, which I'll explain later.
The Q2 comp at 3.3% was primarily driven by higher average check due to the price increases taken over the last year as well as queso add-ons. The price increase average about 4% in the quarter and customer resistance to the price increase remains at or below 20%. The menu price impact was lower than Q1, as we lapped the first increase from April of last year in about 20% of the restaurants.
Sales trends in the first three weeks of July continue to mirror what we saw in Q2 with the comp increasing over the last week or so, as we've begun to compare against those softer trends from last year. So overall, comps should improve from the 3.3% in Q2.
However, keep in mind, that comparisons will get tougher later in Q3, as we lap the introduction of queso in early September, which initially added about 3.5% to the comp, before settling into a sustained benefit to the average check of about 2%. And in November, we will lap the price increase in about 1,000 restaurants, which added an additional 1.3% pro-rated impact to the comp.
Based on second quarter results and expected improvement in the Q3 comp, we're increasing our full-year comp sales guidance from low single-digits to a low to mid single-digit comp range.
We opened 34 new restaurants in the quarter and expect to be at the lower end of our 130 to 150 new opening guidance for the full-year. While we're still building inventory for next year's openings, we continue to expect 2019 openings will be at or above the 2018 levels. Our new restaurants this year have opened strong and we're continuing to emphasize high quality, high returning to restaurants as we build out our pipeline.
As mentioned on our last call, we expect to close between 55 and 65 underperforming restaurants; and today, we're closing 29 Chipotle restaurants. During the second quarter, we closed five Pizzeria Locale in Kansas and Ohio and we also closed three Chipotle restaurants including one relocation. So, today's closures about half of the underperforming restaurants have now closed.
Food comps for the quarter were 32.6%, a decrease of 150 basis points from the 34.1% in Q2 of last year. The decrease from last year was driven by the menu price increase and more favorable avocado prices. The decreases were slightly offset by elevated prices for our steak and barbacoa.
We expect food cost to increase to the low 33% range in Q3, due to the seasonal shift to source higher cost avocados from California and an uptick in paper and packaging costs. We expect to be closer to the 33% in Q4, as we begin to shift the supply of avocados back to Mexico.
Labor costs for the quarter were 27%, an increase of 80 basis points from the 26.2% in Q2 of last year. The increase from last year was driven primarily from wage inflation of about 6% and increased restaurant manager bonus cost as we returned to normalized bonus payouts, rewarding our managers for delivering strong results. These increases were offset by leverage from the menu price increase.
I expect labor cost to increase to the high 27% range in Q3 and to the mid 28% range in Q4 and these increase are driven primarily by seasonally lower sales in Q3 and Q4 and by general wage pressures.
Occupancy cost for the quarter were 6.9%, which is flat with last year. Other operating costs for the quarter were 13.8%, a decrease of 20 basis points from Q2 of last year. Our marketing and promo cost were 3.2% in the quarter, a decrease of about 40 basis points compared to Q2 of last year. We expect marketing and promo cost to be at or slightly above 3% of sales for the full-year with elevated spending continuing in Q3 and Q4.
Other operating cost continue to include about 30 basis points of higher maintenance and repair cost, which we first discussed on our Q4 call and we expect M&R to continue with this elevated level for the rest of the year.
G&A in the quarter increased by $8 million compared to Q1 of this year. The increase compared to last quarter was primarily due to the stock comp forfeitures and the timing of the 2018 equity grant that we discussed on the last earnings call.
As I mentioned earlier, G&A also included $7 million in charges related to the restructuring and additional unusual charges in the quarter, but those were offset by a $6.5 million non-recurring benefit related to revising our estimates of forfeitures, related to stock grants from employees expected to leave the company.
G&A increase compared to Q2 of last year was primarily in support of our restaurant growth, digitizing our restaurant experience and operational leadership changes in the field.
Depreciation expense for the quarter was 3.9%, an increase of 40 basis point from the 3.5% in Q2 of last year. This increase is due to the accelerated depreciation for items we're replacing were related to the maintenance and repair refresh as well as capital initiatives that we described on our Q4 call.
We expect the increase related to the refresh to fall off in the second half of the year. However, it will be replaced by accelerated depreciation and restaurant closures we detailed earlier. As a result, we expect depreciation to remain at this elevated level for the rest of this year.
Our pre-tax income was $70 million and our reported effective tax rate was 33.3%. Our tax rate was higher than the 29% underlying rate we discussed on our last earnings call and is a direct result of the $42 million in unusual expenses this quarter. Without these charges, our tax rate would have been right around at 28.5% effective rate and we expect to return to a roughly 29% rate next year when the transformation charges are fully behind us.
This underlying rate of about 29% may be affected in future years by stock comp vesting and exercises when the benefit realized by our employees varies from our accounting treatment and we'll fully call out these impacts as they occur.
We continue to expect the transformation cost on the restructuring, restaurant closures and other unusual cost will total between $115 million and $135 million with most of that amount hitting in 2018.
We estimate that about $50 million to $55 million will hit in Q3 with most of the remainder in Q4. There will likely be some charges related to terminating restaurant and office leases that will spill into 2019. We'll also write-off about $10 million in deferred tax assets, beginning in Q4 with most hitting in 2019 as fully vested, but underwater options will likely expire as we complete the restructure of the organization.
In Q3, we expect our effective tax rate to be right around 30.3%, or about 130 basis points higher than we guided last quarter. In Q4, we expect our tax rate to be as high as 43% or about 450 basis points higher than we guided last quarter. Both of these increases are due to a lower pre-tax income as a result of the transformation expenses.
As mentioned during our Q1 call, our Q4 rate is impacted by performance shares that will likely expire in that period, because their performance shares will only vest if the stock price is over $700. We took deductions on these performance shares over the years, but if they prove worthless, we won't get a tax benefit contributing to the estimated 43% tax rate.
We'll continue to provide more specifics on future transformation-related costs, when we have more certainty around the timing and we will continue to break out the unusual costs for normal cost you can follow the underlying trends.
We're encouraged by our second quarter results and the contributions of our restaurant teams have delivered an excellent guest experience. We're also encouraged by our guest response to our digital initiative so far along with the solid sales and restaurant-level margin performance during the quarter.
We're confident that significant changes we're making to our organization will enable us to continue to improve operational excellence in our restaurants to be more nimble and innovative in digital, access, menu and the restaurant environment and to execute better to deliver on our commitments to our guests, our employees and our shareholders.
And now, we're happy to take your questions. Our first question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Yeah. Hi, thank you. Just on the 2Q, the implication is with four points of price, I think that you saw some negative traffic and I guess how do you turn that around? And, in particular, you talked about really a lot of growth in digital usage. But do you think you're substituting – just substituting from walk-in orders? Or can you actually tell that these orders are incremental? And are you starting to build a database of your customers that might allow for better targeted marketing? Thanks. Yeah. Thanks for the question. Obviously, I think I did mention in the early remarks, a lot of our new transaction driving initiatives are getting ready to head to pilot and we also are working on some new marketing communication as well.
So, I think as those things start to enter markets and then we gain learnings on how to improve those programs and then plan for national execution, the goal is to use the stage gate process than to inform what our sales transaction performance is going to be going forward. The good news is our price increase that we passed-through has passed-through nicely.
We're not seeing customer accounts retreat versus anything we've seen historically when we take pricing. I mean regarding your question on digital sales, obviously there's multiple elements to that, right? There's the delivery aspect. There's our catering and then there's also the app or website orders. And we see varying degrees of incrementality across each of those spaces. The thing that we do know though is, when we get a digital orders through that second make-line, the economics of that order are very attractive and then our customer satisfaction scores also are very attractive.
So, we continue to see improvements on accuracy and speed at which we're getting people the food they want, when they want, where they want it. So, still a lot to learn and actually when we get the pilot going on our loyalty program, I think that's going to give us another level of insight in understanding on exactly how all these transactions are interacting with each other and that's a new skill we're going to be building for the organization going forward. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Tarantino. Please proceed with your question. Hi, good afternoon. Just maybe a clarification question on the comps for the quarter. Could you maybe explain how the trend transpired as the quarter progressed? It's not as if on the last call you might have started a little slow and then maybe picked up later in the quarter. But is that accurate? Or how should we think about that? Yeah, David. I think that is accurate. We talked on the last call that in April because of weather and the seasonal shift of Easter that we got off to a slow start. May was a great month for us. That's when we had the DoorDash promotion, so May looked great.
And then June settled in right at about the overall average for the month, so I would say the overall comp of 3.3% is a good kind of gauge for what the underlying trend was, a little less in April more in May, but then we settled out right in the middle in June. So, we feel good about the way that we ended the quarter and how we're entering the third quarter now. Great. That's helpful. And then I guess, Jack or Brian, that does suggest a little bit of underlying improvement in at least the way we look at the business on a sequential basis on traffic. So, could you maybe talk about what you think drove that improvement, whether it was the operations improvements you talked about? And then on the operations improvement, in particular, is there any sort of deeper look at that data that would suggest that's moving the needle as you kind of split the restaurants that are doing the best from the worst apart from one another? Yeah. Look, I don't think it was just one thing. The good news is, though, as I mentioned earlier, we've seen improvement in our operations on all the key metrics. And we continue to hear more and more positive customer feedback on their experiences and fewer, or a reduction in customer complaints.
And we believe there's even more opportunity for us to get even better on throughput going forward, so we're pleased with the progress we're making on ops. We also saw in the quarter people really responded positively to the advertising that we put out there, and then obviously, we've seen very positive responses to varying elements of our digital program.
So, I think it was a combination of multiple things, not one thing that drove it and that's what has us excited about how we're moving forward with all the pilots across the business. We're making progress, I think, on ops. We're making progress on digital, and we're making progress on really understanding our customer base better. So that, look, we get the brands, the right message then with the right food at the right place with the right value. I think we'll continue to see improvement in our performance. Great. Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Nicole Miller with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your questions. (26:09-26:14) culture of accountability. Could you talk a little bit more about maybe how it's changed to work in the store day-to-day and how are you aligning that with incentives to have the employees make these changes? Hey, Nicole, I think we missed the first part of your question. Could you just start from the beginning? Absolutely. Thank you. So asking about the culture of accountability, and I thought it was helpful how you talked about how that translated to the customer engagement or improved guest satisfaction. So, what I'm wondering is from the employee perspective, in that store, how is it different to work there today than before, and what are the incentives that you have put in place to keep them aligned with your culture of accountability? Yeah. Thanks for the question. Obviously, one of the things that I think Scott has done a nice job in the field is the accountability is both on developing a great team as well as being accountable to providing a great experience for the customer.
So, I think we're starting to see our teams being more staffed correctly, engaged at another level than where they had been over the last couple years, and everybody has clarity on what their role is on the team. And I think we've talked about this in the past. But, we've given everybody their kind of top five responsibilities, which then gives the team the ability to trust that each other is going to be doing what they need to do for them to be successful.
And then to your question on incentives, yeah, we moved to some quarterly bonus programs. And we've seen that actually have a material impact on our employee satisfaction with – when they make great progress then they get rewarded much closer to when they have that success.
So, I think it's a combination really of making sure that we're holding ourselves accountable to great experience, but also holding ourselves accountable to develop a great team and then obviously rewarding them when they have successes. And then just a final question, when you think about the structural framework previously of a $2 million AUV translating loosely to a 20% store level margin. You're doing that, yet you have over 3 percentage points of marketing that is at least twice as much as what it had been historically. So, it seems that there might be more leverage in the model. Is there any kind of framework you could give or update for us to think about as we model going forward? Thanks. Yeah, Nicole. We've also got M&R just a little high as well. So, I mean, the results we're seeing in the last couple of quarters, give us even more confidence that the model at $2 million gets you right about in that high-teens to 20% margin. And as we grow the volume from there, we think we can move back up into the 20-plus percent margin. So, the things that we thought the model can do, I think we're starting to see that they're coming to life. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Thanks. Good evening. Brian, you mentioned some statistics earlier about how the fast casual occasion perhaps overlaps with that of fast food in some ways with younger generations and that trial seems to be important with those consumers. I'm trying to understand, what you're seeing and saying about the opportunity there in the past?
I think Chipotle tried to get trial going coupons and the like with this understanding that if you get trial they'll come back. But how are you thinking about marketing perhaps different than that and using the data you're seeing? Thanks. Sure. Yeah. So, I think I mentioned this in our call a couple weeks ago. We've got a big foundational consumer study out and we're starting to get some top line in. And what we have definitely seen is when people try the brand and have a positive experience with it, their intent to stay with the brand is much higher than a lot of our competitors in both fast casual as well as fast food. And it's very exciting because when we look at younger people we're getting even more positive response to intent and then intent to stick with us. So, that's what I was referencing.
And in the brand obviously, I think we all instinctually see this, it is very much a purpose-driven brand that syncs up nicely with Gen Z and Millennials and we're seeing that play out in our research as well. So, we're going to want to continue to build on that strength as we move forward. And Jack, you mentioned the restructuring expense that you expect. I know, it's not typical necessarily in the sector, but could you talk about the dollar savings you anticipate, or maybe the return on investment from these store closures and restructuring expenses and the timing of that? Any color would be helpful. Thanks. Yeah, David. The restaurants we're closing, these are all cash flow losing restaurants. We've got about half of them closed right now. So kind of take before we can see the full effect, we're going to have them all closed. But we should pick-up somewhere in the 20 basis points, 30 basis points of margin once they're all closed. So, there's a definite improvement in our margin returns from that standpoint.
Most of the other costs that's more with restructuring the organization, they're going to be returned on that. It's not going to be as black and white or linear. The return is going to be on having a culture that's more innovative, a culture that's more results-oriented and we think there's going to be lots and lots of benefit there, but it's going to be less of a cause and effect where we can tell you what the actual return is. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Hi, this is actually Jared on for Karen. Can you guys give us a sense of maybe delivery as a percent of your total sales at this point and maybe just some context about how delivery is contributing to stronger comp in 2Q versus 3Q? Yeah, delivery is a piece of that 10% number that I mentioned earlier on our digital sales and what we're seeing is, today we're in 1,700 restaurants. We'll be expanding closer to 2,000 here shortly. Really, the delivery performance not surprising right now what we're seeing is it really is impacted by how we promote it, because we're in the early days of getting people to understand that it's available.
I think at the last number I saw we still have over 50% of customers not realizing Chipotle is available for delivery. So, we're seeing some variability in the delivery performance based on how we promote with these partners. The thing that is exciting though is, we are seeing – when we hit that bump, we don't fall below where we were. So, we're continuing to see progress. And I think over time as we build awareness, build a habit, I think we'll see this play a bigger and bigger role in getting us into an on-premise engagement. Thanks. And if I could just follow-up with one more. Have you guys seen any learnings early on the new menu test items that you have in test right now? Thanks. Sure. I think I mentioned this earlier. We're actually – you've seen the products in our NEXT Kitchen where that's really just the look of operational execution and we're just getting ready to use our stage gate process to move a handful of initiatives into an actual test market, where we'll be at scale, where we'll start to really have true learnings of customer experience, team member experience and then how that plays out on total Chipotle performance. So too early to comment on any of those items right now. Thanks for the color. Our next question comes from the line of Andy Barish with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Hey guys. Two things. Just on – can you help us understand as you start to lap, I think, you mentioned, Jack, the July issues last year in Virginia just how we should think about that maybe 500 basis points or 600 basis points decline in traffic kind of coming back? Yeah, Andy. There's a couple things going on right now. We're also comparing against, right now, SAVOR.WAVS. So, we did see a nice uptick in a comp in the last week or so as we compare it to the soft tail from last year, but SAVOR.WAVS happened as well which there was a big BOGO, a lot of buy-one, get-one and so that's creating a little bit of noise, but we do expect to see much more attractive traffic and much more attractive sales comps over the next several weeks. And that'll only be slowed a bit as we compare to the launch of last year, which I talked about in my prepared comments. So, yeah, we're already seeing the positive effect from the comparison to last year, to the softness from last year. Got you. And then anything on sort of pricing as you do the research on the brand? The ability to be a more regular menu price increase taker instead of every several years as has been the case in the past? Yeah. So one of the things, we're definitely looking to understand is exactly the health of our value equation. The good news is our value continues to be very strong, and what we're assessing right now is, what is the right approach to sequence in pricing over time, making sure, we don't ever get ahead of a great value equation. So, that's part of the consumer research, frankly, that we've got going on right now. As we get those learnings back, it will inform, how we approach pricing going forward. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Please proceed with your question Hey, guys. This is actually Jeff Priester on for Jeff Bernstein. Operationally, given all these initiatives, including your potential new items coming from the NEXT Kitchen and I know in New York some of the pickup shelves around the end of your actual make line. Is there going to be an issue down the line where implementing some of these initiatives, where you need to expand the line or reorganize it to get some of these things out there? And then I have one follow-up. Yeah. Sure. So, I think I mentioned this before. Obviously, everything we're looking at has to be thoughtfully executed, so that the throughput engine of Chipotle is not jeopardized. And I think I mentioned this earlier, there's some projects that frankly just are bolt-ons. So like a digital shelf pickup. That actually improves the customer experience and the team member experience, because it eliminates that confusion for where the mobile order person is supposed to go, that awkward moment at the cashier. It eliminates a lot of that.
So, that in our opinion is a throughput enabler, because two things happen. One, it merchandises the fact that you can do this mobile ordering and not have to go through the line. And then the second piece is, it really takes advantage of our second make-line, which is I think a huge advantage to open up an off-premise business.
But look, the varying initiatives, if it comes with needs for new equipment, we'll test out the new equipment and make sure that it works and plays nicely with the throughput engine that we have. If it doesn't, then that's why we use the stage gate process to learn and figure out how we try again.
And it's going to be an iterative process with us. So, I'm very excited that we're going to start the process of seeing some of these pilots get into market, so that we protect the integrity of what's made Chipotle great, while we figure out how we enhance relevance and dial up engagement. Great. And then on delivery, can you give us a sense of the average check you're seeing relative to your dining customer and then as well as the number of customers per order, the number of entrées per order, however you want to approach it? Yeah. I mean, we see obviously a nice increase in our digital orders. So the mobile and delivery orders are in that $16 to $17 range versus our traditional check is in the $12 range. And we're still learning, frankly, what is the order size that comes with it versus additional attachments like chips and guac and queso and so on and so forth. But we're really seeing a blend right now of both. There are times we see more add-ons and then there are times where clearly it's a larger group occasion that's off-premise that's ordering through the app or through the delivery third-party. Great. Thanks. Sure. Our next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Hi, this Brandon (39:38) on for John. I believe on the first quarter call, you mentioned that you expected marketing and promo to be elevated throughout the remainder of the year. Do you still expect that to play out throughout the back half of 2018 here? Yes, it will be a little elevated. We were light in the first quarter. We were 3.2%. This past quarter, we'll be right at about that same 3.2%. So, overall for the year, we'll average right at about 3% for the overall year. Got it, Okay. And then I just had a follow-up. You mentioned in your prepared remarks restaurant AB and guest set scores are beginning to trend in the right direction. Could you elaborate on that comment, maybe quantify some of those improvements? Yes. So, the restaurant AB is the measurement tool that we use that's a couple of metrics that are very important to us that cover financials, people, guest experience and the team, okay. And what we're happy to see is we're seeing a nice move from Bs to As, and that's a good sign. So, it's a very important metric. It's one that Scott keeps a laser eye on and it's a good way for us to understand how we're performing in our restaurants and how we're actually making progress. Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Jake Bartlett with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question. Great. Thanks for taking the question. First, I just wanted to get a sense for how much of the initiatives are driving or how much the improved outlook in the back half is driven by the initiatives or driven by the easy compares?
And I know with in terms of the initiatives, there's a lot of unknown timing, but maybe if you could talk about what you do know. For instance, I believe when you get your study back on the consumer that that's going to be the source of a new advertising campaign, maybe some impact of the change in the new catering menu. I'm thinking about the shelf roll-out. You just mentioned how kind of a no-brainer it is. I mean is that really a test that's going on? Or is that just kind of, should we expect that to be rolled out here in the back half? You know what, I didn't hear the last part of your question, but let me answer the first part, which is, as we talked about our guidance, it's got nearly zero on the initiatives that we've been talking about that we are putting into pilot and that we're going to start expanding over the course of the year.
And what we're seeing right now, I think is what I mentioned earlier, which is, I think we're seeing a nice improvement in our operational performance. I think we've got more visible, more effective, more relevant marketing out there and I think we've done a nice job of expanding access to our digital efforts.
I think it's going to continue to be the combination of all those things plus as we get some learning on loyalty and potentially some new menus items down the road, that we'll see initiatives play hopefully a bigger role going forward. But as of right now, there's – I think it's very minimal. And what was the second part of your question? The second part was just your initiative like the shelves, the pickup shelves. You mentioned kind of it's a no-brainer operationally. I mean what is the obstacles to just kind of rolling that out and not considering the test, but kind of just seeing a roll out. What is there to test with them? Yeah. So look I think as an organization we're going to be a test and learn organization before we go launch. And even though going into where we put it in these five stores, our early indication were it's a no-brainer. The good news is in the first five stores it went as we hoped. And as a result, we're expanding now four, five markets in virtual order and the goal is keep assuming we continue to see the positive performance. We'll get it across the system very shortly thereafter. Great. And Jack a clarification on the tax guidance. I'm just looking if I think about adjusted earnings and comparable to the $2.87 that you mentioned today, I look at the adjusted tax rate there and it's 28.5% is my estimate. So, when you think about the third quarter effective tax rate that you've mentioned in the fourth quarter is that more relevant to GAAP earnings? Or is that relevant to the adjusted earnings we might be focused on? Those rates are more GAAP earnings. The underlying rates are going to be more similar to what we talked about on our last call. So, the higher tax rate that you're seeing this time compared to what we talked about on our first quarter call are directly attributable to the fact that we've got all these charges. It's just pushing our income down and so it ends up pushing our rates up. When we normalize our earnings like, for example, in this quarter, our normal tax rate would be at that 28.5% range. Got it. And then last question, just because I think there is some confusion around depreciation as I look at different estimates fairly-wide range. Could you help us understand what is accelerated depreciation in 2018 and will not going to occur in 2019? And maybe whether you think that depreciation as a whole would be potentially less in 2019 than the 2018 overall? Yeah, 2019 will definitely be less. We're at a higher level this year. Let's call it 30 basis points or so. That's due to two things. One is due to retiring assets as a result of our refresh. We're investing in operating our restaurant. So that requires accelerated depreciation on the items that are going to be taken out of the restaurant.
And then secondly part of the restaurant that haven't closed yet, we leave a little bit on the books, GAAP requires that you leave a little bit of the asset on the books and then you right that off over the remaining time that you expect to have restaurants to be open.
And so as the M&R that we're doing the refresh that we're doing as that depreciation levels off, that'll be replaced by this higher depreciation from the stores that we're going to close, but that should fall off. Most of it should fall off this year, maybe in early next year and then our depreciation should go to more than normal historical rates. Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session and I would like to turn the call back over to Chipotle CEO, Brian Niccol for closing remarks. Okay. Well, thank you everybody. I know this is a busy earnings time, so I appreciate everybody taking the time to listening to our results and have a discussion of the business. And thanks again and I'm sure we'll be in touch. Take care. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

And welcome to the Chipotle Q3 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Coralie Witter. Please go ahead. Hi, everyone, and welcome to our call today. By now, you should have access to our earnings announcement released this afternoon for the third quarter of 2018. It may also be found on our Investor Relations website, at ir.chipotle.com.
Before we begin our presentation, I will remind everyone that parts of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Securities laws. These forward-looking statements will include statements regarding our outlook for the fourth quarter, the potential of a number of our digital sales strategies, sales trends and forecasts for future comparable sales; expected new restaurant openings; estimates of future food, labor, marketing, and maintenance and repair costs, and G&A spend; statements about our expected effective tax rates, and projections of the amount and timing of transformation and restructuring costs and stock repurchases, as well as other statements of our expectations and plans. These statements are based on information available to us today, and we are not assuming any obligation to update them.
Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We refer you to the risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as updated in our subsequent Form 10-Qs for discussion of these risks.
Our discussion today will also include non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which can be found on the presentation page of the Investor Relations section of our website, which can be found at the link included on the Presentations page.
I'd also like to remind everyone that we have adopted a self-imposed quiet period, restricting communications with investors during that period. The quiet period will begin on the 16th day of the last month of each fiscal quarter and continues until the next earnings conference call. For the fourth quarter of 2018, it will begin December 16, and continue through our fourth quarter earnings release.
We will start today's call with some prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer, after which we will take questions. Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A period.
And now, I will turn the call over to Brian Niccol. Thanks, Coralie, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report our third quarter results, which demonstrated that our strategies to win today and cultivate a better future are working.
Total overall sales grew 8.6% to $1.2 billion, driven by comparable restaurant sales increases of 4.4%, and 28 new restaurants opened in the quarter. The positive comp sales trends enabled us to expand restaurant level margin, which were up 260 basis points year-over-year, to 18.7%. Earnings per share adjusted for unusual cost grew 62%, to $2.16, and our GAAP earnings were $1.36. While the quarter experienced some sales headwinds, we had a noticeable lift in sales with the launch of our new 'For Real' marketing campaign in late September. And that increase has sustained through October. Marketing that drives culture, drives difference, and drives purchase combined with great operations, drives results.
Additionally in Q3, key growth initiatives moved forward at a healthy pace. And the team executed with excellence the relocation, the restructuring, the hiring of new talent, and our All Managers' Conference. We exited the quarter with momentum, which sets us up for a solid fourth quarter. And we remain focused on building a culture of innovation and great execution that will drive sustainable long-term growth.
Before I dive deeper into this quarter's bright spots, I'd like to take a step back to remind you that our strategy to win today and cultivate the future is based on five focus areas: one, becoming a more culturally relevant and engaging brand that builds love and loyalty; two, digitizing and modernizing our restaurant experience to create a more convenient and enjoyable guest experience; three, running great restaurants with great hospitality and throughput; four, being disciplined and focused to enhance our powerful economic model; and five, building a great culture that can innovate and execute across digital, access, menu, and the restaurant experience.
This quarter, we made strides towards becoming a more culturally relevant and engaging brand. Our 'For Real' campaign celebrates what is uniquely Chipotle, that our food reflects our belief that there is a connection between how food is raised and prepared and how it tastes. Real flavors, real ingredients, and real cooking techniques result in food that simply tastes better.
We are making much better use of our advertising budget by more effectively communicating who we are and by being in better communication channels, thereby increasing our resonance and visibility. We'll continue to be present on national TV through the middle of November, and the 'For Real' messaging will remain visible in digital and social channels for the balance of the year. Going forward, you can expect Chipotle to have a presence in national media where and when it makes sense and to have an always-on social and digital program.
While we are a brand that speaks to everyone, our consumer research tells us that we are particularly relevant to millennials and Gen Z consumers who share our values. And our customers also want to be our employees. During September, we hosted our All Managers' Conference and it was clear from looking at our general managers and field leaders in the audience, that they reflect our customer base. Our teams came away from this conference energized around our purpose, our values, and our goals, and ready to get back to their restaurants armed with inspiration and information on how to improve the hiring experience, the training experience, and the guest experience.
In Q3, we made progress on our purpose of cultivating a better world with the announcement of a new accelerator program called the Chipotle Aluminaries Project. This is funded by our Chipotle Cultivate Foundation to help food-focused growth stage ventures that share our belief of cultivating a better world and are seeking to disrupt the current food landscape and take their business to the next level. We are using insights from our consumer research to refine our innovation pipeline and how we communicate with our guests. We continue to hear that the number one reason that consumers eat elsewhere is because they don't have convenient access to Chipotle.
Expanding the reach of our digital system remains a key priority in providing our guests with easier access and greater convenience. The digitized second make lines are now in nearly 750 restaurants, and continue to be on track to be in all restaurants by the end of next year. The digital pick-up shelves are now in nearly 350 restaurants, and we are moving quickly to get them in all our restaurants before the middle of 2019. We continued to build momentum in digital this quarter, with digital sales growing 48%, accelerating from the year-over-year growth rates we saw in the first half of this year, and now accounting for 11.2% of sales.
App downloads have increased 25% since last quarter, and we are seeing strong interest from new and infrequent customers as well as frequent customers. As was the case last quarter, we are seeing particularly strong momentum from delivery. In Q2, we added DoorDash as a new partner, and in Q3, we added delivery capabilities directly from our app and website. A free delivery promotion from our app in September drove an acceleration in delivery sales in the quarter. We continue to see good incrementality in delivery and we see very little customer overlap between our in-app delivery and our third-party delivery partner app. We are pleased with how delivery in our app is attracting and retaining new and lapsed customers, and the results we're seeing across our delivery channel has validated our strategy to be available wherever and however our guests want to access us.
As we continue to remove friction from the digital ordering and pick-up process, we would expect our delivery time advantage to continue to widen. Our current average delivery time is under 30 minutes, already making us one of the most attractive choices for customers on our delivery partners' website, and this will keep getting better. As part of our goal to increase access, we are also exploring new formats that leverage digitally-enabled convenient. We're pleased with the early results from our initial digital pick-up lane restaurants and we will expand this test to additional new restaurants in 2019 across several markets. These restaurants have a convenient drive-up window for guests to pick-up digital orders. It's clear from these tests that our guests appreciate the added convenience as these restaurants generate digital sales that are far above our national average. This format is also a win for operations, as the window leverages our digital make-line.
We're also excited about our loyalty test, which launched in September in three test markets. It's very early, but sign-ups look promising, and we'll evaluate and learn from the loyalty test as it moves through the stage-gates in preparation for national launch during 2019. We also have a number of menu items going through our new stage-gate process so that we can build a pipeline for future years. We're testing quesadillas, nachos, bacon, lemonade and a Mexican chocolate milkshake for example. These items are in different phases of the stage-gate process. Importantly, we're improving our ability to deliver great innovations for our customers and restaurant teams with a new concept screening process, more consumer insight, and a better cross-functional process from idea to launch.
Lastly, I'd like to touch on where we are in our organizational transformation. At our all-managers conference last month, we rolled out our new values. These are, One, the line is the moment of truth. Two, teach and taste Chipotle. Three, authenticity lives here. And four, the movement is real. These values were very well received at the conference by our restaurant managers who are more energized than ever. We also emphasized the following key areas for operations to focus on going forward. Number one, throughput excellence, number two, team stability and development, number three, great tasting food, and number four, great customer hospitality. We did a number of store visits following the conference and asked our restaurant managers what they took away. I'm happy to say we are aligned from the support center to each individual restaurant. These values and focus areas also form the foundation for the culture we are building in our support centers, which exist to serve our general managers and team members so that they can delight our guests. I'm pleased with the significant progress we've made in rebuilding Chipotle into an organization with an inclusive culture that sets us up to be more innovative, more connected to what our guests want, and better at executing, so that we can capitalize on the tremendous growth opportunities in front of us. I'm delighted with the great talent that we're attracting, as well as the talent that we relocated.
We've continued to enhance our leadership team, adding Roger Theodoredis as General Counsel, who joins us from WhiteWave. The restructuring and the relocations are nearing completion, and we are building an organization with best-in-class and diverse talent. I love the start-up energy that greets me every day I come in.
Finally, before I turn it over to Jack, I want to thank all of our team members across the company that are providing our guests with a great experience, serving real food cooked to perfection and prepared in our restaurants with fresh ingredients. I'd also like to thank our general managers, who collectively did a great job managing the restaurant P&Ls during quarter three, enabling Chipotle to deliver on financial commitment.
Okay. Over to you, Jack. Thanks, Brian. I'm equally pleased with how our team rose to the occasion and didn't miss a beat, despite managing a significant restructuring, to deliver a solid quarter and create sales momentum that has carried into the fourth quarter.
We generated revenue of $1.2 billion during the quarter, an increase of 8.6% from last year, and comp sales growth of 4.4%. Restaurant level margins of 18.7% expanded 260 basis points from last year, contributing to underlying earnings per share, adjusted for unusual items up 62%, to $2.16. The third quarter had unusual expenses, mostly related to the transformation. And that negatively impacted our tax rate and our earnings per share by about $0.80, leading to GAAP earnings per share of $1.36. As discussed last quarter, we'll continue to see costs over the next two quarters associated with our restructuring, relocation, and underperforming store closures.
In Q3, we recognized $26 million in total charges, with $10 million related to underperforming or closed restaurant, and $16 million related to the organizational restructuring and other unusual expenses. As a result of the transformation, as well as non-cash tax items, our reported effective tax rate increased to 36.8%, or about 690 basis points higher than our underlying effective tax rate of 29.9%, which I'll explain later. The Q3 comp of 4.4% was primarily driven by a higher-average tax on the price increase taken last November and January. And to a lesser extent, the addition of queso to our menu.
During the quarter, comps were in the mid-single digits during July and August, before softening to low-single digits in September, when we compare to the advertised launch of queso in 2017. With the launch of our 'For Real' campaign, with national TV in late September, comps moved back up and are running 4% so far in October.
Looking to Q4, we'll lap the price increase in about 1,000 restaurants in November, which will be a headwind to our overall Q4 comp by about 100 basis points. We would typically provide a first glimpse of our comp guidance for 2019 right now. But with the growing pipeline of initiatives still early on in a stage-gate process, we'll hold off in providing 2019 comp guidance until we have a better perspective of the timing and expected impact of each of these initiatives.
We opened 28 new restaurants in the quarter, and continue to expect to be at the lower end of our 130 to 150 new openings guidance for the full year. Our new restaurants this year have opened at stronger levels, and we continue to emphasize high-quality, high-returning new restaurants as we build out the pipeline. As a result of these strong unit economics, combined with a healthy pipeline for next year's openings, we expect to open between 140 to 155 new restaurants in 2019. As mentioned on our last call, we expect to close between 55 and 65 underperforming restaurants. In the third quarter we closed 32 of these restaurants, and 38 in total, including the six closed in Q2, all related to the restructuring. The remaining underperforming restaurants will close over the next several quarters, as we pursue strategic alternatives to manage our future rent liability.
Food costs for the quarter were 33.4%, a decrease of 160 basis points from the 35% in Q3 of last year. The decrease from last year was driven by the menu price increase, as well as more favorable avocado prices. These were offset by elevated prices for beef and paper and packaging items. We expect to be in the low 33% range in Q4, with the slight decrease from Q3 due to the shift in the supply of avocados back to Mexico, Peru, and Chile.
Labor costs for the quarter were 27.2%, or flat compared to Q3 of last year. The price increase offset wage inflation of about 4% to 5%. We also decreased our worker's comp liability by about $4 million in the quarter, due to better management of claims activity so far this year. We expect labor costs to increase to the mid 28% range in Q4, as a result of deleverage from seasonally-lower sales, as well as continued wage pressure.
Occupancy costs for the quarter were 7.1%, a decrease of 30 basis points from Q3 last year, and that's due mostly to the increase in comp sales. Other operating costs for the quarter were 13.7%, a decrease of 70 basis points from Q3 of last year. Our marketing and promo costs were 2.5% in the quarter, a decrease of about 70 basis points compared to Q3 of last year. The lower-than-expected marketing in Q3 is due to a timing shift into Q4 as our 'For Real' campaign began in late September and will continue through mid-November.
As a result, we expect marketing and promo cost will be in the low 4% of sales during Q4, while full-year marketing and promo will still be right around 3% of sales overall for the year. Other operating costs continue to include about 30 basis points of higher maintenance and repair costs, which we first discussed on the Q4 2017 call, and we expect M&R to continue at this elevated level for the rest of the year before abating in 2019.
SG&A in the quarter increased $24 million compared to Q2 of this year, the increase compared to last quarter was primarily due to $16 million in charges related to the restructuring and other unusual charges in the quarter, as well as $11 million for our biennial all-manager conference. Compared to Q3 of last year, the items I just listed mostly offset the one-time charge we had in the same quarter of last year.
Underlying G&A increased compared to last year, primarily in support of our restaurant growth and digitizing our restaurant experience and operational leadership changes in the field. For Q4, we expect total G&A to be right around $95 million, which includes an estimated $10 million to $12 million of restructuring related expenses. Underlying G&A in Q4, excluding bonuses and stock comp, is expected to be at similar levels as Q2 and Q3 of this year, however, both bonuses and stock comp are expected to be higher year-over-year as a result of better performance.
Depreciation for the quarter was 4.3%, an increase of 60 basis points from the 3.7% in Q3 of last year. This increase is due to the accelerated depreciation for the restaurant closures we discussed earlier and to a lesser extent, accelerated depreciation from the office closure. We now expect transformation costs from restructuring and restaurant closures and certain other charges to total between $100 million and $120 million versus our initial estimate of $115 million and $135 million, again, with most hitting in 2018.
So, far this year, we've charged nearly $70 million, and we estimate that another $10 million to $25 million will hit in Q4. And the remaining charges mostly related to terminating restaurant and office leases will still end in 2019. We'll continue to provide specifics on future transformation related costs when we have more certainty around timing and we'll break out the unusual costs for normal costs you can follow the underlying trends.
Our pre-tax income was $50.5 million, and reported effective tax rate was 36.8%. Our 36.8% recorded effective tax rate was higher than our 29.9% underlying rate due to the transformation costs and non-cash tax items related to the write-off of deferred tax assets associated with the underwater option. While we anticipate the underlying rate in Q4 to remain in the 28.9% to 29.9% range, we anticipate our effective Q4 tax rate to be in the high 30% range or higher through the impact of transformation changes as well as anticipated additional non-cash tax write-offs.
During the quarter, we repurchased $19 million of our stock at an average price of $474 per share, leaving about $100 million in our current buyback authorization. Our buyback rate will remain at this lower level, as we fund the transformation cost. This decrease is short term, and we expect to return opportunistically repurchasing shares at a higher level once we've completed the restructuring.
We're encouraged by our third quarter results, as our team has demonstrated that they can stay focused on serving our guests and executing growth drivers, while also being nimble on managing the business. Meanwhile, our support center made important progress in relocating and hiring talent, hosting our All Managers' Conference, and rebuilding an organizational structure designed to innovate and deliver on commitments to our guests, to our employees, and to our shareholders.
And now, we're happy to take your questions. We will now being the question-and-answer session. The first question will come from David Tarantino of Baird. Please go ahead. Hi. Good afternoon. Just a couple of questions on the comp trend. First, Brian or Jack, could you maybe talk about your estimate of the impact, if there was any, from the Ohio incident that was pretty well publicized? And I guess based on how you look at the business looking at maybe your average daily sales trend and seasonally adjust for that, do you think this most recent uplift from the marketing program has got you back on trend, if there was an impact in Q3? And then I have a couple follow-ups. Yeah, David, this is Jack. There was a lot going on in the quarter. We compared in the middle of the quarter to some soft results from last year. We had Avocado Day that turned into a double day, once we broke the internet. We had a back-to-school promotion, then we compared to queso, then we had marketing at the end. So teasing out any single impact was very difficult. That's why I walked through and I wanted to give the comp trends throughout the quarter. The thing that we know for sure is that marketing did have an impact. As we went on air and as customers started seeing the commercials, we did see an improvement in our sales. And I think when I look through the net-net of it, by the time we left the quarter, I don't think there's any lasting impact of anything that happened in Ohio. Great. That's helpful, Jack. And then on the quarter to-date, you mentioned up 4% for the comp. I know you're cycling now the mix benefits that you had with the queso. So I guess is traffic now running positive in the quarter-to-date period behind the advertising? David, it's right around flattish. When you look at the 4%, we're still carrying a price increase in about a couple thousand restaurants. We'll lap the next wave in November and then the final wave in January. So, I'd call the traffic right around flat. Great. And then last question for Brian, you talked a lot about the stage-gate process with some of the menu innovation you're working on. So I guess at a high level, when do you think we'll start seeing some new items added to the menu? And then, if you can maybe share your perspective on what you've learned in adding new items to the menu in this operating model. Sure. So yeah, we've got obviously a couple items in the stage-gate process, all in various stages actually, both digital initiatives as well as food initiatives. And I think you're going to see both a digital total system from loyalty to our mobile app to our digital shelves. All those things are in test markets right now. And we're very optimistic about what we're seeing. And we're continuing to learn, and the plan is they will start to touch in 2019, consumers; same thing with a food initiative or two. So, we're still early days, David, but we're learning a lot. We're optimistic about what we're seeing. And we're feeling like this stage-gate process is working, and it's going to set us up to execute with excellence on some of these initiatives coming to market in 2019. Sounds great. Thank you. The next question will come from John Glass of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Thanks very much. There were a couple of operational initiatives, Brian, you talked about either on or offline during the quarter, including throughput seemed like an early opportunity for you, and I think you talked about maybe purchasing, professionalizing that organization. Just some of the operational things that you're taking on, where are you on those, and did they have any impact on the past quarter? So, we are early days into both of those, and the good news is, I would say our operational focus, I feel like we're out of the starting blocks with getting our throughput to a higher level than where we've been. But really our focus was, at that All Managers' Conference to get everybody aligned on values so that we're hiring the right people. So that ultimately we can end up with a stable team with the right leaders. And then the other key focus for that meeting was to make sure people understood we're getting back to the throughput excellence, great-tasting food. You do those two things, you end up with great customer hospitality.
And what I love is I feel like we're out of the blocks on all these things. And we should – as we go into 2019, we'll continue to make progress as opposed to just getting started with it in 2019. And the same thing goes for the supply chain leadership. Carlos, actually myself, and Jack, we've already started our visits with some of our key partners, and it's been great to understand the relationships that were started, in some cases, 25 years ago, to some that are relatively new. And the good news is, I think this is an iterative process where there's opportunities for Chipotle and our suppliers to benefit going forward. So I'm very optimistic on both of those fronts, and I feel like a lot of good work has been put in place so that when we walk into 2019, we'll start to see some real tangible benefits. Just one more for me. On the digital sales growth this quarter, which was impressive, are you seeing the operational benefits you hoped? Particularly some of maybe the margin benefits you hoped, utilizing the second make-line? Or is it too early, and you have to get sort of a threshold of volume going through that second make-line to really start to see some of the margin leverage benefit that you might expect? Yeah, I think it's a little too early on the margin side of it. But one of the things that's been great to see is where we have the digital make-line, where we have our shelves, and you've got, obviously, the customer app everywhere. We're seeing increases in customer satisfaction, and we're continuing to see a higher ticket. And it's playing across all those digital channels that you would expect, the app, the web, and in delivery. Thank you. The next question will come from Nicole Miller of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Thank you. Good afternoon. It seems to me you've had – or you're in the midst of a headquarter cultural reset in combination with what is store alignment that could be very powerful. So I'm curious, what are today's store-level incentive metrics? And I've noticed on some of my visits some customer contacts in the dining room, and I'm wondering if that's a particular element that you're focusing on? Yeah, absolutely. We are very much focused on, we want people to walk away from Chipotle with a top guest experience. I think you heard me mention this. When we say the line is the moment of truth, we believe the whole stage is set from the second you see our line. And those are both digital lines, as well as our customer-facing lines. And I think what Scott and his team have been also focused on is we've got to make sure our hospitality matches that line experience. So, you will see some table touches. You'll see what Scott calls his four cornerstones start to roll out across the system. So, I'm delighted to hear that you're seeing that first-hand. And could you speak more specifically about the incentive metrics for the store-level employees? Sure. We can talk a bit more about that. Scott, I don't know if you want to chime in here, but this is all based on our restaurant AB (27:31) scorecard. So why don't you take that? Hi, Nicole. Good to hear from you. Scott here. Yeah, so our incentives currently are tied to our AB (27:38) scorecard, which encompasses sales and profits, obviously, but also incorporates the guest experience, food safety obviously being paramount to our business. So when we ladder that up, we understand where we are from a business unit perspective. And everyone's striving to reach the A level. We've made great progress this year of getting there. So hopefully that answers your question around incentives specifically. That's very helpful. And just a last question. Brian, when you first talked to us a couple conference calls ago, you talked a lot about enhancing and aiding the Chipotle awareness. And today I heard you talk about customers wanting accessibility. So could you compare and contrast those opportunities? And how are you approaching and prioritizing the strategies and tactics between those two opportunities? I think you have picked up on what I think are the two biggest levers outside of our operational excellence, around throughput and great hospitality. I think what you just saw with the 'For Real' marketing campaign – and this is what meant by being more visible, and also being more focused on what makes Chipotle unique, different. So you're going to continue to see us push very hard on getting across what makes Chipotle different, what makes Chipotle driving food culture. And then obviously, we want our marketing to be driving the purchase as well. And I think that can be done at the brand level, which is very exciting for Chipotle. Because I think our purpose is powerful.
The other big lever for us is access, and I think it's going to be driven by this digital access. So, those are two things that we are very focused on getting front-and-center. And then obviously, I think there are opportunities for menu variety and a few other things that we talked about. But probably the two biggest focus areas here in the very near-term are the visibility of the Chipotle brand and purpose. Because I think we're creating a new category with folks, and changing food culture. And when we're much more visible with it, customers respond. And then the digital access aspect is another place where we're seeing great response across that whole digital system that we're rolling out. So is it fair maybe for us to think about awareness is really generating the call to action, and the access is just reducing the friction to get to you? Is that right? Well said. I should have started there. Thank you for your time, appreciate it. Congratulations. Thank you. The next question will come from Sara Senatore of Bernstein. Please go ahead. Thank you. I got two follow-ups. One is just on traffic. I think in the past we've heard there's been a bit of a struggle with frequency, in the sense of just all tiers of customers maybe coming a little bit less. And I was wondering if you could talk about what you're seeing there? Is this where loyalty comes in? Or is it the new menu items that'll bring people back more frequently? So besides access, what are customers telling you that they want to see most, in order to ramp up that frequency curve, which used to be such a tailwind to Chipotle comps? And then I'll have another one. Sure. So, yes, what we've seen – and this is early days – is with our loyalty pilot, we're seeing people that have less frequency entering the program. And we don't have enough time to truly understand what ultimately is going to be the impact on their frequency. But we're very excited about the cohort that we're seeing come into the loyalty program in the early days. So we think that is going to play out where that program will be a key vehicle for driving frequency among key cohorts that today have an opportunity to increase the frequency. The other thing that's been really exciting is a lot of our digital business is attracting new and lapsed users to our business. So that's been another real exciting learning for us. Then I think your point on what about the people that historically were coming all the time? I think that's where we need to get back to talking about what makes Chipotle unique in culture, specifically food culture, what makes our purpose so different. Because that really resonates with our heavy users that are bought in. And we've seen some early indications that that's a great way to drive frequency into our loyalists. Thank you, that's helpful. And then just on the unit, you were sort of at the low-end of the range this year, but obviously will be above that in fiscal 2019, according to guidance. I'm just trying to understand the extent to which this year's build rate was maybe a function of re-establishing your growth pipeline or your development, how you approach it, versus just the how many attractive trade areas are left? And next year, I guess, would we expect to see more of a mix shift towards some of the newer, less established? Or are you going to continue to mostly focus on these established markets? I'll answer and then I'll let Jack chime in as well. But yeah, look, what we're really excited about is the restaurants that we opened this year opened very strong. And the economics support continuing to open Chipotle restaurants above the rate at which we opened this year. And I think that was the guidance we just shared with you all. The thing that's also exciting about Chipotle is we're finding we're having success in some new formats. As I mentioned in the earlier statements, the digital pick-up lane is a very exciting proposition. We're going to do more of those next year. We're also very excited about how we're seeing success in proven markets, and the new markets that we tapped the brakes on, frankly, a while ago. But the economic model of new restaurant openings is very powerful. And as such, we're building the pipeline accordingly, so that where the opportunities present itself, we can take advantage of those. Jack, I don't know if you want to add anything. Yeah. The only thing, Brian, I would add is, Sara, we did increase the quality this year, and that showed. We've got better economics this year than we have in the past few. We were more discerning. We were more selective. We did focus more of our attention in the proven and fully-developed markets. But we also had great success in some of the new and developing. So I think by being discerning, both in our proven markets and our developing and new markets, we've got better quality. I think that sets the table now, for us to take this stairstep up that we talked about next year. And I fully expect if we continue to build this kind of quality, we'll look for another stairstep the year after. So we focus on quality first and then quantity second. Great. Thank you very much, very helpful. The next question will come from Andy Barish of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Hi, good afternoon. Just wondering if you could – I know you've probably given us a bunch of thoughts coming out of your consumer research, but more importantly, on pricing for next year, any initial conclusions on how you're going to approach pricing versus the historical practice of a larger price increase every several years? I'll let Jack – go ahead, Jack. Yeah, Andy, we have mentioned on previous calls, we're open to a whole different approach. We're in the early stages of talking to some outside parties about our menu compared to competition, customers that shop within our menu, and are there opportunities? I think you'll more likely see us take smaller price increases rather than wait two or three years or so and then take a larger one, but nothing to report right now. Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on again, looking out to next year, having 'For Real' for the full year, how do you anticipate the marketing windows to fall versus, obviously, the late roll this year? Yeah. So we are still in the planning phases on exactly when and where we want to use national media. But what we feel really good about is we believe we've got the right communication, and now we're working through how we use the right communication vehicles at the right time. But what we do know is we'll have an always-on social, mobile, digital effort. And then we're still working through how we use the traditional mediums throughout the year in 2019. Thank you. Yeah. The next question comes from Sharon Zackfia of William Blair. Please go ahead. Hi. Good afternoon. I guess just a follow-up to Andy's questions. 3% for marketing, how are you arriving at that as the right number? And how do we think about that going into 2019? Yeah. So we believe 3% is the right number based on what our planning process is sharing with us. We're using our stage-gate process to really understand what does each initiative provide, as far as growth goes, layered on top of our throughput effort. And what we've seen is as of right now, as we re-approach the marketing budget, we're going to change the allocation from a lot of local marketing to more national. And in that switch, it changes the level of visibility that we can achieve with our marketing dollar. What should happen is, our 3% should feel like we're much bigger than what our 3% has been historically. And that's our ingoing assumption. Obviously if we find, through our stage-gate process, that we have an opportunity to enhance the marketing, because the result matches the increased investment, then we'll do that opportunistically. But the going-in plan is to make more out of the 3% than we have in the past. Can I ask just a quick follow-up? For your 2018, what percent of that marketing budget is digital? Chris? Do you know that off the top of your head? I don't know the answer off the top. And I don't know that we necessarily want to give everybody a clue into that. But clearly, with our consumer base skewing more millennial and more Gen Z, that digital is an integral part of the program for us. And one of the things we have a lot of things going on with stage-gate, in terms of five initiatives. But even the media that we're running, we're constantly in a state of where we look at how it goes and how we evaluate it, and how it moves the business. And we'll feel free to shift things between more traditional linear media and digital media as the results warrant. Okay. Thank you. The next question will come from David Palmer of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Thanks, a couple follow-ups for me as well. You talked about operations, digital menu innovation, and obviously you've done a lot of research and testing. But if you were to rank your biggest bucket or buckets of opportunity from this point, how would you do that, in terms of what is going to be the biggest source of improvement? I think the assumption might be new menu news being the unlock from here, but wanted to hear your thoughts. Yeah, look, I don't think new menu news is the primary unlock. I think it plays a role. But I think the digital access, removing friction, and getting into digital access is a big unlock for the Chipotle business. Throughput, reclaiming our throughput capability is another big unlock. And then obviously, I think making the brand more visible and more resonant with this 'For Real' campaign is another unlock. So menu will play a role. But I think you're going to find digital and the combination of throughput, and reminding people why they love Chipotle are going to be big unlocks. And Jack, in the past, you've had these rules of thumbs about margins, restaurant-level margins, and their commensurate level of sales per unit. How has your thinking been changing on that? Obviously you see innovation in delivery or things that bring complexity, and you think that could be margin dilutive. And on the other side, you've talked about productivity. And of course, there's labor inflation and pricing. Have you really shifted how you think about what margins are possible at what levels of sales? No, David, we go through and study this carefully. I think everything with digital, with delivery, we feel good that any time there's an added cost, that there's an opportunity for inefficiency there. So I still think when we get to $2.1 million, we can be in the 21% margin. $2.2 million is a 22% margin. Wage inflation is a bit of a wildcard. We can't overcome that with transaction growth alone. That will require some careful timing and place in a menu price increase. But if we can (41:57) well-thought-out menu price increases to make sure that we manage labor inflation, the model is still intact. And there's efficiencies of moving our customers from the front line to the second make-line. And then it's a matter of working with our delivery partners to make sure that the economics work for both us and them. But everything I've said in the past, David, still intact. Thank you. The next question will come from Karen Holthouse of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Two quick housekeeping questions and I have another one. What was the actual cost to the manager conference in the quarter? And what are you looking for first stock comp for the year? What was the numbers for the conference? It was like, $10 million in the quarter, $11 million for the year. Stock comp for the year is in the – between $60 million and $65 million. And then, as we've started to see some of the marketing digital initiatives take hold, is there anything you're seeing, in terms of regional variations, in the comp performance? And what I'm really getting at are markets that might be thought of as having more competition in the overall fast-casual space, and specifically with concepts that share a lot of the same philosophies and values around food quality and sourcing. Are those regions keeping pace with the system? Yeah. We're not seeing big variations in performance based on the initiatives that we've rolled out to date. When we've done our stage-gate process, we've tried to be true to representing the full United States, so we get a picture of how this performs across the country. So no, we've not seen that issue. Great. Thank you. The next question will come from Matt McGinley of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Thank you. On the labor rate in the quarter, you did a good job of managing that relative to what you had anticipated, or told us what it would be in July. What improved relative to what you had assumed back in July? I missed the first part of your question. Sorry, you cut out. The labor rate looked a little better than you had guided in July, and I'm curious what came in better than what you had anticipated, from a labor standpoint? Yeah, two things. Our teams worked really hard to manage workers comp and workers comp is something that you don't see the benefit week-by-week or month-by-month. But we saw steady progress throughout the year, and so we were able to make an adjustment there. And then secondly, Scott and the team, they challenged the team during the third quarter to really take a close look at staffing and making sure you got the right people throughout the day. And so we saw some efficiency gained throughout the quarter as well. So those are the two things. And I agree with you that we did a nicer job with labor in the third quarter than we did in the second quarter. In the quarter, you ran a few offers to grow digital usage. I think you ran a BOGO and you had the free delivery offer. Did that have any impact on the margin? And is promotion something that you would use on a go-forward basis to drive utilization of that? Or would you expect it to be more of just a more natural increase in digital usages as awareness of the platform builds? Let me answer the latter part of the question, then I can hand it back to Jack on your margin question. Yeah, what we have seen is when we increase awareness of the digital platforms, we get a good response. And I think over time, our loyalty program and using analytics to inform how we incentivize behaviors is going be the future. You'll see us continue to use what I would call broad scale incentives as we build the database and get people into our loyalty program, get people using the mobile app. But where we're ultimately headed is we want – I think we're less than 50% awareness on these digital platforms. We need to improve that dramatically. And then once we get them into the platform, we need to create a capability around using analytics to drive the right incentives for the right cohort at the right time. So with that approach, we think good things happen throughout the entire P&L. But Jack, I don't know if you want to add anything else. Yeah. Listen, I think that was well said. Yes, it does have a theoretical impact on our margin. We give away guacamole. Guacamole, our customers love it. It comes with more than 50% of our transactions. And we gave away a lot of it that we planned on giving it away for one day. We gave it away for two days. But not anything that I would call out when you look at $1.2 billion in sales over the entire quarter. It wasn't material enough to look at. But it's an investment worth making, because we attracted a lot of people into our digital platform, and so it's an investment that will pay off. So it has a theoretical impact on the margin, but not enough to call out during the quarter. Okay, thank you. The next question will come from Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays. Please go ahead. Great, thank you very much. Two questions. One, just following up on the unit growth discussion. Clearly, you're upping the absolute number in 2019. I'm just wondering how you actually arrive at that absolute number? You talked about how there's lots of opportunities and different types of stores that you could do. I know a few years back you were doing well north of 200 stores a year. So I'm wondering how do you think about, maybe what are the guardrails or challenges to a greater stairstep in growth? I don't know if you think there's certain markets that are at saturation, or is it real-estate availability, or cost to build or quality of managers? I'm just wondering what keeps you from ramping up that number more meaningfully in the short-term? Look I think one of the things that always have to go hand in hand with new restaurants is having managers ready to take over those new restaurants. So you have to take it at a measured pace as we increase year to year. Because the last thing you want to be doing is opening restaurants ahead of your capability to run them.
The good news is, I think our economic model suggests we still have room to grow in a meaningful way. And the Chipotle employee value proposition is very compelling. So we're able to attract managers, apprentices, to get them prepared and developed so that they can be part of the growth story as well. So it's really that balancing act if you got to have the teams ready to work and lead the restaurant, coupled with making sure you've got the right economic sites available to open it in. You can't just all of a sudden – well, you could, but we're not going to just go guardrail to guardrail on this thing. I think we would find ourselves not executing very well. So those are the principles we're using. Got it. And then you mentioned the unlocks earlier, which I thought was interesting. You didn't mention anything about, I guess, maybe extended store hours. I know there was some talk of selling burritos earlier in the day or going into breakfast store. I know certain markets you're now doing more late-night initiatives. I'm just wondering how you assess what extended hours might work, what might not work, and the potential opportunity. Yeah. I think one of things we learned through the stage-gate process is ours is going to be a surgical approach. It's not a blunt initiative. And so I'm delighted that we learned that in pilots, as opposed to on a national level. You'll see our hours be very surgical. Where it makes sense, you'll see us have some different hours. But it's not going to be a national, blunt effort. Understood. Thank you. Sure. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Brian Niccol for any closing remarks. Okay. Thanks, everybody, for listening and joining in. I think as I said in my earlier remarks, very proud of what this team has accomplished in the third quarter. I do believe our strategy to win today and cultivate the future is making tremendous progress. The team that we're building in the support center, I am very excited about diversity of the talent and the caliber of the talent.
I'm also very excited about how we've moved all these initiatives forward while moving the company to a new cultural space through this relocation and restructuring. So the Chipotle brand continues to be a purpose-driven brand that we continue to learn, over and over again, means a lot to our customers, means a lot to our team members, and very proud of what we accomplished to date, and also very optimistic about the pipeline that we're building and the initiatives that we're focused on going forward. So, thank you for taking the time. And I look forward to speaking with all of you in the future. Take care. The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

We will start today’s call with prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chief Executive Officer and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer. After which we will take your questions. Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A session.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Brian. Good afternoon. Thank you, Ashish and welcome to the Chipotle team. We are really excited to have you on board. Additionally, I am also happy to share that we have hired our Chief Development Officer, Tabassum Zalotrawala in December and therefore completing my executive leadership team. I am confident Tabassum will make a terrific contribution to our development organization.
With that, I am very pleased to report strong fourth quarter results with 6.1% comparable restaurant sales growth that included 2% transaction growth, restaurant level margins of 17%, 210 basis points over last year and earnings per share adjusted for unusual items with $1.72. I am also pleased to report for the full year 2018 restaurant average unit volumes achieved $2 million and our digital business went beyond $0.5 billion, representing 10.9% of sales. The growth acceleration this quarter gives us confidence that our strategy to win today and create the future is working. When we connect with guests through culturally relevant marketing focused on Chipotle’s great taste and real ingredients and provide more convenient access with less friction, they respond enthusiastically. I am excited about the momentum we built heading into 2019.
Now before I talk about the future, let me review the many positive changes at Chipotle during 2018 by going through the five key pillars that drive our purpose of cultivating a better world. The first is to be more visible with culturally relevant communication and the innovation that increases brand engagement. Our marketing mandate is to drive culture, drive a difference and ultimately drive a Chipotle purchase. In late September, we launched our For Real advertising showcasing Chipotle’s point of difference in real ingredients and real cooking techniques. We drove significant awareness of the brand through a holistic media plan on culturally relevant programming.
We published our entire ingredient list for the world to see in Times Square across numerous social and digital channels, a full page ad in the New York Times and in our restaurants with the headline, the hardest ingredient to pronounce at Chipotle is Chipotle. The next iteration of the For Real campaign called Behind the Foil is launching February 11 and builds on this success. It feels more like a documentary than traditional advertising. It showcases our fresh ingredients, food preparation and celebrates the work our talented team members do everyday in our restaurants to provide our guests a great dining experience.
Our free delivery bowl offering which ran from December 17 to January 7 help to expand access and was not only a great way to attract new guests to our app and delivery capabilities, but also to Chipotle as nearly half of the guests taking part in this offer were new or lapsed users. Collectively, these marketing initiatives help drive a noticeable lift in sales during the second half of the year. Additionally, beginning January 2, we launched our first menu innovation called Lifestyle Bowls for mobile and web orders that really resonated with consumers in a big way. It generated over 1.3 billion earned media impressions in the first few days of January.
Overall, Chris Brandt and his team have done a great job of making Chipotle more visible in culturally relevant social and traditional media channels. For example, our 2018 overall digital impressions increased nearly 20% year-over-year, while social impressions increased nearly 40% year-over-year. This was all accomplished without increasing our overall marketing budget. Going forward, you can expect Chipotle to continue to be a part of culture, have our presence in national media where and when it makes sense and to have an always on social and digital program. I am excited about the continued evolution of our marketing strategy as I look into our 2019 plans.
Our second pillar is to digitize and modernize our restaurant experience with enhanced access and less friction creating a more convenient and enjoyable guest experience. We continue to hear the number one reason consumers eat elsewhere is because they don’t have convenient access to Chipotle. In 2018, we opened 137 new restaurants with industry leading returns and will continue to be one of the leaders in developing new restaurants. For our existing restaurants, we completed the big fix and stayed focused on expanding the reach of our digital system to provide our guests easier access and greater convenience. The digitized make lines are now in over 1,000 restaurants and remain on track to be in all restaurants by the end of 2019. The digital pickup shelves are in approximately 1,000 restaurants and we are moving quickly to get them in all our restaurants by the middle of 2019.
Curt Garner and his team continued to build momentum in digital this quarter, with digital sales growing 66% year-over-year, an acceleration from the 48% we saw last quarter. Digital sales totaled $158.6 million during the fourth quarter and represented 12.9% of sales. For the full year, digital sales exceeded a $0.5 billion and accounted for 10.9% of sales. App downloads increased 72% year-over-year in 2018 and we continue to see strong interest from new and frequent as well as frequent guests at Chipotle. Similar to last quarter, we saw particularly strong traction in delivery. Although off of a relatively low base, delivery sales increased roughly 13 fold compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. The free delivery bowl promotion drove growth in the latter part of December offsetting normal expected seasonality. Encouragingly, we are seeing some residual lift in delivery sales that last beyond the promotion and have seen very little guest overlap between our own in-app delivery and our third-party delivery partner apps.
As we continue to remove friction from the digital ordering and pickup process, we expect our delivery time advantage to continue to widen. Based on data shared with us by our white label delivery partner, we are consistently among the quickest delivery times in their system and we expect this to only get better with the addition of pickup shelves and delivery prepay capabilities that enable delivery drivers to walk in, pickup their order and walkout without any delays.
As part of our goal to increase access, we are also exploring a new format that leverages digitally enabled convenience. Our test of the initial 10 restaurants with the mobile order pickup lane that we call Chipotlane is showing promising results with a higher mix of digital sales and total restaurant sales. We will continue to explore and learn about this opportunity by opening a few dozen more Chipotlanes in 2019 with a mix of freestanding and end-cap building. These restaurants are a great extension of our digital system as they help to increase convenience and access to Chipotle. We are also encouraged by our loyalty test sign-ups and early user data. As we have seen with our app, we are seeing a nice mix of new lapsed and medium frequency guests. And while it’s still early days, we are pleased to see changes in behavior across all frequency bands. Our stage-gate process is working and we are making changes based on the feedback received thus far and remain on track for a national launch in 2019.
Our third pillar is to run restaurants with great hospitality and fast throughput in a great environment. During Q4, we rolled out several operational improvement initiatives to drive better food, feel and flow. This includes training that reiterates our four pillars of hospitality, which are be and look your best, be guest obsessed, surprised and delight and make it right. In an effort to enhance our best-in-class food safety program, we adopted a quarterly food safety training requirement, which trains crew members on their role in keeping our food safe every quarter.
In addition, we implemented a new prep process, we call focus prep. Focus prep reduces the number of people preparing our great food, which makes it more consistent as well as food safe. Ancillary benefits include better service as our hospitality teams are now singularly focused on delivering a great guest experience. And the GM is now in a position to lead the restaurant versus managing every single process of the production. Our teams have embraced this new process quickly and we are already seeing benefits from the rollout. In the coming year, Scott Boatwright and his team are focused on team stability, throughput and consistently great tasting food. Additionally, reducing turnover particularly at the GM level through better leadership training and a clear direction on career progression are critical factors to our long-term success. Internally, we are calling this the year of the General Manager. We are also doubling down on throughput training and providing our teams with an easy to use dashboard that provides greater visibility on their throughput performance.
Lastly, we are elevating our culinary prowess through chef-driven cooking demonstrations as well as consistently executed line tastings to ensure our food is cooked to perfection everyday. In the first half of 2019, we are also launching Cultivate You 2.0, whereby we bring leadership training to the restaurant General Manager level to further drive in-market talent development. As a reminder, we retrained all of our field leaders during Cultivate You sessions at our corporate support centers throughout 2018. We previewed many of these initiatives at our All Managers Conference last fall and our managers know that when I am visiting with them in their restaurants, I’m always going to ask their team, how is the culture and how is throughput here? I am going to ask our general managers about team stability, the development of our team members and obviously the Food Safety Seven. And of course, since we are a restaurant company, we are going to be doing food tastings. It’s clear from my numerous restaurant visits this quarter that Scott and his field leadership team are making tremendous progress and are focused on the right operational initiative.
The fourth pillar is to be disciplined and focused in order to enhance our powerful economic model. Our biggest lever remains sales and transactions growth. Over the past year, we have become more strategic about pursuing projects that generate sales growth and healthy returns. We are in the process of building sales growth layers for multiple years and putting them through our stage gate process to ensure we are learning and iterating prior to national launches. While we are focused on winning today, we are also cultivating our future.
Last but not least, we are building a great culture of accountability and creativity. This is one of the things I am most pleased about as we have made significant progress during 2018 in rebuilding Chipotle into an organization with an inclusive culture that sets us up to be more innovative, more connected to what our guest want and better at executing so that we can capitalize on the tremendous growth opportunities ahead of us. Our people are our biggest asset and I could not be more proud of the team we have assembled. With our restructuring and relocation largely behind us, we are well on our way to building an organization with best-in-class and diverse talent that is dramatically improving our ability to deliver great food and service to our guests. I love the energy and enthusiasm I see everyday when I am with our employees, in our restaurants, and in our support centers.
Chipotle has always thrived by being different, by being the best version of ourselves, not another version of someone else. And we have earned the deep loyalty of our guests, because we are different and deliver a unique experience and being different means always changing. Right now, we are investing in many areas that further position us to win. So as you think about 2019, the main initiatives that ladder up to our five key pillars are: digital system investments, which includes pickup shelves, digitized make lines, loyalty and delivery; marketing programs that celebrate our real ingredients and classic cooking techniques; elevating our core menu by developing innovation that leads food culture and meets guest requests and lifestyle; and of course, a dedication to improving operations with General Manager stability and development, excellent throughput, consistently great food, all in a great restaurant environment.
With that, let me conclude by thanking all of our team members for their belief in Chipotle. Their dedication and passion provide our guests with a great experience serving real food, cooked to perfection and prepared in our restaurants with fresh ingredients. Their efforts are helping Chipotle cultivate a better world. We have an exciting journey ahead of us and while we accomplished a great deal in 2018, I believe the best is yet to come.
With that, here is Jack to walk you through the financials. Thanks, Brian. I am really pleased with the high-quality fourth quarter results, which provide a glimpse of our powerful economic model and a leverage we can deliver, we drive top line sales and provide a great guest experience. Our marketing and digital strategies led to increased guest visits and our restaurant teams responded by ensuring every guest enjoyed a delicious meal.
Our revenue was $1.2 billion during the quarter, an increase of 10.4% from last year and comp sales growth of 6.1%, our highest comp in six quarters. Restaurant level margins of 17% expanded 210 basis points over last year and earnings per share adjusted for unusual items, was $1.72. The fourth quarter had unusual expenses mostly related to the transformation and these negatively impacted our earnings per share by about $0.57 leading to GAAP earnings per share of $1.15.
For the full year, sales were $4.9 billion on a comp sales increase of 4%. Restaurant level margins were 18.7%, up 180 basis points and we generated earnings per share adjusted for unusual expenses of $9.06, an increase of 33% over last year. Unusual expenses, mostly related to the transformation, negatively impacted our earnings per share by $2.75 leading to GAAP earnings of $6.31. In Q4, we recognized $23 million in non-recurring expenses, with $7 million related to underperforming or closed restaurants and $16 million related to the organizational restructuring and other unusual expenses. We continue to expect transformation cost from the restructuring and restaurant closures as well as certain other charges to total between $100 million and $120 million. We recognized about $91 million of these charges during 2018 and expect that the remaining $9 million to $29 million will hit in the first half of 2019. We will continue to provide specifics on the transformation-related costs each quarter, so you can follow the underlying trend. The Q4 comp of 6.1% was driven by a trend change in transactions as 2% of the comp came from greater guest visits along with a higher average check. The check increase includes a price increase of 3.3%, which was a result of increases taken in late 2017 and in January of 2018 and a mix contribution of 0.8%.
Our For Real campaign during the quarter really resonated with our guests and the Free Delivery Bowl campaign in late December made it easier than ever for our customers to enjoy Chipotle. We expect full year comps in 2019 will be in the mid single-digit range with the recent modest price increase contributing about 1.7%. This is lower than the 4% price increase seen in 2018. We are optimistic that with the recent trend change in transactions plus the modest price increase combined with our 2019 growth initiatives, a mid single-digit comp is achievable. We opened 40 new restaurants in the quarter bringing our total count to 137 for the full year. The new restaurants opened in 2018 have continued to open up strong as our development teams have done a great job emphasizing high-quality and high returning sites.
For 2019, we continue to expect to open between 140 to 155 new restaurants, but these openings will be weighted towards the second half of the year. We expect about 10% of these openings will occur in Q1 and about 25% will open in Q2. Food costs for the quarter were 33.2%, slightly lower than Q3 due to price increases as well as lower avocado prices based on our seasonal shift from California to sourcing from Mexico, Chile and Peru. We expect food costs to be approximately 33% in Q1 as the slight leverage from the December menu price increase is largely offset by an expected increase in beef prices. We also expect food costs for the full year to be about 33% as an expected rise in avocado prices this summer will be offset by other efficiencies. Our new supply chain team is now fully in place and we set to find efficiencies later in the year by strategically reviewing this sourcing of all of our ingredients. We will keep you updated as these potential opportunities arise.
Labor costs for the quarter were 27.1%, a decrease of 40 basis points from last year. Our restaurant teams did a nice job of scheduling and managing labor in the quarter while labor inflation in the 4% to 5% range was partially offset by the menu price increase. We expect Q1 in the full year labor to be in the low 27% range as leverage from the menu price increase and sales growth is expected to largely offset ongoing wage inflation in the 4% to 5% range. Other operating costs for the quarter were 15.5%, a decrease of 30 basis points from Q4 of last year and that was due to sales leverage.
Marketing and promo costs were 4.2%, an increase of about 40 basis points compared to Q4 of last year and that funded our For Real campaign in the fall as well as our Free Delivery Bowl campaign in late December. Marketing and promo finished the year at 2.9% of sales and we expect to invest about 3% of sales in 2019 and this includes investing in the low to mid 3% range in Q1, which is higher than the 1.8% we spent last year in Q1 as we launch our Behind the Foil campaign next week. Other operating costs were also higher due to the inclusion of delivery fees, which rose with the increase in our delivery sales. For 2019, we expect other operating costs to be in the 14% of sales or perhaps slightly lower as sales leverage and M&R efficiencies are expected to be offset by our fast growing delivery business.
G&A for the full year was 7.7% of sales or $375 million, which included $32 million related to the transformation and other unusual expenses, $64 million in stock compensation and nearly $11 million related to our biennial All Manager Conference. Without these items, our underlying G&A support totaled about $270 million in 2018. In 2019, we expect our underlying G&A support to be in the $275 million to $280 million range. Our annual stock comp is typically approved and granted in Q1, so we will be able to provide updated clarity during our next earnings call. And this underlying G&A does not include non-recurring transformation costs, which will continue to clearly call out each quarter.
Depreciation expense for the quarter was 4.3%, an increase of 60 basis points from Q4 of last year and it’s increased due to the accelerated depreciation from the restaurant closures as we discussed earlier and to a lesser extent the accelerated depreciation from our office closures and we expect depreciation to be about 4% in 2019. Our GAAP tax rate during the quarter was 26.3%, which is slightly lower than our underlying rate of 27.4%. For 2019, we expect our underlying effective rate to be in the 27% to 30% range. While expected 2019 underlying effective rate has settled into a tighter range than it was throughout 2018, it maybe effective from time-to-time by items such as executive comp related adjustments or deferred tax assets related to previously issued equity and we will fully disclose these adjustments as they occur.
Our balance sheet remains strong with cash and investments balance of $677 million as of December 31. This allowed us to repurchase $45 million of our stock at an average price of $452 per share during the fourth quarter. And for the full year, we repurchased $161 million at an average of $370 per share. We also funded CapEx during the year totaling $287 million, which is lower than the $300 million we guided early last year as we reprioritized our CapEx to support our new strategies. In 2019, we expect CapEx will be around $300 million with around 40% to 45% invested in new restaurants, 30% to be invested in growth-related initiatives, including digitized second make lines and digital pickup shelves and the remaining invested in normal upkeep of our restaurants and strategic corporate initiatives. Our new restaurant investment will increase to an average of about $860,000 per new opening and that’s mostly as a result of further testing of the Chipotlane. The guests convinced with Chipotlane along with the potential for superior economics support allocating a portion of our portfolio to this new format.
In closing, we are encouraged by our fourth quarter and full year 2018 results as our teams remain focused on the guest experience while seamlessly managing a significant restructuring and relocation. The results as a company that is well on its way to building a culture of innovation and great execution that will drive sustainable long-term growth. I am excited about 2019 and I believe we are in a great position to win today and create a bright future for our guests, for our employees and for our shareholders. And now we are happy to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from David Tarantino from Baird. Please go ahead with your question. Hi, good afternoon and congrats on the progress you made last year. Question I guess on the sales trends first. I think, Jack, you mentioned multiple times change in the trend line during the quarter. So can you maybe elaborate on what you meant by that, maybe talk about how the trends progressed during the quarter? I know you mentioned comps in October were up around 4%, so that implies quite a bit of an acceleration. So can you maybe talk about that and maybe what you are seeing so far in 2019? And then underneath that, Brian, can you maybe give an update on for what you think the impact from that For Real advertising campaign was on the comp trajectory and I know you pulled some of that advertising during the quarter, what kind of tail did you see from that approach when it wasn’t running? Thanks a lot. Yes. Hey, David, I will start. We talked about during our third quarter release that the For Real campaign did bring more customers in at that time and we talked about October sales or actually sales in late September moving up to a higher level. We maintain that during October and then through the quarter, October, November, were pretty similar months, David. So even as we are getting near the end of For Real, we held on to those sales and then we had a nice bump at the end of the quarter as we had the Free Delivery Bowls as we were advertising on all the college bowl games and our customers responded in a big way and so that was nice acceleration. I think the things – the two things that make us really encouraging is that the For Real campaign was just resonating with our customers in terms of Chipotle stands for real food and real cooking and that resonated with customers and then two when we made Chipotle more convenient to our customers by making available through delivery and free delivery during the Free Delivery Bowl campaign. They responded, because it was convenient access and those are two levers that we can continue to pull throughout the year. In terms of January sales, it’s really difficult to give you an underlying trend. We maintain the momentum from the delivery bowls end of the first week of January, because we were advertising and offering the promotion through the BCS Championship game. Then we also introduced the lifestyle bowl as well and that created a lot of buzz and interest and activity as well. And then in the second half of the month, we have weather and so really difficult to give you what the underlying trend is. I can tell you we are just encouraged with what we saw during the quarter and we are optimistic about how 2019 is shaping up. Hey, David. This is Brian. The only thing I would add is the thing that was exciting to hear from consumers as well as our team members, is when we started talking about Chipotle, a point of difference in regard to real ingredients, real cooking that results in just better tasting food. Everybody agrees that is why they originally found what with Chipotle and that’s why they’re falling back in love with Chipotle. So the good news is that message is proving be very sticky and I think the team has done a great job of making the brand much more visible with that key point of difference. And it continues to carry momentum with the execution in the restaurant as well as the guest experience that consumers are actually having. So, we are very excited, I think we mentioned obviously, we’re going to continue to pull that string and the team is getting ready to launch kind of the next wave of the For Real campaign through Behind the Foil next week. Great, thank you. Our next question comes from Sara Senatore from Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question. Hi, this is Leo for Sarah. So I have a question on the restaurant margins. It seems that it went up this quarter given the menu price increases, sales leverage, but we were just wondering if there were also some operating efficiency in here and if you could perhaps give more detail on what they might look like in 2019, but ideally some kind of quantification through the supply chain or labor metrics? Thanks. Yes. They were efficiencies and we talked about. We started to see efficiencies in the third quarter. And this is the way our field teams and restaurant managers are scheduling and deploying labor. They found ways to get more efficient in the second half of the third quarter that continued into the fourth quarter. And so that definitely drove part of the margin. The rest of it was from sales leverage and a little bit from the price increase. And then going into next year, it’s really going to be more of the same. We are hoping that will or expecting that will hold on to the efficiencies that Scott and his team drove in the second half of this year. We are expecting with a comp guidance that we provided with a very modest price increase that we will be able to offset some of the labor inflation, the biggest challenge is going to be labor inflation. And labor inflation, we expect to continue in that 4% to 5%. Thank you. Our next question comes from Karen Holthouse from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question. Hi, thanks for taking the question. One quick housekeeping one and then a real question, could you just walk us through given the pricing actions have been taken, why’s that cadence of price through the year will be in 2019 and then there are some encouraging commentary on the loyalty test, in a best-case scenario what one could we think about that getting to a broader rollout? Sure. So, the way to thing about pricing is, we take in a price increase of just shy of 2%. And I think we’ve mentioned this in prior calls, we now brought in a partner to help us manage our pricing approach going forward. So, the good news for us is even with the pricing of below 2%, we continue to have the best value scores in the fast-casual segment and we’re always going to want to hang on to that strength. So, any pricing that we will take going forward, will continue to be probably in smaller increments than we’ve done historically, with obviously more frequent basis, and right now we’re working through what that frequency will look like. But through all of it, the thing that we’ve kept our eye on, is how do we maintain the integrity of that value proposition that we provide to our consumers.
Your second question on digital, the loyalty program specifically, we’re in the stage gate process with the loyalty program. I think you’ve heard us talk about one of the things we’re delighted to see is one, the enrollments and how this is one of those things that just keeps building on itself. So, you get started with some level of enrollments, you see cohorts of people coming in, the thing that’s nice to see is how those that enroll, utilize the loyalty program in their behaviors. And then what’s nice to see is how that builds throughout time and what we continue to be very optimistic about is the cohorts that we’re seeing are, like last meeting users as well as our heavy users. But the thing that we’re most interested in has the data that we get on this, our ability to then turn around remarket Chipotle to influence people’s behaviors going forward. And we’re still in the early days of understanding a lot of those implications, but so far are very promising, and that’s why we continue to move this through the stage gate process, still on track for 2019 launch. Our next question comes from Sharon Zackfia from William Blair. Please go ahead with your question. Hi, good afternoon. I’m sorry if I missed this, but I think Brian, you’ve talked quite a bit about throughput and the opportunity there. I don’t know if that’s anything where you saw any measurable progress in the fourth quarter? And then I guess just to clarify Sarah’s question, can you just talk about how the price benefit will impact the quarter. So, how much are carrying in first quarter versus full year? Yes, I’ll let Jack answer the pricing question here. And then I can answer the other question around throughput. So, go ahead Jack. Just make sure price, it’s 1.7 through the first three quarters. And then about 1.3, something like that. We took the pricing in two stages during December. So, it’s pretty much going to be an even 1.7 through 11.5 once a year. And then your question on throughput, the guys have actually made a lot of progress on throughput. We just launched our throughput dashboard. And, I think I mentioned this in our All Manager Conference, we reemphasize the pillars of throughput. So, we’re in the process right now, giving our teams visibility that they’ve not had on throughput in a long time. And we’re already starting to see that have an impact on our results. So, it’s very early. But the good news is the dashboard coupled with the focus and going back to the core of what this business was built on, which is fundamentals of great throughput. We’re already seeing an impact in the business. And our next question comes from Joshua Long from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead with your question. Great, thank you for taking my question. Kind of following up on that point on throughput, I was curious if you can talk about the opportunity around GM turnover. I know that’s something that you mentioned in your prepared comments, Brian, but just curious on where turnover levels are at now. And then how you think about kind of rebuilding that over the course of 2019 and beyond, if there’s other initiatives in place, or if it’s really a function of just getting the messaging and things that we’ve talked about here thus far in the call and then other venues getting traction with that as we go forward? Yes, thanks for the question. I think I mentioned in my remarks earlier, we’re making 2019 the year of the General Manager. And the reason is because, we want to improve the stability of the General Manager level. And we also want to improve the development of our apprentices and General Managers, so that they’re ready to step in the growth opportunities that are going to be presented. It’s a focused effort. We actually have all of our field leaders together here in a couple weeks, where we’re going to be reviewing the best ways to develop future General Managers and future field leaders in this organization. And, Scott and his team are very much focused on keeping stability in the restaurant with our A plus leaders and then those leaders that need development, they get the right development, so they become A plus leaders as well. And I think what you’ll see is that builds a culture of growth both from a standpoint of career opportunity, as well as sales and guest experiences. So, we’re very much focused on continuing with right initiatives to drive more stability, lower turnover at the General Manager level, goes from that, that just gives us a position of strength to get better throughput, better food execution, and better environment for our customers. I appreciate that color. Thank you so much. In terms of thinking about the Chipotle lane and the prototype that goes along with that. How should we think about that in terms of, for those of us who haven’t necessarily seen it in person and is there an opportunity to shrink some of that square footage as the sales make shifts towards digital and pushing things through or pushing sales through the app rather? Yes, so great question. A lot of folks probably have not seen our Chipotle lane. The way First I want to explain it so, you order ahead in the app or on the website and what it does, is it provides another access point at the restaurant where you don’t have to get out of your car. So, you are able to just pull up to a window, our team member then has a quick conversation with you, you just said pickup time and then what happens is, literally it’s like, I’m here for my burrito, out of the window comes your burrito, you never get out of your car. So arguably, it will be possibly the fastest way to Chipotle is going through the Chipotle lane. It does require you though to order in advance and pick your pickup time. We have that in about 10 restaurants right now. The nice thing is we’re seeing both digital sales as well as total restaurant sales elevate with this new access point.
To your question about what does it mean from a restaurant design standpoint. This is one of the reason why I’m really excited to have Tabassum on our team. She is going to have the flexibility to think through with this new access point, what are our opportunities to change the footprint of Chipotle, and I think that means finding trade areas that historically we haven’t gone into, because we haven’t had this access point and also finding trade areas where potentially we could have a smaller footprint because of this access point to get into those trade areas. So, it really opens the door, so I think additional convenience with less friction and get people to Chipotle closer to where they want a Chipotle. So, we’re still in the early days, so I do want to make sure people understand that. This is still very much in a testing phase and we will continue to test, learn, iterate throughout 2019 and will be happily sharing the results as we get them. Great thank you so much. Our next question comes from John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question. Thanks very much. I wanted to ask about delivery. First, how much of the fourth quarter sales particularly, I guess December sales results you ascribe to delivery and particularly that free offer, how much accomplish did that give, you can tease it out? Second, you did offer free delivery earlier in the year. So, it sounds like this time around, it had a greater impact on sales, why do you think that was? And third, maybe Jack, I know, you’ve talked about delivery economics in the past. But just to be clear, when you look at a delivery sale, I think it’s generally understood, it’s lower margin because of the commission, and it’s hard to offset that even if the higher check. Is that the way you think about it, or do you think yours is structured somewhat differently, or somehow there’s a different proposition where you actually see a restaurant margin going up, and it’s accretive not dilutive to restaurant margin, I’m talking about the average margin now, not maybe an incremental margin? So, John, I’ll touch on the first part, and then I’ll let Jack share on your margin question. Two things to think about. The first time when we did the delivery promotion, it was not available both through in the app and across the marketplace. Now, delivery is accessible both in our app and across marketplace. The other thing I would share with you is, we now have more coverage of our restaurants than we did when you go back the first-time we did this. The other key piece of the puzzle obviously, is I think our marketing team and Chris did a great job of smartly connecting the idea of delivery to an event, that was happening in a lot of people’s homes that just made the occasion that much more relevant. So, I think it’s a combination of more access, more visibility, the access being in our app, in the marketplace and then the visibility being done through television, tied to an occasion that basically trip to what thought for the consumer, hey, I should be doing Chipotle at home while I’m doing this event. So, I think the combination of all those things just built on top of each other to really drive our delivery business in the fourth quarter. I think I’m excited about it, it is the delivery business continues to stay with Chipotle because the speed at which it gets delivered, I think we talked about this before, we’re still best-in-class when it comes to speed. And the second piece is our food is really great when it gets delivered. That burrito, it’s really delicious. And so, to get people delicious food in roughly 30 minutes at home while they’re watching, whatever they’re watching, it appears to be a good idea for our consumer. Jack, I’ll let you answer the margin question. Yes, John, the way to think about the margin first of all is Chipotle is really set up where our operations are geared towards great delivery experience, from through the entire process for our crew, for the driver and for the customer. First of all, let me start with our second make line sales before you consider delivery, is higher margin than our frontline sales, because we start with an advantage there. We have a second make line which means our operator setup who take these extra sales, we’re not running the sales through or the production through the same frontline that our customers are waiting through. We’re investing to make that experience even better with digitizing the second make lines. So, our capacity is going to go up, our accuracy is going to go up, and our timeliness is going to go up. We have stayed at times where when a delivery driver comes in, they know they can come in Chipotle at x time. They know that it’s going to be ready. We are putting shelves in our restaurant as well and we’re about to launch prepaid for even for our delivery partners, so that there is no stopping to pay for the order. So, everything is set up to be very efficient, very seamless in everything we do. There is a delivery fee, but John, right now the incrementality is so high as long as these are extra customers, additional customers coming to Chipotle, we can cover the fee because our morning starts out at a higher level, because it’s incremental. We still can cover the fee and it’s still a accretive. So, it’s not just that it’s profitable, it’s accretive to our margins. The way we’ve got it set up right now. And Jack, just to be clear you’re talking about accretive to the consolidated average margin, not an incremental margin that the second make line can offers in higher check or whatever else elements can offset that commission fee, is that the way you look at it? That’s right John. When we are at a 19 margin, when we cover the delivery fees, our margins are still much higher than the 19%. Now if you’re going to compare this to an incremental customer that’s going to order on their app and come and pick it up, that is our highest margin transaction in the whole restaurant. When you then attach a delivery fee, it’s going to be lower, but it’s still going to be a very attractive margin and again the way we’ve set this up, it is so convenient for everybody and about our crew, the driver and the customer. We think our growth is just going to continue to grow here we’re just going to continue to be incremental and so you know we’re bullish on where this goes both from the sale as well as margin standpoint. Thank you. Our next question comes from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question. Hi, just a couple if I may. Firstly overall, if we do think a while like what is going to be necessary at this point in terms of adding other customers in terms of your peak day parts are, we at the point now where overall throughput is now at the point where that customer can be reaching. And then secondly in terms of the shoulder periods that we’ve talked about before in between the 2 and 5, for example, if there are now programs in place, again it’s meet, the shoulder periods that couldn’t otherwise being met with the overall peak staffing and day part demand? Yes. Hi John, the simple answer is we still have plenty of capacity to handle more throughput during our peaks. I think we’ve mentioned this before, you know, Chipotle in the past was doing $2.5 million on average out of these restaurants and you know, we were doing 35 transactions in 15 minutes and we’re still in the mid-20s today. I’ll be at making progress from the 20, so, you know, Scott, his team know that when we have a line and they go faster, the good news is the line just keeps moving, as opposed to somebody peeling off of the line. And the peak business still has a lot of capacity when we execute throughput really well. So, there’s plenty of upside there. Then your question on the shoulder, you know, the thing that’s great about Chipotle is our proposition really resonates lunch through dinner and consumers are becoming more hour-less on the time of day that they want to eat. And we’re continuing to see us make progress in our throughput in those shoulder hours. But the focus right now is those peaks, how do we get back to where we once were on that throughput because we still have so much headroom in that space. And it’s just – it’s an impressive operation when you see us operating at our throughput capability, and I think we’ve talked about this in the past, but plenty of headroom, but we have lots of focus to capture that headroom in our peaks. Yes. And from your perspective, it’s more of a supply, in other words, a throughput constraint than it has been a demand constraint as the number of customers like you serve for 15 months has been reduced? Yes, yes, I mean, look, I think our – the good news is, we smartly guide our team members focused on their roles, accountability and making great food and now we’re pivoting to, okay, now this is how you do the four pillars of great food, but which was at the core of Chipotle 5 years, 6 years ago. So, we believe we can open more transactions during those peaks by getting people up to speed on what it’s like to run the four pillars of great throughput in a Chipotle. That’ great, thank you. And then secondly, if I may, on the supply chain, and I know you talked about this in the past, but in terms of the bigger structural changes that are happening in the supply chain, how far are we in this journey at this point. I mean, obviously, you hire new people, you have new teams, you have new office, and you have a completely clean slate in terms of what Chipotle could be in 2020 versus 2015 or 2014. I mean, I guess how much efficiency and effectiveness opportunity maybe there’s a basis point number, I think we’d all love that. But whatever it is and then maybe there’s a quality number or a service number that you can talk about in terms of the work that you’ve done on the supply chain in terms of how much that could deliver going forward? Yes, I think we’ve talked about this and I think you categorize it correctly. We’ve got a new leader with Carlos and we are really taking a clean sheet to how we approach our supply chain. But one caveat, food with integrity is still going to be a key driving principle on how we operate in our supply chain. So that means supporting the farmer, supporting the right animal welfare and then also protecting clean food and farming practices that we believe is the future of food culture. With that said, I think Carlos and his team working with Jack, have already started to identify opportunities for our business that we’re going to attack and as we understand what that really means for the business, I’m sure Jack and myself will update you guys, but right now, it’d be premature to give a specific number, John, on what that entails. But I think it’s part of one of our pillars of doing our business, which is we need to take a disciplined approach to protecting the economic model to pull back and that’s what we task Carlos to do here. So, I don’t know, if you want to add anything to that Jack. No, it’s just the only thing I would say, it’s a whole new team as well John. So, we’re fully staffed right now. The team is up and running, it’s really a great team that believes in Chipotle purpose. They believe in Chipotle, our ethos of sourcing high-quality sustained [indiscernible] food, and they’ve had significant outreach to all of our suppliers. So, we’re really optimistic about the team, about the relationship with our suppliers and Brian is right though there’s nothing to report right now, but if there’s opportunities there, I’m confident this team is going to find them. Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Badishkanian from Citi. Please go ahead with your question. Great. Thanks. Just your 2019 comp guidance calls for mid-single digit same-store sales. Should we expect an inflection at some point or you think it’s really just kind of a slow and steady march back to the 2.5 million AUV level you achieved 4% last year. So just kind of steady and slower would you expect inflection point? Yes, look, obviously I think the way we think about this is, if we do the right marketing with the right communication, our consumers will respond enthusiastically to the Chipotle business. And is that slow and steady, is it inflection, that’s not what we’re focused on. What we’re focused on is, how do we get to a place where we’re communicating the things that are meaningful to people about Chipotle, we’re doing the initiatives that we believe will drive returns and growth and we’re running great operations so that when people come in, they have a world-class experience and they want to come back. I think we do all those things right. We’ll continue to be rewarded with customers’ business and we’ll continue to be rewarded with employee loyalty and engagement. So, we’re optimistic about the various initiatives we have in our stage-gate process and how we’re going to attack growth going forward. But what we’re really zeroed in is, how do we make sure we run great operations, do the right initiatives, and then give the consumer the message that makes them feel good about being a part of Chipotle, that’s when we’ll get rewarded with sales and transactions. How that plays out, we’ll update you guys quarterly. Alright. Thank you. Yes. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question. Great. Thank you very much. Brian, you mentioned a few areas of focus for 2019, I’m just wondering as you internally I guess, think about measuring success. I mean, you’re more focused, do you think on the comp to kind of drive kind of acceleration in traffic or do you think about it more as you’ve got the comp momentum back and are you focused more on the margin, just trying to think if this comp upside to ‘19 versus the mid-single digit level, especially because you’re off to a strong start with the initiatives kicking in whether or not you’d be reinvesting that in a variety of initiatives you have or the initiatives really require stage-gating, and therefore, there would be more flow through the margins and earnings in ‘19, if you would have beat that the comp expectation? Yes. Look, obviously we’re concerned about both, is the way I would respond to your question. We want to invest in the business so that we continue to drive momentum in sales and transactions because the best – look the best leverage for the economic model here is growing sales and transactions. We do that well, our margins will expand. At the same token, I think this is kind of to somebody’s question earlier, where there’s opportunities to be efficient or take some of the upside to the bottom line, if we don’t have an investment vehicle that would suggest you should go reinvesting, will take it to the bottom line. So, the thing I’m excited about though at Chipotle is, we’ve got a lot of levers and we’re validating with those levers at work through the stage-gate process, whether it’s a delivery program, a loyalty program, a menu innovation or an ops initiative around throughput. We’re starting to better understand how these things play out, both from a top-line and then how it flows to the bottom line, and we’re going to continue to fund that balancing act. Because ultimately, and I think Jack has talked about this in the past, we want to get back to that 24, 25 with margins that would be best-in-class at 24 and 25. So, we’re really striving towards doing both. Got it. Just because you mentioned the delivery and the loyalty in the menu, it seems like you have a variety of initiatives at various stages of rollout as we think about ’19. And as you started – like you started in the year strong, it seems like you are back into it maybe December was up in the 10% range. So, obviously, there’s some nuances in short-term trends, but you’re starting very strong. I’m just wondering whether you’re expecting the comp to accelerate through the year or whether for some reason get posting some things and some things out that we shouldn’t expect comps to accelerate through 2019 versus where they are today? Yes, look I think we talked about this, right, the fourth quarter, we definitely saw a trend change with the combination of I think improving operations, more penetrated digital system, delivery having more coverage and being more visible about the point of difference in Chipotle. We’re going to keep doing that in 2019, because we believe those are the right strategies to engage with our customers in a unique way.
So, what I would say is, we feel really good about the strategies and the programs we have in place. The trick for us in 2019 is executing those with excellence, so that we maximize with each of those at work. But I know – I think it’s really important for people to understand it’s a multi lever that we’ve got going on here, great operations, a great digital system, more visible marketing that is more resonant than we have been in the past, coupled with some smart innovation, both done in digital and in the menu. So, we’re going to continue to drive that. It served as well in ‘18 and we believe it’s going to continue to serve as well in ‘19. Thank you. Our next question comes from Andy Barish from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question. Yes, just a couple of points on the physical plan. Chipotle lane, are you – those new builds as well as remodels? And then secondly, on the new stores, could you discuss kind of a recent performance history on new store openings relative to the $2 million system average where those stores are kind of coming in? Sure. So, your question on the Chipotle lanes, it is really a new build effort. We are going to do one or two kind of remodel efforts. But the emphasis of this is going to be really a new build approach going forward, at least that’s what our learnings would suggest today. And then your question on the economics around our new openings, they continue to really perform with great opening volumes, as well as terrific returns both on a one-year and two-year basis. Jack, I don’t know if you want to add any – Yes, just Andy, I would say it’s relative to some of the best results we’ve had historically, meaning there are about 80% or even a little bit higher than what our existing mature stores are and so it’s right where we hoped it would be. You might remember a few years ago, we had fallen down to about 70% of the average mature store, so we closed that gap and the quality really is really, really attractive. The team’s done a great job. Thank you. And our final question today comes from Andrew Charles from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead with your question. Great, thanks. Just Jack one quick housekeeping question, and then Brian, one question for you. Should we interpret mid-single digit same-store sales guidance for 2019 to mean 4% to 6% or 3% to 5%? And then Brian, why doesn’t the effect just play devil’s advocate? What is the effectiveness of the marketing spending you saw in 4Q that 4.2%, what does that lead you to rethink the 3% of marketing spend budget plan for 2019 is clearly efforts are working? Thanks. Yes, just a housekeeping real quick, when I say mid low is 1%, 2%, 3%, mid is 4%, 5%, 6%, so I’m saying somewhere in that 4%, 5%, 6% range. And yes, your question regard to marketing as a percent of sales. The – I think the way we thought about this is, how do we have a communication program that will get the brand to be visible, where we want when we want, and to Chris and the teams’ credit, as they’ve looked at the existing budget, we don’t see a problem with being able to allocate those dollars in such a way where we can be, where we want, when we want and how we want to show up. I think we mentioned this in the past, if we find ourselves in a place where look there’s an opportunity for us to go beyond the 3%, we’re not afraid to go do it. But as of right now, we believe reallocating the budget is the better way to go to optimize result we’re looking for right now. But Chris appreciates that question, I’m sure. So, thanks for the question. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we’ve reached the end of today’s question-and-answer session. I’d like to turn the conference call back over to management for any closing remarks. Okay. Well, thank you everybody for taking the time. I just want to reiterate again, how proud I am of the culture we’re creating here, the leadership team that we’ve put in place over the last 9 months to 10 months, and the fact that our reorganization a lot of it is behind us and what we’re really focused on now is executing our strategies, so that we show up for our customers where they want us, how they want us, and then for our team members, that we continue to develop them, grow them and get the opportunities of growth. I think Chipotle is a one of a kind brands and our goal here going forward is continue to drive that one of the kindness with customers and everybody that chooses to be a part of Chipotle. So, thank you for taking the time and appreciate all the questions. Take care. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today’s conference call and thank you for attending. You may now disconnect your lines.","all participants will be in a listen-only mode . at this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Ashish Kohli, head of Investor Relations for Chipotle .",1.0

And welcome to the Chipotle Mexican Grill First Quarter 2019 Results Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode [Operator instructions]. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions [Operator instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Ashish Kohli, Global Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter of 2019 earnings call. By now, you should have access to our earnings press release. If not, it may be found on our Investor Relations Web site at ir.chipotle.com.
I will begin by reminding you that certain statements and projections made in this presentation about our future business and financial results constitute forward looking statements, including projections about comparable restaurant sales growth and new store openings. These statements are based on management's current business and market expectations, and our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Please see the risk factors contained in our 2018 annual report on Form 10-K and in our subsequent Form 10-Qs for a discussion of risks that may cause our actual results to vary from these forward looking statements.
Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these measures to gap measures can be found via the link included on the presentation page within the investor relations section of our Web site.
We will start today's call with prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chief Executive Officer and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer. Afterwards, we will take your questions. Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A session.
With that, I will turn the call over to Brian. Thanks, Ashish and good afternoon, everyone. I'm very pleased to report strong Q1 results with 9.9% comparable restaurant sales growth that included 5.8% transaction growth; restaurant level margins up 21%, 150 basis points higher than last year; earnings per share adjusted for unusual items of $3.40, representing 60% year-over-year growth; and digital sales growing 101% year-over-year to represent 15.7% of sales. The ongoing improvement in each of these key metrics over the past few quarters gives us confidence that our mission to win today and cultivate the future is resonating.
In fact, this is the fifth consecutive quarter of accelerating comps, which reinforces our view that when we connect with guests through culturally relevant marketing, focused on Chipotle's great taste and real ingredients, and provide more convenient access with less friction, they respond enthusiastically. The first quarter strong results were driven by the same strategic focus areas that we've talked about for several quarters now; being culturally relevant and increasing brand engagement and visibility; digitizing and modernizing the restaurant experience; great hospitality and throughput; and of course, enhancing our powerful economic model, all while building a great culture of accountability and creativity.
We were definitely visible this quarter with unique marketing programs that celebrate our real ingredients and classic cooking techniques, as well as several initiatives that caught the attention of our guests. As you know, last fall we launched our four-wheel advertising, which showcase Chipotle's point of difference in real ingredients in real cooking techniques. We followed this up with our behind the foil campaign in February to showcase what is fully kitchen looks like every day; real fresh ingredients; real cooking techniques; and real people.
Chipotle has always believed that there's a connection between how food is ready and prepared to how it tastes. And what I love most about these commercials is there was no studio, no script, no props and no actors. It was just our employees doing what they do best, which is making delicious food. In addition,Q1 also benefited from several other initiatives that made the Chipotle brand more visible in culturally relevant social and traditional media channels. Our free delivery bowl offering, which ran from December 17 to January 7, helped expand access and was not only a great way to attract new guests or app, and delivery capabilities, but also to Chipotle as nearly half of the guests taking part in this offer were new or last users. And we are seeing increased new customer retention with higher levels of delivery sales after the promotion.
We also launched our first digital only menu innovation on January 2nd called Lifestyle Bowls. This resonate with consumers in a big way. In fact, during the first few days, it generated over a billion earned media impressions. Later in the quarter, we extended the Lifestyle menu platforms with plant-powered options, highlighting our Sofritas and Vegetarian Bowls. We're currently testing several other menu items to our stage-gate process and we’ll update you on their progress over time.
And finally, we continue to drive awareness of our brand through a holistic media plan with national TV advertising on culturally relevant programming like March Madness, and always-on social media that resonates with our guests. Collectively, these marketing efforts help drive culture, drive the difference and ultimately drive the Chipotle purchase. This contributed to the lift in Q1 sales as evidenced by digital impressions increasing 300% year-over-year and social impressions increasing 400% year-over-year. We are pleased with the returns on our marketing dollars to-date and expect healthy returns from programs being worked on for the remainder of 2019.
We’re also excited about Chipotle Rewards, which launched on March 12th. The stage-gate process allowed us to learn, enhance and optimize the program to ensure a better guest experience upon launch. And we're encouraged and have already enrolled 3 million members. The rewards or spend day where customers earn 10 points for every dollar spent and receive a free entrée after accruing 1,250 points with periodic bonus offer so real food becomes real treat real fast. In addition to allowing us to reward and thank our guests, we're beginning to gather data that can be used to more effectively target them to engage and grow their loyalty. The Rewards program gives us a currency that we can use to incept behaviors as a key part of our digital system flywheel. Our guests have been asking for a loyalty program for a long time and now the more you eat at Chipotle, the more you can get free Chipotle.
We believe that Chipotle rewards will be a key element that will provide topspin for digital system, which was again a key driver of our sales growth. The digital system, which includes order ahead, delivery, catering, digitize second make lines, mobile order pickup shelf and now, Chipotle rewards, is creating a more convenient and enjoyable guest experience, making it easier to order food from Chipotle, however and wherever you like.
To that end, I am pleased to share that we recently completed the addition of mobile order pickup shelves in all relevant restaurants. These self-service shelves are a key element in digitizing and modernizing our restaurant experience. As they increase access, speed of service and convenience for our guests, while building more love for Chipotle and driving digital sales. In addition, this is a key component to improve delivery times. The delivery driver no longer waits for orders when they enter our restaurant. They simply go straight to the shelf, select the appropriate order and head off to the delivery destination. We feel this is a competitive advantage and allows us to have industry leading delivery times. I want to thank our teams for their great execution on this initiative.
Also with regard to our digital make lines, they're currently in approximately 1,300 restaurants and we expect to have them in all applicable restaurants by the end of 2019. Early results are showing that restaurants of mobile order pickup shelves and digital make lines generate digital sales above our national average. Through a combination of delivery, order ahead and catering, our digital sales accelerated from Q4 and grew 101% year-over-year in quarter one. Digital sales totaled $206 million during the quarter and represented 15.7% of sales. We also re-launched a new chipotle.com website in February that is helping increase customer conversion. We are pleased to be averaging more than 1 million digital transactions per week.
Delivery remains a key driver of our digital growth given enhanced capabilities on our app and website, as well as our expanded reach. As I mentioned earlier, we are seeing some residual lift in delivery sales that last beyond any promotion. And I've seen very little guest overlap between our own in app delivery and our third party delivery partner apps. As part of our goal to increase access, we continue to open Chipotlanes and this test will ramp up later in 2019. These restaurants are a great extension of our digital system as they help increase convenience and access to Chipotle for customers looking to pick up digital orders without getting out of their cars.
On marketing and digital, we're helping to bring guests into our restaurants, the operations team is determined to deliver a great experience that will keep them coming back. Specifically, we are focused on team stability and development, creating and supporting an inclusive engaged culture, exceptional throughput, consistently delivering great tasting food and food safety. Our field leadership conference last month allowed us to reiterate these messages, while also highlighting the theme that Chipotle is a people driven world class organization. The key part of this is to continue supporting and celebrating our general managers through better leadership training, providing a clear direction on career progression to ensure long term success and great benefits as illustrated by our enhanced tuition assistance program.
While early, these efforts are beginning to make a difference. We experienced a solid reduction in overall turnover measures in Q1, which tells us we're on the right path with our people focused initiatives. We are now consistently executing line testings and leveraging chef food and cooking demonstrations to improve the quality of our food. And these efforts are being noticed by guests as measured by our guest experience survey. In addition to these outcomes, we are seeing a modest improvement in throughput, aided by training, focus and providing our teams with an easy to use dashboard that provides greater visibility on performance.
We still have more work to do but I am encouraged by the progress thus far. And we are aligned in our approach and believe that great execution will enable Chipotle to capitalize on future growth opportunities. As we continue to evolve our brand and grow the business, it is an honor to welcome Patricia Fili-Krushel and Scott Boatwright to our board of directors. Pat is currently the CEO of the Center for Talent Innovation, and has previously held numerous leadership roles in Comcast, Time Warner and WebMD. Scott recently retired as CFO of Starbucks after a long and successful career. From contributions in global business strategy and talent management to finance and risk management, I'm confident both Pat's and Scott's perspectives and valuable insights will help us accelerate our goals.
With that, let me conclude by thanking all of our team members for their belief in Chipotle. Their dedication and passion to provide our guests with a great experience, serving real food cooked to perfection and prepared in our restaurants with fresh ingredients. Whether I'm in our restaurants or in our support centers, I feel the energy and see the right actions being taken day-in day-out. It's this focus and strong execution that has brought us to where we are today. To care, hard work and dedication on the line, in the kitchen and in our support centers, are the reason we are winning in the marketplace. We're off to a great start in 2019. And with our sustained efforts, I believe Chipotle can cultivate a better world.
With that, here's Jack to walk you through the financials. Thanks, Brian and good afternoon, everyone. I'm very pleased to report another strong quarter as both comps and margins accelerated from our last report. The biggest lever to strengthening our economic model has always been comp sales and transaction growth. And the Q1 results illustrate that point as we achieved our highest restaurant level margin in nearly four years. Customer engagement and visits are increasing as a result of a compelling marketing message, more convenient access, including delivery and strong operations.
Sales were $1.3 billion in the quarter, an increase of 13.9% from last year and comp sales growth of 9.9%. This 9.9% comp includes a reduction of 30 basis points as a result of deferred revenue from our loyalty program. Restaurant level margins of 21% extended 150 basis points over last year and earnings per share, adjusted for unusual items was $3.40, representing 60% year-over-year growth. The first quarter had unusual expenses related to the transformation, and these negatively impacted our earnings per share by about $0.27, leading to GAAP earnings per share of $3.13.
In Q1, we recognized $7.5 million in non-recurring expenses, primarily related to the organizational restructuring. Transformation costs which started last year now total about $98 million, and we continue to expect these charges to total between $100 million and $120 million. The EPS of $3.40 include $7.3 million or $5.5 million on a tax effective basis. And G&A related to higher bonuses, higher non-cash performance based stock comp adjustments and higher employer payroll taxes, all related to our strong performance and the strong performance of our stock.
The higher stock price also contributed to a tax benefit of 480 basis points in the quarter. The stock option exercises and RSU vestings at the higher stock price drove excess income tax deductions. This tax benefit offset the higher performance based costs included in G&A, resulting in no net impact to EPS. And I'll talk in more detail about these impacts later. Our Q1 comp of 9.9% was driven by a healthy acceleration in transaction as 5.8% of the comp came from greater guests visits. The higher average stock includes a price impact of roughly 2.5% and a mixed contribution of 2% driven by growth in digital orders, which have a higher average check.
With the launch of our Chipotle rewards loyalty program, accounting rules require to deduct or defer revenue for anticipated reward redemptions in our current comp sales. This negatively impacted our Q1 comps by about 30 basis points. We're pleased that our customers have responded enthusiastically for our digital strategies and our culturally relevant marketing, which drove increased guest visits this quarter. And our restaurant teams welcomed our customers by providing a great guest experience.
With these strong Q1 sales results, we're increasing our full year comp guidance from mid single digit to mid to high single digit range with price contributing about 2%. Our comparisons get more difficult as the year goes on. And for Q2 specifically, recall that last year's second quarter benefited by about 100 to 200 basis points, and the beginning of our partnership with DoorDash in May and from the start of our spring marketing campaign.
Finally, the revenue deferral of 30 basis points in the quarter related to loyalty is expected to increase each quarter as we acquire more customers, and it's likely to hit 100 basis points or more before redemption cause the deferrals to level off. We opened 50 new restaurants in the quarter and returned for new restaurants continue to be strong with projected year two cash on cash returns in the low 40% range. Our development teams continue to emphasize high quality and high returning sites. For 2019, we continue to expect to open between 140 to 155 new restaurants with a waiting towards the second half of the year. We anticipate Q2 openings to be slightly higher than what we saw in Q1.
Food costs for the quarter was 32.2%, a decrease of 20 basis points from last year as leverage from the December price increase was partially offset by higher protein prices. Our supply chain team drove approximately $2 million in cost savings through more efficient sourcing this quarter. And while we expect to find additional efficiencies, it's too early to quantify the impact, which we expect to materialize later this year or early next. Of course, our number one priority is to continue to pursue high quality sustainably raised ingredients and our pursuit of efficiencies will never be at expense of food quality or food safety.
While avocado prices were stable throughout most of the quarter, in late March they began to spike based on higher demand from retailers who've been aggressively advertising the fruit combined with lower expected supply in the short term due to the reduced harvesting for an Easter holiday, and a lighter California crop this summer. We expect Q2 food costs to increase around 100 basis points from Q1. For the full year, we continue to believe food costs will be right around 33%.
Labor costs for the quarter were 26.7%, a decrease of 110 basis points from last year. This decrease was driven primarily by sales levers and the menu price increase. We also decreased our workers' comp liability due to better management of claims activity, and we experienced lower unemployment expenses. These benefits were partially offset by labor inflation, which continues to be in the 4% to 5% range. We expect Q2 labor costs to be in the low 26% range as leverage from sales growth and the menu price increase is expected to offset ongoing wage inflation.
Other operating costs for the quarter were 13.4%, an increase of 50 basis points from Q1 of last year and higher marketing and promo costs more than offset sales leverage. Marketing and promo costs were 2.5% in the quarter, an increase of about 70 basis points compared to Q1 of last year to fund our behind the foil campaign in February and free delivery bowl campaign in early January. We expect to increase our marketing investment to around 3.5% in Q2, but still expect overall marketing and promo budget for the full year to be right around 3% of sales.
Other operating costs were also higher due to the inclusion of delivery fees. Delivery continues to be the fastest growing part of our business with high incrementality. And from a margin standpoint, because of the efficiency of our dedicated second make line along with the high leverage our economic models generates on incremental sales, delivery continues to be accretive for our margins.
G&A for the fourth quarter was 7.8% of sales or $103 million, which included nearly $5 million related to transformation expenses, nearly $25 million related to non-cash stock compensation, higher bonus accruals related to our strong performance and payroll taxes and stock option exercises, along with $1.5 million for expenses related to our biannual field leadership conference. Without these items, our underlying G&A support totaled about $72 million right around what we expected.
We expect our underlying G&A support to remain around this level for the rest of the year. And while total G&A each quarter should be lower than the $103 million in Q1 as we complete the transformation of our company and those related costs fall out. The total G&A each quarter will vary as a result of these performance based charges and the level of option exercises. As an example, stock comp in the quarter includes an upward revision of $1.9 million in our non-cash stock comp related to performance shares. Unlike stock options and restricted stock grant, the accounting expense associated with performance shares will adjust up or down each quarter over the vesting term based on actual performance.
Our annual grants have evolved over the past two years to become more heavily weighted towards these BSUs with the percentage of overall equity grants growing from less than 10% in 2017 to about one third in 2019. While these PSUs, which are tied to improving margins and comps, are effective in aligning company performance and incentive pay for the creation of shareholder value, the variable accounting treatment can cause volatility in our recorded quarterly G&A cost. Another component of G&A that's difficult to project and will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter is the employer payroll taxes and stock option exercises and stock vesting. These costs will vary depending on the stock performance and the timing of when our employees choose to exercise.
Depreciation expense for the quarter was $53.8 million, which included $1.8 million of accelerated depreciation related to our digital make line project progressing more quickly than initially anticipated. For the full year, we expect depreciation to be about 4% of sales. Asset retirements were higher this quarter as re-retired assets were identified last year as we completed the big pay. Our effective tax rate was 22% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis, both lower than our communicated range of 27% to 30%.
Our effective tax rate benefited from option exercises and restricted share vesting and elevated stock prices. In essence, we receive a tax deduction for the value our employees receive upon option exercise or share vesting. And when that value exceeds the fixed accounting charge for those shares, we benefit from a higher tax deduction. For the remainder of 2019, we expect our underlying tax rate to be at the low end of our previously disclosed 27% to 30% range. Though it may vary quarter-to-quarter based on the factors I just mentioned.
Our balance sheet remains strong with cash and investments totaling $735 million as of March 31. We repurchased $52.4 million of our stock at an average price of $567 per share during the first quarter. Even though there are fewer shares outstanding and trading as a result of these purchases, our diluted weighted average number of shares increased 422,000 shares as a result of more options being in the money given the higher share price. This negatively impacted EPS by $0.05 in the quarter.
In closing, we're encouraged by our Q1 results and the progress we're making against our strategic growth plan. We know that [Multiple Speakers] initiatives, many of which are in the early stages will help drive sustainable, long-term growth for Chipotle. This will benefit our guests, our employees and our shareholders, and it will allow us to have a positive impact on how real food is sourced and made accessible, contributing to our vision of cultivating a better world.
And now, we're happy to take your questions. We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator instructions]. Our first question comes from Sarah Senator with Bernstein. Please go ahead. I have a question about delivery, if I may. And first part is just, you’ve seen an inflection point, I don't think we've observed in any other limited service in terms of launching delivery and really seeing a change in comp. So I was wondering if you could maybe talk about what you think might be distinct about your context for what you're doing, where you could see that level of incrementality that we're not really seeing perhaps elsewhere. And then just on the margin side, you said it is accretive to margins but then also called that that was a cost headwind. So could you talk a little bit about that? And if there's any opportunity to perhaps lower the cost and delivery, whether it’s the take rates that aggregators have or something else? Thanks. So, we’ll answer both of those questions. So your first question, why do we believe Chipotle is a great solution with respect to delivery. I think it's as simple as our food really travels well in the channel. And then when you think about the time and the ease of access to actually get your order in and then the amount of time that it takes for your food to then get you is some of the best in that space. So we're basically removing a lot of obstacles for people, because the app experience or the web experience, I think is one of the best out there. So it's very easy for people to place order. And then when you look at the time for people to get their food from orders at home, again, it's one of the best alternatives out there for that space.
So time and time here is delivery drivers love delivering Chipotle food, because of our smart pickup times. So they know the food be ready when they walk into the restaurants, they grab it off those pickup shelves and they go. And there's literally no wasted time in the process. And that's we're going to continue to work towards is removing all the friction so that these deliveries become as efficient as possible.
In regard to your question on the margins and incrementality, we continue to see as we give people more access, we get more incremental business. And delivery is one of those occasions that is proving to be highly incremental for the Chipotle business. And on the margin side of things, we are continuing to see with that high level of incrementality it results in a margin accretive proposition. Jack, I don't know if you want to add anything. The only thing, Sarah, when we look at delivering, we take the sales. Some of it is trade off that we think is coming from in-store to delivery. Most of it, we think at least two thirds is incremental. But we take our costs associated with that business. So we separate it as a separate business and we've got our food costs, our labor costs and you factor in the delivery costs as well. Our second make line is very, very efficient and our incrementality, our model drive a high margin incrementality, that the margin that we get on the delivery business is higher than the 21%. So if we didn't have delivery, we would not have delivered the 21% margin. Now, I called that out in other that we do have delivery fees in there. So you're going to see that line item is going to be higher. When you take the whole P&L of delivery together, we're generating net incremental margins at a higher than 21%. The next question comes from Nicole Miller with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Thank you. Good afternoon and congratulations. If you could think about same store sales performance and rank the drivers, it does sound like delivery is number one. But I'm just wondering what TV marketing in past you would suggest there was on comp. And then in terms of delivery, when you think about the 15% or so of sales in delivery, how much was going to your app? And how much is going through other third party marketplace sites? And besides having the ability to keep your data when it comes to your app, what are some of the other economic differences? The first piece I just want to clarify the 15.7% is digital. So that's percent of sales in digital. Within that 15.7%, delivery makes up a certain percentage of that. So I just want to make sure if you guys understand the 15.7% it's not a delivery percent of sales, that's our total digital percent of sales. To go to your first question though, the breakdown between the various levers that drove comp, and I really think we just had a lot of things working in unison that we're building nicely on top of each other. You have the marketing, which I think was very visible with some smart menu innovation around these ideas of lifestyle goals.
And then we've got very positive response to advertising, which I think reinforces why Chipotle is a different restaurant company there is real ingredients, real cooking techniques that brings food really fresh to you at tremendous speed and tremendous value. So I think that is coming through loud and clear. And we know that is a compelling message for people to be excited about being part of the Chipotle business.
The other piece, obviously, is our digital business. As we continue to make access easier, so there's mobile pickup shelves giving to more restaurants, the digital make lines giving to more restaurants. We just execute that much better than we did the prior week. And what we're seeing is consumers love the app experience. They love the new website experience. And that's resulting in them committing, I think more and more to this easier access approach through the digital channel. Many layer in the idea of delivery, which our delivery times are usually below 30 minutes. And what we're hearing from folks is they love obtaining that new point of access as well.
I think we're also one of the only companies out there that has delivery boat in our own app, and is using a third-party partner like a DoorDash or those that are delivering for us. And what we're seeing is no overlap between the two access points. So they're proving to be two different occasions and which is really terrific news. And we have built strong relationships with our partners where we're able to use data smartly to inform what we do next, as well as in the data reflecting internally.
The other thing too is the rewards program got started. And one of the things that's terrific about the rewards program is we see another level of engagement into our digital system. So you see even more commitment to the idea of digital ordering, as well as all these additional access points. So the last thing too is I would tell you our operations. If you had a chance to be in Chipotle lately, I think they have really improved versus where we were three months ago, six months ago or even nine months ago.
Our crews are staffed they know about how to make great food, they're doing line testings, the restaurants look great. And we're making progress on throughput. So when you think about all the initiatives that are going on, our operations, I think are operating at a higher level than they have in the past. I think our digital system is more robust than it was in the past. And I think our marketing is much more on point and much more visible. So it's hard to distinguish one versus the other. I really think it is all those things working in unison, and that's why we get that 9.9% comp. The next question comes from David Tarantino with Baird. Please go ahead. Just a couple of questions on the sales trends. Jack first can you maybe talk about how the comps trended through the quarter? Was it a gradual build or any color you could add there would be helpful? So we started the quarter very strong. We had the free delivery bowls that continued into January. Then we had Lifestyle Bowls as well. There was a lot of talk about the Lifestyle Bowls. So the quarter started out very, very strong. We had weather then in the middle of the quarter, and then things rebounded near the end of the quarter. So there's a lot going on in the quarter. It was overall relatively steady if you factor out some of the weather. But we did start out -- like I said, we started out very strong and then settled into nice gains for the quarter with the exception of the weather during the middle of the quarter. And then, Brian, you mentioned that the guest experience surveys that you run have responded well to the operational improvements you mentioned. So I was wondering if you could perhaps elaborate on where you are now on whatever metric you're measuring versus where you were three or six months ago. And how much you think that might be influencing the trends that you're seeing relative to some of the more tangible drivers you talked about? So one of the biggest things that we've seen make the dramatic change is just the feedback on the food testings. And I think that's a direct result of our teams being basically focused on ensuring they’re creating great food and they are doing their line testings. And so one of the examples I'd give you is what we seen in customer satisfaction surveys is people are commenting on how great the food tastes again. And I think that is a testament to a couple of things. You don't end up with great food unless people make the food correctly. And you don't end up with great food if, when you sit down and go to eat your food that’s not in a great environment. So all those things I think help build the idea that this food was terrific. The other thing that we're seeing in our customer satisfaction surveys are people just are getting us high marks on overall experience versus where we were in the past. So is a customer satisfaction survey is the best way for us to get that feedback, and we're very excited about the momentum we're seeing in those key metrics. And then just a quick follow up. Brian, I know you shared some throughput metrics in the past related to your peak 15 minute intervals. And I think the last update you gave us was 25 transactions in the peak on average for the change, and it used to be 35 before all the issues. So can you maybe just give us an update on where you are heading into the peak season here on that metric? So I think I made comment in my early remarks. We're seeing some improvement on that mid 25, that mid 20s number. And we're excited about the improvement that we've seen. We're not I think done getting better on this throughput front. We're obviously not close to that mid 30 number that you referenced, David. But we're definitely making progress from the mid 20. And I think this is going to be one of those things that overtime we just continue to get better at. This is element of having teams in place with some stability with the right leader in place, so that they really get into a rhythm of great throughput. But early indications, we're making some progress on this front already. And we're excited because there's still so much headroom to get us back to where we were. The next question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. First, can you just comment, Brian, little more about the loyalty program? How does this fit in as you think about comp drivers? And you talked last quarter about a material step up in trend when you did delivery and activated digital? Did it result or is it too early to tell if this is also resulting in another step function up in sales? Or does it taking longer to engage consumers given it take some time to clear the points? I think John it's going to take a little bit longer for us to see the direct impact. What we are excited about though is I think I said this in the past. One of the big request from our consumers was a rewards program. We've rolled out a rewards program and now we've already got 3 million people enrolled. And we're just getting started with using that information to then smartly market to those individuals. So there're few things that are going to be happening over the next year. We're going to continue to build that enrollment. And as you build that enrollment, it gives us a bigger universe then to create the right programs to incentivize behaviors and hopefully change behaviors associated with it.
But I don't think we've seen the impacts yet from the rewards program, because we're just getting started with the enrollment and we're frankly just getting started with doing some targeted marketing leveraging that. And if I could, just one follow up on labor, Jack. Is my calculation is labor dollars per store ran a bit higher than what you would call your wage inflation about 6% versus wage inflation of 4% to 5%. And if that's right, is this just the cost of higher throughput and higher volumes in your stores? Or is that the right way to think about labor dollars per store going forward if your conference are at this new higher run rate? John, our labor was really outstanding during the quarter. Our teams staff and deployed had about the right level. They certainly didn't have more hours than we would have expected of anything. They were a little more efficient than we would normally shoot for, but we had a burst in volume. So when you have that 9.9% and you should think about the comp as being at 10.3%, because that deferral means we had customers that came in they are paying customers and so it's a journal entry to take us from about a 10.2% or 10.3% down to a 9.9%. And so our folks had the right amount of labor. The way I would think about it, John, is we levered labor by over 100 basis points. We also dealt with about 100 basis points or a little more in terms of wage inflation. And so we had to cover the 100 basis points of wage inflation, and then we levered another 100 basis points. And we only had a modest price increase. So I think our labor is outstanding. And I think if we stay at these sales levels so we should stay at this labor level. Your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Please go ahead. I just wanted to follow-up on the Chipotle Rewards Loyalty program, it seems like 3 million members is pleasing to you relative to perhaps your internal expectation. And I would assume you therefore have customer information now in these 3 millions. I'm wondering if you can go into a little more color in terms of how you'd measure ultimate success, whether how that membership compares to what you think that your total unique users? And Brian, you mentioned the one-to-one marketing. I’m just wondering how we should think about that playing out in terms of using the data to effectively market to those loyal users? So I think that is one of the most valuable pieces of the rewards program is it creates a different type of engagement and relationship with our customers. What we saw in our proof of concept or our test markets is this data, when we turn it into communication, is able to incent behaviors. And we do see behavioral changes, so light user becoming a medium user, a non-user becoming a light user. And you see people moving the various cohorts. We’re early days. We haven't even had for a lot of -- we have 3 million people, which we're delighted about but those are coming in on a daily basis. So we even had a chance to market with these folks on a couple months basis here, so it's really early. But I think the positive is we've got a lot of evidence that consumers want to be a part of it. And we've had evidence in our test markets that when we use the data smartly with them, we do see behavioral changes that results in a positive outcome for our sales group. And then just to clarify, you mentioned the digital sales being, I think you said just shy of 16%. But I know you mentioned that some stores obviously doing a whole lot better than that. So I'm wondering if you can maybe give some perspective in terms of the range across the country in terms of where you’ve seen the greatest success and how you’d measure the -- I guess the incrementality of those sales relative to more traditional sales? So we've seen where we've got the full digital system in place, definitely higher percent of sales going through the digital channels with higher sales in general. And I think we've even talked about this. Another example is the Chipotlane where you really have added another level of access, and this is why we're continuing to expand that test. We've seen percent of sales for digital touch 30%. So we're very optimistic that there still is a lot of growth to be had. And a lot of that growth is incremental to business. So we're very optimistic about continuing to drive this access point and ecosystem. The next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. I was hoping to understand the experience of the stores that have had the pickup shelves, and the digitally enhanced second make line the longest. Has there been a significant labor opportunity on a given number of transactions that can be realized in those stores versus other stores that have newly implemented those projects, or perhaps even best said, the stores that don't yet have those projects? I mean, what is definitely true is the most valuable transaction is an order ahead, whether it's in mobile or website, and then that consumer comes in and picks it up from the shelf, because obviously that leverage is then the digital make line, which requires less labor to run. And then, obviously, that transaction usually comes with a higher ticket as well. So that is the most valuable transaction for us to grow. One of the things I love about the Chipotlane test is it gives them more access to that highly valuable transaction, because they order ahead and now they don’t have to even get out of their car to have an experience with a burrito bowl coming off our second make line. So there's a lot of upside in getting more and more business to that second make line just from an efficiency standpoint and then obviously the consumer just key at which they can get to their burrito bowl. And then secondly and I think this was touched on briefly. Some of the broader supply chain work that you've been working on. I mean if we could have an update on some timing and potential benefit on that, especially if you look into '20? So we're early days on this and we already started to see some benefit in the quarter. Their focus is obviously to continue to be as efficient as possible without making a trade off on the quality and our commitment to our integrity price goals. I don't know Jack if you wanted to add anything to that. John, I think the headline is it's too early. Brian is right that's our highest priority. We're also keeping ourselves busy just by keeping up with the growing volume. And we're seeing theoretical opportunities, efficiency opportunities, but they take time. We've got contracts. We've had a lot of suppliers. And so I would expect that we'll be able to -- if we don't see the benefit flow through later this year, perhaps in the fourth quarter, we'll at least have better visibility and we can tell you what those might look like going forward. Your next question comes from Jake Bartlett with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Jack, I have a question about G&A. And you gave us the underlying I think $72 million run rate continuing. I'm trying to understand the stock based comp. And I believe you mentioned $25 million, but that also included bonus accruals. I wasn't sure if that all was really the stock based comp. And then if you hit your guidance, if the current guidance is hit. Is that $25 million pertain for the rest of the year, because that’s the right run rate for that, for bonus accruals and stock based camp. And then built into that question, there was a big impact on the tax rate with the $25 million. Would the tax rate go down as well to offset some of it? I'm trying to get a better idea of what the G&A could be for '19? Well, first of all, let me try to piece that -- tear that apart. The $25 million of that $19 million relates to our stock comp. And of that $19 million, about $2 million is an adjustment to stock comp, because we had better performance. We have, as we disclose in our proxy we, over the last couple of years, have emphasized more PSUs performance shares. Those performance shares will be marked each quarter based on how we actually perform. If you follow us historically when we've issued [indiscernible] as our option, those are fixed accounting and they don't change quarter-to-quarter, doesn't matter what our performance is, doesn't matter what the stock performance is. So it's a different animal that aligns better, we think the incentives with creating shareholder value. But it's going to have variable accounting and we're going to have drones entry that are going to happen throughout the year.
The other 6 million relate to the higher bonus accrual, because of our performance. And that's going to be a cash bonus based on how we perform each quarter. And so if we continue to perform at this level, there will be higher bonus accruals. And then another element in there is that because our stock has performed so well, we've had an increase in the number of stock option exercises. And we have to pay payroll taxes on those, those are very difficult to predict when those are going to happen, also difficult to predict what the stock price is going to be. So there's going to be a number of things that are going to be not part of our core. The G&A this quarter didn't have to do with extra headcount, didn't have to do with extra travel, didn't have to do with anything from an ongoing basis that we need to continue to spend to support a restaurant. But these are incentive based things that are going to hit based on how we perform throughout the year.
Difficult to predict exactly what the number will be, I think the best way to think about it. Underlying is about $72 million and underlying means that’s our headcount to support our business, that's the travel, that's the outside services to support our business. There's a base layer, I would say, of about that $17 million stock comp that if we had fixed accounting that $17 million would not change throughout the year. And then on top of that, we're going to have amounts that will vary depending on our bonus accrual, and that will be performance based depending on the PSUs and that will be performance based on margins and what our stock comp is. And then to the extent that our folks exercise option, the stock price remains high, there may be some payroll tax impact as well. And then you just secondly, Jack, you’ve mentioned in the past, just your last call, a framework around AUVs and what AUVs could have a given restaurant level margin. I had trouble getting there. And so I'm just wondering when you talked about last call 2.2 million in AUVs and 22% restaurant margins. Is that still -- or does that include inflation going forward? Is that if you were standing right now with your current cost structure, and you have those higher AUVs that's what your margin would be? Trying to understand whether that's really how we can frame that target and mesh the two with those AUVs? Jake, it's more of a standing still. And in fact, we're right on the money right now. Our trailing 12 month average volume is 20% -- $0.5 million -- $2.05 million we're at 21% margin during this quarter. And what I've talked about is $2 million you’re at about a 20% margin, $2.2 million you're at 22%. The way I would think about it from here, if we layered on $100,000 worth of incremental volume as of today, our margins at 21% during the quarter, would be -- that extra $100,000 would be a 22%. Now, over time inflation is going to have an impact there. We have to either offset inflation through modest price increases and/or leverage from higher sales. But as long as we're able to offset inflation over time, our model has the ability to expand margins at about 100 basis points to reach $100,000 of sales added.
And I think probably the most important thing is we've been able to do this as our delivery business is growing dramatically, and we know the industry that's been a real challenge. We think we're uniquely suited with the second make line and efficiencies we drive with that second make line, and our model that inherently allows us to create leverage -- margin leverage as we grow sales. We're very optimistic that the more we add delivery sales to our business that margin has the ability to continue to drift upward. The next question comes from Andrew Charles with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Jack, I had a two part question for you. You called out projected year-two cash-on-cash returns and a low 40% range. Obviously, very stellar return. Do you think there's going to be a delta between the 2018 and 2019 cohort? That 2018 development skewed to some of the higher volume markets, or are you testing some the higher cost towards that in 2019? And then secondly is the low 40% returns, is that a strong enough hurdle to justify accelerating development back to call it the 250 openings per year you opened at the peak? First of all in terms of 2018 versus 2019, I mean it's early. It won't have 15 restaurants in so far. But I don't see any reason why 2019 performance wouldn't be similar to 2018. Meaning similar volumes, similar margins, similar returns. It does suggest that we have opportunity to step it up and open up more restaurants. We know that we're only halfway to our ultimate potential. We're about 2500 restaurants now with the ability to get to 5,000. So it suggests that we can step it up but we're going to do it the very thoughtful way. This is not going to be -- we're going to blow the doors off and go from -- our guidance this year is 141, 155, we're not going to all of a sudden open up two or 250 or something like that.
What's most important is that we open at a pace that we're able to find great real estate that'll continue to generate these returns that we'll be able to hire, and develop and staff, our restaurants with great managers and great crew. So we'll have the right cadence going forward. But I do think you can expect us to take our opening guidance up each year in an incremental fashion. Too early to say how much that will be in 2020. But we're optimistic about the results and we'll step it up from here. Your next question comes from Gregory Francfort with Bank of America. Please go ahead. The first question is G&A in a longer term basis? Maybe can you help frame up how you expect that to grow versus revenue? And then the second question just on the unit opening cadence within the year. I think last quarter you'd given us that the second quarter was going to be around 25% of openings for the year. Is that still the case or is it different from that? What was your first question? I was just -- your G&A on a longer term and leveraging it versus revenue growth… The underlying G&A, and I have to emphasize underlying G&A. Underlying G&A will grow at a lesser rate than sales growth. That's our goal internally. And I know we can achieve that goal. From a stock comp standpoint, we're going to have journal entries. Remember, these are journal entries, and these journal entries are different today, because we have PSUs from the journal entries we would report three or four years ago when we had slow start. Even though we're issuing equity, even though there's solution related to this equity, the accounting treatment is dramatically different. And so it's important to understand that these journal entries that we're making, it doesn't change our cash flow, it doesn't change our cash and cash return but it does going to show up in our G&A through these accounting journal entries.
The underlying G&A and that's the headcount, the travel, the outside services that we use to support our restaurants, we do plan to grow that at a lesser percent of sales. And then we're going to have cyclical things like we're going to have a quarter where there's a lot of option exercise and we're going to have a blip in payroll taxes. That's not a sustainable fundamental thing that will continue every single quarter. And we're going to have -- when we have great years like this or great quarter like this, you're going to have bonus accruals. But the idea there is that will be a match along with our improving out the economic model. And it really sets up sets us up for continued momentum, both in our sales, our margin, as well as EPS.
And then the second question was I think on opening. I think I mentioned in my comments, Q2 will open up at a little bit more than the 15 that we opened up in the first quarter. So this is going to be one of those years where we're pretty more heavily loaded in the second half of the year than we've been in quite some time. The next question comes from Will Slabaugh with Stephens. Please go ahead. I had a question on menu innovation. And what we've seen in the past is when menu innovation that generally uses ingredients already in store. Should we expect future menu innovation rather to mostly take that same form, or is there room to broaden SKUs in the restaurant at this point? Yes, you're going to see us doing both. Obviously, what we did in the first quarter was leverage existing ingredients that were already on the line. But I think I've mentioned this before, we're using our stage-gate process to evaluate either new ingredients and/or new forms to bring into the restaurant. And one of our key criteria in order to bring in a new form or an all new ingredient is it can't have an impact on throughput. So the consumers going to love it, it's got to work financially but it also has to work for our operating process. And so as a result, it's going to take a little longer time to bring things to market that are either a change in process or require new equipment or a new form versus it's much easier to do things like a new ingredient or introduce people to a new way, or a new Lifestyle Bowl, like we did in the first quarter. But the plan is to do both. The next question comes from Howard Penny with Hedgeye. Please go ahead. My questions on delivery. Is Georgia's funding part of the delivery or are you funding all of the delivery costs? And if you are given all the benefits that you're seeing from delivery from a margin perspective and enhance capability of delivery. Why wouldn't you offer delivery free all the time and if not all the time, three or four days a week? Thanks. So, obviously, delivery is one of those access modes that consumers definitely want to experience. This is a scenario where we want to set up the model to be a model that can work long-term, not just here in the near term. And long term, we can just be planning to do free delivery all the time. So really what we're focused on is, how do we build the right economic model where the consumer gets a great experience, they get a great value and as a result, they want to do it more. And I think that's what we're setting up and establishing with our key partners, whether they are doing it through our app or through a third-party. The next question comes from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer and Company. Please go ahead. Jack, you said labor costs in 2Q should be in the low 26% range. And that would suggest a similar amount of leverage that you got in first quarter. So just trying to clarify. Are you assuming a similar sales trend in 2Q as 1Q when you talk about that labor guide? And second to that the full year guidance for labor, back when you talked to us last quarter, was low 27% range. But you didn't really update that this quarter for the full year. Where's that target now in your mind for full year labor costs? When I think about Q2, I would not expect the same comp. Take into account by the full year guidance that we gave and take into account that comps get tougher each quarter. What it does mean though is seasonally our sales are higher in the second quarter. So when you move from Q1 to Q2, you naturally have a higher sales amount and you naturally have a leverage, just from moving to seasonally higher sales. It doesn't mean the comp is going to be at the same 9.9% level.
The other thing I would expect that labor for the year is going to be somewhere in between these two levels. I mean, you got 26.7% in the first quarter. Fourth quarter seasonally is very similar. And the two quarters in the middle should be similar where you're in that low 26% range. So I think somewhere between the low 26% to the 26.7% we just delivered, I think that's a fair estimation of where labor should fall. And what we shown in this quarter, we have labor at that level. And as long as we don't have as long as things like avocados normalize we could deliver this strong comp in the 20%, 21% range or so. And the next question comes from Brian Vaccaro with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Just two quick ones on delivery, if I could. Would you be willing to ballpark what percent of digital sales is coming from delivery? And also curious what percent of orders are coming through the company app versus the DoorDash or other third party platforms? And did that move much since the launch of the loyalty program over the five or six weeks? We're not going to break out the composition of our digital sales but with obviously to be up 100% year-over-year. We're seeing great progress in all aspects of the digital system, whether it's order ahead delivery. Consumers continue to want to have access digitally and then they want to have access where it's either brought to them or they can get it quick. So that's working very nicely. And then adding rewards, I think I mentioned this before. One of the things that's great about the rewards program is it's another level of engagement in this digital system. And we have continued to see when people become engaged in the rewards program, they become even more engaged in our digital system. And you see an uptick in our digital as a percent of sales as well there.
So it really requires all these things to be working in unison. We got to have the pickup shelves, which I'm happy to say we now have that have in other restaurants, the digital make line, which we're in 1,300 rec up there we'll be finishing that up in 2019. And then the rewards program is in the early days as well where we've got 3 million people already engaged. And then we're giving them the access that they want, whether we're testing our Chipotlanes or letting DoorDash or a third party like that deliver to them at their home. So the digital system is a powerful growth driver for the company going forward. And it's consistent with the strategy that I've shared with you guys. So we're really excited about the early innings of all this stuff. And then shift into the commodity outlet, Jack, the 33% that you gave for the year. I'm just curious, what's the underlying inflation embedded in that forecast? And just are you assuming that avocados stay where they are currently after this recent run up? Or any other puts and takes on what you're seeing on core proteins and/or other areas that we should be mindful of? Thank you. We're seeing just a little bit of inflation in some of our [indiscernible]. Most of the commodities that we're looking at look pretty benign. The real story the only call out is significant call out is avocados. We're paying a lot more right now. That's why second quarter food costs going to be about 100 basis points more. We'll update you when we update you for the second quarter, hopefully that will ease a little bit as you move into the third quarter. We do expect it to go back to normal once we move back to away from California in the fourth quarter. But avocados are a tough thing to predict. Other than avocados, most other things are pretty modest, very low single digit inflation. And so that's why we think we can stay in this 33% range overall for the year. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Brian Niccol for any closing remarks. All right, thank you. And thank you everybody for taking the time and the questions. I just wanted to remind folks, I think the strategies that we outlined over a year ago, we're starting to see the impacts of the execution around that strategy, whether it is making the brand more visible with culturally relevant marketing and menu innovation, or making the restaurant experience more digital with the roll out of our mobile pickup shelves, the digital make line, the delivery partnerships and now the rewards program, to operational improvements focused on great hospitality, great food, a great environment and then ultimately, terrific throughput.
And then obviously, we're going to continue to work hard to improve this economic model, which is I think one of the best in the industry through being smart and being efficient and prudent in how we choose to spend our money. And then the key piece too is we want to continue to drive home access for Chipotle, whether that means physical access to more restaurants, more digital access through the various channels that I’ve talked about earlier. But we want to have Chipotle solve people's needs for how they want to eat in today and in the future. So very proud of the team and the results that we achieved in Q1, and very excited that we continued down this strategy, and continue to execute with excellence going forward.
So thank you for your time. And we'll talk to you all soon. Take care. The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

And at this time, I’d like to turn the call over to Mr. Ashish Kohli, Head of Investor Relations. Hello, everyone and apologies for the delayed opening. Welcome to our second quarter 2019 earnings call. By now you should have access to our earnings press release. If not, it may be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.chipotle.com. I will begin by reminding you that certain statements and projections made in this presentation about our future business and financial results constitute forward-looking statements. Including projections about comparable restaurant sales growth, new store openings, our effective tax rate and expected G&A expenses.
These statements are based on management’s current business and market expectations and our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Please see the risk factors contained in our annual – 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our subsequent Form 10-Qs for a discussion of risks that may cause our actual results to vary from these forward-looking statements.
Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these measures to GAAP measures can be found via the link included on the presentation page within the Investor Relations section of our website.
We will start today’s call prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer. After which we will take your questions. Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A session.
With that, I’ll turn the call over to Brian. Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. We’re pleased with our second quarter financial performance which reflects continued progress on the strategic initiatives we discussed at our special Investor Call just over a year ago. Since that time, our efforts to highlight that Chipotle sources, cooks and serves real food that has the power to cultivate a better world have led to a meaningful improvement in our business fundamentals. In fact, this marks the sixth consecutive quarter of accelerating comparable sales, which reinforces our view that when we connect with guests through culturally relevant marketing focused on Chipotle’s great taste and real ingredients and provide more convenient access with less friction, they respond.
For the quarter, we reported 10% comparable restaurant sales growth that included nearly 7% transaction growth, restaurant level margins of 20.9% which is 120 basis points higher than last year, earnings per share adjusted for unusual items of $3.99 representing 39% year-over-year growth and digital sales growth of 99% year-over-year representing 18.2% of sales. These strong results were delivered despite the tougher year-over-year comparison and benefited from better execution, on four key initiatives we mentioned on last year’s call, specifically revamping our marketing, creating a stage-gate process for innovations, leveraging our second make line to grow digital sales and expand access and engaging with our customers by launching a new loyalty program. All of these efforts are layered on top of our foundational work to run successful restaurants with great hospitality and throughput.
Let me now spend a few minutes updating you on each of these initiatives. First, starting with our marketing efforts. We made sure to stay relevant throughout the quarter by celebrating our real ingredients and classic cooking techniques. Our Behind The Foil campaign resonated with guests by showcasing the connection between how food is raised and prepared to how it taste by featuring our team members pride in making delicious food daily.
In addition, Q2 benefited from several strategic promotions that made the Chipotle brand more visible for helping to expand access. An example is a free delivery promotion in conjunction with the prominent influencer to celebrate National Burrito Day on April 4. Leveraging the social and digital experience helped make this, the highest sales day in Chipotle’s history.
More importantly, it was another opportunity to acquire customers and transactions by introducing them for the convenience of delivery and we are seeing increased new customer retention with higher levels of delivery sales after the promotion. On the menu side, we are elevating our core by developing innovations that leads food culture and meet guests requests. Our Lifestyle Bowls remain popular with customers and we continue to test new menu items that are in various stages of development.
The furthest along is Carne Asada, which I am pleased to announce is nearing validation through our stage-gate process, after which we will decide on the timing of a potential national launch. This item is easy to execute operationally as unique flavor profile and is receiving terrific customer feedback in our test markets. We are also gaining valuable feedback on our Quesadilla pilot with the good news being that customers really love it.
The new ovens are helping to improve the quality and taste of the Quesadillas and could potentially be a platform for other new menu items including desserts and nachos. That being said, we still have some work to do in order to streamline our workflow. As I’ve stated previously, we are not going to roll out new menu items at the sacrificed throughput. We will update you on our progress of all potential new menu items as they move through our stage-gate process.
We are very excited about Chipotle rewards which launched on March 12 and has exceeded our expectations with over five million enrolled members. Encouragingly these sign-ups across all frequency bands, and we are starting to use customer data to more effectively target and engage the incidence of lower frequency in lapsed users. Early results are showing that members are increasing their frequency after joining the program. The rewards program gives us a currency that we can use to incent behaviors and is a key enabler of our digital ecosystem moving forward.
Our customers are responding positively to our digital system, which includes order ahead, delivery and catering as it reduces friction and creates a convenient and enjoyable way for our guests to experience Chipotle. Overall, digital sales grew 99% year-over-year to $262 million during the quarter and represented 18.2% of sales. For this in perspective, this was more than we did in digital sales during all of 2016. Delivery remains a key driver of our digital growth given enhanced capabilities on our app and website, as well as our expanded reach. In fact, delivery is now available for more than 95% of our restaurants and remains highly incremental.
We continue to see residual lift in delivery sales that last beyond any promotion and have seen very little guest overlap between our own in-app delivery and our third-party delivery partner apps. Additionally with mobile order pickup shelves available in all relevant restaurants and digital make lines in nearly 2,000 restaurants, we are modernizing and making the customer and team member experience, more efficient, while building more love for Chipotle. With more customers coming to Chipotle restaurants, many of whom are new, it is imperative we provide a great guest experience. The operations team has made progress against this goal, partly as a result of our focus to make 2019 the year of the General Manager.
Specifically, we have a great company with a meaningful purpose that people want to be a part of. We have a culture of food safety. We are dedicated to training and developing talent and we are enhancing our industry-leading employee benefits. In addition to our newly expanded tuition assistance program you may have seen our recent announcement of a new crew bonus program. This gives hourly employees the opportunity to turn up to an extra month’s pay each year based on the restaurant achieving certain performance in food safety goals. This is another example of investing in our most valuable asset, our people.
As a result of these efforts, we believe our employee value proposition is resonating. Manager and crew turnover have come down nicely over the past year. Our food is being prepared more consistently through line tastings and our result is being executed better. And we are seeing steady improvement in throughput aided by training, focus and providing our teams with an easy to use dashboard, that provides greater visibility on performance.
While I am encouraged by the progress thus far, I believe we still have a significant opportunity for further throughput gains. When done well throughput isn’t simply about moving people through the restaurant as quickly as possible, instead, it’s about outstanding customer service with clear authentic communication as customers efficiently move down our serving line. I believe better execution on our five key pillars, which have historically been proven throughput drivers will drive sales and transactions.
Everyone at Chipotle believes real food can change the world. So we strive every day to do the right thing for our employees, for our customers and for the environment. I would like to personally thank each of our team members for their tireless dedication and passion to make Chipotle success.
In closing, what really excites me is that I believe we are still in the early stages on many of our key initiatives and by continuing to execute and get better which we are committed to doing, Chipotle is well positioned for future growth.
With that, here’s Jack to walk you through the financials. Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. We’re proud of our performance for the first half of 2019 as we continue to see comps and margins expand. Combination of investing in our people, delivering relevant and compelling marketing, and enhanced digital system and great execution in our restaurants is all leading to a better guest dining experience, which ultimately allows us to further strengthen our economic model.
Sales were $1.4 billion in the second quarter, an increase of 13.2% from last year. The comp was 10% in the quarter, which includes a 40 basis point reduction as a result of deferred revenue from our rewards program. Restaurant level margins of 20.9% expanded 120 basis points over last year and earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $3.99 representing 39% year-over-year growth. The second quarter had unusual expenses related to our transformation as well as legal reserves, which I’ll talk about in more detail later and these negatively impacted our earnings per share by about $0.77 leading to GAAP earnings per share of $3.22.
Our Q2 comp of 10% was driven by healthy acceleration in transactions as nearly 7% of the comp came from greater guest visits. The higher average check includes a price impact of about 2% and a mix contribution of roughly 1.5% driven by growth in digital orders which have a higher average check. We’re delighted by the customer response to the convenience offered by our digital strategies as well as the culturally relevant marketing which once again drove increased guest visits into our restaurant.
Given the strong Q2 and first half of 2019 results, we’re increasing our full year comp guidance from mid to high single digits. To the high single digits with price continuing contribute about 2%. And as you think about the cadence for the remaining two quarters, remember that our comparisons get more difficult as the year unfolds.
We opened 20 new restaurants in the quarter, with continued strong economics. For 2019, we expect to open between 140 and 155 new restaurants with the weighting that’s heavily skewed toward the fourth quarter. We anticipate Q3 opening to be slightly higher than what we saw in Q2 with Q4 openings increasing significantly. Based on the site pipeline we’re building so far this year, we expect the 2020 new restaurant openings to be more equally weighted by quarter.
Food cost for the quarter were 33.7%, an increase of 110 basis points from last year due primarily to higher avocado prices partially offset by a menu price increase, while we anticipated some of the avocado price increase due to a spike in late March based on higher demand from retailers, prices spiked again in June going to further reduce supply coming from Mexico. This resulted in a roughly 50 basis point greater headwind from avocados during the quarter than we expected.
Avocado prices are likely to remain elevated in July, but should start to moderate as we move through the quarter as our sourcing shifts to other market. Offsetting some of the avocado pressure in Q2 was approximately $2 million of cost savings through more efficient sourcing, while our supply chain team will continue to search for efficiencies, our top priority is to continue to pursue high quality, sustainably raise ingredients and our pursuit of efficiencies will never be at the expense of food quality or food safety.
Of note, protein pricing was in line with our expectations during the quarter and we’ve not seen any impact for market forces thus far. Since we purchased higher quality more expensive pork as opposed to commodity pork, and we have pricing agreements in place, covering the near term, we don’t expect a significant impact on our costs for the rest of this year.
Factoring in the above items, we expect Q3 cost of sales to be slightly lower than Q2, while Q4 should be at or slightly below 33% of sales. Labor costs for the quarter were 25.7%, a decrease of 130 basis points from last year. This decrease was driven primarily by sales leverage, partially offset by labor inflation which continues to be in the 4% to 5% range.
We expect Q3 labor costs to be in the mid-26% range as we expect similar labor inflation against lower sales seasonality. Other operating costs for the quarter were 13.5%, a decrease of 30 basis points from Q2 last year, as sales leverage more than offset higher marketing and promo costs. Marketing promo costs were 3.3% in the quarter, an increase of about 10 basis points compared to Q2 of last year to fund our Behind the Foil campaign and various delivery promotions. We expect our marketing investment to be spent more evenly over the second half of the year, with the marketing and promo budget for the full year remaining around 3% of sales. Other operating costs continue to include delivery fees.
And delivery is the way for us to increase convenience, drive awareness and ultimately acquire new customers. It remains the fastest growing part of our business with a relatively small portion being associated with free delivery promotions. Given the high incrementality we’re currently seeing, delivery continues to be accretive to our restaurant level margins.
G&A for the quarter was $121 million on a GAAP basis or $97 million on a non-GAAP basis which excludes $4 million related to transformation expenses and $20 million for legal reserves. G&A also includes $20 million related to non-cash stock compensation and $4 million related to higher bonus accruals from our strong performance and payroll taxes and stock option exercises. Similar to last quarter, without these items, our underlying G&A this quarter, restaurants total right around $72 million, which is in line with our expectations. Moving forward, we expect our underlying G&A support to increase by about $2 million to $3 million in Q3 as we round out our organizational structure.
Assuming our current financial trends continue, I would expect stock compensation, including performance adjustments and higher bonus expenses to remain right around this $25 million for both Q3 and Q4. As it relates to legal reserves, we recorded $20 million in the quarter for estimated loss contingencies related to legal proceedings much of which relates to older cases and includes the previously disclosed government investigation that’s been going on for about four years now – nearly four years.
We have a new General Counsel and legal team, we’re taking a determined approach to resolving certain outstanding matters with the objective of putting these specific issues behind us wherever appropriate. But we still have work to do to bring final resolution of these matters, we believe this reserve is a reasonable estimate based on where we are today. And we’ll update you as we have more information.
Continuing down the income statement, our effective tax rate was 26.6% on a GAAP basis and 23.9% on a non-GAAP basis. Included in both our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate is the recognition of excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation. The GAAP tax rate is higher because of the possible non-deductibility of some of the legal reserves. For the remainder of 2019, we expect our underlying effective tax rate to be in the 26% to 29% range. So it may vary quarter-to-quarter based on discrete items. Our balance sheet remained strong with cash and investments totaling about $746 million. As of June 30, we’ve repurchased $58 million of our stock at an average price of $703 per share during the quarter.
Similar to last quarter, even though there are fewer shares outstanding and trading as a result of these purchases, our diluted weighted average share has actually increased by 182,000 shares from Q1 as a result of more options being in the money given higher share price.
In closing, we’re encouraged by our Q2 results and the progress we’re making against our strategic growth initiatives that relate out about a year ago. Sustaining our sales momentum is the most important lever to our powerful economic model and that requires great execution and delivering an excellent guest experience. We’re grateful to all of our team members for their hard work and their commitment and contributing to our vision of cultivating a better world.
And now we’re happy to take your questions. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now being the question-and-session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from David Tarantino from Baird. Please go ahead with your question. Hi, good afternoon and congratulations on a strong first half of the year. And Brian, you mentioned being in the early stages of a lot of the initiatives, and I guess the context of my question is related to the momentum you’ve seen in the first half of the year. And I guess that won’t be long before investors start worrying about your ability to cycle such big numbers as you move into next year and even the following year. So, I guess can you talk about how you think about the business recovering over the next year – to as you cycle these big numbers and how as you layer in what you have in the initiative pipeline, your degree of confidence and sustaining such positive comp momentum. Yes, sure. Thanks, David. So yes, my point on why we’re in the early stages of all these initiatives is very simple. We just launched a rewards program in March. We’ve got five million members in there. This is a place that we’re going to grow from. We’re not done adding members to the rewards program. As you think about the digital ecosystem, we first started with installing digital make lines and we layered in the digital pickup shelves. So it will be even easier for the customer and then we layered in the rewards program.
And if you think about the awareness of this total system for our customers, we’re still in the early days of those levels of awareness and utilization. So, I think there is opportunities to grow from where we are today on that front. And then as you think about really kind of revamping our marketing communication allocating those marketing dollars, you’re really just now starting to see the marketing team utilized new communication vehicles and continue to fine tune the communication as it relates to Chipotle’s real ingredients, real cooking, which results and we think really the best food out there.
And then the last piece is some of the innovation that we’ve been working on our stage-gate process, all those things are still in its early days and in most cases, the only thing we brought out really is the Lifestyle Bowls to date. And then I’d be remiss not to talk about all the great progress we’re making on operations. If you think about where we were six months ago, a year ago or even two years ago, we are far better than we were. And I’m confident that team is focused on the right things to be better, six months from now, 12 months from now, two years from now. So, still very much early days.
We’re delighted to see the response that we’re getting to the digital system. The response that we’re getting, I would say better operations with more consistent better tasting food that now is getting to be a bit faster. And then we’re very optimistic about how we can grow from here. We had this reward system and also the future as it relates to innovations, as it relates to the menu and or how the market. So delighted to see the response to date, but this is just the beginning. This is how I would categorize it. Sounds good. And on the rewards program, can you elaborate on what you learn to date in terms of your ability to change behavior with that program or incentive behavior with that program. I think I’m a member of the program. And I don’t even recall seeing any incentives throughout the quarter. So just wondering how you’re using that and what you’re learning so far. Well, we have you blocked, David. But… That’s [indiscernible]. No, I’m just kidding. Totally kidding. Yes. So, look we are early days in this and we obviously are breaking this up into various cohorts and we’re trying to experiment with each of those cohorts to understand if you, incentivize them with points on certain days of the week or certain add-ons, what type of behavioral changes do we see. And the good news is, we’ve done a couple. We’ve not done a whole lot and the thing to keep in mind is you know last quarter where were we, I think two million, three million people. This quarter, now we’re closing on five million. So we’re still refining the cohorts and then we’re also experimenting with each of these cohorts to understand how that impacts their behavior.
With that all said, the few programs that we run, we’ve been really pleased with our ability to influence behavior going forward. So as the population gets bigger in the rewards program and we get more fine-tuned on our cohorts, our goal is to then further drive behaviors that makes sense for the customer and then also makes sense for the Chipotle proposition. So early days, but we’re very pleased with where we are right now. Great, thank you very much. Our next question comes from David Palmer from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question. Thanks. Just a couple of quick questions on digital. It looks like your mix was up eight points from the prior year. How much do you think this mix increase is driving comps or how incremental you think it is? And over the next year, how do you think specifically I guess it relates to Tarantino’s question, but how much do you think this digital lift can continue? And just thinking about this digital mix was up 2.5 points from the previous quarter, so it looks like that digital lift is increasing or accelerating, but of course we have more difficult comparisons as you think about things like loyalty coming up. So, any thoughts on that? Thanks. Yes, sure. So look, we continued to understand all the – facets of how this digital business is coming to life. Right as it relates to order ahead, delivery and rewards. And then we also have about 16 restaurants now with Chipotlane where we’ve added another access point for people that order ahead. And what I’m delighted about is we see places where you’re seeing the digital business achieved 30% and north of 30% and it is driven by just giving people more access building more awareness and giving them great experiences.
So we definitely are not, we think, at the top of where this is. We think there is still, lots of room for growth in all aspects of the digital business, our catering business continues to still be a relatively small piece of the order ahead business and we think there’s tremendous opportunity on that front as well. So as we continue to build awareness, give people more access and get them to understand the occasions that they can use this access for, we’ve been pleased to see where this business can get too and we’ve got some evidence of getting north of 30%. And do you think that, are you thinking about how much of that eight point mix is really adding to the comps you’re seeing lately? You mean the 18%? Well the eight point increase or its 18% this quarter, but year-ago. Versus year ago, versus the 10%you’re talking about. Yes. How you think about it? Yes. So the good news is, as we’ve talked about it, the component of this is delivery, which is highly incremental that’s in the 70% range. I think is what we’ve shared and what we continue to see and it appears to be pretty consistent with other people see. Our order ahead business not as incremental as our delivery business, but we’re still continuing to see it be a very incremental piece on the business as well. So we’re not breaking out exactly the contribution relative to the comp, but what I can tell you is, it continues to be an incremental piece of the business and it comes with a nice flow-through as well. So we love incrementally profitable transactions and that’s what this digital business brings to the Chipotle business. Thank you. Our next question comes from Nicole Miller from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead with your question. Thank you. Good afternoon. Two quick questions. The first is on marketing. So the 3% spend is relatively static year-over-year but dollars are up. So, I imagine impressions, weeks et cetera. The dollar spend is up. The question is fairly simple in that, the dollars are up and comps are up. So, what’s the thought process behind increasing marketing spend above 3%? And depending on how you define your peer group, that could be another 100 basis point to fall in line with your peer group. Thanks. Sure. So, I think obviously, this quarter, the spend was up. A part – a big reason for that is Chris and his team, I think, are smart about allocating our marketing dollars. Two communication vehicles that are going to be highly effective and there was more options available in this quarter for us to get the Chipotle message in front of our customers at the right time. And fortunately, we had the right communication there. The thing I will tell you is we are always evaluating whether or not we have the right spend and what we see today is we feel really good about the absolute dollars that we’re spending and I think really what you’re seeing more than anything else is the allocation of those dollars resulting in the brand being more visible with the right communication at the right time, which then is driving ultimately a purchase at Chipotle.
So, no plans in the near-term to go beyond that 3%. The other thing to keep in mind too Nicole is, as this business grows, the marketing budget grows with it, because it’s 3% of now a much bigger business than it was six months a year ago and the marketing team is going to be really smart about how they allocate those additional dollars going forward, so that the brand continues to even being more visible and even more effective in its communication. So, really proud of the work that team has done. But I think we’re still getting started on this one as well and there’s a lot of creative things to come with the dollars that have been allocated to marketing today. That’s very helpful. I think what gets lost in the shuffle, can you – the comp is there is really just not much in a 3% of the spend and that would be one way if you ever wanted to look way out in the future to do it. So, that’s very helpful. The second question is around your comments on digital and some stores being 30% mix, it’d be pretty fascinating to understand anything you could share, this might not be the right metric, but the first thing that comes to mind is the AUV range. So, I’m trying to understand clearly with the comp being what it is and the flow through. I don’t think there is any question that it’s incremental. So, would you characterize the AUV of those digital, high use digital stores as passed the system average maybe there higher at above the system or maybe there even at like what a prior peak used to be for the system. What does that look like? Yes, what I can definitely share with you is they’re above our average for sure. And I don’t think we want to get into specifically talking about what the AUVs are, because some of that relates to the site-specific, but what I can definitely share with you is where the digital system is totally in place, meaning even adding a Chipotlane that’s beyond the average unit volumes. And then even in the places without Chipotlane is above and beyond our average unit volumes, where you see this digital business play such a big percentage of the business. So, we feel great about continuing to drive that digital business to a higher percent. Because it is incremental, which then results in these higher average unit volumes that we’re seeing across our system. Thank you for the time. And our next question comes from Sharon Zackfia from William Blair. Please go ahead with your question. Hi, good afternoon. I just have to say I did get an incentive through rewards. So, I’m pleased to be in a different cohort than David. So… You know what that means. That means that you are a light user. I think, currently, he is going to block me as we’re talking. So, on the delivery side of the equation. I guess just given the success you’ve had with DoorDash and it sounds like very little overlap between what DoorDash is doing and what you’re getting through your own app. I mean how do you think about opening that opportunity to other third-party delivery providers. Is that something you’re exploring? And then it seems as if the digital cadence didn’t slow at all after you lap the DoorDash agreement in May. And if you could just talk about, if that was in fact the case that maintained its momentum. Yes. So, to answer your first question. We’ve got a great relationship with DoorDash. We do today also provide delivery with Postmates and Tapingo. So, it’s not exclusive however DoorDash and Chipotle, I think have done a nice job of marketing the delivery channel. And we’ve got a great relationship in place with that team. And as you mentioned, we lapse our DoorDash partnership pretty successfully. And one of the things that I’m really excited about seeing is, it does continue to show up in the data that those that use our in app delivery experience are not the same people that are using the third-party app experience.
The other thing that I’m also really excited about is there are a lot of people on these third-party platforms that still have not gotten to try Chipotle delivery. Even though Chipotle is one of their top delivery partners, there is lots of runway with people that are using these aggregator sites to still have an opportunity to experience the Chipotle delivery experience. So, lots of runway, even in the partnerships we have in place. And then as I think about our digital business as it grows and we generate more awareness about the occasion, I’m very optimistic about how we grow from here going forward. Okay. Thank you. Yes. Our next question comes from Sara Senatore from Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question. Great. Thank you. I had a question about the product launches, and then a follow-up on the digital mix. Just on the – you were talking about Carne Asada being well received and looking to Quesadilla as – getting the ops right there. I mean, I think in – my question has to do with, is the goal to sort of prevent menu fatigue, is it to bring in new customers. Is it to drive incrementality in a – the given quarter that you launch it. Is there anything you can tell us about to the extent that you’re seeing successful test? How that’s translating into new or incremental traffic? And how do you think about that in the context of, I think people in general are creatures of habit and a lot of people probably order the same things over and over again anyway. So, any color on that? And then like I said, I have a follow-up on the digital mix. Sure. So, to answer your question on the menu innovation, we view it as – it should be able to drive incremental sales transactions. The reason why is because it does give people an experience that they don’t get out of their every day experience. So, it gives them a reason to either come more often or maybe come and try us for the first time. And as we do these tests, that’s what we’re really trying to understand. How much of this is, hey, this is just among our existing user that’s coming more often, because we’ve now added another occasion form. Or you know what we’ve now peak somebody’s interest that has never had the opportunity to try Chipotle in the past. And Carne Asada is a great example, where we’ve actually gotten the request of both non-users of Chipotle and users of Chipotle to say, how can you guys never do Carne Asada?
Now whether or not, it stays on the menu permanently. there’s a lot of things that go into that decision. And that’s why we keep these things into our test long enough, so that we can understand how is it perfect behave both new with marketing and then just on a sustained basis as part of the menu. And then things like the Quesadilla, it adds another level of validation, because it cannot have a negative impact on our throughput. But things like Quesadillas and Nachos; those are clearly things that both, again, users and non-users of Chipotle have said, well that would really make the brand, the restaurant experience even more attractive, so that I could come more often. So that’s why we’re experimenting with these things. And that’s why we use the stage-gate process. So, we can understand that balancing act between incrementality among existing users as well as bringing in new users. Great. Thank you. And then just on the – I know you said you’re not breaking out the contribution, the comp from the different types of digital ordering. But is it fair to assume that at least some of the growth came from mobile order and pay. The reason I ask is, because of one, the extent to which, when you see people actually coming into the store, maybe, that’s an opportunity to engage with them and versus delivery. And then two, of course, I think they are very different margin profiles, insofar as mobile order and pay I think is probably the highest margin and delivery is lower. So, if you could just maybe talk about that either even qualitatively, the mobile order and pay versus the delivery? Yes, sure. So, yes, obviously, it contributed to our comp growth, right. I mean the thing that’s wonderful about this digital business is its incremental transactions with higher ticket. So, we’re picking up more ticket and that is true, both in the order ahead business as well as the delivery business. Now, obviously, the order ahead business has even better economics, because we don’t have to deal with the aspect of the delivery cost. But both are proving to be incremental, both are contributing to the comp and we’re very bullish on how we can drive this going forward. Okay. Thank you. Yes. Our next question comes from John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question. Thanks very much. Brian, as you look at your digital mix across your fleet of stores, how – is it a normal distribution? Is it more skewed as you might think to more urban markets, more affluent markets? Or is it really across the breadth of your stores? And I guess the comment is on digital, but also in delivery specifically, how evenly distributed or not, is that business for you? Yes. You know what – it’s actually fairly evenly distributed. You don’t have certain spikes in some of those areas that you mentioned, it’s fairly evenly distributed, John. That’s helpful. Can you talk about also throughput, maybe update us on the metrics you’re looking at for throughput. You said there is – it’s improving, but there is still opportunity. And in particular, the digital make line is accounting for, and I’m rounding up nearly 20% of your sales, is that executing as you would expect? Or do you need to tweak that as the volumes are growing faster there? Maybe, one time expected and you need more capacity there? Or is it – is it still underutilized in this headroom? Yes. So, the – first, I’ll answer the question, just in general on throughput. The teams have made really great progress on throughput. We are halfway through the year. I think we mentioned in our prior call that we have – the teams are incentivized in their bonus based on throughput targets and then even to the point now where we will provide accrued bonus assuming they’re able to hit there both throughput targets, food safety targets and the other key operating metrics that we ask the team to hit. but I think the thing that’s really been powerful is Scott has got the operational organization just focused on a critical few items. It’s these tasks have a great team – have a great leader, which results in great culture. That’s number one. He has got them focused on.
Number two. Great food, taste the food, know how to make the food and do it right, every single time. Throughput, we now have the dashboard in place, we’re showing the teams what is the difference between having the five pillars in place versus not having the five pillars in place and we’re seeing nice results on that front. And then obviously, a culture of food safety has to be evident in everything that we do, since we’re handling real ingredients with real cooking techniques every single day. So, all of it is working together and I give Scott and a lot of our ATDs a lot of credit, because they are really getting after one best way of execution and then holding themselves accountable against that execution.
So, I think we’re going to continue to see better progress on operations going forward. And we look at this every day and you know this, the restaurant business, the retail business is an everyday business. And that’s the type of focus that we have. Every day, we want to be better than we were the day before. And that’s what we’re getting after on the throughput, team stability, great food and then obviously, all in a food safe environment. So, on your question regarding the digital make line, the good news is, we have plenty of capacity. Capacity is not our issue. If anything, we just have to learn how to execute better on that second make line. Some new metrics are important for us, right.
On the front line, we’ve never had to worry about accuracy. Because the reality is, I’m interacting with you and you get exactly what you want as you move down the line. Now, we’ve moved to a place, where you order, you pick it up and go, and then you open it up, and that’s the moment of truth of whether or not it’s accurate, everything is there, is it hot? And the good news is, the food is hot, because we make it really quick. The deliveries are really fast. And we’re learning our way to become even more accurate.
So, some things that we’re learning, so that we could be better with that off-premise experience. But all in all, plenty of capacity, customers really love having the additional access, both on-premise and off-premise. And then as I mentioned, I think the in-store operation is just really, really continuing to improve and much better than we were six months ago or even a year ago. Okay. Thank you. And our next question comes from Andy Barish from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question. Hey, guys, one quick sales question and then an expense question. Any commentary you’re willing to share just on sort of cadence given you were lapping. During the 2Q, given you were lapping the DoorDash launch and the launch of For Real advertising and then the start of the 3Q here. Yes, Andy from a dollar standpoint, our sales were even throughout the quarter and then they continued through – the trends continued through July. You did see a difference in the comp percentage as we moved from April to May and June, because we are comparing against the things that you mentioned. But from a dollar standpoint, we still see nice underlying strength and that continued into end of July as well. Okay. And then can you give us a quick update, Jack. I think you mentioned that the $2 million of food cost saves, was that just a continuation of what you – what you saw in the first quarter, is that $2 million incremental? And then just more broadly from an organizational perspective, obviously, given the numbers you’re putting up right now, cost saves efficiencies are kind of happening on their own, but are there some efforts that may bear some fruit as we look out to 2020 more on the peer cost save side of things. Yes. Andy, the $2 million is incremental on top of the run rate that we reported in the first quarter. And the team does continue to look at opportunities and there are a number of opportunities, Andy. So, I fully expect that we’ll be talking about greater savings, especially as we move to the end of this year and into 2020. Thank you. Our next question comes from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question. Hi, thank you. In the past, we’ve talked about the ability to take price to the extent that there was any cost pressure whether from commodities or labor or anything else. Is 2% pricing the right thing for this brand, especially, looking at some of the absolute pricing of Chipotle versus some peers, which have obviously gotten higher. How much pricing do you think you have at this point that you could take to the extent that you needed to, that wouldn’t have spend as current – excuse me, that wouldn’t influence your current rate of customer traffic? Yes. So, we’ve taken the approach on pricing that we don’t want to be overly aggressive with it. I loved about the value proposition that we present today. Because as you mentioned a lot of other people that are doing real ingredients, real cooking, their prices are significantly higher than Chipotle and it just puts us in a very nice position, where if we need to take pricing. We have the pricing power to do it, but we want to be very judicious and when we choose to do it. And the good news for us is we see no reason to go beyond the 2% right now. But we’ve also learned that we definitely have room to price beyond 2% if necessary. And if the environment mandates that, then we will do it accordingly. Okay, thank you. And that’s just a quick modeling question. Your G&A in the second quarter look to have taken a step-down. Is that the new run rate in G&A per operating week; however, you want to look at it or was there anything unusual in the second quarter regarding G&A expense? Yes. that’s close to a normal run rate. But keep in mind; we’ve had a lot of things happening in the last year in terms of closing restaurants, which means you accelerate depreciation for a while, same with your offices. So, I think we’re to more of a normal depreciation. but keep in mind as we open up new restaurants, especially, because we talked about opening up a heavy load in the fourth quarter, you’ll see that in the fourth quarter as those stores open. You’ll see some incremental additions to our depreciation and amortization at that time. Perfect, thank you. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question. Great. Thank you very much. Two questions just one specifically on the commodity front, I’m wondering whether you can offer any color in terms of what basket inflation you’re seeing today. I mean it sounds like you’re saying pork is not an issue in coming quarters. I’m just wondering if there’s any directional trends you could offer whether you think there is some upward pressure expect as we look to 2020. It seems like that’s what the industry is talking about. But I get the impression you perhaps don’t see it the same way. And then I had one follow-up? Yes, Jeff. Avocados is the inflation story that we’re seeing and it’s not really sustained inflation. It’s more of a cyclical thing; it’s a supply and demand out of balance right now. We expect that to become more normal. I don’t think we’ll necessarily get back to the prices that we paid in the first quarter this year, but it should drop from what we saw in Q2.
We’re seeing a little bit in dairy. We saw that is unique to us a little bit in Cilantro. But these are very, very minor and manageable items. We don’t see or we’re not anticipating anything significant with any of our proteins that could change between now and the end of the year. But right now, it looks like – it looks like other than avocados, the commodities are behaving. Got it. And then as we talk about kind of the outlook from an earnings perspective, I mean I understand the comp visibility you have based on the guidance you provided. but obviously, the earnings growth is critical. As you look to the back half of the year, any other changes you would expect, I mean, just not sure if you think the comps are maybe going to ease a little bit as you suggest on a tough compares, would you expect restaurant margin expansion to moderate, like how you’re thinking about the puts and takes in the back half of the year with what seems like some very strong comp momentum and how that might flow through the earnings? Yes. on a year-over-year basis, if you’re talking about a high single-digit comp versus a 10% comp. Yes, you’re going to see a different margin leverage than that. And yet, Jeff, you can walk through the modeling to see what that would look like. But remember we had pretty strong margin at the end of last year. I would say the biggest wild card in terms of our margin potential is avocados. If avocados normalize, avocados increased by about 150 basis points, which is from Q1 to Q2. So, imagine if that comes back to us or a half of that comes back to us. Our margin potential gets much greater as avocados normalize. We have a shop that next year avocados could be more plentiful, a number of avocados kind of go in this every other year. next year should be a more plentiful year and I will see if it actually materializes. But I would say that’s the biggest wild card.
In terms of our flow through, we’re really happy with the flow through that we’ve seen with the comp that we’ve gotten. If you do see a – or as you do see a lower comp, the flow through year-over-year is going to be somewhat less. But we think we’ll still see some nice flow through based on the contribution margin that we earn. Nice to hear, avocado is the bigger issue than labor. That’s a positive sign looking to 2020. Thank you. Our next question comes from Will Slabaugh from Stephens, Inc. Please go ahead with your question. Yes. I think I just had a follow-up on the throughput comment that Brian you said earlier in your prepared remarks. Did you put any context around that in terms of where you are today versus you were previously, I guess the bottom as well. And then what you see as an opportunity going forward? I couldn’t hear the first part of your question, I’m sorry. Yes. Sure, just to comment on throughput and you mentioned that in your current market, throughput, wondering if you could put some context around that in terms of where you are and what the opportunity is going forward. Sure. So, I think we’ve talked about this in the past, where today, we’re kind of in the mid-20s. In our peak throughput performance, we’re kind of in the mid to low-30s. And I think the thing that I’m excited about is the team is really focused on getting ourselves from that mid-20s to high-20s and then how this works. Once we get the high-20s, we’ll be looking at low-30s. So that’s what I mean by – we’ve got terrific focus and we’re seeing progress, and then you have these moments where people achieve something and then we’re able to share that with everybody else in the organization, so that the throughput machine really starts to get going and people realize what’s possible. So that’s where we are today. We’re definitely making progress on that mid-20 number and then once we move beyond kind of the mid-20s, high-20s, we’ll be zeroing in on the low-30s. Great. thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we will conclude today’s question-and-answer session. At this time, I’d like to turn the conference call back over to Brian Niccol for any closing remarks. Okay. Thanks, everybody. And apologies for the technical difficulties that got us rolling, but we’ve got it all sorted out and really appreciate you all taking the time to listen and ask questions. Obviously, very proud of our results, very proud of the team and very proud of what’s happening in our restaurants.
As I mentioned in our call, we’ve got some very specific strategies that we’re focused on around marketing, digital, operations and really using the stage-gate process on innovation. We’re in the early days on a lot of these initiatives. We’re delighted by the customer response we’ve seen to date and we’re delighted by the performance we’re seeing in our restaurants today. And I look forward to sharing where we are next quarter with you all, on this journey for Chipotle to really cultivate a better world. So, thank you everybody and I’m sure we’ll be in touch. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. We do thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",we are pleased with our second quarter financial performance . this marks the sixth consecutive quarter of accelerating comparable sales . apologies for the delayed opening .,1.0

These statements are based on management’s current business and market expectations and our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statement. Please see the risk factors contained in our 2018 annual report on Form 10-K and in our subsequent Form 10-Qs for a discussion of risks that may cause our actual results to vary from these forward-looking statement.
Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found via the link included on the Presentation page within the Investor Relations section of our website.
We will start today’s call with prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, our Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, our Chief Financial Officer. After which, we will take your questions. Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A session.
And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Brian. Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. We’re pleased with our third quarter financial performance, which reflects further progress on our key strategic initiatives that are providing guests with a great experience and positioning the business to deliver above industry growth for many years to come. In fact, this marks the seventh consecutive quarter of accelerating comparable sales, which highlights that running great restaurants with a purpose of cultivating a better world is a compelling proposition.
For the quarter, we reported 11% comparable restaurant sales growth that included nearly 7.5% transaction growth. Restaurant level margins of 20.8%, which is 210 basis points higher than last year. Earnings per share adjusted for unusual items of $3.82, representing 77% year-over-year growth and digital sales growth of 88% year-over-year representing 18.3% of sales.
I’m often asked what’s next. I believe we still have a lot of opportunity in executing our five key strategies, which are; number one, making the brand more visible and loved; number two, running successful restaurants with a strong culture that provides great food, hospitality and throughput; number three, leveraging our digital make line to grow sales and expand access; number four, engaging with our customers by launching a new loyalty program; and number five, creating a stage-gate process for innovations.
Let me give you an update on each of these starting with our stage-gate process, which is designed to test an item in a few markets on three key areas, delighting our customers, driving our financial benefit, and of course ensuring a seamless integration into our current operations. This test tends to be predictive of what happens nationally and helps increase the likelihood of success.
I’m pleased to announce that carne asada is the latest item behind Lifestyle Bowls and our Rewards program to be successfully validated through this process and all three are meeting or exceeding our expectations. Carne asada is a limited time offering that is easy to execute operationally and has a unique flavor profile. It’s a tender cut of steak seasoned with fresh squeezed line and finish with hand chopped cilantro and a blend of signature spices. No wonder it’s receiving terrific customer feedback.
As great as carne asada taste, it’s success is amplified by all elements of our strategy coming together in unison. Specifically, digital providing more frictionless access, marketing enhancing awareness and emphasizing the deliciousness of carne asada operations, delighting our guests with great hospitality and throughput and our supply chain, ensuring we have the highest quality ingredients that meet our food with integrity standards.
I’m so proud of the collective efforts of our teams rolling out this new premium steak. Beyond carne asada, we are also testing queso blanco, salads in quesadillas. These items are in various markets where we are gaining valuable feedback. As I’ve stated previously, we’re not going to roll out new menu items at the sacrifice of throughput nor will we add complexity to our restaurants by overemphasizing new menu choices. We will update you on our progress of all potential new menu items as they move through our stage-gate process.
Now let’s talk about our marketing efforts, which have and will continue to be an important enabler of our growth. In fact, you saw this with the carne asada launch as we leverage our digital capabilities as well as a national TV campaign by teaming up with film director David Gelb. These spots are a continuation of our Behind the Foil campaign that launched earlier this year and highlight real Chipotle team members and providing an inside look at the real fresh food and skill for preparation that happens in Chipotle kitchens every day.
These efforts are designed to increase transactions and grow sales by driving culture, driving a difference and ultimately driving a purchase. In addition, we effectively utilize social media and ran several strategic promotions during the quarter to make the Chipotle brand more visible, while helping expand access. Going back to the question of what’s next, we launched Chipotle Rewards in March and are just now beginning to leverage that platform.
We currently have 7 million enrolled members and have only scratched the surface on database marketing. We are encouraged by early signs of transaction increases across all frequency bands and going forward, we’ll double down on our ability to leverage this data to incent behaviors. We expect this lever to become a bigger driver over time as we gain more experience gathering customer insight, while continuing to expand our digital platform.
Reducing friction and providing more convenient access for our guests has been critical to increasing our digital system penetration over the past couple of years. This quarter, digital sales grew 88% year-over-year to $257 million and represented 18.3% of sales during the seasonally slower summer quarter for digital. And we’re knocking on the door of digital becoming $1 billion business. Consistent with past quarters delivery remained a key driver of our digital growth given enhanced capabilities on our app and website as well as our expanded availability from more than 97% of our restaurants.
Importantly, digital remains highly incremental and we continue to see residual lift in delivery sales that lasts beyond any promotion. Additionally, I’m pleased to announce that we have finished installing our digital make lines in all relevant restaurants and this was completed slightly ahead of schedule and makes the system more efficient for our guests, team members and delivery partners, while driving more sales and loyalty for Chipotle. Now that we have the digital make lines installed, we are focused on ensuring that execution for this large and growing business matched that of the traditional front line.
This brings me to the evergreen topic of operational excellence. The reality is that all the growth initiatives I just mentioned are being supported by the terrific job our operations team is doing in providing a great guest experience. And we know cultivating a better world includes investing in our people. And we believe that’s the right approach in creating an environment where our employees can thrive professionally as well as personally and be in a position to win not only today but also in the future.
Enhanced training and development, industry-leading employee benefits, including the recent Debt-Free Degrees program in addition to our newly expanded tuition reimbursement program and a new crew bonus that was paid out to more than 2,600 employees last quarter are just a few examples of how we continue to invest in our people to cultivate a better restaurant culture.
The result is our employees putting their best foot forward and remaining focused on our core fundamentals. This is leading to us attracting and retaining the right talent and having higher teams stability, which is allowing them to spend more time together and deliver on two important benefits. One, delicious food consistently being prepared and served every time, something our guests have definitely noticed. And number two, we’re seeing a steady improvement in throughput aided by training, focus and providing our teams with an easy to use dashboard that provides greater visibility on performance.
I want to recognize our team for their efforts and hard work in delivering another outstanding quarter. I believe we are still in the early stages of our journey and we need to stay focused on our priorities and executing flawlessly to support our growth, while providing our customers with the experience they expect from Chipotle. Thank you to all our employees for all that you do. We have a unique brand and I love the passion and determination that I see during my restaurant visits as our crew members constantly strive to be better today than they were yesterday.
With that, here’s Jack to walk you through the financials. Thanks, Brian and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered outstanding financial results in the third quarter as comps and margins continued to expand further highlighting the strength of our economic model. Connecting with guests through culturally relevant marketing focused on Chipotle’s great taste and real ingredients, while providing more convenient access is helping lead to greater overall demand.
Sales were $1.4 billion in the quarter, an increase of 14.6% from last year. Comp sales grew 11% in the quarter, which includes a 10 basis point reduction as a result of deferred revenue from our Rewards program. This deferral is lower than previous quarters due to a combination of an increase in free entrée redemptions as guests earned enough points and an adjustment and breakage rate assumption for chips and guacamole now that we have more history.
Moving forward, we expect quarterly deferral to range between 20 basis points and 40 basis points based on various factors including the pace of signups and promotional activity. Restaurant level margins of 20.8% expanded 210 basis points over last year and earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $3.82, a 77% year-over-year growth. The third quarter had unusual expenses related to our transformation as well as legal reserves that negatively impacted our earnings per share by about $0.35, leading to GAAP earnings per share of $3.47.
Our comp of 11% was driven by an acceleration in transactions as nearly 7.5% of the comp came from greater guests visit. The higher average check includes a price impact of about 2% and a mixed contribution of roughly 1.5% driven predominantly by digital orders, which have a higher average check. Looking to the fourth quarter, factoring in strong sales we have seen thus far in October as well as the tougher comparison from last year, we expect Q4 comps to be in a high single digit range. This will result in our 2019 full year comp guidance being at the top end of our high single digit range.
We opened 25 new restaurants in the quarter bringing our total openings for the year to 60. And based on the early success of Chipotlanes, we shifted our real estate strategy to seek more sites that can accommodate a Chipotlane. As a result of the more than 80 restaurants currently at construction, about half of them will have a Chipotlane, which will result in a total of about 60 Chipotlanes by the end of 2019.
Given the longer construction timeline associated with Chipotlane, some of these new openings are likely to shift from Q4 into early 2020, so expect our total openings for 2019 to fall at or slightly below the low end of our 2019 range of 142 to 155 openings. For 2020 we anticipate opening between 150 and 165 new restaurants with more than half including a Chipotlane. And we expect these openings will be better balance throughout the year with around 60 openings in the first half of the year versus only 35 openings through June of this year.
Food cost for the quarter were 33.2%, a decrease of 20 basis points from last year due primarily to a menu price increase that was partially offset by higher cost of several ingredients. On a sequential basis, avocado pricing moderated as we expected. This was the result of sourcing more supply from Peru, which reduced our reliance on Mexico. For Q4 we expect ongoing moderation in avocado pricing as a result of increasing supply in the back half of the quarter, but we believe this will be largely offset by the higher cost of carne asada resulting in cost of sales remaining in the low to mid 33% range.
Labor costs for the quarter were 26.6%, a decrease of 60 basis points from last year. This decrease was driven primarily by sales leverage, partially offset by labor inflation, which continues to be in the 4% to 5% range. It also includes 20 basis point additional investment related to our restaurant level performance incentives including the crew bonus, Brian mentioned earlier. We expect Q4 labor costs to be in the high 26% range given extra initial labor expenses associated with a significant number of new restaurants being opened in this quarter as well as lower seasonal sales in the fourth quarter.
Other operating costs for the quarter were 12.8% a decrease of 90 basis points from Q3 of last year due to lower marketing and promo cost as well as sales leverage. Marketing and promo cost were 2% in the quarter, a decrease of about 50 basis points compared to Q3 of last year as we decided to shift some of our marketing investment to Q4 to support carne asada and other promotions. As a result, we expect our marketing investment to be at or slightly above 4% in Q4, which will result in the full year investment remaining right around 3% of sales.
G&A for the quarter was approximately $115 million on a GAAP basis or $105 million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding about $7.5 million for settlements of several legal matters and $2.5 million related to transformation expenses. It also includes $72 million in underlying G&A expenses, $25 million related to non-cash stock compensation, $5 million related to higher bonus accruals from our strong performance and payroll taxes on stock option exercises and $3 million related to other expenses including our All Manager Conference, which will be held in March of next year. Underlying G&A with a little lower than expected as we continue to finish rounding out our organizational structure.
We’re expecting to fill open positions in Q4 and therefore, we believe our underlying G&A support will get to around $74 million to $75 million in Q4. Also, if we assume our current financial trends continue stock compensation, including performance adjustments, along with the higher bonus expenses should be right around $25 million.
Lastly, we’re expecting to recognize between $2 million and $3 million for expenses in Q4, related to our upcoming All Manager Conference. And we expect the total expense to be right around $16 million, most of which will hit in Q1 of next year.
Our effective tax rate for Q3 was 17.9% on a GAAP basis and 18.3% on a non-GAAP basis. Both these rates are lower or below our full year guidance range due to the recognition of excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation during the quarter. For Q4, we expect underlying effective tax rate to be in the 26% to 29% range, though it may vary based on discrete items as well as any stock option exercises.
Our balance sheet remains strong with cash and investments totaling $844 million, as of September 30. We repurchased $39 million of our stock at an average share price of $783 during the quarter.
In closing, we’re pleased with our Q3 results as our strategic growth initiatives continue to sustain strong sales momentum, which is a key driver of our economic model. We remain bullish about the future and we believe we still have plenty of runway ahead.
I just want to thank all of our restaurant team members for their contribution and their passion as they remain Chipotle’s most valuable asset as we worked together to cultivate a better world.
With that, we’re happy to take your questions. Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Katherine Fogertey with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Great, thank you. I’m just trying to get a handle around the new unit guidance. So you guys expect additions to new units to go now at the lower end of the 140 to 155. And some of those are getting pushed into next year. Does the new unit guidance then implicitly state that you guys are slowing down the pace of new restaurant adds? I’m just trying to get a handle on what are the puts and takes between unit growth here when coupled with the very strong comp momentum in the quarter? Thank you. Yes. Thanks, Kathy. So no, the plan is actually, I think the guidance that we shared is we’re going to be accelerating new units as we move into 2020. And I think, what we just wanted to share with people is, a greater blend of that will now include Chipotlane, which we’ve accelerated the composition of Chipotlanes in our new unit kind of growth trajectory going forward. So the good news is with 11% comp and 7.5% transactions and really strong margins, we’re now going to be able to push on how we continue to expand our new units going forward.
So this is really just one of these temporary things, whereas we take advantage of an opportunity with the Chipotlane, which really I think it is a terrific outcome because it will drive our digital results as well as drive the total business, which hopefully as we’ve seen to date will result in even better returns going forward as we build out the new units. So no plan to slowdown, if anything, our guidance was intended to inform people we’re going to be increasing. And we also wanted to be share with folks that we’re going to have a greater mix now Chipotlanes. Can you help us also just to remind us on the AUVs for restaurants with Chipotlanes versus those without? How we should think about how that blend might progress? Yes. I don’t think we’re disclosing exactly what the AUVs are on this. But here’s what it is, I think we can give you some interesting facts on it, which is our digital business is roughly 50% bigger and the driver of that additional growth is our order ahead business, which as you know, it has got the best margin associated with our business going forward. So we loved the composition of the sales and we love the economics associated with new units, whether they have Chipotlanes or not. But we’re very positive on which Chipotlane brings to our new unit program and why we’re raising guidance for next year. Great. Thank you. The next question will be from David Tarantino with Baird. Please go ahead. Hi, good afternoon and congrats on another great quarter. Jack, I was wondering if you could maybe clarify what you meant around the Q4 guidance. I think you mentioned that October so far has been strong and you’re expecting maybe that to ease, as it is cycle tougher comparisons coming up. So could you maybe just elaborate on what you’re seeing in October so we have the right context for the rest of the quarter? And then Brian, you mentioned that you’re seeing some progress on throughput in the restaurants, I was just wondering if you could contextualize what that progress has been so far and how you see that playing out in 2020? Thanks. Yes, David on comp. We saw comps accelerate in September, when we initially rolled out carne asada, which is around September 12 or so. And then we started media around September 22. So we saw sales accelerate at the end of the quarter and then we saw those higher sales levels continue into October. The guidance that we’re giving for the fourth quarter though it takes into account the strong comps as we start the quarter, but also that our strongest comp month last year was December, so going up against the tougher comparison in December. That’s when we had the delivery bowls and those were very, very successful.
The other thing, I want to mention is, we only have enough supply for carne asada to last us for part of the quarter. We think we’ll probably run out around the end of November, maybe into early December. And so we’re being a little cautious with what happens once we run out of carne asada. But the momentum to start the quarter is great, but we got a tougher challenge as we move through the quarter. And then, yes, to your second question, David, on throughput. The thing that I think is really exciting to see is as each quarter has gone by with the focus on this. We continue to see every region making progress on their throughput goals. So we’re not all the way to where we have targeted, but we are making great progress and our throughput is better than it was last quarter and it’s definitely better than it was two quarters ago. So the operational team is very focused. Scott has the guys dialed in on this and our throughput is continuing to improve quarter-to-quarter, month-to-month. So I’m very optimistic about what that’s going to do for the business going forward. All right. Thank you. The next question will come from Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Please go ahead. A question about margins if I could, which is just about the fact that it’s been a little bit volatile this year, but in the end, very good margin expansion and maybe for the full year, EBIT margin on a recurring basis, maybe as much as high 100 to 200 basis points something in that range. But I guess that implies a very high flow through margin, even on a 10% comp. So could you just deconstruct that a little bit? Especially, because you have a traffic-driven comp, there’s not a lot of price in there. Is that digital mix? Are there cost savings that are coming through? And is it still the case that when we think about potential return to peak volumes, we should think about restaurant level margins that are maybe below what they would have been at previous peaks? Or are you finding opportunities again between throughput order ahead is sort of structurally offset, whatever the headwinds may have been? Yes, Sara. The way I would think about margins is I think most of the leverage, it’s from flow through. So we do get a higher, a very attractive flow through, when we have higher sales, especially when they’re transaction-driven like this. We have some headwinds in there. That we have to overcome, like we do have labor inflation that 4% to 5%, that’s about a 100 basis point headwind, avocados to get better in the quarter. So we had bigger headwinds from avocados in Q2 than Q3. And then moving into Q4, we’ve got a little bit of a challenge. The carne asada’s more expensive, a cut of meat. It’s a higher quality premium cut of steak. So that puts a little bit of pressure on our food costs.
But I would say that from overall margin standpoint, we’re pretty much right on track. We talked about at $2.1 million volume, we should generate a margin of about 21% and we’re right about there. In terms of as you move from $2.1 million to $2.2 million to $2.3 million up to if we get back to our peak volumes of $2.5 million, we’re still confident that we’ll be right in that same kind of margin range of like a 25%. So we think the flow through so far is pretty much right on track. Thank you. The next question comes from Nicole Miller of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Thank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to understand what might be the tipping point on the acquisition of customer data. I believe, you said 7 million loyalty members. So right now the comps are producing, I would imagine it’s not doing much yet with that data. So maybe you could talk about what you’re doing with the data, but the power of what it can be – what it can do, now that you have a 7 million base and is that enough of a base to produce results? Yes. Thanks, Nicole. The – obviously, we’re delight we’ve got 7 million users now in rewards program. We anticipate that’s going to continue to grow. And as I mentioned in the past, we are already starting some experimentation with the various cohorts. And the good news is, when we have done some of these experiments, we’ve seen meaningful changes in peoples’ frequency and their engagement levels with the brand.
So I think this is something that ongoing, as we roll into 2020, it starts – it’s going to start being a contributor to our sales growth. Because we’ll have a meaningful database with meaningful numbers of users and I think we’re learning really quickly and figuring out what really does result in behavior changes that rewards people and at the same time rewards the business with incremental transactions and incremental sales. So I’m very optimistic about what this can do for us. The database marketing is showing signs of being a really meaningful growth lever going forward. Thank you. And just a follow-up and last question, Chipotle is clearly getting stronger every day. So when you think about the development acceleration for next year, is there anything in there for international growth and if not, when and how do you leverage that international opportunity? Yes. So the reality is exactly what you said, which is the health of the business and the operational performance gives us confidence to accelerate new units next year. And then you compound that with adding to the mix, new growth lever called Chipotlanes, which is a driver of digital sales and highly profitable sales. We’re really excited about what our growth opportunity is from new unit standpoint in United States, so very excited about that. At the same time, we’re continuing to work on our business in Canada, which they have made tremendous progress to date. And if they continue to deliver the financial performance that they’re delivering, which is now getting close to what we’re seeing in the U.S., obviously, that’ll be a place down the road that we will look to accelerate new units as well.
We’re still probably in the earlier innings in Europe. Because we’re still learning there on what we can do with our Chipotle business. But again, the team there is making great progress as well. But still some work to be done there on both the model and how we continue to introduce Chipotle in the new markets. But I just want to emphasize, there is so much opportunity in the U.S., with the performance that we’re getting out of our business. As well as frankly, the types of restaurants we can build going forward, the combination of end-caps, and now end-caps with Chipotlanes as well as the inline unit and then the freestanding restaurants that we’ve done to date. So we’re very optimistic about where we can go with our unit growth in United States. And then obviously, down the road, we’ll figure out how we pivot outside the U.S. Thank you. The next question will be from David Palmer of Evercore. Please go ahead. Thanks. Good evening. Question on labor, I think your labor hours per unit went up more like high-single digits this quarter versus mid-single digits in the first half of the year. I know you can tell me if I’m right on that, but if it did ramp up, why? And more broadly, even beyond this quarter, how do you view that leverage point going forward? Is that second make line, for example, fully staffed and ready to go? And should we see similar levels of labor leverage? Or is there more to be had or even less because you’re not up to where you need to be? Thanks. Yes, David. I would say, the labor leverage hit exactly where it should be. I’m not sure, how you’re doing your calculation. We had additional transactions of 7.5%. We grow our labor hours at a lesser percent than sales, quite a bit lesser percent. So when you say high-single-digit, that’s not what we actually added. We would have added something quite a bit less than 7.5% in terms of the hours. And if you breakdown the labor leverage, we had labor leverage of about 60 basis points in the quarter and that’s despite the fact that we had about 100 basis points of inflation challenge that we had to deal with. So we really labor – leveraged the labor line by about 160 basis points and that’s really right on the target.
Now going forward with digital, we do think there’s an opportunity with digital for us to get even more efficient. We’re in the early innings there. Chipotlane, we’ve only got 20 Chipotlane restaurants right now, but we’re going to have 60 by the end of the year. And we’ll learn more about how we staff the Chipotlanes and how we can really get as much as efficiency that we know is possible, out of moving more of the sales towards that second make line. So, so far we’re really pleased with where labor is, but we do think that there’s additional efficiencies as the second make line grows. I guess my second point was really about, in that second make line, are those staffed and are you effectively at a low capacity utilization on that second make line currently and therefore that incremental margin is going to be outstanding, perhaps even better than the first line? Or is that something that you’re not, where you need to be in terms of staffing when that mix gets up to where some of your better digital make line stores are staffed? Thanks. Yes. David, I got your question. It’s a good question. In our very busiest digital restaurant, those things are fully staffed and I think there’s additional leverage to be had. There are areas of the country and there are individual stores where the digital business is not at that same 18%. We do have challenges in making sure we’ve got the right staffing throughout the day and every single day.
So there are opportunities for us to staff those restaurants, so that the business will build, but I will tell you in terms of the levers that you’re getting at with the restaurants that are already at 18%, 20%, 25% digital, those restaurants are staffed. And as we add more sales to the second make line, you’re going to see greater sales leverage in those stores. Great. Thank you. The next question will be from John Glass of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Hi, thanks very much. Just on digital sales, I understand there’s some seasonality, but I was still surprised to see sequentially about the same percentage of sales as digital. So maybe what gives you confidence that you aren’t hitting some sort of ceiling in that, the consumer doesn’t want to transact more than they are in digital channels. And can you talk specifically about how delivery has performed in this quarter relative to prior quarters? Yes, sure. So what we’ve seen is the seasonality was more around the delivery aspect of the business, in our digital business because we continue to see growth in our order ahead business. And so, what we’ve also seen is we’ve come out of kind of the summer months where the seasonality was is, that strength in continued on with the order ahead business and then consistent with what we’ve seen in the past, the seasonality played out in the delivery side of the business.
So we’re definitely confident that we are far from the ceiling. And then we’ve got other indications where when we’ve added additional access like the Chipotlane, you get well beyond 20%. So that’s what gives us confidence that we’re far from the ceiling on this. Okay, that’s helpful. And then just on carne asada, is this – was this intended to be an LTO or what – why are you running out of product and is it just temporary or is it, you’re just going to pause this in-and-out? I thought it was more like, you were going to try attempting to build sort of permanent new sales items, not LTOs? Yes. This was intended to be a seasonal offering where we would bring it in-and-out. There are other items like queso blanco, we’re assuming it the success for the stage-gate-process, that’ll be more permanent. But yes, this one initially was intended to be more of a product represent some news and we may use it again depending on how the whole experience plays out.
The early feedback we’ve seen from our customers and our crew members is, they definitely would like us to do this again. So, we’ll figure out exactly the right pacing and sequencing and whether or not it’s something we want to have permanently in the business or if we continue to use it more as like a seasonal item. Got it. Okay. Thank you. Yes. The next question comes from Jake Bartlett of SunTrust. Please go ahead. Great. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to ask a follow-up on the carne asada, my kind of chats or just even my experience in the stores was that the carne asada was selling significantly more than the regular steak. And so I assumed that, that was driving a decent amount of checks. So within that the context of that, of those statements, could you talk about how October has been impacted by the carne asada? And maybe what we could expect to kind of fall-off with the carne asada’s removal. Okay. Yes, sure. So, we have gotten great response to the carne asada initiative. We’re really excited to see that the stage-gate-process was predictive of what we’ve seen nationally. So we’re really delighted about that. We’re seeing it drive both check-in transactions, which is also another thing we’re very excited about. And what we’re seeing is, it’s sourcing new users as well as having people that have been users of the Chipotle business to try a new occasion. So we’re seeing frequency compression and we’re seeing new users coming in.
What we’ll obviously want to continue to understand, which we’ve got some understanding on is, what happens to all those new users that came in now that they’ve experienced the Chipotle business and historically, Chipotle has been very sticky beyond just one product, it’s the whole value proposition that get people excited about Chipotle. The idea of Food With Integrity, the idea of customization, the idea of speed, and then obviously putting that all together at a really reasonable price, it’s something that’s very sticky for the Chipotle business. So we think this is much bigger than just the product. It’s more about introducing people to the Chipotle experience ongoing. Got it. And I don’t know if Jack would you want to just share what it’s kind of done to how much it’s been helping the October sales in mix. But also just building on that question, if it’s sounds like its successful in driving check and driving traffic and kind of hitting everything you want it to, why not keep it around or do it more permanently? Is it a matter of the throughput or is it a matter of the supply being a little more difficult? What would be the reason why not to keep on offering it? Yes, so look, the main driver is, we were not willing to compromise on our Food With Integrity principles on the supply over this program. And so going into it, we knew the supply available would take us through November to early December.
And, something we’re going to work on going forward, given the response we’ve seen is, okay, how do we work on the supply of steak in that particular cut to be consistent with our Food With Integrity principles to give us the flexibility to do it beyond just the seasonal program. But I don’t think we can answer your specific question that you’re looking for on exactly how is it playing out in the product mix and the comp. Obviously it’s playing a positive role. Got it. That’s where I would leave it. Okay. I appreciate it. Sure. The next question is from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Please go ahead. Hi, good afternoon. I am wanted to follow up on the Chipotlanes and as well on the carne asada. So on Chipotlanes, could you – Jack give us any idea on kind of what the incremental cost is when you add the Chipotlanes to locations and maybe what the unit economics are that we should think about for 2020 associated with those new openings?
And then on carne asada, any quantification around what it did to COGS either in the September quarter or what we should expect in the fourth quarter? Yes, Sharon on the investment, the investments about an extra $75,000 to add Chipotlanes, that would be for like an end-cap building. It’s the same $75,000 on a free standard, but a free standard just cost more than an end-cap. So our emphasis so far has been on getting the vast majority of our sites should be on the end-cap. We’re trying to get as many end-caps with Chipotlanes as possible, that’s why we’ve been able to pretty quickly pivot so that we can have more than half of our portfolio. Now we’ll have the Chipotlanes. So it’s a relatively modest investment.
Too early to say on the sales what the difference is between Chipotlanes and non- Chipotlanes, Sharon, we’ve got 20 of these that spread throughout the country. I’ll tell you they’re opening up nicely. We’re very pleased with the results. I just wouldn’t want to put a number on whether it’s performing at or above from a sales standpoint, but the fact that it’s 50% above on digital it’s a very strong starting point.
We know that when you can operate Chipotlanes with less friction, meaning it’s easier to order, it’s easy to stop-in and pick up Chipotlane without even getting out of your car. That tends to cause our customer to want to get your Chipotlanes even more often. So our optimism, even though it’s very early is very strong and the economics with even a modest increase in sales at that kind of an incremental investment is going to be very attractive. And then on carne asada, if you could help quantify the impact on your COGS for the third and fourth quarters. Yes, it’s going to be about it – it’s very small in the third quarter, Sharon, because it was only in for a few weeks, but it’s going to be in the ballpark of 50 basis points. And so – that’s what we mentioned in our guidance that our food costs in Q4 is going to stay about the same, maybe a tick or two higher. Even though avocados are going to cause less in the fourth quarter, that’s going to be offset by carne asada and we’re guessing right now, again, we’re trying to predict what the rest of the quarter is going to look like when we’ll run out. But it looks like it’s probably going to be right around 50 basis point impact in the quarter. That’s helpful. Thank you. The next question will be from Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays. Please go ahead. Great. Thank you very much. Two questions, just one following up on the, I guess menu relation. Brian, it sounds like the carne asada success, I’m wondering how you literally would define success in terms of maybe what mix you’ve achieved thus far or what you think is the target level and maybe any color on the case of DSL. In case, you talked about what potential hurdles there would be to overcome in the stage-gate-process before we might see any or all of those? And then I have one follow-up. Yes, look on a carne asada, I mean what we did in this stage-gate-process was, we wanted to make sure we had a product that consumers wanted. We wanted to make sure we had a product that our operators could execute. And then obviously we wanted to make sure it made sense financially.
And the way we derive that financial benefit is through check and transactions. The good news is carne asada has done terrific on the traffic driving as well as the check driving. And then our operators, to their credit have done job in executing and the feedback we’re getting from consumers, both new users and existing consumers, is they love the product. So by all accounts, we’re delighted with what carne asada is doing for the business.
And as you fast forward to other initiatives, our intention is we want to derive all those types of benefits when we’re launching a product. So, queso blanco, same expectations, needs to be something our crews can execute with excellence, consistent with our Food With Integrity principles. It’s got to be something the consumer is going to say they love it and they want to try it again. And then obviously it’s got to play a role in the financial model so that it’s continuing to move Chipotle forward.
And that’s the reason why we test these things. And, some will play a bigger role in traffic driving than others and that’s why you got to have a pipeline of different products to play a different role in the business. So I’m really excited about what the pipeline looks like and very delighted really about carne asada going through this whole process and then everybody executing with excellence. That’s how we end up with a successful initiative. Got it. And can you just for color, maybe Jack on the marketing stand, I think you said 4% in the fourth quarter, which would lead the full year at 3%. I’m just wondering how you measure the return on that and whether we should think about 2020 being more in the 4% range or whether there’s a reason why you prefer to keep it up that lower 3% level? No, I mean Jeff we have no plans to do that, that could change as the year unfolds. But right now we think 3% about the right level, right now we think we’re getting a great return. You know the marketing team, every single campaign they look at what’s happening in terms of transaction, what the return is and so far we’ve been getting a great return on our dollar. So right now we think 3% is the right level. If we – should change in the future, we’ll communicate that. Thank you. The next question will be from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Great. Thank you. I was hoping to get an update on some of the supply chain initiatives that we’ve been talking about in 2019. If there’s an update in terms of how much money was saved in the third quarter, if there’s an outlook for the fourth quarter and what the visibility is for some of the supply chain work on fiscal 2020 to start contribute more meaningfully the margins overall. Yes. John, we’ve saved another few million dollars during the quarter, but it was offset by other things including, some of the carne asada pressure that we saw in the last three weeks of the month. But listen, the team’s been doing a lot of great work and we think that we’ll see more savings in 2020.
Too early to predict what those are going to be. I mean, a lot of these things will take time because you’re talking about long-term relationship with suppliers, but I expect we’ll be able to talk next year about even more savings from the efforts of the supply chain team. Thank you. The next question is from Andy Barish with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Yes. Wondering on kind of looking out, obviously, the second half margin progress, which we thought wasn't quite going to be a strong as the first half may act otherwise, but I wonder if you look out to 2020 and kind of give us a sense of the puts and takes, I assume, pricing is going to remain around 2%. Any early thoughts on kind of the protein basket just as we try to gauge some of the margin levers for next year as we sit here today? Yes, Andy, we're not seeing anything out of the ordinary right now. It's too early to get a precise prediction, but it looks like beef generally to the extent that we can get the supply of food with integrity cuts that Brian mentioned, it looks like that should be pretty stable. We don't see anything out of the new ordinary in chicken. We see what's happening with pork supplies throughout the world. Our supplies are separate from that and so we haven't seen any impact there.
So right now we're kind of crossing our fingers and hope that everything continues to look stable. We're also hoping for a benign or maybe even a positive benefit from avocados next year is going to be the alternate year where we should see a more plentiful harvest. And so right now, knock on wood, cross fingers, all that kind of stuff. It looks like a pretty stable cost of goods sales environment for next year. And do you anticipate menu price kind of staying in this 2%-ish area? You know, we're studying that right now. Andy, if we did anything, it definitely would be in that kind of 2% range, but no decisions have been made. Thank you. The next question is from Andrew Charles with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Great, thanks guys. On Chipotlanes, what percent of the existing 2,500 non-Chipotlane locations have the capacity or the ability to add a Chipotlane versus the amount that are structural enable and just also just curious about your appetite to retrofit these locations as you go through 2020 and beyond? Yes, sure. So there on our current estate there really aren't that many options out there for us to retrofit into the Chipotlane only because we don't have that many end caps historically. Chipotle really was in line unit execution. So we're just limited with the real estate that we have and then you've got to have the end cap in the right location in order to do a retrofit. With that said, where the opportunity exist, we've done one, and not surprising, we saw positive result given for what Jack said earlier, when you get people more access with less friction, the order ahead business continues to take steps forward. So limited opportunity in retrofit but lots of opportunity going forward as we build new restaurants. That's helpful. And I know you're reluctant to give numbers in details on Chipotlane, but when you talk about year-to-cash on cash returns for new store of around 40%. Is it right to think that Chipotlane is higher than that just given this is a winning prototype for future development? I mean, it's early but, yes, we would expect to Chipotlanes are going to be a higher return than the average portfolio. Thanks, guys. Next question will be from Gregory Frankfurt with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Maybe just going back on to Andrew's question, in terms of the operating model for Chipotlanes going forward, I guess, right now, you can only order ahead as you pull up to a Chipotlane. what's the likelihood that you shift this model to more of a traditional drive through operating structure at some point down the line? I guess what's going to I guess prevent you from making that shift at some point? Thanks. Well, nothing would prevent us from making the shift. We just don't believe it's the right shift. So what we've seen is giving people the access through ordering ahead, so that they don't have to get other car is a nice unlock for the Chipotle business so that we don't have to provide the additional complexity of running a traditional drive through.
Frankly, I think this is the future of how people will want to interact with restaurant companies because this is arguably faster than any other way possible to get your food. You order ahead and you don't have to get out of your car and our model is already fast now. Now, we've made it fast assuming that we get out of your car, come into the restaurant, grab your food and go. So we don't see any reason to make that pivot going forward. Got it. Can you maybe talk about the experience so far in terms of balancing consumers kind of timing when they show up at the restaurant with kind of when the food is ready, and if they show up early, and how you manage through that and kind of how you would expect to manage that as you go forward? Thank you very much. Sure. So you have – with our smart pickup times, you do select a time for when your food is going to be ready and then you show up with it. If you show up early, we usually have people just pull forward and tell them they can come into the restaurant at their time or there are times where we will bring the food out to them where they pull forward. The good news is what we've seen is after the restaurant opens and two or three weeks in, people get into a pretty good rhythm where they shop on time and once they realize this is how the Chipotlane works and we've gotten really great consumer acceptance and the right type of behavior going forward. So that's not been a problem to-date and it's really just a matter of people adopting the new approach to how you get your food in your car. Helpful perspective. Thank you. Yes. The next question comes from Peter Saleh with BTIG. Please go ahead. Great, thanks. With 7 million loyalty members now, can you talk a little bit about the composition of the customer. Are they new users or they lapsed customers and just maybe a little bit more detail. Are these loyalty customers, are they spending more, are they coming in more frequently? Any details around that would be helpful. Thanks. Yes, of course. So this is a question I love to answer because the thing that's been great about the program to-date is it's definitely got bigger representation of new and light/medium users, and what we're seeing is when we do communicate with them with certain incentives, we see behavioral changes that are very positive and so we're seeing all the things you would want to see in a rewards program from a standpoint of the composition of those that are in the rewards program and then the behaviors associated with those that are within the program. So a lot of new light and medium users, and then we're seeing really nice behavior associated with all those various cohorts. Great. Thank you very much. The next question will be from Chris O'Cull with Stifel. Please go ahead. Yes. Thanks. Brian, given the supply of Carne Asada, it is going to run out late November, what are the plans to continue driving usage from guests that came in for the product. I mean, I'm just wondering if we should expect a new product news before the end of the year? And then I had a follow-up. Yes. Our plan is those that come in with Carne Asada, they get a great Chipotle experience that is going to result in them wanting to come back even with Carne Asada is not on the menu. And we're obviously focused on continuing to drive that message throughout the whole quarter. So we probably have already seen it on television; we are running ads that both talk about Chipotle as the brand and the total restaurant company as well as driving Carne Asada.
So – and what we've seen is the response has been positive to both messages. So people are very much in tune with the idea of food with integrity, real culinary, real ingredients, cooking done right in front of them, as well as some new product menu news around Carne Asada. And the good news is Chris and the marketing team, they've got a strong plan to finish the year that goes well beyond just products. Okay, that's fair. And then, Brian, would you talk about how the company to determine the appropriate number of unit openings for 2020 and what you would need to see to accelerate the number of openings? Yes, look, the good news is, there are plenty of sites and the economics would support going faster and doing more. What we wanted to really make sure is we've got the people and capability in place and I think we're seeing more and more confidence as our stability has gone up, and as we've opened new restaurants, they continue to open really well. So we're going to continue to build a really strong pipeline, which we have for next year, and if the opportunity presents itself to go a little faster, obviously we'll.
But I think I've been pretty consistent with this one, which is the key for us to continue to have great unit growth is to have great unit economics. And I think that's what we're demonstrating is tremendous unit economics. So I'm not surprising as the unit economics continue to improve. There is more and more sites that are available for us and then now we've just added another lever called the Chipotlane, which I think is going to open even more sites for us in the future.
So we've been very purposeful to be – I think very measured in how we go about ramping up our new unit development. But I think there is plenty of opportunity for us to grow from where we are today and what we probably will do in 2020. Great. Thanks. And our last question today will come from John Tower with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Taking the question, just going back to the digital piece of the business, with digital and specifically order ahead mix moving higher as a percentage of your sales, does this potentially open up more opportunities on the menu over time? I'm thinking specifically about your Quesadillas and how, at least when you're testing now requires about a 30-second cook time with new kitchen equipment.
So in a traditional store that might gum up throughput, but if you're doing Chipotlanes where you've got a greater mix of order ahead, obviously that seems to tie in better in that type of a store. So does it potentially open up more opportunities for your menu? Look, I think it's great about the digital business and the digital make line is it does present the opportunity for us to look at opportunities that historically we may not have been able to look at, because I think you can use that make line in various ways, whether it's fulfilling directly digital orders or helping alleviate the front line. So it's definitely something we're continuing to contemplate because it just presents a tremendous opportunity for us. We've got now additional capacity with really great economics associated with that additional capacity.
We before was not be thinking about how we can drive, why can't we drive that harder and that's what the team focused on is how do we drive that harder because we like the results every time that business growth. So – and I wouldn't just have it be the idea of just product. I think there's other ways to drive people into that digital business and then ultimately leverage that digital make line. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Brian Niccol for any closing remarks. Okay, thank you. And thanks for all the questions and thanks for joining us today. Obviously, where I started this conversation is, I'm tremendously proud of the Chipotle team, all of our team members in the field. You don't deliver 7.5% transaction growth and an 11% comp unless you've got an organization that is all rolling together and I think the culture is tremendously strong, both in the support centers and in the restaurants, and I think what we've demonstrated with Carne Asada is we also now have a muscle where we can do new product innovation, as well as driving the digital system. And I'm also really delighted about the unlock that I think Chipotlanes is going to present for us from our new unit opportunities going forward.
So a lot of growth opportunities in front of Chipotle, a tremendous quarter I think that the team delivered most recently and couldn't be prouder of where we are, but I'm also really excited about where we're going. So thank you for joining us and we'll talk soon. Take care. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Ashish Kohli, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter and fiscal year-end 2019 earnings call. By now, you should have access to our earnings press release. If not, it may be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.chipotle.com.
I will begin by reminding you that certain statements and projections made in this presentation about our future business and financial results constitute forward-looking statements, including projections about comparable restaurant sales growth, new store openings, our effective tax rate and expected G&A expenses.
These statements are based on management's current business and market expectations and our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statement.
Please see the risk factors contained in our 2018 annual report on Form 10-K and in our Form 10-Qs for a discussion of risks that may cause our actual results to vary from these forward-looking statement.
Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found via the link included on the Presentation page within the Investor Relations section of our website.
We will start today's call with prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chief Executive Officer, and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer, after which we will take your questions. Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A session.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Brian. Thanks, Ashish. And good afternoon, everyone. We had a strong ending to 2019 as Q4 marks the eighth consecutive quarter of accelerating comparable sales, which highlights that running great restaurants with the right leaders and the right culture delivers outstanding performance.
Our guests love what they see in our restaurants and our team members deserve all the credit. They are more passionate and committed than ever to delivering on our purpose of cultivating a better world.
For the quarter, we reported sales of $1.4 billion, representing 17.6% year-over-year growth, which was fueled by 13.4% comparable restaurant sales growth that included 8% transactions growth. Restaurant level margins of 19.2% which is 220 basis points higher than last year. Earnings per share adjusted for unusual items of $2.86 representing 66% year-over-year growth and digital sales growth of 78% year-over-year representing 19.6% of sales.
Full-year results also showed great progress, with sales growing 14.8% to reach $5.6 billion, driven by an 11.1% comp with 7% transaction growth. Restaurant AUV, about $2.2 million, margin expansion of 180 basis points to 20.5% and digital sales of $1 billion dollars which grew 90% versus the prior year.
These results were driven by the same five key fundamental strategies that I've mentioned previously. Number one, making the brand more visible and loved. Number two, creating innovations utilizing a stage gate process. Number three, leveraging our digital make line to expand access and convenience. Number four, engaging with customers through our loyalty program. And number five, running successful restaurants with a strong culture that provides great food, hospitality, throughput and economics.
While Chipotle had an excellent 2019, what excites me the most is that we are just getting started. I believe we have the opportunity to continue to expand AUVs, margins and store count over time. Our strategy has plenty of runway that should help drive healthy comps in 2020, while also improving flow through.
Let me provide you an update on each of these strategies, beginning with our marketing programs which are designed to increase transactions and grow sales by driving culture, driving a difference and ultimately driving purchases.
We continue to iterate our national For Real TV campaign to showcase our real ingredients, fresh food and the culinary skills of Chipotle team members in action. These ads are honest, transparent and highly effective at driving awareness and reminding customers what makes Chipotle great and a brand they love.
This campaign is connecting with our customers as evidenced by significant increases across almost all major drivers of brand strength, including trust and favor brand in our consumer brand tracker.
Our various marketing initiatives across both traditional and digital channels were successful in attracting new users to Chipotle as well as motivating existing customers to come more often. Importantly, we saw healthy transactions growth in 2019 without relying on short-term promotions.
Although our overall marketing budget relative to 2018 remained consistent at 3% of sales, the promo portion was actually reduced by 15% and follows a sizable reduction in 2018 as well.
There's no doubt that marketing helped drive impressive sales during 2019. And based on the plans we have in place, I expect more of the same in 2020. Chipotle will continue to have a presence in national media where and when it makes sense. We will be a part of culturally relevant events and we have an always-on social and digital program.
Our marketing efforts this year were elevated because we used the stage gate process to develop innovation that leads food culture and meets guest requests. We are pleased to have rolled out several successful menu items that were validated by this process.
This included our preconfigured, diet driven lifestyle bowls which were launched in January 2019 and received terrific feedback as they showed that whatever lifestyle or diet you want to pursue, Chipotle's real ingredients are a perfect fit. We recently enhanced this platform by adding a new super green salad mix composed of hand-cut romaine, baby kale and baby spinach, as well as a whole 30 chicken to provide guests with specific dietary goals, more options.
The other noteworthy new item was carne asada, which was launched in September and will transition out by the end of the first quarter. This premium steak continues to exceed our expectations. As a result, our supply chain team is exploring options to see if we can add this as a permanent menu item at some point in the future, contingent, of course, on us finding enough supply of high quality ingredients that meet our food with integrity standards.
As you think about 2020 and beyond, our goal is to continue introducing one to two new menu items on average per year. Our pipeline remains robust with Queso Blanco, quesadillas and beverages currently being tested in various markets. In fact, Queso Blanco has recently been validated via the stage gate process, allowing for a national rollout and replacement of our existing queso shortly. Additionally, we have several items in the early stages of testing. We will keep you updated on their progress over time.
The key takeaway here is that the state gate process is working as expected and gives me confidence that future innovations will delight our customers, ensure a seamless integration into our current operations and derive a financial benefit.
Let's move now to the third key initiative. Our digital platform designed to reduce friction while increasing convenient access. The progress we've made here continues to be a standout story.
Over the course of 2019, we significantly upgraded our capabilities by completing the rollout of digital pickup shelves, digitizing our digital make line and expanding our delivery capabilities to over 98% of our store base.
During Q4, these efforts resulted in digital sales of $282 million, which grew 78% year-over-year and represented 19.6% of mix. In just three years, we have quadrupled the digital business, achieving over $1 billion in sales during 2019.
Moving forward, I am really excited by the latest addition to our digital flywheel, the Chipotlane, which is off to a great start. Customers love the fact they don't have to get out of their cars, as well as having a pickup time that is significantly faster than their traditional drive-through.
We continue to see overall digital penetration for Chipotle in restaurant in the high 20s, with the majority of this being driven by our highest margin, order ahead and pickup transaction. We will more than double the number of Chipotles in 2020 because our guests love the convenience and it strengthens our economic model by making our highest margin channel more accessible.
The next potential piece to enhance our digital offering is a new restaurant design that helps evolve our mobile pickup shelves to an integrated digital pickup portal. We recently began to test several formats including one with a walk-up window across from Wrigley Field in Chicago. This 2,000 square-foot restaurant is slightly smaller, has fewer seats, the customer-facing grab-and-go beverage case and digital pickup shelves near the front door for easy access. By better suiting our restaurants to accommodate the digital business, we will be able to provide a better overall experience for our guests.
Now that we have many of the digital tools in place, 2020 will be about using them more efficiently and really leveraging our rewards program, which currently has more than 8.5 million enrolled members and is one of the fastest growing restaurant loyalty programs in history.
While in 2019, we focused on member growth. In 2020, we will not only further increase enrollment, but more importantly look to optimize the use of database marketing to incent behaviors as we build out our CRM capabilities.
Personalization and engagement are the cornerstones of our revolving loyalty strategy. We are encouraged by the early signs of transaction increases across all frequency bands. We expect this lever to become a bigger driver in the future as we gain more experience gathering customer insight while continuing to expand our digital ecosystem.
This brings me to the most foundational ingredient of having a successful restaurant company – operational excellence, which comes from great leaders building great teams who create equally great guest experiences.
We continue to focus on outstanding execution by being brilliant at the basics. This requires a significant investment in our more than 83,000 employees with regard to career development as well as offering industry-leading benefits. Recent enhancements, such as debt free degrees, crew bonuses and mental health benefits, help differentiate the Chipotle brand.
Nowadays, employees want more than just wages from a potential employer. They are seeking the right culture and the right skills to help them grow, both professionally and personally. Additionally, our purpose around Food With Integrity and cultivating a better world also provides us a competitive advantage in this tight labor market.
Within our restaurants, we believe the general manager is the most important position to improving operational health and ensuring a great customer experience. During 2019, this emphasis on our general managers resulted in exceptional food that is being prepared more consistently, better stability with turnover being reduced by around 35% and nearly a 10% improvement in our max 15 minute throughput KPI, aided by training and a laser focus on the five pillars of throughput.
This success reinforces that continuing to develop, grow and invest in our GMs is the right approach to creating an environment that allows our employees to be in a position to win, not only today, but also in the future.
We've made good progress this year on our operational goals, but still have plenty of opportunity as we strive to be better today than we were yesterday, a message we will reinforce at our all-manager conference in March.
In closing, I believe our strong performance this year highlights that our strategies are working and the Chipotle brand is thriving. I'm really proud of what we accomplished in 2019 and want to thank all of our employees for winning today and creating a bright future.
We're building a successful, durable model. And by staying focused on our priorities and executing flawlessly, while providing customers with the unique Chipotle experience, I'm confident we will be successful for many years to come.
With that, here's Jack to walk you through the financials. Thanks, Brian. And good afternoon, everyone. Once again, we delivered outstanding financial performance in the fourth quarter as comps and margins continue to expand, highlighting our strong economic model.
Sales were $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter, an increase of 17.6% from last year. Comp sales grew 13.4% in the quarter which includes no net impact from our rewards program. Deferred revenue from our rewards program was essentially offset by a refined breakage rate assumption for chips and guacamole as we gather more historical data. Moving forward, as we begin to lap the launch of our loyalty program, we expect quarterly deferrals to have a modest impact on our comp.
Restaurant-level margins of 19.2% expanded 220 basis points over last year and earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $2.86, representing 66% year-over-year of growth.
The fourth quarter had unusual expenses related to our transformation as well as legal reserves that negatively impacted our earnings per share by $0.31, leading to a GAAP earnings per share of $2.55.
For the full year, sales increased 14.8% to $5.6 billion on a comp increase of 11.1%. Restaurant level margins were 20.5%, an increase of 180 basis points, and we generated earnings per share adjusted for unusual expenses of $14.05, an increase of 55% over last year.
Unusual expenses mostly related to transformation and legal reserves negatively impacted our earnings per share by $1.67, leading to GAAP earnings of $12.38.
We're pleased that our unit economics strengthened in 2019 with average volumes now exceeding $2.2 million and restaurant margin reaching 20.5%. This margin included temporary pressure from carne asada and avocado pricing, without which our restaurant level margins would have been just over 21% which is within striking distance of the 22% margin potential at a $2.2 million AUV.
The growth in AUVs and margins in 2019 is evidence that our strong economic model remains intact and we expect continued growth in both of these metrics during 2020 and beyond.
The Q4 comp of 13.4% was driven by an acceleration in transaction as 8% of the comp came from greater guest visits. We also saw an increase in check of roughly 5.4%, driven by price and mix, the latter being driven by carne asada and digital orders which have a higher average check.
Looking to fiscal 2020 where comparisons will no doubt be tougher, we're optimistic that based on healthy sales trends thus far in Q1, plus the 2% price increase taken in December, combined with our future growth initiatives that a mid-single digit comp is achievable for the full year.
During the fourth quarter, we opened 80 new restaurants, a record number of openings for a quarter, bringing total new restaurant openings for the year to 140. Productivity of these units is in the high 80% range, the highest in the company's history. I'm really proud of the hard work put in by our development teams and our operations teams, especially given the significant back-end loading that occurred in 2019.
We opened 46 Chipotlanes in the quarter, resulting in 66 Chipotlanes at year-end. And as Brian mentioned, we're excited by the early success of these Chipotlanes and we'll continue to aggressively open more moving forward.
For 2020, we anticipate opening 150 to 165 new restaurants, with more than half including a Chipotlane. While these openings will once again be weighted towards the second half of the year, we expect a modestly better balance in comparison to last year. About 35% of these openings are expected to occur in the first half of 2020 versus only 25% in the first half of last year.
Food costs for the quarter were 33.1%, a decrease of 10 basis point from last year due primarily to a venue price increase and lower avocado pricing that was partially offset by the higher cost of several other ingredients, including about 70 basis point headwind from carne asada as it was available for the entire quarter.
On a sequential basis, avocado pricing continued to moderate, given greater supply coming from Mexico as we begin the more plentiful harvest year. For Q1, we expect ongoing moderation in avocado pricing as a result of increasing supply, but we believe this will be partially offset by higher carne asada cost, resulting in cost of sales being in the mid-32% range.
We expect food cost for the full year to be in the low to mid 32% range based on better avocado pricing and further supply chain efficiencies being partially offset by what appears thus far to be a normal cycle of protein inflation.
Labor costs for the quarter were 26.5%, a decrease of 60 basis points from last year. This decrease was driven primarily by sales leverage, partially offset by labor inflation which continues to be in the 4% to 5% range including the cost of benefits such as debt free tuition. We expect Q1 labor costs to be in the mid 26% range with sales leverage and wage inflation being the biggest factors.
Other operating costs for the quarter were 14.8%, a decrease of 70 basis points from 1Q4 last year due to sales leverage. Marketing and promo costs were 4.1% in the quarter, similar to Q4 of last year, but a 210 basis point increase sequentially to support carne asada and our free delivery bowl promotion. For the full year our marketing investment was 3% of sales as expected.
Looking at 2020, we once again anticipate spending around 3% of sales overall for the year, with Q1 being in the low to mid 3% range compared to the 2.5% we spent in Q1 of last year in order to support our ongoing menu innovation.
During the quarter, we booked $10 million for legal reserves related to US attorney's investigation that began in January 2016. This brings the total reserve to $25 million. We believe this amount is a reasonable estimate of what we may be expected to pay to settle this matter, but there can be no assurance that a settlement will be reached. We have been cooperating with the investigation and we're in active discussions to possibly resolve this matter.
G&A for the quarter was $112 million on a GAAP basis, $106 million on a non-GAAP basis excluding nearly $4 million net related to several legal matters including the $10 million reserve I just mentioned and about $2 million related to transformation expenses.
G&A also includes approximately $75 million in underlying G&A expenses, $25 million related to non-cash stock comp, $4.5 million related to higher bonus accruals from our strong performance and related payroll taxes and $1.5 million related to our upcoming all manager conference.
Underlying G&A was in line with our expectations as we grew headcount responsibly to support our growth. Looking to Q1, we expect to continue hiring people to support future growth and invest in our emerging digital platform. This will lead to Q1 underlying G&A support in the range of $77 million to $80 million and total G&A is expected to be around $120 million.
We expect stock comp to be around $23 million per quarter, although this amount could move up or down based on our actual performance. This is slightly lower than Q4 as the 2017 equity bonuses roll off post testing and are replaced with new 2020 brands, which are valued at target without any performance.
We also expect to recognize between $3 million to $4 million of importer taxes associated with shares that vest at the beginning of our fiscal year.
Lastly, we're expecting to recognize about $13 million of expenses in Q1 related to our upcoming all manager conference.
Effective tax rate for Q4 was 28.3% on a GAAP basis and 27% on a non-GAAP basis. The difference was due primarily to tax implications related to transformation costs.
For fiscal 2020, we expect our underlying effective tax rate to be in the 26% to 29% range, though it may vary based on discrete items as well as any stock option exercises.
Our balance sheet remains strong with cash and investments totaling $909 million as of December 31. And similar to Q3, we repurchased about $38 million of our stock at an average price of $773 per share during the quarter. For the full year, we repurchased $188 million at an average price of $684 per share.
In closing, we're pleased to report a strong ending to fiscal 2019, including 8% transaction growth which highlights that our strategies are resonating not only with high-frequency customers, but also with medium frequency and new customers.
Continuing to enhance convenience and access while optimizing our digital, marketing, menu and operations will help ensure the Chipotle brand remains healthy moving forward.
Thank you to all of our employees for their hard work and their dedication this year and let's keep it going in 2020.
With that, we're happy to take your questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And the first question will come from David Tarantino with Baird. Please go ahead. Hi. Good afternoon and congratulations on a strong year. My question, Jack, is about the margin performance at the restaurant level. I'm just wondering if you could comment on the flow-through that you saw in Q4 and throughout the year. And I think you mentioned that, at $2.2 million AUV, the expectation would be that you have margins in the 22% range and you're a bit below that. So, can you reconcile some of the factors that are driving that and what the algorithm might look like going forward as you grow the unit volumes? Yeah, David. First of all, we still think that the margin potential at $2.2 million is right around 22%. There are a couple of things that were headwinds during the year. One, we saw some really, really high avocado cost during the summer. That had an impact. And then, we also had carne asada, which, I think, as you know, for most of the quarter, we priced carne asada at just $0.50 above steak and it cost us about $0.35 to $0.40 or so. And we did that intentionally as a transaction builder, but it did have a temporary negative impact on our margin.
Now, during the quarter, we did take a price increase. We increased carne asada another $0.25. We got a $0.75 upcharge and we didn't see any degradation in demand at all. So, we think there is room when we do additional premium offerings like that we can price them at full margin.
The other thing that's going on, David, that also had what I would call temporary headwinds is, we just started our loyalty program last year. We did a great job of acquiring well over 8 million customers in the program. With that acquisition comes the discounts, and yet we hadn't really monetized that [indiscernible]. So, that has a little bit of an impact on the margin as well.
And then, our delivery business is growing well also. So, all these things are what I would call temporary or cyclical headwinds that we can overcome all of them and we still feel confident that, when we get to $2.2 million, we can generate a 22% margin. We get to $2.3 million, we could generate a 23% margin. We think that potential still exists within the model. Thank you. And the next question will come from Nicole Miller with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Please go ahead, Nicole. Perhaps your line is muted on your end.
All right. We'll move to our next question. That's Katie Fogertey with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Great. Thank you. I have a couple of questions here. So, first of all, with the – bringing the super greens on to the menu in January and kind of expanding the lifestyle bowl offerings that you did in 4Q. Can you give us a sense of how your bowl versus burrito mix is changing here and how that is evolving and any kind color that you can give us on labor and margin efficiencies as you move to the bowl away from the burrito? And I have a follow-up. Sure. The reality is continues to show a slight migration to bowls. The thing that's great about that is that's our fastest product on the Chipotle menu and which also provides, I think, the customer the greatest value proposition because of all the customization that they see right in front of them, with all our ingredients right in front of them. So, the good news is the super greens proposition has been well received. It's performing in line with expectations and the customer feedback on it has all been very positive. So, it's perfectly in sync.
And I think we talked about this earlier. One of the things we heard early on from our customer was they would like us to improve our salad and that's what we're doing with the super greens salad mix. Great. That's helpful. And do you have a sense of the mix of the bowls versus burritos? Rule of thumb is two-thirds bowls is the way to think about it. And then, the next piece is burritos followed by tacos. Tacos are small. Okay. And then, on the delivery cost side, we're seeing more and more restaurants pass on the delivery cost to the customer and not seeing really any kind of impact to demand. You kind of talked about having some room to move on carne asada and not seeing any traffic hit there. Is that a potential opportunity for this year for you guys to pass on some of the delivery cost to the customer? Yeah. Look, the good news is our value equation is really strong at Chipotle. So, we have room if we find that the economic proposition requires us to pass along some of these costs in the delivery channel. Or if we want to bring out some elevated ingredients. The good news is our value proposition is really strong and the elasticity would allow us to do it. Currently, we like the economics that we have and we're more in the mortgage acquisition mode of using delivery as a tool to get people into our digital ecosystem. So, the good news is we've got the right value proposition that if we wanted to flex it, we could. Okay. Thank you so much. Next question, we'll move back to Nicole Miller with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Thank you. Good afternoon. Can you hear me okay now? Yeah. I apologize for that earlier. I wanted to ask about how you think about directing the balance sheet. So, when we look back on last year, clearly, was better at every quarter versus where you started guiding the year, what the Street expected. So, maybe some of the things that you didn't do. So, not necessarily an acceleration in development. How do you view that as a use of cash? The share repurchase hasn't necessarily increased and would you use leverage? And then, when might a dividend be appropriate? Thank you. Yeah, Nicole. Let me start with buybacks. We bought, I think, like $168 million during the year, $38 million during the quarter. Our cash balance did grow during the fourth quarter. We actually suspended our buys during the quarter for a while as we got into serious negotiations with the government. Our counsel advised us to suspend that for a while. With this release, we'll be able to get back in the market. And so, I think what you'll see is we will be opportunistic as we look at the share price and we look at our balance sheet just to do buybacks at the appropriate level. In terms of investing in return-generating assets, the best investment we can make is into our Chipotle restaurants. And I would not expect us to see – to do a stair-step increase in the opening, but you will see an increase over time. Our pipeline is building very, very nicely. And that's going to be a great return for us.
We're also going to dabble in remodel this year as well. So, we've got several hundred restaurants that needed refresh, so that they're more digital forward. So, we're going to experiment with that. And if that goes well, which we're optimistic about, that will be another opportunity for us and I would expect that would be a return generating asset as well.
We from time to time, Nicole, talk about dividends, but it's not really on the radar screen right now. We think that we're more in growth mode and opportunistic buyback of our stock and not dividend generating. That might change in the future, but right now we're not considering a dividend. The only thing I would add is we have a billion-dollar digital business that continues to grow nicely. And where we see opportunities to invest and continuing to push the digital access in our business, we're going to do that because it makes a lot of sense for both performance today and performance in the future. And just a follow-up, what's the practice on leverage? How do you feel about it? Would you deploy it? No. Nicole, that's financial engineering. That's something that I think is more appropriate for a more mature slow-growing company. So, I would not expect us to put leverage on the balance sheet. Excellent. Thank you. Thanks, Nicole. And our next question comes from Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Thank you. I have one question and one follow-up please. First on just menu innovation, you talked about the super greens performing in line with expectations. But if I think about carne asada, I think it's probably exceeded expectations, which is why you are bringing it back permanently and maybe was, we'd estimate, maybe much of a mid-single-digit mix or lift. So, how should we think about menu innovation going forward? Is that sort of a unique experience and we wouldn't expect to see these kinds of big hits or is it just that you could have more opportunities that would be as meaningful? And then, I have a follow-up please. So, actually, we're really delighted with the carne asada performance. It's evidence that are our stage gate process towards innovation really is working. The thing that was great about carne asada is we stay true to our principles around Food With Integrity and bringing out great quality meat. And when the customers got to try it, they loved it and they came back for more.
So, we're working right now to figure out, can we get a supply, so that we could make it permanent. And if we can secure that supply, then we probably make it permanent. But we haven't been able to finalize that point yet. So, customers loved it. The performance was great. As we figure out our supply scenario on this, we'll figure out the right time to bring it back. And if we can, we'll figure out a way to make it permanent.
But regarding the innovation going forward, what I love about this brand is we have the ability to, I think, give people the access to food that they don't get access to anywhere else. And I think that's why we got the response that we did on our lifestyle bowls, the response that we got on carne asada, super greens and that's what we're going to continue to push against.
And Queso Blanco is the most recent product that's gone through our stage gate process that now we are ready to bring this to market and replace our existing queso. I think we've mentioned we've been working on quesadillas and some beverages. So, the thing that's great is, I think we've got a cadence that's building. And as I mentioned before, we're not going to be moving to a place where we are doing something every 4 to 6 weeks. That's not our business. That's not who we are. You can expect us to do one or two of these initiatives on the menu because it's the right cadence for operators to execute really well and it's also the right cadence I think to give our customers the variety that they're looking for in our business.
So, I love what's happening in our menu. And I love what's happening in our pipeline. And I think this stage gate process is proving to be a very effective tool. Okay, great. Thank you. And then, my follow-up is just, I think in terms of the guidance, mid-single-digit comp. I think, Jack, historically, you've kind of guided to whatever the current run rate of volume that you're not assuming much of an acceleration. But is it safe to say that quarter-to-date you're still seeing kind of low double-digit comps? That would be the implication I think if I... Yeah. The way I would say that, Sara, is that these dollar sales that we saw in the fourth quarter continued into the first quarter, but the comparison is different. So, yeah, the comps are strong. Just keep in mind, we'll have to compare to our 13.4% in the fourth quarter of next year. And then, when we run through the carne asada, we'll lose some check as well. The carne asada added about 150 basis points to the average check, so we'll see that as well. We're optimistic we'll keep all those transactions, but that will have a bit of an impact. The only thing I would add to that is, we mentioned that the brand has got, I think, really excellent momentum. And I tried to highlight that in the script by talking about how we've seen trust and favored brand metrics really move forward.
And so, I just want to make sure people understand. I think the reason why we had the quarter that we had is not because we had carne asada, and it was just one thing that drove this business. I really do believe our operations are running better than they ever have been. We saw an opportunity to be even better. But our operations are running better. They're running faster. The food is more consistent. We have lower turnover. And I think we've got better execution.
If you think about all the progress on digital and then I think the progress we've made on allocating our marketing dollars, so that it is driving purchases without using discounting as the crutch. And then, obviously, layered on top, we had a nice menu innovation on carne asada. So, I just want to make sure people understand it's not a one trick here on why we've got 8 points of transaction growth and a 13.4% comp as a result of it. The next question will come from Andrew Charles with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Great. Thank you. Brian, you mentioned during the quarter an openness to work with other third-party delivery providers beyond the national partnership you have with DoorDash and also the agreement you have in place with Postmates. I'm curious, what would lead you to pursue working with other delivery providers? As well as, does your agreement with DoorDash indicate you would see higher commissions if you were to onboard another delivery partner? And then, I also have a follow-up for Jack. Okay. Yeah, look, I think the reason why I said we're going to be open to it is, at the end of the day, we've got to give access to our customers where they want Chipotle, when they want Chipotle and how they want Chipotle. And I think the delivery channel is proving to be one of those access points. The relationship with DoorDash has been great. Working with Postmates has been great. We'll see how things unfold going forward. But I do think ultimately the delivery marketplace is not going to be an exclusive proposition. I think the delivery marketplace is going to be about giving customers access accordingly. So, we're continuing to talk to all the players. And when the right opportunity presents itself, we'll figure out whether or not we bring on additional players or not. But, yeah, we're open to it. And the real driver of it is we want to deliver on the needs of our customers. Sure. And then, Jack, beyond if you would see a higher commission from DoorDash if you were to onboard another provider, looking at labor, it looks like labor dollars per store growth accelerated quite a bit. Our model is just about 10% growth, which is well in excess of the 4% to 5% labor inflation you called out despite the accelerated digital growth which is obviously more favorable for labor. What do you attribute this acceleration to? Is it the incremental benefits? Is it the greater number of crew members to handle the greater traffic? Just curious, for modeling purposes, how we should think about labor in 2020? Yeah, it's traffic driven. So, if you just take a standard 10% increase in labor when we have 8% – keep in mind, we have 8% in terms of transactions, but we also had mix which means we're cooking more food as well. So, we only had a 2% price increase. So, the rest is more food, more customers that we're serving. It does take more labor. And so, our labor is more partially fixed, partially variable. Frankly, during the quarter, our labor performed the way that it should have. We saw 60 basis points of leverage even though we had about 140 basis points of inflation and then benefit headwind. So, we had to come up with couple of hundred basis points of leverage based on the price increase and based on the higher transaction.
We also during the fourth quarter – keep in mind, we opened up a record number of restaurants. And so, that's another piece where, just with that alone, you're going to add labor, not just to staff the 80 restaurants, but we also have to train those folks before the restaurants open. And we tend to have an allocation or allowance for more labor hours early on in the first week or the first several weeks because people are learning and we don't know exactly what the sales are. So, there's a number of things why you see higher labor in the fourth quarter. Thanks. And the next question is from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Thanks. And congrats on a great year. Interesting that your digital mix increased by 7 points in that fourth quarter. Your same-store sales growth was obviously a lot higher at over 13%. So, you can see how the new product news is letting you not lean as hard on delivery and digital order growth to drive the comp. Looking into this year, how do you see your growth contribution going forward? You mentioned a new product. But then again, you're also talking about ways to engage that loyalty member. And I have a quick follow-up. Yeah, David. So, the way we're thinking about it is, marketing, combined with our CRM is a real opportunity to grow the business both with new users and existing users. And then, as we think about our digital business, one of the things that I'm really excited about is our order ahead business, as we continue to get people into our digital system, they really see the benefits of, one, joining the rewards program, but, two, just the convenience, the ease of access by using whether it's the website or the app. So, we believe there's going to be continued growth there.
And then, obviously, I continue to believe that there is more growth just running our restaurants better. As we continue to improve on our throughput, that just basically continues to be a multiply effect, right? It's like, carne asada, the digital business, none of it will be nearly as effective if we don't have strong execution on the basics with our restaurant. So, I feel like every one of these calls, people are always like, what was the one thing and what's the one thing to drive comp going forward. I really continue to believe the strategies that we've outlined all contribute to our ongoing growth model. And we've got lease on – some will provide more at certain times of the year and others will provide more at other times of the year. But, in the end, that's why we had the year that we had, and that's why I believe we'll continue to perform going forward. The quick follow-up on that is related to, I think, a conception that going into this year, you're going to be lapping free delivery windows. And you've done those margin dilutive ways to onboard consumers. And I guess the question I would have is, once you have them on board, I think you said 8 million strong, how do you convert them into more digital users? Or you feel like you can maybe have your cake and eat it too with margins and sales as you grow that digital user base? And I'll pass it on. Yeah, yeah. Look, David, obviously, what you just articulated is how we want this to play out where we continue to invest to grow the database. The good news is, I think, going forward, it's going to be more balanced between invest in acquisition as well as kind of driving behavioral changes. And, as our digital business continues to grow, as Chipotlanes become more prevalent, we think there is opportunity for us to become even more efficient in how we provide people that great Chipotle experience.
The one thing I would mention is, Jack said this at the very beginning, the bottom line is, we hold ourselves accountable to make the economic model consistent with what we've been talking about. You get to $2.5 million, we'll have 25% margins. And we think we see a clear sight of path on how that all happens through a combination of initiatives, and then just being really, I think, smart about how we manage the P&L accordingly.
So, it's a great situation to be in where we've invested. And now, we are going to be able to take advantage of those investments in the digital space. But I think it also plays out in a lot of different ways that people access the Chipotle brand. So, obviously, we're very proud of where we are, but I'm really excited about where we're going, is kind of the summary. Thank you. The next question will come from Lauren Silberman with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Thanks. I wanted to ask about the loyalty program. So, now at the 8.5 million members less than a year after launching, what do you think makes Chipotle different than maybe some of the competitors as it relates to customer acquisition? And thinking about the trajectory of membership growth going forward, any color on kind of when you start to turn on more of the personalized marketing? Yeah. Look, I think, Chipotle is a unique restaurant company. And any time we have found that we provide people the ability to have more engagement or more access, they want to be a part of that. And I think that's why the rewards program has had such quick adoption. I think it's a testament to the fact that we are committed to Food With Integrity, we've got a great value proposition, all the reasons why you love Chipotle. Okay?
Now, the thing that's great is we have 8.5 million customers and the personalization really is just getting started. So, I'm already seeing some of our tactics going to the marketplace. And what's great to see is we're seeing it have an effect on just about every cohort that we're targeting. And we define those cohorts both on purchase frequency as well as, I would call it, lifestyle.
And so, I think it's going to continue to be something we're going to want to invest to continue to grow. But at the same time, we're now taking that universe and really using it as a smart way to grow the business. And it's a hugely valuable asset and it's an asset we're going to really drive going forward. Great. Just a follow-up to the digital sales growth. I think there is a perception that the majority is coming from deliveries, but the customers don't see the third-party platforms. Are there opportunities to convert them to the Chipotle digital ecosystem? Yeah. I would tell you that's a little bit of a misconception. The thing that's great is, as we see people come into the digital system, we see really nice gains in our order ahead business. So, in the early days, obviously, delivery was on 8% growth rate, was one of the biggest parts of our digital business. But one of the things I'm really excited about is the progress we're making on the order ahead business.
And delivery is proving to be just a great experience for people that maybe didn't have that occasion with Chipotle in the past. Now, they believe it's convenient, so they can have those occasions with Chipotle, both order ahead as well as delivery. So, it's working nicely as a system between rewards, order ahead, delivery and now the Chipotlane. Great. Thank you. Sure. The next question is from Peter Saleh with BTIG. Please go ahead. Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the second make line. The second make line is digitized. The second make line is now in all the stores. Digital sales are now approaching 20%. So, are you starting to see some leverage on that second make line? Is there anything noticeable? Any which way that you guys can break out the contribution that you're seeing from our second make line now? Look, I think we're going to be very smart about how we take advantage of that efficiency. Our most important thing right now is we want to give people a great digital experience. That's why we've invested in those digital make lines, we've invested in the – we're calling that – the digital portal pickup.
The thing that's great is, we know the efficiency is there and we're going to be smart about how we implement that efficiency into the business, so that we don't affect our growth and/or the experience that the customer has.
So, we're delighted that we're closing in on 20%. But that's not the end of this journey. That's just one of the stops on our journey to, I think, a much bigger business than where we are today. Great. Thank you very much. The next question is from Jake Bartlett with SunTrust. Great. Thanks for taking the questions. My first one is on throughput. You mentioned an improvement in the peak hour throughput. I think you said 10% or maybe it's 10 seconds. Maybe I misheard. But if you could just remind us what that was and where you are in terms of throughput versus the kind of the low of your throughput. Trying to see how much you've improved since that low and maybe when that low was. Yes. So, the 10% improvement is what I said. But, yeah, I think we talked about this as – at our peak, we're doing low 30s, mid 30s and the max 15. And unfortunately, that dropped to kind of the low 20s, mid 20s. And what I'm happy to say is, Scott and the team have really put a lot of focus on how do we get back to great throughput. And the more we have stability in the restaurants, the more we have consistency in our KPIs and what we're going to hold our teams accountable for, I think we'll continue to see this metric improve which just provides a better experience for our customer.
But the way to think about it is we've had about a 10% improvement. And what I'm happy to say is, as we've moved into 2020, we continue to see the improvement. So, this is one of those things that builds on top of itself. And if you were to talk to any of our team members, they would all know throughput is a key pillar as well as having great food, great teams and having those restaurant staffed correctly. So, I'm really optimistic about where operations are going to take this metric going forward. Great. I think of throughput as a key sales driver, but it also could be a cost savings. Is throughput part of what you talked about in your prepared script around just flow-through – better flow-through of profits in 2020? Is that going to contribute to kind of keep labor in check? Yeah. It's part of it. The flow-through I'm referring to is kind of where Jack started this conversation in regard to – look, for every incremental dollar, we expect X% to flow to the bottom line. And then, that's how we hold the model consistent, so that when we do get to $2.5 million, we'll have 25% margins or better. So, it's not just one thing, but obviously that's a key indicator that we're running the restaurants correctly.
You're not running the restaurants correctly if we're not going fast. And so, one thing we do know is a busy restaurant, a restaurant that's running quick is a well-run restaurant. The team members prefer working in that environment and the customers prefer getting their food in that environment. So, all really good stuff. Great. And then, Jack, last question on G&A. You mentioned this kind of the underlying G&A and the guidance for the first quarter, I think you said $77 million to $80 million, if I got that right. That to me is up – it looks, versus the first quarter of last year, up about 9%, 10%. Is that the right run rate just in terms of the underlying G&A, that underlying G&A should grow that quickly. I was kind of more under the impression that you could kind of keep a mid-single-digit G&A growth longer-term. I think that's right. Over the long term, I think that's about right. We started the transformation in this move about a year-and-a-half ago. And so, there's a few gaps that we need to fill. And so, that's why we want to make sure you guys saw what we are doing into the first quarter. So, I think more of a mid-single digit-ish in terms of underlying G&A. So, we will grow our G&A at a less than the sales rate, so we can leverage it. So, I think that's correct to think about it long-term.
But keep in mind, as Brian mentioned, we're in the early days of digital. So, some of these resources – a lot of these resource, in fact, are making sure that we've got the right skill gaps, whether it comes to digital, whether it comes to some of the CRM and things like that. And so, we want to make sure we get ahead of those. But I think over a longer period of time, I think something more in that kind of mid-single-digit as opposed to a high single-digit is probably a good way to think about it. Okay. And just to be clear. The first quarter should be higher than the rest of the year, should be more in line with the long-term or the whole year is kind of a year of investment? Well, the whole year is going to be up because we're going to hire people and then they're going to be into the base. Got it. Thank you. The next question is from Dennis Geiger with UBS. Great. Thanks. Brian, you talked about employee benefits and initiatives, kind of how that's been translating into operational excellence. Just kind of wondering if you could talk a bit more about building the talent pool, what that's meant for the quality of restaurants. Looking ahead, in particular, as you – I don't know if you still frame it as far as a restaurant, et cetera. Just the progress that you've made there on the restaurant pool.
And then, just going one step further, thinking a little longer term around restaurant development, it feels like this has always kind of been the limiting factor from an employee talent perspective. Just how you're thinking about those benchmarks from a talent perspective to where you can kind of see a step change looking ahead from a store growth perspective? Thanks. Sure, sure. So, look, I'll give you a little bit of example to bring to light the progress that I think we're making on the restaurant. So, I was actually in Denver just a couple of weeks ago. And Denver is one of our older markets. And I was visiting with our team director there, Alfredo Ponce, and he has got just terrific restaurant general managers. And this one young lady who is running one of our restaurants, she's had three consecutive quarters where she hit all the KPIs and her and her entire crew have all gotten bonuses. And she is on her way in the fourth – the first quarter, but she – she just walked in there, she's like – she wanted to show me her AB scorecard. It was all green, it was As everywhere. And the first thing she told me is like we're going to get our fourth quarter in a row of accrued bonus. And every one of those employees had a smile on their face. They were truly energized, truly engaged. And I give that just as one example of what I see as I now travel more and more across the country. Whether you're in Arizona, Boston, New York, we're seeing our team members I think just be more energized, more engaged and just super-proud of making a difference. It's hard to put a value on that.
As part of this process, though, we ask them what does more support look like for you to be successful at Chipotle. And what they came back with is, look, tuition reimbursement is great, but I actually need a debt free program, like I need a program where I don't put myself in a place where I'm behind the eight ball and that's why we came up with the debt free degree program. We also heard loud and clear from a lot of young people mental health is top of mind for not only them, but their family. And so, we brought forward those benefits. So, English as a second language is something also too where people are like, hey, it's great to have a benefit for me, but it would be great if I could have for my whole family. The reason why this is important is we want the employee to feel great about working there, but we want those around them to feel great about them working at Chipotle as well. And I think we're seeing the impact of that.
And we're going to continue to fine-tune the benefits. We're going to continue fine-tuning the employee value proposition. But my goal and our team's goal is, we want people to believe and experience that when they work at Chipotle, they get to be themselves, they will get to grow professionally and they will get to grow personally. And I think if we do that, we'll continue to attract the right people and we'll get much better outcomes than if we didn't have all these things in place to attract these types of people.
So, it's one of the plays that I'm usually passionate about and it makes you get really excited when you see it happening in our restaurants. Thank you. The next question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Thanks very much. First, just on the loyalty and program enhancements, Brian, that you're planning, how much work has been done? Are you ready to do sort of phase two and do more bespoke offers? Or is there more work behind the scenes that you need to do before you can do that? I know it's easier said than done. And when should we expect those more bespoke or personalized offers to start appearing? Yeah, John. Great question. The bespoke or more personalized offers have begun. We're kind of rolling right now with it. So, it's going to be happening all year long, and I think as every week goes by, we're only going to get better at it. And I'm really – it's nice to see the work that's been done over the last year start to come to fruition in 2020. All right. And then, Jack, just two margin questions. One is, you didn't mention in the labor commentary the cost of the bonus program. Can you just quantify what that may have been? I assume that's entirely variable, right? So, if comps were to moderate, some of that bonus goes away, so we shouldn't worry about labor dollars per store growth. It's going to be relative to comp growth. Is that fair as it relates to that bonus? Yeah. We're not breaking out the dollar amount, John. I would put that into the category of the 4% to 5% inflation. That's the piece where I mentioned we have about 140 basis points of headwind in labor. So, that includes normal wage inflation, includes debt less degrees and includes the bonus program, all these things that Brian mentioned. Those are all in that. And I know that doesn't technically qualify as wage inflation, the way that you might think about it, but these are all things we're doing to make sure that we have the best workforce we can and that we engage them and that we keep them. So, that's all included in that number.
And I wouldn't think of it as 100% variable, John, because there is qualitative figures in there as well. Sure, when sales are good, that means the margin is going to be good. And so, they'll be hitting those metrics, those other metrics as well that aren't as direct. So, I would call it semi-variable. So, generally, it's going to be tougher to earn the bonus. We don't have very strong sales, very strong margins, but it's not 100% variable to sales. Okay. And then, just finally, you mentioned there may be a modest impact to comp on the loyalty program or deferred benefits. What does modest mean? How big could that drag be? We had seen 30 and 40 basis points early last year, John. And as we've seen the program mature a little bit and people have earned their rewards, they're redeeming them and the redemptions are now offsetting the deferrals. And so, it will be, we think, in most quarters, it's going to be less than it was early last year when it was in the 30 basis points, 40 basis points. So, like this past quarter, because we also made a little adjustment on our breakage rate on chips and guac, there was no net impact. And so, I think in the future, it's either going to be very little to no net impact. Got it. Thank you. And the next question will come from Chris Carril with RBC. Please go ahead. Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So, you noted the very strong productivity of recent openings. And I think they were described as the highest in company history. I know you mentioned earlier in the context of investment that we shouldn't expect large accelerations in openings. But given these really strong productivity results, does this potentially shift your thinking incrementally at all on development in the near to medium term? Yeah. So, I think we've been sharing this with you guys is, the economic model and the availability of sites for Chipotle continues to be a huge opportunity. And we increased obviously what we're going to build in 2020, and I think we're going to continue – you're going to continue to see us I think accelerate that into the future years for two reasons. One, the economics support it, the customers want it. And then, the second key piece is, I think we now have our operations in a place where we're developing leaders to be ready to take over those restaurants. So, we want to be smart about how we continue to move forward on adding new units. The good news is the returns continue to be great. Our operations are running better. Our people development is in a much better place, and I think it sets the stage for us nicely to continue to grow from where we are right now. So, I see a future where we could get back to the 200 plus restaurants. It's just not going to happen this year. Great. Thanks. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Brian Niccol for any closing remarks. All right. Thanks. And thanks, everybody, for taking the time. Obviously, very proud of Chipotle for delivering what was a great 2019. I think we touched on each of our key strategies.
The thing I just want to emphasize, everybody, is I believe you don't get these results without developing the right culture and the right people and I think that's happening in all facets of our business, whether it's operations, marketing, digital, HR, public affairs.
I do believe we are building out a team that has world-class leaders in all aspects of this company, and those leaders are building a strong culture that's focused on cultivating a better world and developing future leaders, so that these strategies that I believe have a tremendous runway of growth can be executed flawlessly.
So, I do want to say thank you to everybody for a terrific 2019. But as we mentioned earlier, these strategies are not just about 2019. They're about 2020 and well beyond. And we're confident Chipotle is going to continue to be a unique brand that provides a unique experience that will continue to drive and attract great people and a great culture.

And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Brian. Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon everyone. We hope everyone is doing well and staying safe during this unprecedented time. Given the circumstances, we will discuss Q1 results and recent trends in a few minutes, but I want to start by updating you on our response to COVID-19 and its impact on our business.
Let me say upfront how proud and grateful I am to all our employees for their positive attitude and efforts in providing guests access to our safe, delicious, high-quality food made from real ingredients.
I want to thank our supply chain partners who have been dedicated to keeping our restaurants stocked with gloves, hand sanitizer, masks, and other necessary items to keep our employees, food, and customers safe. I also want to thank our supply chain partners who’ve delivered our food with integrity ingredients to every open Chipotle restaurant during these challenging times in a healthy and safe way.
As a result, I am pleased to report that only about 100 restaurants are fully closed at this time. These are mainly inside malls and shopping centers as well as 17 locations in Europe, while the rest of our restaurants remain open for to go and digital order ahead and delivery services, which is critical at a time where food options are limited.
Cultivating a better world takes commitment from all of us, and we are fortunate to have the financial strength to weather this storm. Jack will provide more details, but it's important to note that we remain focused on conserving cash while prudently continuing to invest in several areas that will help us show a strong recovery once guest activity begins to normalize.
Specifically, I want to focus my discussion on three key topics. One, our efforts to take care of our employees, guest, and communities; two, our emerging digital platform; and three, our recent comp trends.
At Chipotle, investing in our people has always been the top priority. After all, they are our greatest asset. Well before COVID-19, we had industry-leading benefits for all employees that include free meals, paid sick leave, crew bonuses, and debt-free degrees as well as mental health benefits and access to a health care concierge service for all employees and their families.
In the weeks since our world quickly changed, we continue to find ways to support our employees personally and financially. We expressed our appreciation for restaurant employees who are willing and able to continue work between March 16th and May 10th with assistance Pay, a 10% increase in hourly rates.
We approved discretionary Q1 bonuses of nearly $7 million to field leaders, general managers, apprentices and eligible hourly employees. We're also providing an additional $2 million in assistance bonuses to general managers and apprentices for their services in April, and we expanded our emergency lead benefits to accommodate those directly affected by COVID-19.
Beyond these benefits, we are working diligently to ensure that we're doing everything possible to keep our guests and employees safe during this time of uncertainty. At Chipotle, food safety is more than a collection of programs and processes. It's part of our DNA. We have a culture of continuous improvement, in which we regularly evaluate our processes to ensure that our customers have consistently excellent experiences.
Over the past few years, we strengthened many of our food safety initiatives, including, wellness checks done before every shift and trained nurses available to evaluate any employee who may feel ill in order to determine whether they should be excluded from work with full pay, installed advanced technology air purification systems to reduce the risk of viruses, supplied Purell sanitizer for employees and guests, mandated handwashing between tasks and at least every hour as well as gloves being won for all tasks, enhanced food preparation and food handling practices designed to reduce food safety risks, improved internal training and education to ensure that all employees thoroughly understand the company's high standards for food safety and food handling, engaged a third-party consultant to perform regular inspections of all restaurants, and finally, creating an independent food safety advisory council comprised of food safety experts to provide ongoing guidance on best practices.
More recently, as the cases of coronavirus started to grow in the U.S., we formed a cross-functional task force that has been holding daily calls. This provides a real-time platform for us to stay current with market trends, regulations and mandates on COVID-19 based on feedback from the CDC, FDA, state and local agencies, as well as ensuring we get frequent updates on our own operations.
This is also allowing us to make quick decisions and navigate these evolving circumstances, including recent additional precautions to safeguard our employees and guests. These include increased sanitization of high-touch, high-traffic areas, providing masks for employees and a tamper-evident packaging seal. Customers can leave instructions in our app and online to request contactless deliveries and carryout. All of these initiatives give our employees and customers' confidence that Chipotle remains steadfast in our commitment to keeping them safe.
We are also doing our part for the community by donating excess food daily to various food banks. We're celebrating National Burrito Day by thanking healthcare heroes with 100,000 free burritos and offering a new gift card program that supports healthcare workers on the front lines.
Chipotle will be donating 10% to Direct Impact an organization working to provide personal protective equipment and essential medical items to healthcare workers through May 31st. In addition, Chipotle is doing a buy one, give one offer for burritos, whereby, Chipotle will donate one burrito to a healthcare worker for every one purchased digitally from April 21st through April 26th, as we continue to support those on the front lines of this crisis.
As I mentioned earlier, the majority of our restaurants are open for to-go orders, which is allowing us to successfully leverage the digital platform we put in place over the past two years. Q1 digital sales grew 81% year-over-year to $372 million. Our highest ever quarterly level, and represented 26.3% of sales.
As people started to implement social distancing, we moved swiftly by driving further investments towards digital and delivery designed to reduce friction, while increasing convenient access.
Although Queso Blanco is off to a terrific start, we reprioritized our marketing efforts by offering free delivery from March 15 to at least early May and shifted from live sports to more online and streaming platforms. We also announced a successful national delivery partnership with Uber Eats that is helping drive new customers and greater frequency.
Collectively, these decisions translated into strong engagement with our guests as evidenced by our March digital sales growing 103% year-over-year and representing 37.6% of sales. A recent survey among current Chipotle consumers suggest that about 15% had Chipoltle delivered for the first time during the last 2 weeks of March based on their desire for fresh ingredients, craveable taste and good value.
We believe this will have a lasting benefit well beyond the current crisis and are pleased to report that we have maintained strong momentum into April with the month-to-date digital mix running in the high 60s.
While, delivery continues to be the fastest-growing part of our digital platform, we are also pleased with our order ahead business, where average daily sales have doubled from the level seen prior to COVID. This is part of the reason that we continue to shift our development pipeline more aggressively towards Chipotlanes, as it helps drive our high-margin digital order ahead transaction.
Another element that is benefiting from the current environment is our rewards program which now has more than 11.5 million enrolled members. Over the past month, daily sign-ups spike nearly fourfold, which is another sign that our digital platform is gaining traction. We are pleased to report that 65% of newly-enrolled rewards members are new to the Chipotle brand, up from 51% pre-COVID.
In addition, 61% of previously store-only rewards members are now new to digital versus 8% pre-COVID. While it's early days, we are starting to leverage this growing install base with personalized promotions to better engage and intent behavior. We are seeing modest transaction increases across all frequency bands and expect this lever to become a bigger driver in the future as we gain greater customer insights while continuing to expand our digital ecosystem.
Lastly, let me provide a few comments on trends during the quarter and thus far, in April. Despite lapping a 9.9% comp in Q1, 2019 we had a tremendous start to 2020 with our comps running at plus 14.4% with nearly 11% transaction growth through the end of February, including a 2% benefit for leap year.
This highlights that our 5 key strategies continue to resonate with guests. And as a reminder, these are: making the brand visible and loved; creating innovations; utilizing a stage gate process; leveraging our digital make line to expand access and convenience; engaging with customers through our loyalty program; and running successful restaurants with a strong culture that provides great food, hospitality, throughput and economics.
We began March on a very positive note, but as COVID-19 restrictions became more prevalent, our comps deteriorated and ended up declining 16% for the month, with the week ending March 29 being the trough at down 35%. This resulted in the Q1 comp being up 3.3%, with transactions down 1.4%, including a 1.3% leap day benefit.
Restaurant level margins were 17.6% and adjusted diluted EPS was $3.08, down 9% year-over-year. April has seen our comps improve with the most recent week adjusted for Easter being in the negative high teens range.
No one can predict the magnitude or duration of this crisis, but we are focused on winning today, while we cultivate a bright future for our employees, guests, communities and shareholders. By staying calm and working collaboratively to leverage our strong brand, business model and balance sheet, we are confident in our ability to get through the current downturn.
In fact, we are continuing to judiciously invest in key areas of our business so that when we come out the other side, we will emerge even stronger.
We know it won't be easy, but Chipotle is well prepared to regain our prior momentum and expand our brand leadership. A recent consumer survey showed that the vast majority of our pre-coronavirus consumers envision coming back to the restaurants at a similar or higher rate than before. As a result, we believe our long-term opportunity to significantly expand the UVs, margins, and store base remains in place.
Thanks once again to all of our employees and partners for their dedication and hard work during these difficult times. We will get through this together and be stronger as a result of the tremendous passion and commitment from everyone.
And lastly, I would be remiss if I didn't offer a heartfelt thank you to the healthcare workers for their heroic efforts on the front lines of this pandemic.
With that, here's Jack to walk you through the financials. Thanks and good afternoon everyone. These are unprecedented times and I could not be more proud of the way all of our people from crew and managers and our restaurants to support teams in the field and all of our support staff in Columbus and Newport Beach, have all stepped up to support each other and do everything possible to help navigate through these challenges.
Unlike typical earnings calls, I will not go through our financials line-by-line, but instead, we'll briefly share how we were performing before the effects of COVID-19, and then turn most of my focus on how we're managing the business to ensure we come out of the crisis stronger than ever.
Our comps through February was 14.4%, which includes nearly 11% transaction growth, including a 2% benefit from Leap Day. Restaurant margin was nearly 22% through February, as our restaurant managers and teams were doing a great job managing the business and leveraging the strong topline to drive good margin flow through.
During the month of March, our weekly comp progression was up 12% for the week ending March 8th, down 4% for the week ending the 15th, and down 34% to 35% for the weeks ending March 22nd and the 29th. Sales improved to around down 30% as we entered April and then improved again over the past week with comps adjusted for Easter in the down high teens range.
The beginning of April, in-store ordering is down around 75%, while delivery is up about 150% and order ahead is up nearly 120%, highlighting the importance of our digital platform and setting us up for a bright future as digital sales tend to be sticky. Digital is currently accounting for nearly 70% of sales.
Given the uncertainty surrounding the impact of COVID-19 on the U.S. economy and on our sales trends, we're withdrawing our previous fiscal 2020 comp guidance. We ended Q1 with $909 million in cash and short-term investments and no debt, which puts us in a strong financial position to navigate this crisis.
As sales fell quickly from the -- from the COVID impact, we proactively began to manage cash outlays to preserve liquidity. The situation is fluid and we constantly reevaluate. We -- here are some of the initiatives we have implemented so far.
While we bought back about $54 million of stock during the quarter, we suspended our buyback program on March 20th, just a few days after our dining rooms were closed and we have no plans to restart the buybacks in the near-term.
In the restaurants, our operators have done a tremendous job adopting to lower sales as they are efficiently managing food ordering, prepping and cooking to minimize waste while ensuring each guest receives a freshly prepared meal. They're effectively scheduling labor hours to accommodate the needs of our crew and shifting hours to support our growing digital business and they're reducing non-essential controllable costs.
As a result, our return or breakeven at a comp of right around down 30% to down 35%, and that excludes recent employee investments, such as the 10% assistance paid for crew and discretionary bonuses for our managers and also excludes the free delivery that we're operating in our app, and these investments have cost us about $20 million for the month.
Outside the restaurants, our supply chain team has been constantly and diligently working with our supply partners to ensure there are no major disruptions. They've done a tremendous job making sure that our restaurants have all the essentials, such as soap, cleaning supplies, gloves and hand sanitizers as well as ensuring our restaurants are stocked with our delicious ingredients.
Pleased to say that we've been able to avoid wide outage while minimizing food waste. We're also in contact with our landlords, about rent deferrals and rent abatements. We are a strong tenant with significant growth ahead of us and we expect our landlords will partner with us during this difficult time period.
On the G&A front, we, of course, halted all non-essential travel, and we're reconsidering the hiring of project consultants, and we're negotiating longer payment terms on the larger contracts. These will help balance preserving cash in the near-term with investing for the long term. Cash G&A is running around $20 million to $25 million per month. And if the recovery takes longer than expected, we have the ability to make additional adjustments as needed.
With regard to CapEx, we're delaying non-essential reinvestments, including deferring all remodels that don't involve a digital make line or the addition of Chipotlane. But we are pulling forward those remodels that involve adding a second make line for the few restaurants that don't already have one, digitizing the second make line in those restaurants that required a remodel to fit the digital make line, and a few remodels where we're able to add a Chipotlane.
Combined with new store construction, which I'll talk more about in a few minutes and our tech investments, our CapEx is running around $30 million to $35 million per month. That being said, we have the flexibility to defer or eliminate much of this CapEx, if needed. But we believe making these investments today will pay off in the long run.
So to recap, our monthly ongoing cash burn is around $50 million to $60 million, assuming we break even at the restaurant level and our G&A and our CapEx is in the range I just described. Encouragingly, if comps can be sustained at the level seen over the past week of down high teens, restaurant cash flow would be in the plus $20 million range so our net cash burn would be cut by about one-third.
While we don't plan to utilize the PPP loan provision of the recently passed CARES Act, we expect to see a liquidity benefit of around $100 million, primarily from deferring social security tax payments and accelerating tax depreciation and previous returns. And how we generated taxable income in Q1, we don't expect to have any related tax liability due to the tax deductions related to option exercises and equity vesting in the quarter.
Finally, although we don't currently need access to the debt markets, we're working on a $250 million to $500 million revolving credit facility with our banking partners to provide us additional access to funding, should it be needed. Even before adding this facility, our balance sheet, along with the carriers, tax deferrals, can sustain us for well over a year. And that assumes our comps are at the down 30% to 35% level where our restaurants breakeven. Last week trend gives us optimism that our comps will continue to improve in the coming months.
Our new unit development pipeline is continuing to build as we remain confident about the long-term opportunity to more than double the Chipotle restaurants in the U.S., and we're already beginning to see an increase in sites available as other businesses have pulled back. This will allow us to opportunistically expand the quantity of sites, while also enhancing the quality of our robust pipeline.
During the quarter, we opened 19 new restaurants with 11 having a Chipotlane. And Chipotlanes continue to have a higher overall digital mix than in recent weeks is approaching 80%. In addition, the mix of higher-margin order ahead and pickup transactions has more than doubled for these restaurants as compared to the pre-COVID time frame.
Our Chipotlanes and opening sales are outpacing non-Chipotlane openings by about 5% to 10% before COVID, they now are higher by over 30%. Our optimism for Chipotlanes is further enhanced by our most recent opening a few weeks ago in Eureka, California. Day one sales of nearly $15,000 was one of the highest opening days of all time. As a result of the continued strong performance of Chipotlanes and less competition for new sites, we will seek even greater proportion of Chipotlanes in our pipeline, which will enhance customer access and convenience, and increase new restaurant sales, margins and returns.
Year-to-date, we have open 28 restaurants with another 49 under construction. However, we have begun to see a construction delays and therefore, have preemptively delayed groundbreaking on the majority of projects in April. So we have a better visibility into when construction will pick-up momentum again, we believe it's prudent to withdraw our prior 2020 new restaurant opening guidance.
Lastly, you may have seen, we signed a deferred prosecution agreement to resolve the DOJ investigation that was previously reported relating to food safety incidents beginning in 2015. The agreement will be impact for three years – in effect for three years, the DOJ agreed to not take further action so long as we comply with the agreement, and pay a $25 million fine, with $10 million being paid on June 1st, and pre-payments of $5 million every 30 days after that first payment. These payments will unfortunately hurt our liquidity a bit, but we're ready to put this old matter behind us.
In closing, despite uncertainty about the near-term impact of COVID-19, our talented and committed teams, the strength of our brand and the resiliency of our economic model gives us the confidence and conviction to make the right long-term investments for our people, for our customers, for our company and for our shareholders. And amid these unprecedented conditions, we will remain focused on not simply managing through the crisis by taking actions that will allow us to emerge even stronger.
I also want to thank all of our extraordinary team members for their commitment during these challenging times. Their efforts are very much appreciated.
With that, we're happy to take your questions. Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today will come from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Thanks. Good evening. Jack, a question for you, you were talking about some cash burn rates, $50 million, but actually might be a-third less than that on a monthly basis at the current comp decline rate. And I think you said something like $30 million to $35 million of CapEx is included in that. So, I guess, does that mean, just roughly speaking, that you're breaking even or a little bit better than that at this sort – from just a pure EBITDA standpoint at the current decline rate that you've seen lately? And I have a quick follow-up. Yeah, that's right, David. So if you look at the sales for the last week, and listen, we'd love for that to be the trend for us to improve from there. But if we just hold it at the trend we're seeing from the last week, which is down in the high-teens we earned cash flow at the restaurant level about $20 million. Our G&A is in the $20 million to $25 million range. So you're absolutely right. Before CapEx, we're right about at EBITDA breakeven. And just to quick question on your – on the coastal areas, those urban centers. You can imagine certain parts of the country are particularly hard hit right now. Are you seeing a pretty widespread in the type of comp decline that you're seeing? Or is that mitigated by something more of a disruption among the competitive set in those areas than whatever you're doing digitally? Thanks. David, it is a wide range of comp out there. As you can imagine, the Northeast, has been hit the hardest; parts of the middle of the country are much further ahead in terms of the recovery, and so it gives us great optimism that we can see our way out of it and get towards and then eventually into positive territory from a comp standpoint. Thank you. Thanks, David. And the next question will come from Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Thanks. I have a follow-up on a separate question. So, the follow-up is just on the question of, sort of, disparities in your comp trends. Our sense is that things like day part mix or off-premise versus on and also things like urban versus suburban, are determining a lot of what's happening in terms of the recovery. Can you remind me, sort of, what your sales mix might have looked like before this, whether it's lunch or dinner? Or what percentage of your stores are in urban markets versus suburban? I'm just trying to get a sense of how much of this is just a function of what the business looks like beforehand versus anything unique to the brand? And then one other question, please. So I'll start, Jack, and then you can chime in. So, obviously, Chipotle had a pretty good split between lunch and dinner, pre this crisis. We're definitely seeing a little bit of an uptick in our dinner business, or dinner occasion with a little downtick in the lunch occasion. And I think that's driven by just the natural consumer behavior of people not going out and about.
The positive is the digital experience, I think, has introduced people to a new behavior and a new occasion for Chipotle, which is solving that occasion for a family meal or dinner that historically maybe they already had Chipoltle for lunch and they haven't considered us for that.
So we're seeing a slight pivot just in more dinner occasion and with a little decline in the lunch occasion. And a lot of that, I think, is driven by just the situation of people being sheltered at home. And then also the ease at which the digital occasion, both contactless pickup as well as the contactless delivery. And I think one of the things that's also driving all this, order ahead, growth because people are just realizing how easy and contactless, the order ahead experience is, which is showing up in the Chipotle execution as well as using our mobile pickup channels.
And then on your question about suburban versus urban. And one of the strengths of Chipotle is our suburban footprint. Frankly, really, the whole concept started from a suburban standpoint. And that continues to be a strength. And frankly, one of the things that's worked out really well is as we brought on partners, whether it's DoorDash or Uber Eats, we've really spent a lot of time making sure they had coverage in the suburban markets.
And then, obviously, we have a presence in urban markets as well. And not surprising, as Jack mentioned, the Northeast or the New York is more -- is a laggard as a region, relative to what we're seeing in our other regions on the recovery. But we're seeing a lot of positive things happening in our digital business. It will be very interesting to see, as we are given the opportunity to start to open our dining rooms here in the next, call it, weeks or a month, how we're able to continue to keep people engaged in our delivery business, our digital business. Because the one thing that, hopefully, you picked up in here is our rewards database just went from eight million to almost 12 million. And that's going to be a very valuable asset, I think, going forward as we work through the recovery.
Jack, I don't know if there's anything to add? No, I think you covered it really well, Brian. Thanks. Okay. Thanks. Very helpful. Just both of you were in the industry back during the global financial crisis. If you think back then, would you anticipate as we come out of this -- there's a silver lining, possibly better opportunities on real estate or maybe some of the capacity come out? I was just curious what your institutional memory might tell you about what we look at like on the other side? Yes. Look, great question. I think this is really the strength of our brands, our balance sheet and our digital business is going to, I think, set us up very nicely on the opportunities that present themselves as we get to the other side of this. The obvious opportunities, I think, are some things we've already talked about.
We're not shying away from sites and our ability to get the sites that we believe are best for our future digital business and our Chipotlanes. And then I also think just very much being on trend with people having access to real wholesome nutritious food is going to continue to be at the forefront of good health.
And I think good health and well-being is going to be an even more important trend in the consumer psyche going forward. And I think we're very well positioned in the fast casual category and the brand in the fast casual category to get people access to that higher quality food with integrity in the access and the experience that they want, which is the least amount of friction with arguably the least amount of contact. And we're well positioned for all those things.
And then the strength of our balance sheet and the strength, frankly of how we're able to flow every incremental dollar allows us to invest in future real estate, future sites, future digital, and we're optimistic once we get to the other side of this. Thank you. And our next question will be from Katherine Fogertey with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Great. Thank you. I wanted to touch base on menu innovation. It's not something that was really brought up too much on the call today, but how you're thinking about the forward here? And in particular, as we're looking at the consumer here, the financial impact that virus has had on the consumer, where are the opportunities you think to grow check or potentially even take share just given your price point relative to the competition? Thank you. Sure. So look, we are still big believers in our menu program. I think we've talked about this. We saw opportunity in beverage we still believe there is an opportunity in beverage for us to have. Beverages with same type of commitment to organic, no artificial ingredients, less sugar, the juices. So you're going to see us continue to push into beverages.
And then the case of Blanco launch, I got to tell you was -- it was coming out of the gates as evidenced by where our comps were, right, in January and February, it was getting huge positive feedback. Our teams were loving it, the customers were loving it, and I think there's an opportunity still to reengage people in case of Blanco once we get past this.
And then we're still working hard at bringing back carne asada. And then there's a few other things that are going through our stage gate process, which we've had to delay just because this is not the environment where you can go test and the restaurants to really understand consumer experience, operational experience.
But we have some early reads on this, and we feel really good about being on trend with different meats, different grains, I think what we've always talked about it is we want to meet customers' requests. So we're testing the quesadilla, but we also want to leave consumers to higher quality food or different food experiences, and that's why you see us talking about things like briskets and color flour rice and so on and so forth.
So, consumer sentiment hasn't changed on the desire for those things. We just have to make sure we do it at the right time because we want to come back operationally strong with the core business before we start adding some of those things. That's helpful. And then just one follow-up here on commodity. We've seen a lot of deflation across the entire universe. Is there any opportunity for you guys to lean in and lock in some contracts? What's the environment like here? And how can you kind of kind of leverage this current backdrop? Thank you. Yes. Katy, on the commodities, it's likely to be a favorable commodity scenario going forward. We deal with a lot of small farmers. And so generally, we don't have a great opportunity to lock in like you would if you were buying the commodity meats, for example.
Although we definitely think that there's going to be a time for us to be able to support our farmers in a way where we can bring not only strong demand, but hopefully growing demand as well. And we think that will lead to favorable pricing. But in terms of locking in, that's not likely.
The only wildcard, as usual for us, is avocados. And we'll see this should be a favorable or pretty favorable year for us, but we'll see how demand and supply match up. And hopefully, this will be a more normal year since we've had two or three or four years now in a row of pretty volatile avocado cost. Great. Thank you. And our next question will be from David Tarantino of Baird. Please go ahead. Hi, good afternoon. I hope everyone is doing well. My first question is on just the commentary around real estate and recognizing that you do have the enviable position of a good balance sheet that you might be able to take advantage of some opportunities.
Just wondering if you could maybe comment further on how you're envisioning the rate of growth exiting the crisis that we're seeing now. Do you think there's opportunity to accelerate the pace of unit growth maybe in 2021, 2022, however you want to answer that? Yes. Look, David, I think there's going to be an opportunity for us for two reasons because I think we've made tremendous progress on the people front. So, our turnover has really come down over the last, call it, year. So, we have more stability with our leaders. And then I also think, in the environment, we're going to have the ability to recruit and retain even more people going forward, which will really set us up nicely for an acceleration in development.
And I think we've always talked about it. We just want to take a very measured approach to how we accelerate that growth because we want to open the restaurants with great teams, great experiences and great financials. And -- but this will definitely present an opportunity where I think our pipeline will get bigger. And we'll present the opportunity for us to staff them and run them really well so that we can continue to accelerate our growth plan. Got it. And then the second question I have is related to operations. And I guess how do you envision the operations working in your format in the world of social distancing on the other side of this as you open up your dining room I guess, what steps are you taking? And do you think you'll see throughput constraints come back as you try to maintain social distancing on the line as an example? Yes. So, obviously, this is something we've been spending a lot of time on. And frankly, this morning, we spent a lot of time on it. We're going to make sure that we provide all the indicators in the restaurant so that the customer has the confidence what they're supposed to do to maintain the social distance, as well as our team members. But look, you're going to see our team members wearing masks, you're going to see our team members wearing gloves, you're going to see a team member in the dining room that's sanitizing tables and high-traffic areas. The hand sanitizer will be in the dining room. We probably will have to move things off of the drink station and make sure that we have a little bit more control of that, so that those things are clean and sanitized the way that we would want them to be, so that every person that gets a drink or grabs a Tabasco bottle can have confidence.
But look, think the one thing that is great about our business is our customers that come in the restaurant they know how to order a Chipotle. And they're part of the process to move down that line quickly, as much as our employees are part of the process to move down that line quickly. And I – I think the combination of our digital business getting up to the 60%, 70% of sales. I think we're going to hang on to as much of that as we possibly can, while we build back our dine-in business. And I think over time, some of these restrictions or behaviors will migrate back to the way it used to be. But the good news is our model is very durable in this environment for when we actually are able to open the dining room. But we're going to be very specific on the actions we've taken in the restaurant to give people the confidence that they're having a healthy experience. But in the near term, it's going to be something that we're going to have to learn our way through. And I'm confident Scott and his leaders will do a great job of managing the dining room reopening. Great. Thank you. The next question will be from Andrew Charles of Cowen. Please go ahead. Great. Thanks. In a normalized environment, marketing and promotional expense typically runs about 3% of sales. And given the headwinds the sales that we're seeing throughout the industry, philosophical, are you looking to pare back spending in aim to run 3% marketing expense off the lower base of 2020 sales? Or are you looking to maintain kind of a similar $180 million to $190 million budget that you had at the beginning of the year? I'm thinking about in the context that, obviously, the shift from live sports to streaming platforms is less expensive advertising, but I would imagine this probably gets offset by subsidizing delivery fees for the foreseeable future. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you kind of hit the nail on the head. What I think Chris and the team are really focusing on is every dollar we spend in the marketing is how do we maximize the return for the environment we're in. And I think the team has done a phenomenal job of it, pivoting away from traditional television, frankly, and moving more towards delivery incentives around delivery, and then also using platforms social, digital. I love how the guys quickly pivoted to like Chipotle together, right? These are things that we were the first ones doing, because I think Chris and the team are very much in tune with where the consumer is. And where young people want to experience their brands and how they want to experience the brand.
So we're going to spend to do those things. And whether the absolute dollars end up being a little different, probably. But really, what we're focused on is getting the return so that we feel good about the dollars that we're investing, and we see that showing up, obviously, in both the top line and then the bottom line. So very proud of where we are and how we pivoted our spending. And I think, we'll continue to see us lead in this space. That's great. And then just my follow-up question is that, you guys disclosed a high 60%, almost 70% digital mix of sales so far in April. How does that mix of sales differ between carryout and delivery relative to what the – relative to the digital carryout and delivery mix before COVID-19? Is it safe to say that you're seeing delivery sales now represent the majority of the digital sales for the most recent week? No. What I would tell you is, delivery definitely those first couple weeks in March really took off. But over the last couple of weeks, we have seen order ahead, frankly, catch up and – as our digital business has just grown in totality.
And so the mix prior to COVID, we're seeing a slight change in – I would say the biggest change is our catering business went away. And as a result, what we've seen is really kind of delivery be a little bit more of the leader with order ahead not far behind, but both are hugely, hugely up. That’s great. Thanks guys. The next question will be from Nicole Miller with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Thank you. Good afternoon. I appreciate the update. I wanted to dig into the April, let's say, less worse environment, quite a big jump. There is probably now a half dozen restaurant companies that have the statement. What do you think is happening on the consumer behavior side? Because it seems like right now and going forward, it's all going to be about what the behavior is now and then the tipping point to see it changes. So I'd be curious on really just what the heck to think is going on? Is it so start crazy or advertising is kicking in? What do you think might be causing that? Well, look, I think there's a couple of things; one, I think all the pantry loading behavior has slowed down. And I think also people have worked through their pantries. And I think also people realized they bought a lot of things that they end up having to throw away. And I think there's fatigue in cooking.
So combine that with the fact that also tax refunds and stimulus money is starting getting into the hands of people. And I think people were like, you know what, I've got the additional cash, I've worked through my pantry loading and I think it's time to break the routine of me cooking and being a little stir crazy and let's reach out for restaurants to solve the solution.
So I think that's just the fundamental to set up right now, which is most stimulus money in the hands of customers. And then the pantry loading behavior, I think, has really slowed down dramatically and they've worked through all the goods that they purchased in their pantries. That's helpful. And so just a follow-up and last question on that point, to what degree can this serve as a proxy for the recovery? So if I think about Chipotle in '15 and in '16, what happened then as you perfectly positioned as you've been outlining for the last hour basically, to take this head on?
So I think back to that time, I would say that probably impaired the brand to some degree, was dilutive to the brand equity to some degree, specific to your brand, obviously. But that's not the case, everyone's being treated equally. So is this more like a remodel pattern? I guess, the real question is, everybody is, I guess, in the same boat, you close, reopen. And the question is how long to get back to the prior run rate? Yes. Look, here's what I would tell you is, I'm very excited about the opportunity to get our dining arms reopen. I'm very excited about leveraging all the digital gains we've made. And then I'm also very optimistic about our ability to operate once the dining room is open.
We have our digital business running next to us in an environment where we're working with elevated wellness practices, elevated food safety practices, because these are all things that we've been doing for years now that a lot of people are just starting to adopt. So I think we're always going to be the ones that will look to figure out what we can do next on wellness and food safety. But I'm very confident about our operators being able to operate in that environment.
And then I'm very optimistic about what will happen as the phased, kind of, reopening of the economies goes into effect because I think we're going to hang on to a lot of our gains, digitally. And a lot of the gains we've made culturally and operationally as we reopen these dining rooms.
But look, that timetable, I think, is going to be driven very much about when the economy gets reopened so that people can start experiencing dining rooms and the full access of restaurants. So -- but it looks like that's going to start loosening up here over the next month or two. Thank you. And the next question will be from John Glass of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Thanks very much. First, Jack, if I can just follow-up on the restaurant margin question you answered earlier about the cash consumption or the cash breakeven. What does that translate back into? If comps are down high teens, what is the percent restaurant margin that that translates into? And is unusual about that number I noticed you talked about? Is it fully loaded with the rent, for example? I think there was some increase in wages. On the other hand, maybe you don't -- I don't know if you're fully staffed restaurants. What's unusual in the current restaurant margin? Yeah. John, I don't even have handy, what percentage of sales that would be. It's still a very low margin. If we're still down in the down teens, it's still bumpy line item by line item. Our teams have done a great job of managing the business for the lower volume, but we're not going to cut our staffing too short so that when the surge happens. The more people come in and the orders start to rise, we want to be ready for that. I think the point there is just that we can get breakeven at the 30, 35. We're hoping this is a new trend. And so it reduces our cash burn by a lot.
What I would tell you we're thinking about is when we think about what happens when the dining rooms reopen and we start to build back our dining room business. And as Brian mentioned, keep as much of our digital, we feel like we'll be able to get back to the margins we are running before as we get back to that run rate. We were at a better than $2.2 million, our AUV on our way to $2.3 million. And we're already showing through February, which January and February are not great margin months, and we're already at 22%.
So we know when we get back to those volumes, the $2.2 million, and then on our way back to $2.3 million. That's the kind of margins you could expect us to deliver. But we're still down in the high teens. It's still going to be a single-digit kind of margin, John, but it's something that reduces the cash burn and allows us to make the right investments for the long-term. That's very helpful. And just a follow-up, you mentioned in the release, the Cares Act tax benefits were about $100 million. Is that all inside of 2019 and is that all expressed through the tax rate? Was there some of that in this quarter? And how do we think about how those benefits flow over the next quarters or year? It's all this year, John, but it's all cash basis. So none of it is earnings basis. So, for example, it's a deferral of things like self security taxes. We're going to have to pay those beginning next year, but it saves us cash this year and we need it the most. And then there's depreciation resets that we get for 2018 and 2019. And so from a book basis, there's no change at all because the book depreciation doesn't change, but our tax depreciation does. So it will affect our cash flow. It will affect our deferred taxes, will not affect our earnings margins or EPS. Got it. Thank you. And our next question will be from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer & Company. Please go ahead. Thanks. Appreciate the question. With digital trends now at 70% of sales, I assume they're not going to remain that high when we're through this virus, but they're probably going to remain pretty sticky, which means your delivery business is probably going to remain a much bigger part of your business moving forward. Is there a tipping point where you potentially think about mixing in some of your own delivery drivers? Or can you just talk a little bit more about the strategy for delivery if it becomes that large of a business? Thanks. Yes. So, obviously, we're optimistic that we'll hang on to both our order ahead business as well as the delivery business. And -- but specifically to your question on delivery, I think the reality is it works off our digital make line, which sets us up for a very different walk on how we get to the margins we get through our delivery business.
And what we have said is, look, as partners potentially change commission rates or you see various economic impacts on it. There's just a general understanding with the folks we work with, where it's like, look, we need to make money at it, you need to make money at it, and we'll figure out how we make this work.
And fortunately, for us, our food works very well in the delivery occasion, our customer has had positive feedback on the experience and the partners that we have are very willing to have the right dialogue and be transparent with each other so that we can make the channel work for each other.
So we're going to take a very smart approach to it, where it should be still viewed as a positive to have this occasion for the Chipotle business. And that's the approach we're going to take, and we'll continue to be transparent with our partners as we work through this. Thanks. Appreciate all the color, Brian. Sure. The next question is from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Hi. Good afternoon. Hoping you could touch on the restaurant level labor situation and how difficult recruitment might be in this environment or a turnover has been trending? And then separately, Jack, it sounds like you've kind of implied this, but are there any structural cost changes to the model coming out of this? Well, I'll take the labor thing, and then I can hand it over to you, Jack, on the structural question. Okay. But on the labor side of things, I think this is really where we're seeing the power of our purpose and our culture, because we're seeing turnover actually improve. We're seeing fewer people walking away from Chipotle. We're also seeing people that are with us, very proud to be with us.
And I think we've been very purposeful in executing against what we believe are our values and the right thing to do. And as a result, our restaurant managers, our restauranteurs, these folks have more tenure with us than we ever have. And they're excited about the opportunity of the new restaurants we're going to open, and they're excited about how Chipotle is going to get to the other side of this. So, I think we will -- based on the communication we've had with our employees. They've been very, very, very supportive of the Chipotle business, the Chipotle culture, and each other. And I think we're very fortunate that way.
And I think going forward, we're going to be a place that people are going to want to work and so and we're going to be a place where people are going to be able to grow. And I think that's going to attract the right talent so that we can grow our business effectively.
On the structural stuff, I'll pass it over to Jack, but we don't see that doesn't seem to be a headwind. But over to you, Jack. Yes, I don't think so, Sharon. There's going to be stuff in the short-term, like when the dining rooms reopen, and we're actively talking about what exactly that means, and we're going to have to follow everything that's happening in the state and the local jurisdictions and the like. But it's likely for some period of time, we'll have an extra person in the dining room just to make sure the customers see that we're constantly cleaning that if they have questions about social distancing or what have you, there's somebody there. So, there's likely to be some extra cost for a while.
On the other hand, with a higher digital we know that our digital business is more efficient, it takes less labor on that digital make line to serve as many customers. And so we're, in fact, seeing efficiencies in that. We're seeing that we're using less labor to deliver some of the sales that we have to add hours for in the past. So, I think there's pushes and pulls.
I think when we get fully to the end of this, past the transition and let's say, a year from now or something like that; I don't think there's going to be any meaningful structural cost. I think our model will be fully intact. But it will be a little bit bumpy when we get -- as we get from here to there. And our next question will come from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Hi, thank you. A couple of clarifications, if I may. First, were the 100 restaurants that were closed, temporarily closed, included or excluded in the same-store sales commentary? They're-- They're included? Included. Okay, perfect. And then secondly, 30% of your sales being non-digital, were 100% of your restaurants, I mean, I guess, could they serve non-digital transactions? Were there any examples in any markets where the stores had to be 100% digital, I guess, by market mandate or what have you? Or were you able to keep all the restaurants open for that not non-digital so far? Yes, we had a couple of hundred where we were purely digital. I think it's like 200 or 300 range. But otherwise, the balance of the system, we're still able to do come in and carry out. And did you learn anything from any of those fully digital restaurants? I mean, is that -- I mean do you think you could have done more of those restaurants and still even taking up the digital mix even higher? I mean what type of experience or learnings that you get from digital-only restaurants, which, obviously, were also cashless as well. Yes. So, look, 1 of the things that's definitely true is the in-restaurant experience still provides another level of customization, which people still appreciate for a certain occasion. We still have great customization in our digital app and on the website. But look, if you want to build that little extra mile of customization, that's something you get from an in-store experience.
So, that would probably be the biggest thing that we've noticed is some of our heaviest users or loyal users really appreciate having access to the dining room. But the good news is they're getting experience with our app now. And they're realizing – and you'll see us do this going forward. We're going to, I think, educate people more on how they can customize via the app and the web, because there's a lot of very simple practices on – if you want to put your sauce on the side, it's easy. If you want to do half and half, easy. And people still are getting used to how they do their customization. But I would say the biggest learning is our people that are very loyal to the idea of coming into the restaurant and getting their Chipotle their way, and that makes us unique. So that’s it. Definitely, yes. it's an obvious difference. And the final kind of question. In terms of reopening the dining room, I mean, what type of – what will you look for in the marketplace? I mean, obviously, some governors, Georgia being one or kind of vary ahead of the curve in terms of kind of getting people back out, others for different and obvious reasons, kind of on the other spectrum, but in a lot of local markets, mayors themselves are making decisions. So I mean, is there – do you want to open entire states at a time, markets at a time? And when you kind of think about reopening your dining rooms, even with a lot of social distancing are probably in place. And what are you looking for the permission to go out and start to reopen that full experience? Yes. So look, I think this is going to be a by restaurant approach for us. And this is one of the things that I think is terrific about us being all company owned. We have the flexibility and the capability to do it. So we've got a very – we're very fortunate, too. We've got a leader of food safety and wellness, Kerry Bridge is her name.
She's very tied in right now with the CDC and the FDA. And she's tracking for us and having those conversations so that as the government and the science and the data comes in, we can be best informed so that we can provide a healthy experience, both for our customer and our crews.
And we're going to execute this restaurant-by-restaurant because I think what we're seeing is this virus is very much proving to be very different depending on where you are in the country. And fortunately, we're set up where we have the capability to open that way, our dining rooms. And I think we have the people capability to execute it in the restaurant, and we have the people capability to get the right information. So we make smart decisions as we reopen. Thank you so much. Yes. The next question will be from Jon Tower with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Awesome. Thanks. I hope everybody is okay. Just a few on the Chipotlanes. And frankly, just thinking about this business going forward. In terms of – you mentioned earlier, the idea that real estate is opening up, and you're getting access to potentially better sites. Are you also thinking that you may have potentially better rents going forward? And then on top of that, historically, you've shied away from the idea of owning any real estate, but clearly, you've got a fairly strong cash balance. Does that cash balance and potentially, real estate prices dropping, make it more attractive to move towards that ownership structure? And then I got another one after that, please? Yes. Listen, good question. It's likely that rents are going to relax a little bit. Now we typically go after A sites and A trade areas. Those tend to hold their value, their rent values more than if you're going to go to a B or C location. But I would still think when there's less competition out there that we're going to see relaxed rents.
The thing that I think we're most excited about is, where landlords might have been resistant to add a Chipotlane in the past like picture and cap and then a landlord having to redo the whole circulation around that property because we've asked for a Chipotlanes.
While they might have resisted that a bit in the past, we're not seeing much resistance of that anymore. The fact that we're looking to go into a site, we're continuing to grow that's what we're most excited about.
But we do think we'll be able to get more sites, higher quality sites, more Chipotlanes, and I would expect that the rents would be – should be at least incrementally more attractive. We've never really been against buying. If there's an opportunity to buy a site, we typically are going after going into somebody else's building. So we don't do a lot of free standards.
We do, do free standards, they're often on the pad of a shopping center. And typically, the landlord or developer, they like to keep those. But I have to tell you, if a developer is cash poor and they're looking to sell a site and if the price is right, we'll certainly be there and we're willing to definitely buy that land. So we can lock in our occupancy costs forever. Great. And then just on the Chipotlane following that line of thinking, you had mentioned, I think, previous calls, greater than 55% of the development was going to be tied to Chipotlane and for 2020, at least, in thinking about the where that can move for the balance of this year and next year?
Are we talking about this being a higher run rate going forward in terms -- as a percentage of the mix? And are we talking somewhere between 80% to 90% of new stores being in that Chipotlane format? Definitely going to be higher, 80% to 90% might be a little high because we still do open up in some storefronts and some urban areas as well. But it's definitely going to be higher than the 50% to 60%. In fact, we're even seeing that deals that we've already done or have mostly done.
We go back and say, hey, by the way, we talked about that Chipotlane and you weren't that crazy about it, what do you think about it now? And we're getting landlords to say, you know what, if you're still willing to go to the site, we'll do it, right.
I do think for this year, you'll see the percentage of Chipotlanes inch up. And then I think for next year, I think you'll see a stair-step, I don't know that 80% or 90% is realistic, but certainly higher than 60% and maybe north of 70% as well. But we'll see. So far, the reaction from the landlords has been good. So we're very, very optimistic. Great. Thank you. Stay healthy everybody. Thank you. And the next question will be from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Please go ahead. Great. Thank you very much. First, Jeff, just a clarification on the restaurant margin conversation we talked about earlier. It's obviously hard to read the most recent trends, but still think it's fair to assume that $100,000, equating to 200 basis points of margin? Or is it in the short to medium-term that there are going to be some structural headwinds that would make that a little bit harder to achieve, even if you do think that – I think you said ultimately, you do think that those two numbers would once again go lock step together? Yes. I think long term, we're 100% on that same page that when we get back to, call it, $2.2 million, we could be at 22. And then every $100,000 of volume, you can get an extra 100 basis points of margin. I just think between now and then, it's going to be bumpy.
It's going to be bumpy because there's going to be dislocations throughout the country and how the recovery happens, it's not always perfect when you add volume or pause on volume that you get the right response in terms of the labor management, the management of food and waste and things like that.
And listen, we're not going to go crazy over that as we navigate through this recovery. But I think once you get through the recovery, I think our earnings power, our margin power is going to be fully intact. Got it. And with that said, as we – I know you withdrew your 2020 guidance, which seems prudent. But as we think about 2020 and 2021 modeling, I know it's difficult at this point. But from a sensitivity standpoint, how do you think about each point of comp or each 100 basis point of margin in terms of a framework to think about earnings over the next year or so? Yeah. I'd tell you, I just wouldn't -- I wouldn't want to lock into what the next few quarters are going to be. If you want to look a year ahead and let's look at when there's either a virus or anti-virals, and the economy is back and humming again. I think we're fully back to the 100,000, equals 100 basis points.
I think in the interim, I think it's just too hard. And listen, it's going to be bumpy. I mean, EPS is not going to be that predictable. And so what is going to be predictable is the investments we're going to make. We're going to make them in our people. We're going to be able to make investments in our future.
In terms of real estate, we're going to make sure that from an employment brand, from a customer brand and from the investments we're making for the future, that we're going to do all the right things.
In terms of EPS in the short-term for the next few quarters, just be ready for that to be bumpy. But I think the investments we're going to make and the impact that we're having, positive impact we're having on our brand, I think, creates a bright future for us beyond that. Understood. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Brian Niccol for any closing remarks. Yeah. Thank you. And thank you, everybody, for taking the time to discuss our current situation in the Chipotle business. I want to just first reiterate what I said at the beginning. A huge thank you and gratefulness to all our employees and supplier partners that are keeping the Chipotle experience up and running in our communities. Couldn't be prouder of the way we have handled this in the way that our culture has really shown itself. So very proud of everyone and frankly, very humbled by seeing all of it.
The other thing I will leave you all with is, and we've kind of talked about this throughout the whole Q&A. We're very fortunate that the Chipotle brand is as strong as it is, compounded by a very strong balance sheet with, I think, very smart investments that we made on the digital side, as well as on our operations and food safety culture.
And I think that just sets us up to navigate the current situation at hand. And I look forward to getting back to achieving the results we had frankly in January and February, once we get past this crisis.
And I'm confident that, as Jack mentioned, we're going to be very prudent on managing our cash, but we're also going to be very smart about investing in the Chipotle proposition for the future. So thank you again everybody. Hopefully, everyone in families and friends are healthy and safe out there, and I look forward to talking to all of you in the future. Best. Take care. Thank you, sir.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ashish Kohli, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Hello, everyone and welcome to our second quarter 2020 earnings call. By now, you should have access to our earnings press release. If not, it maybe found on our Investor Relations website at ir.chipotle.com.
I will begin by reminding you that certain statements and projections made in this presentation about our future business and financial results constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management’s current business and market expectations and our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Please see the risk factors contained in our annual report on Form 10-K and in our Form 10-Qs for a discussion of risks that may cause our actual results to vary from these forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found via the link included on the presentation page within the Investor Relations section of our website.
We will start today’s call with prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer, after which we will take your questions. Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A session.
And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Brian. Thanks, Ashish and good afternoon, everyone. Since our last earnings call, the world has continued to face unprecedented challenges with regard to health, economic and social issues. However, I am so proud of our employees those in the field managing and running our restaurants, our support center staff who are working remotely, as well as our supply partners for coming together to continue to provide our safe, delicious, high-quality food made from real ingredients. As a result, Chipotle is successfully delivering on its commitment to help cultivate a better world for our employees, guests, farmers, communities and shareholders.
Today, I want to focus my discussion on three key topics. First, our efforts to take care of our people and guests as restaurants reopen for in-room dining; second, provide details on our improving comp trends; and third, highlight how we have built an operating model that’s designed to generate strong performance in a wide variety of environments such that we can win today while we create a bright future. As I have mentioned previously, the health and well-being of our employees and guests has always been and will continue to be our top priority. Given our strong financial position, we are able to make investments in our people and the Chipotle business, which are not only helping us manage through this crisis, but set us up for a strong recovery and future success.
Our top priorities for the rest of the year include safely running our restaurants and reopening dining rooms, using best practices to support alternative restaurant support center working arrangements, ensuring supply chain consistency and strengthening our digital ecosystem. Within our restaurants, we have taken a number of steps to enhance our robust food safety and wellness protocols, including the creation of the steward role, which is focused on sanitization in high-touch and high traffic areas, providing mats for all employees and having a tamper evident packaging seal for all digital orders. We are also delighted to see many of our guests doing their part by wearing masks, socially distancing and where appropriate, leaving instructions in our app and online to request contactless deliveries and carryout. These initiatives give our employees and guests confidence that Chipotle remains steadfast in our commitment to keeping them safe, especially now that the dining rooms are starting to reopen.
As of last week, about 30 restaurants remain fully closed and these are mainly inside malls and shopping centers. We began to open dining capabilities in the middle of May and currently have about 85% of our restaurants offering limited in-restaurant and/or patio dining, with the remaining being open for to-go services, which includes delivery, order-ahead and pickup and coming into the restaurant and ordering a meal that is taken then off-premise. Encouragingly, since sales dropped in late March, we have been able to retain 70% to 80% of our digital sales gains, while recovering 40% to 50% of our in-store sales. This supports our thesis that digital tends to be highly sticky and was a key factor in helping improve our sales performance as the quarter progressed.
Our Q2 comp was down 9.8%, which includes a 1.9% headwind from closed restaurants. Our restaurant level margins were 12.2% and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.40, down 90% year-over-year. In terms of monthly comp cadence, April was down 24%, with May being down 7% and then June showing further progress to finish up 2%. July comps continue to improve and are up 6.4% month-to-date, including about a 1.4% positive impact from the July 4 weekend and about a 2.7% negative impact due to underperforming restaurants in the northeast and international markets as well as restaurants closures due to COVID-19. And keep in mind, we are comparing against the nearly 10% positive comp in July of 2019. Overall, these trends highlight that despite these unprecedented conditions, our five key strategies continue to resonate with guests and position us for success in the near-term as well as giving us more confidence in doubling our restaurant base, while ultimately expanding AUVs and margins above $2.5 million and 25% respectively.
Let me spend the rest of my time providing brief update on each of these strategies, which are making the brand visible and loved, creating innovations utilizing a stage-gate process, leveraging our digital make line to expand access and convenience, engaging with customers through our loyalty program, and running successful restaurants with a strong culture that provides great food, hospitality, throughput and economics. To begin with, our marketing team has been remarkably agile and proactive during the crisis by quickly pivoting from traditional television advertising to creative social and digital media to help keep the Chipotle brand relevant and drive awareness of our digital capabilities, whether it be healthcare heroes to support frontline workers, lifestyle goals to keep people healthy, while working from home for virtual events such as proms, concerts, e-gaming tournaments, and the virtual farmers market. These initiatives are helping support our customers, suppliers and communities in the time of need. These efforts continue to drive awareness, expand access and grow sales by driving culture, driving difference and ultimately driving a purchase.
In conjunction with marketing, our stage-gate process is a key enabler to develop innovation that leads food culture and meets guest requests. Over the last 18 months, lifestyle bowls, carne asada, Supergreens salad mix and Queso Blanco were all successfully validated by this process. Despite less marketing support than initially planned, our new Queso, which uses 13 real ingredients and has just the right spice level and texture, has been a hit with guests. Our current attach rate of high-teens is roughly 70% higher than with the previous Queso. The latest innovation to make it through the stage-gate process and upgrading existing item is a suite of tractor beverages. These are organic, non-GMO, less sugary and aligned well with our food with integrity ethos. We received terrific customer feedback and expect these to help improve our drink incidents moving forward.
While COVID of course has delayed testing menu items over the past few months, the pipeline of potential new options continues to build. Now, that regions are starting to reopen, we anticipate being able to test new items again, which will allow us to deliver on our goal of rolling out 1 to 2 new menu items on average per year. To give you a couple of examples, we have recently launched a pilot to test cilantro lime, cauliflower rice and began offering quesadillas as a digital-only entree, which we believe can overcome the throughput challenge presented on the frontline. These menu items are in various markets where we are gaining valuable guest and operational feedback. We will update you on our progress of all potential new menu items as they move through our stage-gate process.
Next, our digital platform has been a big beneficiary of the current environment. Order to digital sales from 216% year-over-year to $829 million which is by far our highest ever quarterly level and represented 61% of sales. Working from home, driving increased digital awareness via advertising, new delivery partnerships with Uber Eats and GrubHub as well as expanding our digital capabilities into Canada are attracting new customers and helping reduce friction, while increasing convenient access. Notably, partnering with all the major third-party delivery aggregators has led to an increase in orders, a reduction in delivery time and cancellations and an improvement in overall customer ratings. As you know, all digital orders from Chipotle are fulfilled via our digital kitchens, which are comprised of a dedicated make-line and operated by a special team in nearly all Chipotle locations. Recent digital investments such as pepper, our concierge spot on Facebook Messenger, group ordering and complete customization are further optimizing a seamless ordering experience for our guests.
Even with in-restaurant dining opening back up, we continue to see strong digital sales momentum in July, with a mix of nearly 50%. Breaking this down further shows that a little more than half is coming from order-ahead and pickup transactions, while the remainder is coming from delivery, both channels continue to perform well, but we are pleased that order-ahead is now our fastest grower due partly to being less promotional on delivery, partly to more customers realizing the value of a pickup transaction, as are no delivery fees, and to a lesser extent, more Chipotles. With free-delivery promotions likely to be less frequent moving forward and as pivoting more aggressively towards Chipotles, we are optimistic that the order-ahead transaction will continue to be a big driver of future growth, which should benefit both sales and margins.
Another element that has seen a meaningful acceleration over the past few months is our Rewards program, which now has nearly 15 million enrolled members, what an amazing accomplishment considering this program was launched only 15 months ago. The rate of enrollment has roughly doubled during the COVID crisis as customers flocked to Chipotle’s digital ordering channels. Today, the question I hear most frequently is how are we going to benefit from this? Interestingly, even in the early stages of utilizing the customer data, we are seeing a significantly higher frequency of transactions from members versus non-members. Its early days, but we are starting to leverage this growing installed base with personalized promotions to incent behaviors, especially considering more than 70% of current digital orders are from our members. We are also using this tool to help make our digital platform stickier by reengaging customers if their usage drops.
As we continue to enhance our CRM journeys, we are seeing incremental transactions across all frequency bands, not only as a result of the offers, but also from our brand, safety and purpose-driven messaging. We will continue to leverage our data over the second half of this year and expect loyalty to become a bigger tailwind over time as our install base expands and we increase our level of sophistication with this large base of consumers. Driving more people to Chipotle is only part of the equation. The other key is to ensure great restaurant operations so that guests have an enjoyable experience and continue to come back. As I visit our restaurants, it’s apparent that the investments we are making and our people are paying off as our food tastes great, employee retention continues to stabilize and service levels are improving. Not only is this benefiting us currently, but these factors should position us well to drive higher throughput post COVID as in restaurant demand returns to a more normal level.
What has always attracted me to Chipotle and what I believe is a key point of differentiation is our unique purpose of cultivating a better world and a culture that has always been committed to fostering diverse, inclusive and safe environment where everyone can belong and have the opportunity to build personal and professional success and make a positive difference in their family and communities. This isn’t always easy, especially given the unrest and uncertainty at the moment, but we must do what is right, even when it’s hard. More recently, Chipotle has taken several actions to help drive out inequality and injustice, including listening sessions with our employees, financial contributions to organizations advocating against systemic racism and forming a multicultural employee resource group. The bottom line is that we are all in this together and when we do our part we can make a difference to our employees, our food, our business practices and in our communities.
Before I conclude, I want to publicly welcome our two new directors, Mary Winston and Gregg Engles, both bring excellent experience to our board and will be valuable assets for Chipotle. Finally, I want to thank all of our employees for delivering excellent guest experiences and supporting our restaurants and each other. Their belief in our purpose, commitment to living our values and hard work is what’s pulled us through what we hope is the worst of the COVID crisis. By channeling our energy into programs and initiatives that help us become a stronger team, innovate and grow our business, I believe we will finish 2020 with good momentum and be well-positioned for the long run.
With that, here is Jack to walk you through the financials. Thanks and good afternoon, everyone. Before discussing our second quarter results, I also must recognize and thank our incredible teams. I have personally been inspired to watch everyone come together to face our current challenges embracing new ways of working and decisively taking actions to safely serve our guests in the face of unprecedented conditions. From our operators doing a tremendous job managing the restaurants and providing guests a delicious customized meal, our supply chain diligently working with our partners to ensure there are no major disruptions and our support teams and development teams working virtually to keep the business moving forward. I could not be prouder to be part of this team.
Looking at our Q2 performance, while the comp was down 9.8% for the quarter, it improved sequentially every month and we are pleased to see this progress continue into July. Relative to the pre-COVID environment, in-store ordering currently is down around 37%, while order-ahead is up 140% and delivery is up 125%. We are also encouraged by the fact that there is a higher incidence of new customers, majority coming via the digital platform making their second purchase in the same month and spending more than before. It’s another example of our digital access being sticky, resulting in our July today digital mix staying nearly 50% of sales. Restaurant level margin for the quarter of 12.2% was negatively impacted by significant number of investments, including promotion to acquire digital customers through bonuses and assistance pay, along with costs related to COVID as well as higher supply chain expenses, most notably, the spike in beef prices that has since eased somewhat since the peak in May.
During the quarter, marketing and promo costs were elevated at 5% of sales due to free delivery. With this promotion behind us, we expect marketing spend to normalize during the second half of 2020 towards our typical target of 3%. While the investment in our people to acquire – and to acquire digital customers put pressure on our margins in the quarter, we are confident that these were the right investments to make and will make our brand and our culture much stronger over time. If you consider the month of June where our comp turned slightly positive and we are trending a little over $2.2 million AUV run-right, restaurant level margin was roughly 20%. The gap relative to the theoretical 22% margin we would expect at the sales level is primarily the impact of higher delivery mix and partially the result of the temporary costs I just mentioned, including higher beef cost. Similar to what many of our peers are already doing, we are about to experiment with delivery, menu prices as a way to potentially help offset this headwind and fully capture the margins expected at this volume.
As Brian mentioned, we believe our powerful and durable economic model remains very much intact. In fact, our performance through the COVID crisis, particularly the strength of our digital business, is giving us confidence hitting the $2.5 million AUV mark earlier than we have previously expected. We continue to expect margins of around 25% at that sales level. Same time, we are aware that the uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus pandemic makes it difficult to predict the near-term and medium-term impact and therefore we are not providing fiscal 2020 comp guidance. Having said, Q3 margins and EP S will likely remain bumpy as we continue to make further investments in our people, our business and our communities.
Specific to the margin, we expect it to be in the high-teens based on continued price volatility and a few ingredients, including avocados as we transition from Peruvian to Mexican fruit as well as higher labor cost given the reopening of our dining rooms. However, if we see no major COVID-related market regression in the fall, we expect our sales to continue building, which could lead to Q4 being the first quarter where margins and earnings begin to normalize. And this should help set us up for a successful 2021. We ended Q2 with $935 million in cash, restricted cash and short-term investments and no debt, which gives us a strong balance sheet, along with a $600 million untapped credit facility with which to continue to navigate the crisis.
Our team remains focused on reducing non-essential controllable costs and judiciously spending and return generating projects to preserve liquidity. I am pleased report that we generated positive free cash flow in the second quarter despite essentially normal level of growth CapEx investment, which we believe is the right thing to do and will payoff in the long-term. Furthermore, assuming a comp improvement, we are seeing continues that gives us greater confidence in our potential to generate positive cash flow for the rest of this year, which will help support ongoing strategic investments. While we didn’t buy back any stock in Q2 in order to preserve cash and we likely won’t over the foreseeable future, we are open to revisiting the program and returning excess cash to shareholders once the environment stabilizes.
During the second quarter, we are delighted to have opened 37 new restaurants, with 21 having a Chipotlane. We recently announced a milestone with the opening of 100th Chipotlane and these formats continue to perform very well and have a higher overall digital mix and recent weeks is approaching 60%, but about two-thirds being from the higher margins, order-ahead and pick up. Also, if you look at the sales of our Chipotlane cohort, of the 13 Chipotlane that are in our comp base and therefore opened well before COVID, sales are over 10% higher than the non-Chipotlane comp restaurants in the same opening period, while the more recent openings during COVID are actually 30% higher. We recently relocated 3 restaurants out of Chipotlane and we remodeled 3 more and all are seeing higher sales so far. These great results are fueling our desire to open more than 60% of new restaurants to Chipotlane this year, with the goal of exceeding 70% in 2021. Opening more Chipotlanes will enhance customer access and convenience as well as increase new restaurant sales, margins and returns.
Given factors out of our control, there was a pause in new ground breaks during April, but we started construction again as soon as regions began reopening, but we continue to build the units currently and expect to have a sequentially higher number of openings in Q3. There remains uncertainty around a potential spike in COVID cases in the fall, which makes it difficult to offer 2020 new restaurant opening guidance at this time. However, we remain confident in the long-term opportunity to more than double the number of Chipotle restaurants in the U.S. And in fact, our strong financial position along with less competition for high-quality sites as our other businesses pulled back is allowing us to build a robust new unit development pipeline. As a result, we expect to see an acceleration in the number of new units open in 2021. In closing, despite uncertainty about the near-term impact of COVID, we are very excited about our future given the strength of our brand, our talented employees, a solid liquidity position and the resiliency of our economic model. And with that, we are happy to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Tarantino with Baird. Please go ahead. Hi, good afternoon. Congratulations on learning the business so quickly. Brian, I have a question about some of the new customers that you think you have acquired since the start of the pandemic. I was wondering if you could perhaps give us a sense of how big of a contribution to sales that new customer layer has brought? And then secondly, I guess what is your tactic or plan to try to keep those folks in the fold as you move forward? Thanks. Sure. Yes. Thanks, David. So, the bulk of our digital customers that we have gained as we mentioned in our comments, a lot of them are new customers to the business. And obviously, since dining rooms have not reopened, they have yet to experience the business or I should say dining is reopen fully right. They have yet to experience the business from that access point. The good news is because so many of these new customers came through our digital business, the bulk of them also signed up for our rewards program. And so we have created these journeys that are targeted to new customers, existing customers, whether they are light, medium or heavy. And what we are seeing already with these journeys is we do have the ability to influence behaviors, whether it’s getting another occasion or getting them to add on to an occasion that they are already doing with us. So, what I would tell you is a lot of the digital growth came from new customers. The thing that’s nice about that is they are in our rewards program, a lot of them. And what we are seeing already is really great progress on using the data to then influence their behavior going forward. Got it. Makes sense. And maybe I will try a slightly different angle, so I think you mentioned your dine-in business or traffic way down 37% or running down 37%. First, can you clarify was that for the quarter or for the – I guess the quarter to-date period in July? And then I guess what – what I guess percentage of that number do you think is people that maybe you have shifted into the digital channel versus not? Yes. I mean, one of the things to keep in mind, David, is our entrees per transaction are significantly up. So, we have not seen as you think about our sales performance, we still have kind of the same gap that we historically have had on call it check and number of entrees if you use entrees as a transaction proxy. And so what we are definitely seeing is people are slowly, but surely returning to the dining room. But the bulk of what we are seeing is all the huge gains are in, I would say, more entrees per transaction coming from our digital business. So, the in-store ordering obviously we only have reclaimed about 40% to 50% of that business. And a lot of the opportunities still will be reclaiming that in-store business as people get more confidence to come back into the restaurants. But the same token, what we are seeing is a nice increase on entrees per transaction order with the digital business. So, I think some of the customers that have shifted from in-store to digital, what we have seen is their tickets have gotten bigger as they are ordering as groups. So, that helps explain why we are down in the dining room, because you just don’t have the same occasions that you used to have with people driving to work and having that lunch individual occasion, but we are picking up the entrees, I think, through our digital business is the way it is way to think about it. So I think we mentioned in the script right order-ahead is up like 140%. Delivery is up 125%. And then obviously, as we continue to get the dining rooms, operating closer to full capacity, I think we will continue to make progress on the transactions that occur in the restaurant as well. Right, Brian. Thank you very much. Yes. The next question is from Peter Saleh with BTIG. Please go ahead. Great, thanks. I want to ask about the Queso Blanco, I think you guys had indicated that you saw pretty substantial high teens attach mix with that just talk about what you did differently there and how you can apply some of those learning’s to maybe some of the new products you plan to launch over the course of the year? Yes, sure. Well, for starters, the Queso Blanco, I think was a huge improvement over the prior Queso. And then I think that the team did a really nice job of doing was doing the marketing to those that were already Queso users, as well as people that you may have tried it in the past, but have not purchased it in a long time. And so, I think the team did a great job of using our data to do very targeted marketing, and then the advertising, I think that they ran on a more broad scale based did a nice job of bringing to life. What was different about this Queso and look, the learnings that we have gotten with using our data to drive attachment, I think is something we will be able to use with beverages we will continue to use, frankly, with all sorts of programs coming down the pike. So we feel really good about how Queso Blanco has performed. And I am also really proud of what we have learned in how we can use up this database to better inform our customers what is available and what is right for them so that we get a better attachment in each ticket. Thanks. Very helpful. Just a question on the development going forward, I think in the past, one of the governor’s on development and growth, going faster has been just finding enough people. I think the environment that was such that it was tough to find enough employees. Do you feel like that has changed for you? I know capital is not an issue seems like real estate is not the issue. So do you have any restraints on finding enough people to go faster on the development side? Yes, I would say, it’s two things on the people. One was having access to hire the additional people and then two was having, I think the people culture and capability in place that when we brought these people on they quickly could be trained and learned he Chipotle way of executing our business. And I think Scott and our HR leaders, Marisa, and all the folks in the field have done a phenomenal job of doing a really good job of recruiting the right people. And then when we recruit them, we are able to train them so that they are ready to go to open a new restaurant or takeover a restaurant in the event, we need to move with an apprentice or a manager to a new restaurant. So we feel like we got all the components to really continue to have success with opening new restaurants, access to really good people the right people capability in the operating model for these people to get trained and ready to roll. And then as you mentioned, the returns continue to be really, really strong because we are able to have access to really good real estate and then we have got all the different access points whether it’s Chipotle just a traditional Chipotle. Alright, thank you very much and congrats on the quarter. Thank you. The next question is from Katherine Fogertey with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Great. Thank you. The quesadilla being offered as a digital-only item in test, can you walk through maybe the learning’s of prior Stage Gate tests, maybe what you saw with carne asada when you launched it initially as digital only, that gave you confidence that this digital only strategy will work. And kind of in that same vein, are there other items or even other day parts now that you are committed to kind of digital only offerings that might fit well here? Has that expanded or changed the potential for menu innovation going forward? Thanks. Yes, thanks. Thanks for the question. Yes. So one of the things it’s been a nice benefit of all the growth in our digital businesses, we now have scale where, we are doing over a million dollars of business of this digital make line, right. And we have got some restaurants doing well beyond that. And what we have found is, we can have success providing digital only menu items. So, we started – we kind of dipped our toe in the water when we did lifestyle bowls. And we have kept that going. And what we have seen early days is people are willing to do the app/digital experience in order to have access to a quesadilla. And we feel really good about what we have seen in the early days of the test that we have got going. Obviously, we want to finish the test out. But what I would tell you is the things we have learned in the stage-gate process was just that, which is a huge improvement over making a quesadilla on the frontline with our new approach. But once we started to get meaningful scale, we realized you know what, we don’t even need to put that challenge in front of our operators on the frontline, because we can run it through this digital business. And everybody gets a better experience. The team member has a better experience in the restaurant. The customer gets a better experience from a speed and having the product ready to go when they show up and then the product itself I think you might have heard me talk about this with our digital business, you kind of make your reservation for when you are going to get your quesadilla. I mean, it is Chipotle’s food is really good. And this quesadilla is really good. But when it’s really hot and it’s right there when you reserve your time, it’s extraordinary. So, we feel like it’s hitting on all the marks you would want, better operational experience, better experience for the customer, arguably better food experience. And then operationally, it plays really well in our throughput initiative so that folks in the frontline can really continue to stay focused on speed and that our digital make line is really focused on being on time and accurate. So, we are feeling really bullish. The good news is this does open the door for additional innovation. And Chris and the team are working through what are things we could be doing that are dedicated to the digital make line. And you will see us continue to test those in our stage-gate process. While we still do things like cauliflower rice, which, frankly are going to be both on the frontline and the digital make line. So, we are feeling very optimistic about what our ability is going to be to your point to open kind of that innovation spectrum using the digital make line, whether it’s state parts or menu while we can protect the integrity of our throughput model on that frontline. Great, thank you. Yes. The next question is from Nicole Miller with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Thank you. Good afternoon. Could you dig in a little bit to direct and indirect, so I understand digital order-ahead is up 140%, delivery is up 125%. If you isolate delivery, how able are you to keep the consumers coming directly to your app? And I imagine clearly that changes from month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter, but how do you keep that in balance, please? Yes, sure. So, right now, it’s pretty evenly split between marketplace and our own app experience. And the thing that I think you have seen us done is over time we can run very targeted efforts within our app into our rewards customers to incentivize them to stay within our app for that delivery occasion. The thing we also like about our – frankly our delivery app execution is we can control more of the variables on delivery fees as well as menu prices, so that we can also incentivize behaviors towards our app as well. And then obviously, the big differentiator is you continue to get rewards points when you do delivery through our app versus using a third-party. So, we are feeling really good about the growth that we have seen in our white label business and continues to be an access point that we are going to continue to drive, because it does still appear to be a unique occasion. That’s very helpful. I will just ask the second and last question and admittedly, it’s as much about Chipotle as it is trying to understand the consumer behavior at a very high level. When you think about July there is many reasons for your rebound, I just want to understand, what would you be willing to tell us about week-to-week or region-to-region? So, in big restaurant geographies, there is less mobility, I know, California would be the most obvious. I am very curious to understand if the customer maybe doesn’t go back into a dining room that’s understood. And I am wondering if that drives them more and more to Chipotle or a drive-thru in general and more and more to digital? Yes. I mean, look, what we have seen Nicole is the regions that opened the earliest, I would say we have made the most gains in comp. And the thing that has been really promising is the digital business has remained sticky, even while we have seen dining room business make a come back, okay. And I think we have mentioned this, our Chipotlanes, we just now have 100 of them or just over 100. We have seen that Chipotlane business stay robust and outperform our system. And I think there is a consumer behavior, where even if they want – even if they are going into the dining room, they are still taking it for takeout. They are not sitting down and eating at least what we are seeing to-date, it’s come in, get your food and go for the most part. And digital was still I think, perceived as even more convenient, that coming in, building it and then going. So I think you are going to continue to see that. And obviously California rolled back some of the in-dining room experience So, we have quickly pivoted to just relying more heavily on our order-ahead business, which fortunately Chipotle has those access points where we can pivot depending on what happens, state by state, municipality by municipality. So, I am hoping that we don’t have to go backwards before we can go forward on this proposition, but I think we are positioned nicely to be able to weather whatever way we need to bop in order to get through the next couple of months. Great. Thank you so much. The next question is from Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Great, thank you very much. I wanted to just follow-up on questions about the delivery the decision to kind of pullback on promotions and anything you might be seeing there early on, just is the easiest way to think about it that now order-ahead is growing 20 percentage points faster than delivery and that’s how we should think about the elasticity or is that not really the full weight of that? And are you seeing those sales shift to order-ahead, so kind of from your lowest margin sales to your highest margin, just any kind of color? And on that front, the implication is that, that should be helpful for margins. So I was just trying to sort of square that with Jack’s guidance for kind of high-teens versus the 20% run-rate that we saw when you were kind of spending heavily behind non-delivery. So, just anything on the top line and then how to think about the implications for the margin? Yes. So hey, Jack, why don’t I start and then I will hand it over to you. Does that sound good? Perfect. Yes. Okay. So obviously, one of the things that occurred as soon as if we kind of rewind on the quarter, right, everything moved to off-premise and you had a huge shift to delivery that over time as we got people into delivery and into the digital business, they learned about the other access mode of order-ahead and pickup. And so what I think people have discovered is, you know what, from a value proposition standpoint, I can skip the delivery fee, I can skip some of the waiting if I order-ahead. So we have heard from our consumers as you look at like qualitative side of this, hey, look the convenience of ordering ahead and picking up was something they discovered as a result of bringing them into our business through the delivery channel, which I think is kind of surprising. I don’t think people would realize that people would join the Chipotle digital system because they came in through the delivery occasion. We brought them into the system and then we gave them the experience of the order-ahead. And what’s been nice is we have seen that there are occasions where people want the convenience of delivery, because I can’t get to a Chipotle, but they also really value the ability to order-ahead and go pick it up, because it frankly puts them even in more control of the convenience that they want. And look, they can avoid some fees, right. They don’t have to pay delivery fees, service fees or what have you when you look at whether it’s marketplace or white label. And so what we have pivoted to now is we did put in the dollar delivery fee versus being free the whole time. And I do think some people view and always it worth paying the delivery fee or should I go ahead and just hop in my car and pick it up. And luckily for us, we have made it very convenient for people to make that trade-off. With that said, the delivery occasion appears to be a very unique occasion that when people want to do it, they are willing to pay the delivery fee or the added price associated with delivery. So, we see them as working really well together. But over time, we obviously want to migrate that delivery business to not just be an acquisition tool, but to also be an occasion where we don’t mind the trade-off between delivery or order-ahead over time. And I think that’s what Jack was alluding to in his comments. So Jack, I will hand it over to you. Yes. Thanks, Brian. Yes, Sara. So, when you look at I talked about June being a pretty clean month, our margin was 20%. I think that gives an idea that when we normalized the P&L, we can bounce back, we are only 12% during the quarter, but the first couple of months of the quarter had big investments in terms of free delivery. We did start charging the dollar delivery. So, we went from zero to $1 in June and that helped contribute to the higher margin during that period. There is no question that our margin potential as we experiment with and we figure out which levers to pull with between delivery fees and the menu price with delivery that we think there is more upward potential with that margin going from 20% and getting back to more like a 22% when we are at a $2.2 million volume, but we are going to experiment in Q3. So I would call Q3 more of a learning quarter, not a recovery of the margin quarter. That’s why I signaled that Q4 could be the first quarter that we actually see a more normalization of that, of our overall margin. So, we will learn in Q3, we will figure out what to do in Q4. And then also, Q3 is going to be hit by avocados. We have to do that transition back to Mexican avocados. And we are looking at potentially higher prices. We are still picking up some of the higher price of beef, even though beef has begun to normalize, that’s going to hit us as well. So I just want expectations in Q3 to be – there will be some bounce back on the 12%, but it’s not going to stay at that 20% and then we are going to looking ahead to Q4 in the next year and everything that we are saying we have confidence that our March potential is as intact as it’s ever been. Okay, great. I just – if I can ask one housekeeping you said that there is a 2.7% negative impact that come from the Northeast and international, are we right in thinking that Northeast is about 20% of your stores and maybe bit more than that in sales, is that sort of the order of magnitude? It’s in – I would say, Sara, it’s in that maybe 15% to 20%. It’s one of 8 regions. And so it obviously was hit the hardest. So, I would have to go back and check 20% might be a little on the high side. Okay, thank you. The next question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Thanks very much. I wanted to just go back to delivery as well. How incremental has – the adding the extra incremental third-party delivery provider spend to comp? How do you measure that? Are they all providing the right level of delivery service, you are just using the one, DoorDash for that service and really just relying on the marketplace? And Brian, I just want to also make sure I understood, you are saying 50% of sales in June are delivery, half of them – 50% are digital, half of that is delivery. So, 25% of your sales now is delivery, is that right and what would that have compared to pre-COVID? Yes. So let me unpack that. To answer your first question, we use all the major aggregators for the third-party delivery. We are only using DoorDash for our in-app, white label delivery. And what we have seen is as we brought on GrubHub and Uber Eats. And we obviously already had Postmates with DoorDash. Each time we brought on people, we have seen incremental customers come into the business for the delivery channel. Specifically, we are watching this from delivery transactions. And it’s pretty consistent. I think we have heard over and over again and from what we have done our analysis on the others 20% to 30% overlap with some of the big players. So we definitely have seen a nice uptick in our delivery business. Then to answer your question on our digital business, think of the digital business as roughly 50% of sales and half of that or almost a little more than half is order-ahead. And then within that other half that right now is delivery, think of that as another like, call it 60:40 split of marketplace and white label is kind of the way to think about it. So – and we have seen nice growth, I think, as we highlighted in both the order-ahead business and the delivery business. Thank you. And then as a follow-up, you talked about the dine-in business being down, how many – what percentage of your store base is in urban cores that rely on that lunch business that probably doesn’t exist in much more fashion, how much headwind is that and how much therefore could that come back as we go back to work over the next 6 sort of months? Yes. I think, John, I think it’s around 150, maybe a few more restaurants where there are in those really, called the dense urban setting. But I think in general dining rooms will benefit as that lunch occasion comes back with people going back to work in a more normal pattern versus the heavy skew right now, which is the work from home environment. Got it. Thank you. Sure. Your next question is from Jake Bartlett with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Hey, thanks for taking the questions. My first is try to let me better understand that the performance of stores when they open dining rooms, how much of an overall lift that is? And then you mentioned that 85% of the stores have dining room or patio? Did you break that down to tell us what percentage are the dining rooms open, just alone right now? Yes, sure. So the last part that’s pretty 70% are dining rooms and then there is like 15% that are patio only. Okay. And then your question on when the dining room opens, what type of lift do we see? It’s a gradual build back. What we have seen today, on average is we have recaptured about 40 to 50% of that dining room business. But it’s a gradual thing, it’s like every week goes by, I think consumer psyche starts to build with the idea of going back into the dining room. Again, the bulk of that is people end up still taking it off premise to eat versus actually sitting down in the dining room because remember, even when we have these dining rooms open, in some cases only 25% of our seats available. So, it’s very limited seating to sit in the dining room. Got it. Just to understand that that better, having such a kind of it seems like there is a minimal impact of people sitting. So what’s the big change in terms of the consumer behavior when you open up the dining room, you have already had people, able to come in and in order by standing in line so I mean, I guess I am a little confused as to why would change the sales so much yet it doesn’t seem like the actual dining in is very material? Yes, I think it has more to do with the consumer psychology of going to restaurants versus doing it all from home. or in your car. Okay. Again, in even I think I might have shared this with some of you in prior meetings. As I’ve gone into the restaurants and talked to folks that are in the restaurant, a lot of them are like, thank heavens, you guys are opened for me to sit down because I’m just tired of eating in my car. I am tired of eating at home. There is a consumer psychology to the idea that more things are open. And therefore are more mobile, and I’m out and about. So that’s what our research shows. And, as you talk to consumers, that’s the feedback we get. Got it. And then real quick just on pricing and I was hoping you could provide what I don’t think you have what traffic and overall check growth was. And we also found some menu pricing recently taken in markets like California, if you could maybe confirm that or just talking about your strategy for taking menu price. This year I know in years past, it’s been kind of concentrated over a month or two any color on your strategy for taking price this year? Yes, sure. So we have been very limited in our pricing, because of just I think the nature of the consumer psychology right now. But one thing we have done from a pricing standpoint is we have gotten very strategic with our partner at Fishbowl. And there are places like California where minimum wage moved. And accordingly we did some pricing action to go along with some of the minimum wage movement. So that might be what you are picking up. But it’s very and even that is not market wide. It’s very still strategically executed, on a restaurant by restaurant basis. But I think that’s what you are referencing is you probably saw some of the pricing moves in conjunction with recent minimum wage movement that we are pretty significant minimum wage movements. Right. And then adjust the traffic in the check? We don’t bring that out. Go ahead Jack, sorry. Yes, I think Brian alluded to it earlier, the transaction has changed the group size has changed significantly, both because people have moved to digital and digital is a higher group size and then even within the order in the restaurant, the group size has changed and I think that’s because we set up, the person working and going out to lunch, maybe with a group, but they are all paying themselves. Now, it’s going to the restaurant and then ordering for the family. So, I think a better way to look at it is when we have the 9.8% negative comp during the quarter, if you look at just entrees, because an entree kind of lines up with a person, entrees were down about 15%. And what that suggests is there is a 5% effective lift in the check and that would have come from a couple of points from menu prices. We also saw a bigger incidence of steak. People are buying steak more and that is a higher priced item. And then the attachment with queso so – I think that’s the best way to think about it. And I think as we go from a negative 10 into a positive comp situation, it’s going to be a similar gap where people are still buying steak more, they are still buying queso and we still have this small menu price. So, I think you are going to still see a kind of 3%, 4%, 5% gap between our sales and our transactions. I think that’s probably the best way to think about it. Great. Thanks a lot. The next question is from Andrew Charles with Cowen. Please go ahead. Great. Thank you. Jack, a two-part question for you. Now that you are at 100 Chipotlane locations, I am curious what the early read has been on cannibalization if you prefer sales transfer are relative to what you see typically when you open a traditional store near an existing store. And then my follow-up was just now that you have line of sight to development plans through 2021 and perhaps at this point even visibility into 2022 although not finalized. Are you able to extrapolate out or express your desire for what mix of stores Chipotle will represent, will you reach that milestone 5,000 U.S. locations? Yes, Andrew, thanks for the question. We are not seeing anything unusual in terms of impact. We open up a Chipotlane versus another restaurant. I mean, you might see the impact that we expect to be a little higher, a little lower, it might be higher, but the volume is higher. The volume in the totaling is higher, so nothing unusual or nothing concerning there whatsoever. We do have internally what we would like to see over a, call it a 3 to 5-year period. And it’s not ready for us to disclose yet. But we are looking at individual markets, some of our oldest markets and looking at we may not be opening up a lot of restaurants in our Denver, our Kansas City, some of the earliest markets, but we do have old restaurants there, where we can look at relocations and rebuilds. In fact, in my prepared comments, I mentioned that we did 3 remodels and added a Chipotlane and 3 relocations and added a Chipotlane. And the way I think about that is we are doing some early tests, call it, running it through the stage-gate to see how these restaurants perform. And as they perform well in the first 6 that we have done, have come out of the box with a higher sales. We are going to look to add more relocations, more remodel so that we can bring more Chipotlane, not just through new stores, but through these other approaches as well. And the good news is in this environment our landlords are more willing to work with us to do a remodel and if they are not willing to work with us on a remodel, there is a site across the street that we will take a look at as well. So, we think the opportunity to move more Chipotlane over the next 3 to 5 years is pretty encouraging. Jack, I also just have one bookkeeping question I have. Can you speak to labor costs that 28.2%, the implied labor dollars per store actually declined 90 basis points? It’s obviously a very impressive dynamic when considering the investments that were made in supplementing team member wages as well as manager bonuses. Can you speak to some of the talent in the quarter to help better understand what is temporary and what is enduring within that favorable labor expense? Yes. Well, listen, our labor as a percentage of sales was up and it was up because we had the assistance bonus and we have some discretionary bonuses for our managers, but we have some stores that were closed for a while, we have lower sales. And so the labor hours we will schedule with lower sales is going to go down and that might be why you are seeing a just lower absolute number. When you look at just as a percentage of sales, about two-thirds of the increase as a percentage of sales was from the bonus and assistance pay, about one-third of it is because of de-leverage going forward. And the other piece that’s in there, we have some labor efficiencies, Scott and his team out in the field, did a really good job on navigating making sure we had the right number of people show up. Early on, that was hard to get the store staff, our stores were staffed, they were efficient. When you see volumes move up and down, it’s very hard to staff the stores. Well, they did a great job. And I think part of that is also we expected and we saw some efficiencies with the digital make line as well. So now in terms of Andrew, what carries forward in terms of those efficiencies – some of that depends on how much of the business stays digital. If 50% of the sales stay digital or somewhere in that ballpark, let’s say even 40% some of those efficiencies will pass through, too early to put a number on it yet, but I think our teams did a great job and to do an average of $1 million. And in some cases, Brian alluded to it $2 million and even greater on that digital make line, with fewer labor just gives us a lot of optimism about what we can do in terms of sales and what we can do in terms of profit margin as well. That’s helpful. Thank you, Jeff. The next question is from Lauren Silberman with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Hi, thanks. I wanted to follow-up on the commentary regarding the June AUV run-rate of Q2 and 20% restaurant margin the 200 basis points differential from the framework. Is it primarily driven by delivery costs? Or are there any other costs to consider? And then is there any offsetting benefit from the shift to the more margin accretive order-ahead occasions? The biggest piece is delivery for sure. There is some other pressure, Beef was a little bit of pressure our customers buying more Beef was a little pressure and we are selling fewer drinks. And so, drinks are very accretive to margins and we are selling fewer of them. So there is other things that we are in there. But by far the biggest piece, the piece that we can act on is the delivery piece. We know that if delivery stays at this, this current level, that that the higher delivery fees is going to be a permanent impact on our margins. And that’s why we are going to do some experimentation in Q3. The other pieces are going to work their way out. We do think that especially with tractor beverages we are going to sell more beverages. We suspect that there will be some shift back, away from beef to other menu items. If not, we will need to understand that a little bit more, but that there are a number of things but by far the delivery fees is the biggest piece. Great. And then with regards to the loyalty program, now 15 million members, one of the fastest, but not fastest, in restaurant history, what do you think is driving the outsized adoption of Chipotle, is it faster than you originally expected? And then just thinking about the composition of the loyalty program members what portion is light, medium and heavy users? Yes, so obviously the adoption of the rewards program has exceeded our expectations, and it’s gone really well. And, obviously, with the fact that so many people switch to our delivery and digital business over the last couple months, really enabled us to get people to engage in the rewards program. The thing that has been really refreshing is a lot of folks that have joined our rewards program have been new users or light users. And so, we are already using these customer journeys to start influencing behaviors, so that, we can have them be a more frequent customer. And I think that is going to prove to be a nice tailwind for us in the future. Because I don’t think we are done at 15 million, I think 15 million is going to become, you know, 20 million and so on and so forth. And as everyday goes by, we learn more and more on how to use that data to better influence, light, medium and heavy users behavior. Any color, I guess the magnitude of light, medium versus heavy, users in the program? We have not broken that out. So, what I can tell you is we are really pleased with the mix that we are seeing a light medium and heavy users. Thanks very much. Next question is from Chris Carril with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Hi, thanks for taking the question. So I wanted to ask about how you are thinking about store formats going forward so clearly the current environments validating the opportunity with Chipotlanes. But are you rethinking at all any other aspects of the restaurant perhaps around? How much in restaurants eating is necessary going forward? And do you think there is an opportunity to drive new restaurant returns even higher by contemplating these different formats? Well, what I will definitely tell you is we are testing different formats, whether it’s a restaurant that is a Chipotlane-only to a restaurant that's all order-ahead with Chiptolane access point. So we are going to test various formats because our goal is to have a suite of assets that we can then put into a trade area to maximize totally sales out of that trade area. So, the good news is we are seeing these access points all to be truly viable. And I feel like we have got, terrific flexibility in what we want to build, whether it’s in line, tradition, traditional Chipotle all the way to, the freestanding Chiptolane. We’ve got a lot of flexibility in between those two call it bookends, so, and we are going to continue to experiment with what are the, besides we can put Chipotle and then maybe historically we would have said that, and we cannot put Chipotle there but now we can because we have got this different execution and also the scale of our digital business, which supports the additional access points. Jack, I don’t know if you want to add anything to that? No, I couldn’t agree more. And I think this pull forward of the digital business is already allowing us to look in additional trade areas and you can flex the investment and you can flex the size and the access points within the restaurant and so – but we are going to be thoughtful like we have done with anything and take a stage-gate type approach. So you will see some different formats come out and then when they do well, you will see more of them. Right. That’s really helpful. Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Brian Niccol for any closing remarks. Alright. Thank you and thank you everybody for taking the time to listen and ask questions. Obviously, we are very proud of all of our employees, the way that they have managed the business, the way that they have taken high, high importance on the safety of themselves and their customers. Very fortunate to be a part of this company and leading this company of so many talented leaders, so many talented people that are so committed to Chipotle’s purpose and really honored to be where we are with the Chipotle business. Obviously, we are very proud of the investments we have made in digital and how that has played out for us over the last couple of months. I am very optimistic about how the Chipotle business with now the combination of a very robust digital business, combined with great culinary, great speed and just tremendous value is going to play out in the future. And we are very optimistic about what the future holds both for the health and well-being everybody in this country and then obviously the health and well-being of Chipotle of both the people that work in it and the business that we are going to lead going forward. So, thank you for taking the time and I look forward to speaking with you all soon. Take care. Bye. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation.

Today, we are sharing strong third quarter results that highlight ongoing progress in these unprecedented times. However, before I dive into the details, let me acknowledge and thank our incredible Chipotle team members who remain focused on great execution and on advancing our purpose of cultivating a better world for our employees, guests, farmers, communities and shareholders. I’m truly humbled to have the privilege to work alongside this team. Their efforts are helping us not only successfully navigate this pandemic, but highlight that Chipotle’s business model is durable, flexible, and could perform in a challenging environment.
As always, the health and wellbeing of our employees and guests continues to be our top priority. We are benefiting from investments made a few years ago, including advanced air filtration systems, sanitizers throughout the restaurant, wellness protocols, and improved handwashing. In addition, we are closely following the recommendations of the CDC and local health departments and have implemented social distancing, wearing face masks, a tamper evident packaging seal for all digital orders, as well as creating the steward role to sanitize high-traffic areas. Collectively, these efforts have made the pivot to enhance COVID-19 safety protocols much less complicated and give our employees and guests confidence that Chipotle remains steadfast in our commitment to keep them safe as we reopen restaurants for in-restaurant dining.
We continue to monitor and adhere to state and federal mandates and at present have roughly 10 restaurants closed and about 85% offering limited in-restaurant and/or patio dining, with the remaining being open for to-go services. Since sales troughed in late March, we’ve been able to retain 80% to 85% of our digital sales gains while recovering 50% to 55% of our in-store sales. The stickiness of digital is a key factor in allowing us to deliver strong results, and we’ll continue to invest in making the digital experience as easy and frictionless as possible, as illustrated by the recent launch of our group ordering feature on the Chipotle app.
For the quarter, we reported sales of $1.6 billion, representing 14% year-over-year growth, which was fueled by 8.3% comparable restaurant sales growth, restaurant level margins of 19.5%, which is a 130 basis points lower than last year, and earnings per share adjusted for unusual items of $3.76, representing a decline of 1.6% year-over-year.
Comparable restaurant sales were strong in each month of Q3, with August being the high point. Sales trends remained strong in September, even though beginning mid-month we rolled over the successful 2019 Carne Asada program. Beginning mid-September, comparable restaurant sales impressively delivered mid-single digits and this trend has continued in October.
The two-year compounded comp stack is a healthy 20.2%, which is similar to the 20.4% pre-COVID level we delivered in Q4 2019 and highlights that our digital system along with running great restaurants with the right leaders and the right culture can deliver outstanding performance despite external challenges.
As you can see from the Q3 results, our key strategies continue to resonate with guests and position us to win today while we create the future. In fact, they give us confidence in ultimately having more than 6,000 restaurants and expanding AUVs above $2.5 million with margins at or above 25%.
Let me provide a brief update on each of these strategies which are: number one, making the brand visible, relevant, and loved; number two, utilizing a disciplined approach to creativity and innovation; number three, leveraging digital capabilities to drive productivity and expand access, convenience and engagement; number four, engaging with customers through our loyalty program; and number five, running successful restaurants with a strong culture that provide great Food with Integrity while delivering exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences.
Beginning with marketing, where the goal remains to increase awareness, expand access and grow sales by driving culture, driving a difference, and ultimately driving a purchase. Our team has shown a heightened sense of urgency since the beginning of COVID. They quickly adapted to the evolving environment and experimented with creative social and digital media initiatives designed to help enhance Chipotle’s brand and purpose. Most recently demonstrated by our roundup or change feature that has raised over $2.1 million for organizations supporting underserved communities. We also connected and engaged with guests through our Behind the Foil TV campaign, highlighting real ingredients, real cooking techniques, and real employees.
Innovation is a core component of Chipotle and our stage-gate process is a key tool in which we test, listen, and learn from customers and operations before moving to a national launch. Chipotle continues to explore menu initiatives that align with our Food with Integrity standards. A successful example is Carne Asada, which we’re delighted to bring back for a limited time across the U.S. and Canada, as well as in France for the first time.
Given that only 5% of U.S. beef meets Chipotle’s strict sourcing standards, we have embarked on a yearlong mission to partner with new farmers, whose practices emphasize quality and responsibility to ensure supply through Q4 and into Q1 of next year. This guest favorite is off to a great start, helping drive sales and transactions again this year.
In addition, our upgraded suite of Tractor Beverages that launched in July has been receiving terrific customer feedback. These organic teas and lemonades have elevated our drink options to match our food quality and Food with Integrity ethos. While their full benefit won’t be seen until more customers visit our dining rooms, they have already helped improve drink incidence and position us for ongoing beverage gains.
We have two other menu items currently being tested, cauliflower rice, which further enhances healthy eating options at Chipotle and quesadillas, the number one requested new menu item by our customers. The quesadilla is available as a digital-only menu option in a few test markets. Given our digital scale as well as removing operational friction by utilizing our digital kitchens, we are optimistic about the potential for quesadillas to be available nationwide at some point in the future. We are gaining valuable feedback on both of these items, and we’ll update you on their progress as well as other new menu items that are in early stages as they move through our stage-gate process.
Next, our digital platform continues to be a big beneficiary of consumers adopting the digital off-premise occasion. A reduction of dine-in services, more people working from home, increased advertising and digital awareness, recent partnerships with Uber Eats and Grubhub and expanded digital capabilities into Canada all have helped attract new customers into our digital ecosystem while increasing convenient access to Chipotle. As a result, Q3 digital sales grew 202% year-over-year to $776 million and represented 49% of sales. Assuming this momentum continues in Q4, we believe digital sales could exceed $2.5 billion in 2020, more than double what we did last year. At this sales rate, our average restaurant delivers a digital AUV of well over $1 million, up from just a few hundred thousand dollars per restaurant a few years ago.
During the quarter, about half of the digital sales came via the delivery channel, with the remainder coming from order-ahead and pickup transactions. Both channels continue to grow nicely with delivery benefiting from our expanded partnerships. Order-ahead also remains robust as guests better understand the value offered by this channel as well as the convenience of more Chipotles, which provide an extraordinarily fast experience. I am pleased to report that this strong digital momentum has continued into October with our digital mix remaining in the high-40s.
Chipotle has transformed itself over the past few years to a real food and people company powered by technology. A prime example is our rewards program, which has expanded significantly since March and now has 17 million enrolled members. To put this in perspective, this is more viewership than on a typical Monday night football broadcast and gives us a content distribution and engagement network that we can use to elevate engagement and awareness of brand initiatives. Additionally, many of these members are new for Chipotle, not just dining guests who switched to off-premise.
Today, our loyalty program is already proving quite fruitful. We’re seeing an increase in frequency across the board with consumers resulting in an extremely strong return on investment. However, what really excites us is that we’re in the early stages of using this valuable tool to understand consumer behavior that will allow us to enhance their journeys and ultimately drive higher sales. We can also utilize these learnings to reengage members if their visits decline, which should efficiently sustain the stickiness of our digital platform. Over the next few years, we expect loyalty to be a key enabler of our digital flywheel as we optimize the use of this important data set.
Switching now to our great operations, where today more than ever guests demand and deserve a safe and enjoyable experience as they venture back into our restaurants. We now have two large and growing businesses to manage with digital now comprising roughly half of our sales. Despite COVID challenges, our operations team has done an outstanding job providing consistently prepared delicious food, while improving service levels. Our GMs have maintained a strong presence and stay closely connected to our crew who are at the heart of our culture and our business.
A strong culture is a critical part of running successful restaurants. As a leadership team, we continued our listening sessions with employees to understand their experiences and hear their ideas on how we can better support them. In response, we have further invested in our people, including diversity, equity and inclusion training, voter education, and most recently expanding debt-free degrees to include Paul Quinn College, the nation’s first urban work college and one of the oldest historically black colleges and universities in the country. Of those enrolled in our educational assistance program, 85% are crew members and the benefit has a significant impact on their tenure and growth. We’ve seen a retention rate that is 3.5 times higher among employees enrolled in the program, and crew members participating are 7.5 times more likely to move into a management role within the organization. In fact, nearly 70% of our GMs are internal promotions. This is extremely important as we promote and hire new leaders to help support continued growth in our digital business as well as a meaningful acceleration in 2021 new restaurant openings.
As we look ahead, we still operate with some uncertainty regarding a potential second wave and the longer term economic impact of COVID. Yet I’m really hopeful that if we do the right things as a company and as a community, we can avoid major disruptions. I’ve never been more confident that Chipotle is a resilient brand committed to fostering a culture that values and champions our diversity, while leveraging the individual talents of all team members.
Our core purpose of cultivating a better world through Food with Integrity remains the guiding force in all Company decisions and instills a great sense of pride among our employees, which will far outlast this pandemic.
With that, here’s Jack to walk you through the financials. Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone.
Despite the ongoing external challenges, we’re pleased to report outstanding third quarter results, which highlight the durability of our economic model and the strong performance of our restaurant teams. Sales were $1.6 billion in the third quarter, an increase of 14.1% from last year, with comp sales grew 8.3%. Restaurant-level margin of 19.5% was 130 basis points lower than last year, and earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $3.76, representing a 1.6% year-over-year decline. The third quarter had unusual expenses related to legal reserves, restaurant asset impairments and closure costs as well as our transformation that negatively impacted our earnings per share by $0.94, leading to GAAP earnings per share of $2.82.
We remain optimistic about the future given our strong Q3 results as well as a great start to this quarter, despite lapping a 13.4% comp in Q4 of 2019. That being said, uncertainty from COVID makes it difficult to provide comp guidance for the remainder of 2020 or for 2021 at this time.
Food costs for Q3 were 32.3%, a decrease of 90 basis points from last year due primarily to a menu price increase and lower avocado prices that were partially offset by COVID-related impacts, including elevated beef prices, increased incidence of steak and fewer sales of high-margin beverages.
In Q4, we expect food cost to be in the low-32% range as the benefit from a full quarter of delivery menu price increases, which I’ll discuss shortly, will be offset by the launch of Carne Asada.
Labor costs for the quarter were 25.3%, a decrease of 130 basis points from last year, and this decrease was primarily driven by sales leverage, partially offset by labor inflation as well as expanded emergency lead benefits to accommodate employees who are directly impacted by COVID.
We expect labor costs to be around 25% in Q4 as the benefit of delivery menu price increases will be slightly offset by lower seasonal sales. Other operating costs for the quarter were 16.8%, an increase of 400 basis points from last year, due primarily to higher delivery fees and marketing costs in the quarter. Delivery expenses were elevated year-over-year, given the significant growth we’ve experienced in our digital business, a trend we expect to continue. Therefore, to help improve economics on this important access point, we’re currently testing delivery menu price increases. Remember that we have reduced delivery fees on white label from $3 per order before COVID to just $1, so the net increase to our guests is relatively small, typically about 2% to 3%. We expect this new delivery pricing strategy to be dynamic and evolve over time as we gauge consumer response. And we’ll make adjustments as needed, including perhaps during the approach, market-by-market.
Our goal is to ensure we provide convenient access to our guests, so they can enjoy Chipotle how and where they choose to. When customers choose a premium convenience channel that attracts higher costs, our objective is to largely cover those costs within that channel.
Marketing and promo costs for the quarter were 2.6%, an increase of 60 basis points from last year, due primarily to advertising campaigns to support our digital growth. For Q4, we expect marketing and promo costs to be in the mid to high 3% range to support Carne Asada and for the latest brand messaging under our Behind the Foil campaign. As a result of higher anticipated marketing spend and ongoing momentum in our delivery business, we expect other operating costs to be in the low 17% range in Q4.
Looking at overall restaurant margins, we expect Q4 to be at a similar level to what we saw in Q3. While underlying margins are expected to improve by around 200 basis points sequentially in Q4 due to the delivery menu price increase and other efficiencies, these will largely be offset by higher food costs associated with Carne Asada as well as the roughly 100 basis points incremental marketing spend relative to the third quarter. Normalizing to a 3% add in promo spend and without the near-term margin impact of carne, our Q4 underlying margin would be in the 21% range. Looking beyond Q4, we expect COVID-related direct and indirect costs to ease over time, and we have a number of plans in place to ensure we are able to deliver our full margin potential.
G&A for the quarter was $133 million on a GAAP basis or $102 million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding $29 million for settlements of older legal matters and $2 million related to transformation expenses. G&A also includes $84 million in underlying G&A expenses and $18 million related to noncash stock compensation, which includes a $3 million cumulative life-to-date downward adjustment on our 2018 PSUs relative to COVID impacts. As expected, our underlying G&A increased sequentially as we grew headcount and invested in technology to support our growth. Looking ahead to Q4, we expect a similar underlying G&A expense while stock comp will likely be around $22 million, although this amount could move up or down based on actual performance.
Turning now to the balance sheet. We ended Q3 with nearly $1.1 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments and no debt, along with the $600 million in untapped credit facility. Our financial strength gives us the opportunity to make ongoing strategic investments in our people, in our business and in our communities, which we believe will benefit us for years to come. While we didn’t buy back any stock in Q3, we’ll continue to evaluate the operating and economic environment each quarter, and we’ll return excess cash to shareholders when the environment is more stable and more predictable.
Another area of strength for Chipotle is restaurant design and development. And during the third quarter, we’re delighted to have opened 44 new restaurants with 26, including a Chipotlane. We now have a total of 128 Chipotlanes, including 5 conversions, and performance for these formats continues to be stellar. The digital gap versus non-Chipotle restaurants remains around 10%, and that’s driven entirely by the higher margin order-ahead transaction.
Also, if you look at the sales of our Chipotlane cohort, of the 17 Chipotlanes that are in our comp base, and therefore, opened well before COVID, sales are over 10% higher than the non-Chipotlane comp restaurants from the same open period, while the more recent openings during COVID were actually 25% higher. These results further reaffirm our strategy of an accelerated pivot towards Chipotlane sites going forward. And while we continue to expect about 60% of new restaurants with a Chipotlane this year, our goal is to have more than 70% openings, including Chipotlanes in 2021. Opening more Chipotlanes will not only enhance customer access and convenience, but it also increases new store restaurant sales, margins and returns.
It’s hard to predict the external environment, but if we assume there are no further COVID-related construction stoppages, we expect to have a sequentially similar or perhaps slightly higher number of openings in Q4. And while the current environment prevents us from being able to provide reliable new store opening guidance for 2021, our development team has built a very robust new store inventory, which under normal circumstances would lead to opening around 200 restaurants next year. As the permitting process and ground breaks become more certain in the coming months, we’ll provide as much visibility as we can around expected openings by quarter and for all of 2021. Longer term, we remain confident in our ability to more than double total number of Chipotle restaurants in the U.S.
In closing, I want to thank our incredible teams who continue to collaborate and find ways to safely serve and delight our guests in the face of unprecedented conditions. With a strong brand, a team of committed employees, and broad financial strengths, we feel well-prepared to weather any near-term COVID-related headwinds, and we remain excited about Chipotle’s powerful economic model and therefore, our long-term potential.
With that, we’re happy to take your questions. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from David Palmer of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Thanks. Jack, you mentioned two things. One was how COVID-related costs were hurting margins. Could you lay that out how you expect those to taper off, how many basis points of margin is that? And then also, just when it comes to the inevitable tapering off of mix on digital, how do you see that playing out in terms of your margins for next year? So for example, if the sales were flat to this in third quarter of ‘21, and the digital mix was say, 25% versus roughly 50%, what impact would that have on your margins as well? Thank you. Okay. Thanks, Dave. Let me take the first one first. When we look at the direct/indirect costs that we can identify related to COVID, there is about 100 basis points of margin drag. There is direct costs that we mentioned in the script, for example that I talked about. This is COVID, A, when people are excluded, they either have been exposed or they tell us that their family member that tested positive or may have been exposed, we pay those people to not work. And so, that is a piece, and that’s the most direct piece.
There’s also things like during this process, as new customers have come in and they’ve shifted to digital, there’s a higher mix with steak, and steak is a lower margin than chicken. People are buying more burritos, and this is something that’s 100% due to the digital channel. We’re bringing a lot of new customers into the digital channel. They’re starting their journey with Chipotle with burritos. And also, the other thing that we know that our customers tell us is that the burrito travels better than a bowl, and so they’re buying more burritos. They’re also adding tortillas in digital as well. And until recently, those were free and we’ve got fewer beverages.
We only, David, have about 5% of our customers. Even though 50% are coming in the restaurant to order, only 5% are staying in the restaurant, and so they’re buying a lot fewer beverages. So, those are the direct and indirect impacts that we’re seeing, and they have about 100-basis-point impact. Hard to tell how these will cycle in and cycle out. Some of these things we can control, like we can stop giving away free tortillas, and if somebody wants to buy the tortilla, they can pay a slight premium of $0.25. Other things like steak mix, we’re going to have to watch and see how that plays out.
In terms of looking forward a year from now, really hard to answer that question. I will tell you this, it all depends on delivery. Delivery is the channel that attracts a premium. And the way I would think about this is our margins were hit and the other line item, other expense line item was hit because we had about a 15% shift that was in-store customers that went to delivery. And we all know that delivery brings a much higher cost. So between now and next year and your question, if delivery shifts into in-store and shifts into order-ahead and pick-up, then I would say our margins, for sure, are headed on the way up. If delivery stays the same or increases, we’ll have some challenges. But, we think that the experimentation that we’re doing with menu prices, we think we can offset those prices and get back on to our algorithm that we’ve always talked about with our margins. Our next question comes from Katherine Fogertey of Goldman Sachs. Great. Thank you. And Jack, you walked through some of the details about passing on delivery prices through digital channels, I wonder if we could dive into that a little bit more? When you have your initial findings around this, are you seeing any shift in consumer preference here? And then, are you treating white label the same as marketplace? Yes. Katy, we are treating white label and marketplace the same in terms of menu prices. So, in a given market, we do have different prices, in different markets, different delivery prices. But if we raise prices, for example, 7% with our white label, we’re doing the same with marketplace. So, everyone is on equal footing there. And then, in terms of -- I’m sorry, what was your other question? Are you seeing any decline in consumer demand as you are…? It’s early still, Katie. But no, we’re not seeing -- we’re not seeing any decline. There might be a slight shift into order ahead and pickup, which we’d be absolutely delighted by because that’s our highest margin transaction, but no noticeable moves to call out so far. Our next question comes from David Tarantino of Baird. Please go ahead. Hi. Jack, just a quick clarification on your fourth quarter commentary on the margins. I think, you mentioned restaurant margin on an underlying basis at 21%. Is that a fourth quarter number? Because I know fourth quarter usually is a seasonally lower margin quarter. So, I guess, would that annualize as something higher? Yes, David, great, great question. That’s correct. The walk forward that we did was over to the Q4. And you’re right. Q4 and Q1 are typically seasonally lower margin quarters. Okay, great. And then, on the comps, I’m curious on your thoughts on -- you mentioned you’re cycling much tougher comparisons now related to the launch of Carne Asada. As you look underneath the surface and look at kind of seasonally adjusted sales trends on a daily basis or however you want to answer this, do you think you’re seeing a softening of the trend line, or do you think the underlying business really hasn’t changed, or maybe it’s even improved, it’s just lower because of the comparison? Yes. Listen, David. I’ll start and then Brian may want to add on as well. When we shifted from August into early September and then we started a tougher comparison in the middle of September, we saw the dollar sales trends hold up really, really well. And so, we can look at those sales trends. We understand what we expect from a seasonality standpoint. It’s a little more difficult with COVID. But, the sales trends themselves held up really well. So, the only callout that we had was as we compare to these tougher comparisons, the comp is -- we’re delighted with the fact that through the second half of September and into October so far, we’re still solidly in that mid-single-digit. So, the adjustment in the comp percentage is merely because of a tougher comparison to last year. Yes. The only thing I would add, David is, hopefully you saw this as we were talking about the two-year compounded performance. We’re getting close to being back to where we were performing pre-COVID, even though we’re still in a COVID world. And clearly, the composition of our sales are different coming from our much more significant digital business. But, we’re feeling really good about the trends we’re seeing in the business. And as Jack mentioned, the good news is, the feedback we get from customers on Carne Asada coming back is they’re really excited to have it back. And as a result, they’re coming back to Chipotle to come and get Carne Asada. Our next question comes from Jon Tower of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Great. Thanks. Just one big a little bit into the Chipotlane stores. I’m curious if you could talk a little bit about the profitability piece of those stores. I think, the 17 or so you had mentioned in the comp base. You had talked about the sales side of the equation, where they’re doing much better on a comp basis and the digital mix is higher. But obviously, you’re seeing in some of your stores today due to the higher delivery fees, some margin pressure. So, can you talk about where that sits today on a comparable basis versus the average store base out there? Yes. I was just going to say, there’s a couple of different angles to this. First of all, we look at our comp base, the Chipotlane restaurants are about 10% higher than non-Chipotlane for our comp restaurant in that -- in the same cohort or open for more than 12 months. So right out of the box, that 10% equates to about $200,000 in volume. That’s about 200 basis points in margin right there. The other thing is even though we have about 10% higher overall digital, our delivery in a Chipotlane is actually lower. Okay? So, while overall digital is 10% greater, the order-ahead and pickup is more like 15% greater. So, there’s a shift from the delivery component into the order-ahead, and that enhances margins as well. So, it’s at a minimum, just the sales volume alone is 200, and then that mix shift adds a meaningful margin as well. So, it’s a meaningful change in margin and therefore, a meaningful improvement in returns as well, because the Chipotlane is around $75,000 to $100,000 more expensive than a non-Chipotlane. And obviously, when you go through the math, the returns are extraordinary on that extra $100,000 investment. Yes. The only thing I would add to that is I really do think, as Jack mentioned, when you hear the results of our order-ahead business, the additional convenience, the incremental sales, I really think we’re in the phase of proving really the digital drive-thru of the future, and I’m glad we’re on the front end of it. So, obviously, we’re very optimistic about where this can take this. Our next question comes from Andrew Charles of Cowen. Please go ahead. Thanks. And Brian, a great segue to my question that you spoke about the opportunity for 6,000 ultimate Chipotle locations. And I think, you once mentioned during the quarter that Chipotlanes could ultimately be featured at the majority of Chipotle locations when you get that 6,000 number. So, I’m just curious, how many conversions of existing traditional stores Chipotlanes would this entail the long term? And as you’re presumably getting ready to do some conversions in the coming years, how are you prioritizing which stores are going to be converted from a traditional store to a Chipotlane format? Yes. So, I’ll start, and Jack, feel free to add here. We’ve mentioned this I think in the prior calls. Because of the success we’re seeing and the return on the investment that we’re seeing, we’ve pivoted aggressively into our pipeline to have Chipotlanes be the majority of what we’re going to build going forward. So, that will be a big driver of why the portfolio mix will change in the future.
And then, we’re in the early days of working through conversions. We’ve done a handful of conversions. And the thing that is I think really good news here is before, I would say there was some resistance by landlords and such to convert end caps, let’s say, we’re not seeing that resistance. And we’re also having some success with the idea of even relocating when it makes a lot of sense to do that. So, it’s going to be a combination of, we’ve got Chipotles that are now 20 years old, and when the opportunity presents to relocate, we look at it from a standpoint of relocating so we can add Chipotlane. And then, we’re starting to see much more traction with landlords being willing to work with us on the conversion, and we’re also seeing nice results from the conversions that we’ve tested to date. So that’s what gives us the confidence of saying that Chipotlane is going to play a major role in our portfolio as you look out into the out years. Jack, I don’t know if you want to add anything. No, Brian, I think you said it perfectly. The key there is even our oldest markets, those are the sites that are coming up for renewal, either they’re coming up to either exercise an option or they’re coming up to the end of the term. And so, a nice thing there is because landlords are more agreeable, even in our oldest markets, which don’t have a whole lot of new stores over the coming three to five years, we can do a lot of conversions and a lot of relocs. So, we’re very optimistic about it. Just a follow-up to that. Is the conversion relocation opportunity for 2021 going to be greater than what you saw -- what you’re able to achieve in 2020 from relo and conversion opportunity perspective? It’s early to tell, but I would expect that we would see a step-up in conversions and relos next year compared to this year, and then a step-up the year after that as well. Because when you just go back to 10 and 20 years ago, and these are the leases that are coming up, we had an increasing number of openings, back in that 10-year period, that 20-year period. So, the opportunity should increase every year. So, I would expect to see a step-up each and every year. Hard to exactly quantify at this early stage though. Our next question comes from Nicole Miller of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Just one point of clarification, and it might be self-explanatory, but I hate to make assumptions at this point. Jack, can you just go ahead and find what a mid-single-digit comp is for you? I mean, I tempted o take the comp this quarter and just shave off about 200 basis points from year-over-year compares. But, maybe you’ll help us figure that out if you’re at the lower or the higher end of that range? Yes. Nicole, listen. At this early stage of the quarter, when I say -- when we say mid-single digits, we’re thinking out of 4, 5, 6 within that range. Of course, week-to-week, it’s going to change based on weather and other things, but it’s solidly within that range. Then a question, Brian, you had mentioned 17 million loyalty members more than some sporting events. So, it really begs the question, at least for me, what is the appropriate level of spend? I think, you’re around the 3% range for this year. And understandably, you would be getting with more sales and more units, more dollars to spend. But, the big global brands, which it seems where Chipotle is headed, they’re spending 5%. So, when would you pull the trigger on marketing? Yes. Look, I think, the good news is we’re starting to get a lot of leverage out of that 17 million database. And obviously, it’s served us very well, especially during kind of the environment where more traditional marketing channels probably haven’t had the viewership that they’ve had in the past. So, I think, the way we’ve approached it, Nicole, is we want to look at where we’re getting a return for every investable dollar. And the good news is, Chris and the team continue to find great ways to drive purchases with our marketing dollars. So, we’re less fixated on -- in the future, what’s the right percentage. We’re more fixated on what’s going to be the right dollar amount, so that we can continue to get great returns and continue to drive sales the way we have to date. So, I think, I’ve mentioned this in the past, not opposed to spending more when we know we’ve got opportunities that would result in great return. Our next question comes from Sharon Zackfia of William Blair. Please go ahead. I guess, a point of clarification. Could you help us understand after the delivery price increase, kind of what the gap is between non-delivery and delivery price points? And then, on development, is $200 million kind of the right yearly cadence at this point, or is there some pent-up kind of flow-over units that are flowing into 2021, and so, we shouldn’t think of $200 million as maybe the right number beyond next year? So, I’ll tackle the first one and then tackle your prior question too, and then Jack, chime in. So, look, I think, what we’ve been doing is continuing to test out alternative formats. And the good news, as we’ve gotten more and more scale in our digital business, the alternative formats like a Chipotlane are proving to us that we’ve got more viable opportunities for Chipotle, both in developed markets and emerging markets. So, we’re feeling really good about getting back to 200. And I think, I’ve mentioned this in the past, we think we’ve got the opportunity to go beyond 200. So, as we get further along and we better understand the impact that COVID’s going to have on building going forward, we’ll be able to give you better guidance. But, I think what we’re trying to share with you guys is we’ve got a great pipeline. We’ve got great formats that give us great returns, and we’re feeling really bullish on the ability to get back to building 200 restaurants. And then, our hope is we’ll go beyond that in the future.
And then, your other question on -- was it delivery margins, was that right, relative to... No. It was really from a consumer standpoint. So, what would be the average difference in price points right now with the test between delivery and non-delivery? Oh, so -- yes, we’ve got a couple of different tests in place, anywhere from a 7% tests that we’ve got, a 13% test that we have, and we even have 17% test in menu prices. The thing I would remind you is, remember, before COVID, we were charging $3 for delivery. In all those scenarios now, what we’ve done is we’ve kept the delivery fee at $1, so the effective price on the transaction is only 2 to 3 points higher. So, like, when you look at the total cost, it ends up being about 2% to 3% more than what they were used to paying for delivery before we started promoting the delivery channel, which obviously COVID, I think, was the right thing to do to pivot to that channel and get the digital business going.
So, all in all, it flows in the totality of about 2% to 3%. Jack, was there anything on that one? No. That was it, Brian. Just, Sharon, to give you an idea, the 7, the 13, the 17, they wash out to on average to be low double-digit kind of increase. But, Brian made the key point about we offset that in our white label with lowering the delivery fee in $3 to $1. So, for folks that are shopping in our white label, it’s a really, really good value. If they’re shopping in marketplace, it depends on what the others are charging for their delivery fee, which we don’t have control over. Yes. That’s a good point Jack. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays. Two questions. One, just as we think about the volumes versus the margin correlation, which you’ve talked about many times in the past, it seems like the two are back to moving lockstep. I think you’ve noted that this third quarter, the AUVs are in the $2.2 million range. And I think, you said the underlying margin would have been 21% or actually 22%, if you back out the 100 basis-point kind of COVID hit. So one, I just want to make sure I’m getting that right. And then, it seems like your peers are talking more and more about maybe doing more with less, perhaps seeing some cost savings through COVID that seem like they’re sustainable. So, I’m wondering whether you’re seeing some of those cost savings, whereas there is potential to see restaurant margin reaccelerate faster than any AUV. And then, I had one follow-up. I think, you’re thinking about it right. The key to note is that we know that there is a gap, a temporary gap, some driven by COVID, some driven by other things. But, we know that what it will take to get from where we are today to what the algorithm is. The key to note is that we’re not going to be in a hurry to get there. We know what levers to pull. We know how to close that gap, so we get all the way to that algorithm. We’ll pull those at the right time and the right place, so that we don’t, for example, disrupt consumer demand for Chipotle. But, it’s important for you guys to know that these are levers that we know that we can pull. We know that we can deliver the margin that -- the full margin potential that we know is there, but we’ll be very, very patient in doing it. Got it. And then, just a follow-up in terms of the -- if there was a silver lining to come out of this very difficult pandemic, it does seem like commodity is not a big issue, and you’re seeing nice leverage, labor inflations easing seemingly and you’re seeing some leverage, real estate costs sounds like things are getting better and maybe locations are becoming more favorable. So, I’m wondering whether you see that the same way. And maybe how you’d prioritize the magnitude of those benefits, whether you believe they’re all sustainable or not? Here, I’ll get started, Jack. Yes. So, I think, the way we would look at it is, in our business, we always plan for the unexpected. So, our approach has been when opportunities present itself, we want to make sure we take advantage of it. When challenges present themselves, we want to make sure we have plans in place to handle them. You’ve mentioned some things that may prove to be some tailwinds going forward. But, one thing I’ve learned about these businesses, we can expect the unexpected. So, look, where there’s tailwinds, we’ll make sure we capture it; where there’s headwinds, we’ll figure out how to maneuver through it. So, Jack, I don’t know if you want to add anything specific to that. Yes. Brian, I think that was well said. And we are seeing, for example, our teams in the field are doing a fantastic job, not just the peeping, their team’s sake, not just making sure the customer is safe but also running the business well. And so, they really are doing a very great job. You hinted this in your first question about some opportunities or some savings. They’re doing a great job of managing things like M&R, managing things like food cost. The fact that digital has become a much bigger part of the business. We always charge when somebody orders extra steak and digital, it’s the only way to do it. So, there are some advantages there, and those are helping us along the way. Our goal will be to Brian’s point is to make sure that we can hold out of those as we deal with future challenges ahead of us. Our next question will come from Peter Saleh of BTIG. Please go ahead. Brian, I wanted to ask about the Chipotle’s value proposition. Historically, Chipotle has been a better value for the consumer relative to many of its peers and its competitors. Over the past couple of years, you guys have been raising menu prices and introducing higher price point items like Carne Asada, and now I think you’re talking about raising delivery menu prices somewhat. So, can you talk about the value proposition, how you see it, and any insight you may have into the value scores, especially through the pandemic? Yes, sure. So, here’s the great news is our value proposition continues to only get stronger. So, you’ve got to remember, 60% of what we sell are chicken burritos and bowls, and those are still great meals purchased for less than 8 bucks on our menus. And even when you look at other channels like delivery where there’s some additional costs associated with it, we still then maintain our same value gap relative to peers because a lot of people are pricing a lot higher than what we are in the delivery channel. So, the feedback we get consistently is the food’s delicious, the customization is unlike anywhere else I get, and the price I have to pay for that at the speed of which I get it, this is still a tremendous value proposition. And I think it’s -- well, I know based on the surveys we put out there, we’re continuing to get feedback that our trust is going up and our value is going up. So, these are obviously customer surveys. But, we feel really good about the strength of the brand because of those metrics where we have strength, which is food quality/food integrity, trust, speed, customization and then not surprising when you have all good things in those areas, you get really good value scores. So, it remains very strong. Our next question comes from Dennis Geiger of UBS. Please go ahead. Brian, I wanted to ask a bit more about new product innovation and whether there’s much help that you can share on kind of takeaways from some of the products that you mentioned that are in test? And maybe what that’s done to your excitement level, what we’ll call it as it relates to broader rollout eventually? And just related to that, I guess, as the results of this ADA process to date, have they increased the rate of new product rollout as you kind of hone the process and the rate of success as you hone that process over time? Just curious your thoughts there. Thank you. Yes, sure. Well, look, we’re feeling really good about the process. We’ve had some really powerful initiatives. Chipotlane is one of them that went through the process. Obviously, menu items like Carne Asada, Queso, Tractor Beverage, these things are all proving that our process works to identify the winners so that we bring those forward. And we do it in a way that protects the integrity of our financial model and the integrity of our operating model, while giving the customer what they want and sometimes leading the customer in food.
Some of the things that I’m really excited about is, look, I’m really fired up about this cauliflower rice, I’m really fired up about the quesadilla, for two reasons. One, the quesadilla is proving to be very effective in our test markets in a digital channel execution, which keeps the channel very much engaged for the customer. And I think we’ll continue to make it a sticky and acquisition tool for people to come into the business.
And then the cauliflower rice, I think, is just in Chipotle’s wheelhouse of continuing to push real wholesome ingredients done in a delicious way. And I’m fortunate that we’ve got that in Orange County, so I get to have you cauliflower rice with some frequency and it’s just that, it’s delicious.
And the guys are working on some additional things that I think we’ve mentioned that you’ll see us continue to roll out into various test markets. But, the good news is, the ones that didn’t do so well, we haven’t rolled those out naturally. So, the stage-gate process is working. The ones that work, we move forward to national, the ones that don’t work, we learn from it and stop the trains from just moving down the tracks. So, it’s working. Our next question comes from Sara Senatore of Bernstein. Please go ahead. Just two clarifications, if I may. The first is just, Brian, you said that people are coming back for Carne Asada that’s securing from your customers. I guess, so the implication, as I understand it is that even though your compares are still tough, you do have this extra pull, if you will, on your menu. So, I don’t want to put words in your mouth, but is that right? There are people who maybe don’t come from the menu without the Carne Asada but become when it’s on. So, that was the first clarification.
And then, just on the margin, I know you’ve gotten a lot of questions there. Was there any savings from not having dining rooms open? We’ve heard that from some other companies that just being able to sort of from most of the sales through either drive-through or carry-out does allow some labor savings. And I was just curious if that’s true as we think about more normalization of sales? Thanks. Yes. So, the first question on Carne Asada, here’s what I think you should know. The good news is even when people come in for the first time for Carne Asada, what we do see is their second or third purchases, they move within the menu. So, they experiment with chicken or they experiment with our regular steak. And it proves to be pretty sticky. So, it’s -- yes, I’m sure we can pull forward some frequency with Carne Asada, we’ll get some new users in with Carne Asada. But the good news is, it proves to be sticky because they love the Chipotle experience. They love the Carne Asada, but they love the Chipotle experience. And so, I think, that’s why you’re seeing us in a COVID environment being able to lap a Carne Asada initiative that was widely successful a year ago, because we’re getting both. We’re getting frequency play and we’re getting some new users into the business.
And then, your second question was -- can you remind me what the second question was? Yes. Just on margins, were there any kind of savings from a different labor metrics, because you don’t have dine-in? Yes. So, I think, Jack kind of outlined some of these things where our teams have done a really great job of flexing between the frontline and the digital line. The good news is our frontlines now are open and I think it’s like 90% of our restaurants almost. And obviously, we’re doing really smart things from a labor management standpoint. But, we still operate our dining rooms. And we’ve committed to making the dining room experience really safe. So, we’ve invested in things like the steward, and that’s an important position to give people confidence to come in and get takeout. So, there are some places where we’ve seen efficiencies and we’ve captured those efficiencies. And the teams have done a great job of managing the labor effectively for where the business is, which is now split 50-50 between digital and the frontline. So, I think, where we are able to capture the savings, we capture them. And then, in the other areas where it’s necessary for us to invest to ensure there is a confident work environment for the employee and customer, we do that as well.
Jack, I don’t know if you want to add anything to that? Yes. Brian, I think, it was really well said. The other thing that I would just point out, Sara, is that some of the other like traditional fast food, if they have 90% of the business going through the drive-thru, they have almost nobody that’s really pending to the dining room. And so, I know that some folks are hesitant to even reopen the dining room or if they can keep it closed, that will be great. That’s not really an option for us for the reasons that Brian mentioned. We still want to have our frontline staffed and ready to go. We still have half of our sales that are going through that frontline. And so, but having said that, definitely, there’s been efficiency inherent shift of the business going from 20% digital to 50%. And Scott and the team out in the field have captured that efficiency and that has well served. Our next question comes from Lauren Silberman of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Just a follow-up on the delivery menu prices. With $1 delivery fee, what menu price increase would be necessary for delivery transactions to be at parity with the dine-in transaction? And is that something that you would explore, assuming the delivery mix sustains at these levels? Yes. Look, I think, what we want to do is figure out the best way in the channel to capture the additional costs. So, we’ll figure out how we do that, whether it’s through the menu price or if there’s other ways to even be more efficient. But, we want to figure out how we understand the costs and then how we make sure we address those costs in the most effective and efficient way because we want to give the consumer the access that they want. And so, we obviously work through various iterations. And that’s why I think you heard Jack mention earlier, we’re still experimenting with various approaches. Okay. And Brian, now 18 months into the loyalty program, what can you share regarding what you’ve learned about how customers across frequency cohorts use the Chipotle brand differently? And then specific to just customers using delivery, do you see any outsized usage among light users, or new users to the brand? Yes. Well, what has been great is the delivery channel has proven to be a great access point and an acquisition tool for our digital system. And what we’ve seen is a nice increase of light, lapsed, new users into the business. Not surprising, we see more of a frequency gain with that cohort group versus somebody that’s a heavy user. The utilization, which is also really nice to see, is as they become more familiar with our app and the ability to order-ahead and do the grab and go, we see people adopt that with some really nice frequency. So, there are those occasions that are dedicated to deliveries, but there’s also these occasions for everybody in these cohorts where the order-ahead proposition makes a lot of sense. And we’re very bullish on being able to use the data and the insights to drive the behaviors around these various occasions that maybe Chipotle before wasn’t top of mind but now they are. Our next question comes from Gregory Francfort of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Hey. Thanks for the question. I just had one quick one and then another question. Just can you remind me if there’s any big differences in the compares last year being the months? I just don’t know if you’re lapping a particularly tough or easy period in the first part of the month -- first part of the quarter. And then my question is on labor. And can you maybe give us a little bit of the backdrop on what’s happening on the labor front in terms of turnover the ability to source labor? And it seems like you guys have seen -- done a really good job of managing that. I’m just kind of curious if you could talk a little bit about that environment. Thanks. Sure. So, the first question is really easy to answer. The fourth quarter, we’re rolling over a plus 13 off of the heels of our successful Carne Asada launch last year as well as a lot of the throughput gains that we made, operationally. So, that’s why we mentioned, starting in mid-September, the rollover got harder. The good news is, when you look at the two-year compounded growth rate, we’re continuing to perform in that 20% range. So, we feel really good about where we are.
And then, your second question was -- sorry, I forgot what the second question is. You’re getting a lot from all of us. So, just on the labor side, the ability -- new talent and turnover, just what that environment looks like for Chipotle? Yes. Look, I think, we’ve got a great employee value proposition. So, not surprising, we’re attracting a lot of applicants. The investments that we’ve made and the way that we’ve handled, I think, this COVID environment in regard to honoring bonuses, providing our employees with restricted stock and also giving them all the tools they need, whether it’s mental health benefits, debt-free degrees, obviously, a lot of the work around diversity and inclusion, all these things, I think, make the job really exciting. And then, you layer in the simple fact, we’re a growth company. Right? So, you’re going to come into this Company, maybe you join as a crew member, maybe you join as a kitchen manager, but we’re going to be building 200-plus restaurants, and there’s a growth opportunity for you, where in the next 18 to 24 months, you could find yourself being a manager running a restaurant.
So, that creates stability because people want those opportunities, and it also creates the ability to pull people in to want to become a part of the Chipotle culture and opportunity. So, I think, Scott and Marissa and all of our restaurant leaders are doing a terrific job of sharing the story of, look, we’re a company that cares about cultivating a better world. We do it in Food with Integrity. And we are a people business. We are going to invest in our people and do what we need, so that they can be successful and that their development hopefully results in their ambitions that they have. So, we’re seeing a very-positive situation out there right now. Our next question comes from Andy Barish of Jefferies. Please go ahead. A question on the Carne Asada price premium. I think, you took it up this year. Can you just give us a sense of sort of on margin neutrality, how much higher would it go and just comparing versus sort of your basket of product mix? And then, how much of an impact you expect in the 4Q versus, I think, it was about a 50 basis-point headwind a year ago when you launched it? Yes. So obviously -- go ahead, Jack. Go ahead. Andy, just real quickly, you’re in the ballpark [Technical Difficulty]. Yes. I’m not sure if you heard Jack on that. He was kind of faint on that. But… Yes. I didn’t know if it was my phone or your phone. No. Yes, he got faint there. But, I think, what he was saying is the good news is Carne Asada is proving to be incremental. And obviously, we priced it such that from a penny profit standpoint, it looks really good. And I think, the numbers that you talked about are pretty consistent with what we see as the margin impact. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Brian Niccol, Chairman and CEO, for any closing remarks. All right. Thank you. And thanks everybody for taking the time and for all the questions. I do want to just take a moment to recognize, like even despite being in a COVID situation, this third quarter really I think talks to the power of our brand and the power of our culture. If you just stop and think for a second, we had record sales with a two-year number close to 20%. We did over $1 billion in delivery now, year-to-date. We’re $1 billion of order-ahead business year-to-date. And we have a really strong balance sheet with $1 billion of cash.
So, I think we are also at the same time moving our margins on a way to be consistent with the model that we’ve been talking about. And I think, we’ve talked about that quite a bit. And obviously, we continue to invest in our creativity and innovation through the stage-gate process. And I think, one of the things that I’m really excited about is how we’re proving I think the digital drive-thru of the future with Chipotlane, which I think is going to be a huge impact going forward. And I’m really excited to be talking about building over 200 restaurants again.
So, we’re obviously going to continue to invest in our people, obviously continue to invest in our culture because we know that results in driving best-in-class operations. And our teams, again, I just want to say a huge thank you. They have stayed focused. They have committed to the COVID protocols, so that we can keep each other safe and can serve our customers in a safe way. And, I think my takeaway from all this is, the brand is powerful, our future is really bright, and we’re going to continue to make progress on cultivating a better world, really through our intention around Food with Integrity.
So, I look forward to the next quarter when we can share our results. But so proud of where we are today and just so proud of our team and our culture for how we’ve navigated through these really challenging times of late. It’s demonstrated that when you do right things for your people, you do the right things for your community, you get rewarded with great results. So, thank you for your time. And we’ll talk soon. Bye, bye. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. And you may now disconnect.","all participants will be in listen-only mode . i would now like to turn the conference over to Ashish Kohli, head of Investor Relations .",0.0

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Ashish Kohli, Head of Investor Relations. Please, go ahead. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter and fiscal year-end 2020 earnings call. By now you should have access to our earnings press release. If not, it may be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.chipotle.com.
I'll begin by reminding you that certain statements and projections made in this presentation about our future business and financial results constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current business and market expectations and our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Please see the risk factors contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our Form 10-Qs for a discussion of risks that may cause our actual results to vary from these forward-looking statements.
Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found via the link included on the Presentation page within the Investor Relations section of our website.
We will start today's call with prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer, after which we will take your questions. Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A session.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Brian. Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report a strong ending to what has been a challenging year. Even today a few Chipotle restaurants remain fully closed, while only about 60% of our dining rooms are open with reduced capacity, with the rest being available for to-go services.
Despite this challenging backdrop, our results demonstrate that Chipotle restaurants with the right leaders and culture, along with excellent culinary, can deliver outstanding performance in any environment. Most importantly, none of this would be possible without our dedicated team members that strive to deliver a great guest experience on a daily basis.
The pandemic has presented new challenges for all of us and our team has successfully navigated every one of them. I thank our team members for their ongoing commitment to serving our guests, as well as supporting each other and could not be prouder of their efforts.
Before we dive into our financial results let me reflect back on 2020 and highlight a few key accomplishments that have helped propel Chipotle's mission of cultivating a better world. These include, a paramount focus on industry-leading protocols that help ensure the safety and well-being of our employees and guests, providing jobs with industry-leading benefits to nearly 88,000 people and paying out nearly $40 million in discretionary bonuses and assistance pay to our restaurant team members, as well as over $13 million of tuition costs for employees furthering their education; prioritizing diversity, equality and inclusion efforts across the company; and raising nearly $4 million in support of organizations; helping underserved communities; and investing in the future of farming through grants, long-term contracts and the Aluminaries Project 2.0.
As a purpose-driven organization, we're already hard at work identifying ways that we can make a positive impact on the world in 2021. We are optimistic about the future and look forward to continuing to deliver on our promises and passionately play an active supportive role in our communities.
Now, let's focus on our business performance where for the fourth quarter we reported sales of $1.6 billion, representing 11.6% year-over-year growth, which was fueled by 5.7% comparable restaurant sales growth; restaurant-level margins of 19.5% which is 30 basis points higher than last year; and earnings per share adjusted for unusual items of $3.48, representing an increase of 21.7% year-over-year.
Comparable restaurant sales were fairly consistent in each month of Q4, due to a combination of factors, including healthy demand for Carne Asada, strength in our digital platform and the delivery menu price increase. Q1 has also started on a very positive note, with comparable restaurant sales for January accelerating to around 11% despite a double digit comparison.
Even with a resurgence in COVID cases the two-year compounded comp stack in Q4 was a robust 19.9%, which is similar to the 20.2% we delivered last quarter and highlights the resiliency of the Chipotle brand.
In light of the ever-changing environment we all experienced in 2020, our full-year performance showed good progress with sales growing 7.1% to reach $6 billion, driven by a 1.8% comp, 161 new restaurant openings and digital sales of $2.8 billion, which grew 174% versus the prior year.
As you can see from these results, our key strategies continue to resonate with guests and position us to win today, while we create the future. What really excites me and the entire leadership team is our vision of having more than 6,000 restaurants and expanding AUVs above $2.5 million, with margins at or above 25%, all of which is a question of when, not if.
Let me now provide a brief update on each of these strategies, which I believe still have plenty of runway. These are: number one, making the brand visible, relevant and loved; number two, utilizing a disciplined approach to creativity and innovation; number three, leveraging digital capabilities to drive productivity and expand access, convenience and engagement; number four, engaging with customers through our loyalty program; and number five, running successful restaurants with a strong culture that provides great food with integrity while delivering exceptional in restaurant and digital experiences.
Beginning with our marketing programs which are generating attractive returns by driving culture driving a difference and ultimately driving purchase. Our creative marketing initiatives across both traditional and digital channels continue to be successful in attracting new users to Chipotle, as well as motivating existing customers to come more often.
Whether it was switching our Halloween celebration to an entirely digital offering for the first time unveiling a new line of Chipotle merchandise ahead of the holiday season or launching Real Foodprint a sustainability impact tracker that shows how Chipotle ingredients are better for the planet, the marketing team did a terrific job consistently enhancing our brand and purpose using the right message with the right vehicle.
Traditional advertising also remains an important marketing tool for Chipotle. We connected and engaged with guests through our Behind the Foil TV campaign and a new avocado journey spot highlighting real ingredients, real cooking techniques and real employees. We also featured our making an order spot that highlights the ease of customizing your order on our app to continue to drive awareness of digital ordering.
And last week we announced our first-ever Super Bowl commercial that will air during the second quarter beginning this Sunday. The spot is titled Can a Burrito Change the World and highlights Chipotle's commitment to cultivating a better world through its real food, sustainable sourcing and commitment to the farming industry.
Supplementing these efforts are a steady flow of new menu innovation that is validated by our stage-gate process which gives new and existing customers even more reasons to visit Chipotle. Since our initial offering of carne asada ended last year we continued hearing from our guests that they wanted it back.
So we found a way to source more tender cuts of steak that met our Food with Integrity standards and brought it back for a limited time across the U.S. and Canada as well as in France for the first time. The relaunch which we expect to last through early March is going well and we're encouraged that the incidence mix is similar to what we saw last year.
In addition, in January we launched Cilantro-Lime Cauliflower Rice for limited time across the U.S. and Canada. We're excited to introduce this plant-powered better-for-you option that aligns with the latest health trends and emphasizes the benefits of real food.
With only four grams of net carbs per serving, it puts a delicious twist on Chipotle's classic rice recipe by using the same fresh real ingredients and culinary techniques. Early feedback has been outstanding. Cauliflower rice is definitely on trend a great reason for new guests to try Chipotle for the first time or entice existing guests to visit more often and it keeps our Lifestyle Bowls platform top of mind.
We have two other menu items currently being tested. The first is quesadillas which is available as a digital-only menu option in a few test markets. We continue to make operational progress and remain optimistic about the potential for quesadillas to be available nationwide in the near future.
The second item is our smoked brisket which is currently being tested and showing encouraging results. I personally love the richness of our smoked brisket recipe as it delivers a flavor unlike anything else at Chipotle. We are gaining valuable feedback on both of these items and we'll update you on their progress as well as other menu items that are in early development as they move through our stage-gate process.
Moving to the next strategic driver our digital platform which continues to be a big beneficiary from guests adopting the digital off-premise occasion. Q4 digital sales grew 177% year-over-year to $781 million and represented 49% of sales. This was consistent with Q3 digital sales and mix highlighting our ongoing momentum and the fact that Chipotle is top of mind for a lot more eating and dining occasions than we were in the past.
We are not stopping there. We've made our digital channel even more convenient with easy ordering in the Chipotle app and website enhancements such as unlimited customization, contactless delivery and group ordering. As a result and I mentioned this earlier, full year digital sales were $2.8 billion representing 46% of total sales and growing 174% year-over-year.
What an amazing accomplishment. At this sales rate our average restaurant delivers a digital AUV of $1.1 million. With this success we will not allow complacency to set in. Rather we will continue to look for ways to further enhance our digital ecosystem. For example, we just announced a car-side pickup pilot in San Jose as an additional access point for our guests.
In addition we are opening up more and more Chipotlanes and are in the early stages of testing alternative formats like our first-ever digital-only restaurant outside of West Point. This new prototype allows us to enter more trade areas that wouldn't support a full-size restaurant and allows for greater flexibility with future locations. It's early days but this location has outperformed our expectations thus far.
During the quarter about half of the digital sales came via order-ahead and pickup transactions or digital pickup orders as we refer to them with the remainder coming from the delivery channel. However, our overall digital mix moved up about 50% late in the quarter as COVID restrictions toughened, largely driven by an increase in digital pickup orders. I'm pleased to report that the strong digital momentum has continued into January with our digital mix remaining in the low-50% range.
Another area where we saw a big benefit in 2020 is our rewards program which added over 10 million members in the last year and currently has nearly 19.5 million enrolled members. This gives us the ability to communicate organically with a large and passionate community of Chipotle fans.
We have focused on strengthening our creative and analytical capabilities by using predictive modeling to ensure that our members feel known and valued as we elevate their relationship with Chipotle. We strategically share brand and promotional messages with personalized content weekly. In addition we reach customers with dedicated journeys focused on welcoming new members growing frequency and minimizing lapsing behavior.
There are preprogrammed touch points in place to drive customer value across their life cycle including a keen focus on retaining digital customers who have experienced the brand in new ways over the last year. Although Chipotle Rewards and its CRM capability have been active for less than two years, we have already made significant progress and have further enhancements planned in the coming months that we expect will continue to drive frequency increases across our customer segments.
Finally, I want to spend some time on our restaurant operations, where the team stayed focused on safety, reliability and excellent culinary, as it seamlessly adapted to abrupt changes in guest needs and ordering patterns. This hasn't been easy, especially as the number of COVID cases began to spike and at times impacted our staffing capabilities. But they have been up to the challenge and I'm so proud of our operational leaders and team members. They have been unwavering in the desire and execution of the right things for each other, our customers, our community and our business.
And as I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, Chipotle has continued to reward and invest in our team members to ensure we are creating an environment that allows our employees to develop and thrive in their career not only today but also in the future. We offer best-in-class benefits, coupled with training, development and promotional opportunities that foster a learning culture for continual growth.
Turnover continues to be relatively stable and we are seeing plenty of great applicants for open positions to staff our expected growth in AUV and new restaurant openings. In fact, we held our first national hiring event of the year called Coast-to-Coast Career Day in mid-January with a goal of employing 15,000 new restaurant team members across the US. We had an overwhelming response and feel fortunate to have a reputation for attracting and developing great talent.
In closing, I believe our performance in 2020 was in some ways even more impressive than what we achieved in 2019 and highlights that the Chipotle brand has remained visible and flexible in order to stay relevant. Our ability to pivot and adapt to the rapidly changing needs of our guests is a testament to the durability of our model and the strength of our team members.
My sincere thanks to our employees for their passion to make Chipotle a welcoming place for all and a special place to work. As we look ahead, the rollout of vaccines gives us hope that the world can return to a more normal environment at some point during 2021. And I'm optimistic that resiliency will prevail as people want to get back together to share a meal and share some stories.
In the meantime, we're ready to navigate through any potential challenges. With world-class talent, an inclusive culture, strong business fundamentals and deep financial strength, we feel well prepared to emerge even stronger post-COVID and continue to serve and delight our guests.
With that here's Jack to walk you through the financials. Thanks, Brian and good afternoon, everyone. Despite ongoing challenges related to COVID, we're pleased to report solid fourth quarter results with sales growing 11.6% year-over-year to $1.6 billion as comp sales grew 5.7%. Restaurant-level margin of 19.5% was 30 basis points higher than last year and earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $3.48, representing a 21.7% year-over-year increase.
The fourth quarter had a non-recurring tax benefit was partially offset by expenses related to legal reserves, restaurant asset impairments and closure costs, transformation expenses and other adjustments, which netted to positively impact our earnings per share by $3.21 leading to GAAP earnings per share of $6.69. For the full year, sales increased 7.1% to $6 billion on a comp increase of 1.8%. Restaurant-level margins were 17.4%, a decrease of 310 basis points. And we generated earnings per share adjusted for unusual expenses of $10.73, a decrease of 23.6% over last year.
We had non-recurring tax benefit that was partially offset by expenses related to legal reserves, restaurant asset impairment and closure costs, as well as our transformation that positively impacted our earnings per share by $1.79 leading to GAAP earnings per share of $12.52.
While the uncertainty from COVID makes it difficult to provide comp guidance for full year 2021, we remain optimistic about our future prospects as evidenced by a great start to Q1 with January comps accelerating to roughly 11%, despite a very difficult comparison.
Sales in last week of January were in the high-single digits with winter weather across the country contributing to the lower comp. Assuming the pandemic doesn't worsen, we expect our Q1 comp to be in the mid- to high-teens range given an easier comparison during the second half of March.
Food cost were 31% in Q4, a decrease of 210 basis points from last year and this was due primarily to menu price increases along with better waste control, partially offset by fewer sales of high-margin beverages and higher dairy pricing. In Q1, we expect food costs to remain right around 31% as the benefit from a full quarter of menu price increases will be offset by higher cost menu items such as cauliflower rice as well as slightly higher avocado prices.
Labor costs for the quarter were 25.4%, a decrease of 110 basis points from last year. This decrease was driven primarily by sales leverage and efficiencies related to digital orders, partially offset by COVID-related expenses including exclusion pay as well as normal labor inflation.
We expect labor costs to be right around 25% during Q1, as expected benefit from sales leverage is offset by ongoing COVID-related expenses. Other operating costs for the quarter was 17.9% an increase of 310 basis points from last year, due primarily to higher delivery fees in the quarter.
Delivery expenses were elevated year-over-year given the significant growth in delivery with delivery sales now nearly 25% of total sales. To help improve the economics on this premium access point, we have implemented several delivery menu price differentials with a weighted average being right around 13%. We have seen modest resistance thus far and we'll continue to monitor and adjust pricing as appropriate at the market level or at the restaurant level.
Marketing and promo costs for the quarter were 3.9%, a decrease of 20 basis points from last year. But as expected, it was 130 basis point sequential increase from Q3 to support Carne Asada and the latest brand messaging under our Behind the Foil campaign. We expect marketing spend to be near 4% in Q1, which would be the highest quarterly level during 2021 in order to support new menu items as well as the upcoming Super Bowl ad.
As a result of the higher anticipated marketing demand and ongoing momentum in our delivery business, we expect other operating costs to be right around 17% in Q1. The Q4 restaurant-level margin was 19.5%, while our trailing 12-month average unit volumes were roughly $2.2 million, which is back to our pre-COVID level. We expect to close much of this margin gap versus the 22% expected at this volume in 2021 as COVID-related impacts and delivery economics normalize and as quarterly marketing expenses even out.
Note that, some of this gap relates to delivery accounting as increased delivery menu prices as well as delivery and service fees had the effect of grossing up which may create the appearance that margin algorithm gap is widening. Therefore, we now disclose our AUVs with and without the delivery menu price increase to provide better clarity and transparency.
G&A for the quarter was $124 million on a GAAP basis or $114 million on a non-GAAP basis excluding roughly $7 million for settlement of several older legal matters and nearly $3 million related to transformation expenses.
G&A also includes $90 million in underlying G&A $21 million related to non-cash stock comp, and a $4 million bonus performance adjustment due to our strong performance in 2020 despite the pandemic. We are still in the early innings of our growth life cycle and therefore continue to make important G&A investments in 2020 despite the COVID pandemic. We saw an uptick in Q4 underlying G&A due to technology investments, customer service enhancements, increased headcount as well as higher medical claims.
Looking ahead to Q1, we expect underlying G&A expense to carry forward in the $90 million range as we continue to make tech investments the majority of which are revenue-generating to bolster our expanding digital and loyalty platform. These include initiatives that are customer-facing like app upgrades as well as behind-the-scenes initiatives like a new labor scheduling tool.
In addition, we also plan to increase headcount in order to support our expected accelerated growth. Even with this elevated spend our goal remains to deliver leverage on this line item relative to our sales growth. Stock comp will likely be around $23 million each quarter in 2021 although this amount could move up or down based on our actual performance. We also expect to recognize around $4 million of employer taxes in Q1 associated with shares that vest at the beginning of our fiscal year.
Lastly, our 2018 performance shares were modified to account for unplanned effects of COVID. This will result in a GAAP accounting charge of about $24 million for both Q1 and Q2, and about $8 million in Q3 and Q4. We plan to present non-GAAP results without these unusual charges to clearly show our underlying business performance.
Our effective tax rate for Q4 was negative 62.2% on a GAAP basis and 24.6% on a non-GAAP basis. The difference is due to recognizing a net operating loss for tax purposes in 2020, which we expect to carry back to the preceding five years. We generated an NOL for tax purposes due to several factors, including the impact of COVID increased tax deduction for equity, vesting and exercises accelerated tax depreciation deductions and various tax planning initiatives.
An income tax benefit is generated due to the difference in federal tax rates between 2020 and the years that the federal NOL will be carried back to. For fiscal 2021, we estimate our underlying effective tax rate to be in the 25% to 27% range though it may vary based on discrete items, such as stock option exercises. This range assumes no change to current income tax rate. And if corporate tax rates change, as a result of tax reform under the Biden administration, we'll revisit our estimated effective tax rate.
Turning now to the balance sheet, where we ended Q4 with $1.1 billion in cash restricted cash and investments and no debt along with a $600 million untapped credit facility. We're privileged to have this financial strength with which to make ongoing strategic investments in our people, our business, and our communities to further differentiate Chipotle brand and support our expected growth for 2021 and beyond.
We didn't buy back any stock in Q4, but if our business continues to improve and economy continues to stabilize we will likely begin buying again in late Q1 or early Q2. One area that definitely benefited from our strong cash position is restaurant design and real state development, where we remain diligent and aggressive while many of our peers pulled back. I'm really impressed by the hard work of our development and operations team as they opened 61 new restaurants in the fourth quarter with 42 including a Chipotlane.
For the full year, they successfully navigated construction and permitting challenges and opened 161 new restaurants with 100, including a Chipotlane. Remarkably, this was towards the high end of the 150 to 165 range we provided before the onset of the pandemic.
As of year-end, we had a total of 170 Chipotlanes, including five conversions. Performance for these formats continues to be stellar. The digital gap versus non-Chipotlane restaurants remains around 10% driven entirely by higher-margin digital pickup orders. And sales at the Chipotlane cohort continued to outperform the non-Chipotlane results from the same open period.
In fact non-comp Chipotlane sales are opening close to our existing restaurant AUV versus historical peak productivity in the mid to high 80% range. These results reaffirm our strategy of an accelerated pivot towards Chipotlane sites. Not only will this enhance customer access and convenience but it also helps increase new restaurant sales, margins and returns.
While 62% of new restaurants in 2020 had a Chipotlane, our goal is to have more than 70% of openings include a Chipotlane in 2021 where we anticipate opening around 200 new restaurants. Of course this development guidance assumes no major COVID related delays in 2021. Guidance also includes remodeling or relocating 10 to 15 restaurants this year to add a Chipotlane. This will allow us to learn and ensure we're getting a superior return on this investment before potentially ramping up the number of remodels and our relocations in the future.
Let me end by also expressing my gratitude to all of our team members in our restaurants and in support roles as they overcame countless challenges and embraced change to safely serve and delight our guests. It's through this collaborative effort that we've been able to achieve such an impressive performance in 2020 and continue to build momentum at the start of this year.
With that we're happy to take your questions. Thank you. And we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Nicole Miller with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Thank you, and congratulations on a great year despite all the challenges. I wanted to just talk about the go-forward estimates and opportunity around unit growth. If you remove the barriers to development that are COVID related and certainly there's no financial hurdles from a cash perspective, how fast can your current team go with a fully formed bench? Just essentially what are stretch goals that you look at internally? Yeah. Thanks Nicole. Look, I think what we're really excited about is we definitely see the opportunity getting back above 200 restaurants. And the good news is part of the reason why we're accelerating is because our operations are running so well, and we know we've got the people benched to run those restaurants. We'll continue to look for great sites. The good news is we have a lot of inbound desire for Chipotle coming from a lot of different places and we know we still have lots of places to build. So we're very optimistic about how we can accelerate from where we finished this year to 161 to getting to 200 and beyond.
So, Jack, I don't know if you want to add anything to that? No Brian. I think you said it well. Our -- Nicole, our record for a year was right around 250. We certainly can get up to that point. I don't know if it will take us a couple of years or not. But I think the sites are coming to us. As Brian mentioned, we've got the deep bench now. But we're going to do it a step at a time. We're going to go from 161 to something around this 200 level, but we certainly can go beyond that. And the cauliflower rice is outstanding. I've tried it in multiple channels. When I go into the restaurant it's a $2 upcharge. When I order through the marketplace it's a $2.25 upcharge. Is that how you're getting the pricing power? Can you just establish for us today that you're not taking 13% across the board right? There's a strategic I imagine algorithm that helps produce that pricing power? Yeah. That's exactly right Nicole. We're basically testing a lot of different pricing levers, but we are very strategic in where we choose to implement that pricing. And you're right the only place that we've taken that 13% is in the delivery channel. And effectively it plays out the way you just described it like on a cauliflower rice add-on or to your total ticket depending on what you're ordering. So -- but it's an ongoing process, it's a fluid process and we're not done working on it. Thank you. Appreciate it. Sure. And our next question will come from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Thanks. I actually had three little small questions. One you mentioned in the release that delivery added a point or so to comp in that quarter. Does that -- was that for the entire quarter, or will that be a bigger tailwind in the first quarter and beyond? I didn't catch that. Forgive me if you said that.
And then Jack just the restaurant level margins you touched on that as well about how the $19.5 million or so was short of that relationship that you would have for a $2.2 million box, i.e. that should be 22% if you get your delivery economics up to speed. Should we be thinking about -- what is the buildup that -- in that margin through the year? How fast can you close that gap in that relationship?
And I guess the last thing is when it comes to the two-year trend in comp basically if you look at The Street numbers people are thinking a mid-teens two-year or thereabout after we get vaccines. And I'm wondering how you -- I know you're not giving guidance, but how do you think about the net of people having more options but yet you're having perhaps a better daytime traffic and walk-in traffic than you would. Sorry for the three questions. Hey, Jack, you want to take the delivery and margin and then I can touch on the last piece? Yes. Sure thing Brian. I'll start with the margin because I might David ask you for a little clarity on the delivery comp question. But on the margin you heard it right. Right now we're being bogged down by some of the COVID-related expenses. There's also delivery ends up being a drag right now. But we can see as COVID-19 begins to be in the review mirror and as we have taken some action and we consider other action and how we're going to offset the margin impact of delivery I would expect by the end of the year.
And remember COVID is going to be with us for at least a quarter or two. I mean the vaccine is not going to be widely available until more like midyear. So, it's going to be more second half of the year. But I feel good about by the second half of the year that we should be closing the gap. If not all the way we'll be knocking on the door on what the margin algorithm would be. And then David maybe you can clarify parts about delivery comp. Yes. And maybe I'm misunderstanding this but I think you talked about a 13% increase -- or 13% higher prices for your delivery menu. Right. And you said a point -- I think it was in the release that it was about 100 basis point help to your comp in the quarter. Maybe that was because it was only there for part of the quarter because I would imagine that if delivery was about a quarter of your business I'm just trying to understand if that could be -- if delivery pricing could be a bigger lift in the coming quarters. That's basically what I'm getting at there. Yes. So, here let me say what delivery actually did drive in the quarter. The 13% because delivery is about 25% that ends up being an effect of like 3.25% like call it 3% 3.25% price increase. That's the impact in the quarter. And the price increase we had two, we had one in August one in early October. So, we had a full effect during the quarter. So, that's more of the impact that we had during the quarter. Got it. Okay. Thanks. And then David just in regard to your question about our -- I think it's really our confidence in where the business goes from here is kind of what you're getting at which is look I think the thing that I'm really optimistic about is we have really grown a meaningful digital business that's got access for just about every occasion you can think of. And currently we're even testing now a car-side access.
What I've seen is in the markets where we start to open those dining rooms up, you don't lose those occasions. You pick up the occasions that kind of got impacted by COVID. And it really is an and situation not an or.
Now, it's not 100% back in the dining room in some of these regions. But we're seeing 50%, 60% of the dining room business come back and we're hanging on to 85%, 80% of our digital business. And as you walk into 2021, our digital system now has 19.5 million members. And what we have seen is they like the additional access, the convenience that it provides. And they like our ability to communicate with them through that rewards program.
And so look I think January is a great example of the strength of Chipotle's business still being impacted by COVID rolling over a year ago that didn't have COVID. And I think it just shows the power of the new access points, the way we're running our restaurants, the culture that we have in our restaurants. And then ultimately our customers believe in the food believe in the purpose. So, very optimistic about where we get to.
And as Jack pointed out, I think as the year goes on you're going to continue to see us make progress on getting that algorithm back to where we said it will get to as COVID wanes and some of these expenses go away. And the delivery channel we kind of normalize it into our business going forward. Great. Thank you. Yes. And our next question will come from Chris Carril with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Hi, thanks for taking the question. So, I think last quarter you quantified about 100 basis points of direct and indirect margin drag from COVID-related costs. Can you provide an update on how these costs impacted the margins in the 4Q? And then any thoughts on how we should think about these costs over the course of the year? That would be really helpful. Why don't you take that one Jack? Yes Chris. Yes they're still in that ballpark. There's direct and indirect. Like for example we had -- pay during the quarter. So, that's where our employees have been or may have been exposed. And so they don't work. We don't want them at the restaurant but we pay them anyway. That all by itself was 50 basis points.
There's indirect items as well. Like for example we're selling less beverages. We're selling like a few more burritos and more steaks. That seems a little counterintuitive why would COVID drive that, but we have a lot of new customers coming in and they've been moving into those items.
Unclear whether that will fully normalize after the pandemic. But I would say with the direct and indirect that we know about that comp delivery, it probably stays at 50 to 100 basis points range. And then delivery all by itself [Technical Difficulty] Jack, we're losing you. I don't know if your microphone-- Sorry about that. Okay. I'll take it off speaker. Can you hear me a little better now? Yeah. That's a lot better. You were kind of – you said roughly, the same and then you started to trail off. Yeah. So it's – I would call it in that of the direct impact, it's going to be in that 50 to 100 basis point impact. And that counts things like the exclusion pay which is very direct and then product mix shifts and then does not count delivery. Delivery all by itself is going to be a pricer in this. You probably call it the 60 to 80 or 90 basis point impact. But I think the key to all of this is, we believe as COVID is starting to move into the rearview mirror as we're starting to move out of it, and combined with actions that we will take to either offset some of these costs or find other efficiencies we do think we can capture all this margin. Okay. Great. Thanks. I’ll pass it on. And our next question will come from David Tarantino with Baird. Please go ahead. Hey, good afternoon. Brian, I want to come back to this question on the interplay between the delivery channel and your in-restaurant business. And I wanted to get a gauge for what you think is possible in terms of the in-restaurant transactions returning? And I think you said, you're recapturing 50% to 60%. And I think maybe 60% of your dining rooms are still closed. So I guess, what do you think the upside is on the in-restaurant business coming back? And how much of the digital channel do you think has replaced those in-restaurant transactions I guess said differently. So? Yeah. Sure. What I would say David is, we're still seeing like that lunch occasion have a real opportunity. And what we've seen is in places where you have people moving around more for whatever their routine is, you see that occasion still happening, where they want to come into the restaurant. And look, I still think, the occasion of the dining room experience gives you something unique. It's got another level of customization, because you get to be face-to-face with how we're making your food versus the online occasion. And so when we talk to customers, there is a fair amount of people that when they have the opportunity, they will want to go back to their dining occasion. The thing that I find really promising in that is, they've also adopted new off-premise digital occasions that they're not going to abandon. And when we look at the Venn diagram, the world where it used to be they were exclusive. I only did online, and I only do in dining and there was a few that did both. That's changed. You've got a lot more people doing both. And we've got people that historically probably would not have tried it, if not for unfortunately COVID.
But they still really love that in-restaurant experience and now we're top of mind for that occasion when they're not going to be in the restaurant. So we're seeing a scenario where digital is going to prove to be very sticky and people look forward to getting back out and going into our restaurants. Great. And then, I guess, the second question is you mentioned something about with your digital marketing efforts or your loyalty program making it a priority that some of those digital customers stick. Can you just elaborate on what you're doing there? Yeah. Sure. So this is what I mentioned. We've got 19.5 million folks in this. And the team has really done a terrific job of setting up I think the right cohorts, understanding the frequency of how they need to communicate with those cohorts, and then drive home the idea of engagement and/or driving home frequency or purchasing behaviors. And we've got various journeys taking place.
I mentioned it in my prepared remarks. And what we're seeing is it does have a powerful impact on people's frequency. And the good news is we believe we're learning more every day. But what we've learned to date, I think is going to have a powerful tailwind for us going forward.
And if you think about 2020, we started the year with I think it was less than 10 million in our system. So you've got twice the amount of people that we can influence behavior with on a pretty one-to-one basis. So that's why you hear me talking about why I see this being a driver going forward. Great. Thank you. And our next question will come from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Hi. Thanks so much. First, just to follow up on the delivery costs. Jack, you said the 60 to 80 basis points of pressure or 69 – 90 whatever it was. Is that inclusive? Is that after you've taken this price increase, or was that prior? And is there – when you think about offsetting it is there a way to offset it fully? Are you thinking about you can recapture the margin elsewhere and delivery will always be of some dilution to margin but you just get it somewhere else, or is there a way you think within delivery specifically that you can fully offset that – those delivery cost outcomes? Yeah, John, here let me kind of walk through the pieces. The price increase that we took it covers the dollar cost of delivery like there's an increase in delivery this year versus last year, because so many people moved into that channel. And so the price increase we took so far it gets us to about a breakeven versus last year in terms of a dollar – from a dollar standpoint. But if you go through the math, and it's easiest to do this like on an annual basis, if you – this 13% on 25% of the business ends up being about $80,000. And so look at the average cost of delivery being about $80,000 on average per restaurant. When you take that price increase, it ends up being a 3%, 3.25%, your sales will go up by about $80,000. And so you cover those dollars, your cash flow on a per restaurant basis are the same. But if you go through the math and take the same cash flow and take 25%, which ends up being $625,000 of cash flow, that's $2.5 million at a 25% margin. And if your costs go up $80,000 and your revenue goes up by $80,000, your margin is going to go down by 80 basis points.
And so we don't make any less money, but the margin does end up being diluted just because of the math. Now we think there are things that we can do either levers, we can pull other efficiencies we can file. We think over time we can offset that, but that's just a math challenge that we're dealing with. That's helpful. And then Brian maybe just bigger picture now. You've got some more Chipotlanes under your belt. You're looking at maybe it's just early days, but a digital-only restaurant. When is the time to reexamine kind of the total opportunity of units in the US? And you haven't -- we haven't spoken about international in a long, long time. I think, France was thrown into one of the comments. Is it a moment now where you start to really think about a global opportunity and start to talk and engage with either master franchisees or your own organization how you do that, or is that still too far in the future and you've got too much on your plate right now to really engage in that? Yes. Sure. So look the first part of your question around the opportunity in the US is, we're very optimistic about Chipotlane and then the various executions we can pull off to bring Chipotle to every trade area in the United States that we think makes sense for Chipotle. And I think we've talked about that as hey, we're accelerating, we're going to get back above 200. We're within striking distance of where the max level of development we did in the past.
And so the economics look great. The new restaurant openings are opening really strong. Chipotlane continues to perform. And you see us experimenting with digital only. You'll see us experimenting with Chipotlanes only. But at the end of the day, I mean, the full business of Chipotle where you got both lines, a Chipotlane as an access point with this digital system, it's just really winning economics and there are a lot of those sites available in the US.
To your question about international, obviously, we believe Chipotle can travel beyond the United States. We're already seeing some success in Canada. And then, obviously, we've got some plans in place for places that we already have our foot in the door. So think of the UK, France specifically. And so you're going to see us starting to really use kind of our stage-gate process to move those markets along. And then we'll evaluate other regions accordingly. We've not made decisions on how we want to enter those other markets. And frankly, we haven't laid out exactly the order of how we're going to do it.
For now, we want to deliver the US. And where we already have some presence, we're going to start leaning into to see how much more upside there is. We have an idea. And then, obviously, we're going to evaluate where we go beyond the markets that we currently are. But when we've done some research, what is clear is people love the purpose of Food with Integrity. They love the customization. They love the food. And frankly the whole value proposition, I think has legs well beyond the United States. Okay. Thank you. And our next question will come from Jared Garber with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Hi. Thank you very much for taking the question. It's really great to see the results this year. I wanted to ask Brian quickly on the marketing side. One of your goals when you joined the company was to boost the visibility of the brand and you talked about that at top of the call. So you'll be running the Super Bowl ad this year, which is the first for the company. Can you talk about the brand's visibility now and where it stands versus maybe several years ago when you took over? And how you're thinking about continued opportunities going forward? And I have a quick follow-up on the carne -- rather the cauliflower rice, and if you're seeing new customers joining the brand. Obviously, it's only been a couple of weeks, but if you're seeing new customers visit on the back of that? Thanks. Yes. Sure. Thanks Jared and welcome. So look, first of all, I just believe our message is a strong message that differentiates our brand and it's a message that's very much on trend with how young people want to eat and the future of how people want to eat. So you're going to see us continue to push the visibility of Chipotle and the idea of real food, with real cooking, real culinary done frankly every day.
And what I can tell you is, when I rewind the tapes, when I first got here back in 2018, we were arguably spending about the same percent of dollars and nobody saw the brand. If I would have asked you, what's Chipotle up to? You would not have been able to give me a good answer. Frankly, it would have been somebody else's narrative. And I think fast forward to where we are today.
I know our brand is stronger from an awareness standpoint for what we stand for. I know the brand is stronger from a trust standpoint. I know the brand is stronger, when it comes to our menu innovation, as well as our approach to culinary. So we've made tremendous progress. The marketing team I think has done a fabulous job of keeping the brand in culture and leading culture. And you're going to continue to see us do that.
I'm excited about bringing our message to the Super Bowl platform. I think it's going to be a very widely watched Super Bowl. And a lot of customers say to us, I feel good about eating at Chipotle, but they can't articulate why. We're going to tell them why they feel good about it. Obviously, they love the culinary aspect. But now they're going to get clarity on why they feel good about, why they choose the brand Chipotle. And you'll see it in the advertising around our approach to farming, animals, sustainability and frankly the communities that we support and operate in.
And then your second question about cauliflower rice. Look, I love it. It's really good. I highly recommend it, if you haven't tried it. I'd recommend going 50-50, a little brown rice and cauliflower rice. But with that said, the good news is about 25% of our orders are coming from new or infrequent customers, which is really terrific. So it's off to a great start and our operators are doing a great job of making the cauliflower absolutely perfect. So we're really happy with how that's come out of the gate. And our next question will come from Andrew Charles with Cowen. Please go ahead. Great. Thanks. I had two questions: one on quesadilla and one on catering. So Brian you mentioned that the national launch of quesadillas are in the near feature, but it doesn't look like it's contemplated in 1Q same-store sales guidance given it implies a deceleration to your trends from January to the combined February and March time frame.
Does guidance reflect uncertainty over the course of the pandemic or more so conservatism as quesadillas are expected to launch later in the quarter? And then my second question on catering. As we look towards the reopening, how big of an emphasis do you plan to place on catering given the gap you guys historically had with 1% of your sales coming from catering before the pandemic versus fast casual peers that were typically in that 8% range? So to answer your first question look, I think there's still – as much as I'm optimistic that the vaccine program is getting better as every day goes by and it really is amazing to see the efficacy of these vaccines. There still is – we want to be cautious about where COVID goes from here. So we're being careful on that front.
And then obviously, as we are able to lock and load on new initiatives, we'll share that with you guys. We're still in the phase of making sure we've got the equipment rolled out everywhere. And we're feeling really good about the training, we're going to do around quesadilla. So more to come on that front. But I would say more of it is just there's still a lot of unknown.
Luckily every day seems to be better with this – with the whole COVID issue both – vaccine rates seem to be going up and COVID cases seem to be going down. And luckily less and less people are ending up in the hospital. So I'm optimistic but we wanted to be conservative on that front.
And then regarding catering, yes, look Andrew, I think it's a huge opportunity. Once people want to get back together I think it's going to be a real big opportunity for our business. And it's one of the areas we're thinking about. And we're going to figure out the right time to start pushing that once obviously people can get back together in groups in a meaningful way. So it's a big opportunity. I wish we – the first step will be getting back to 1% of our sales doing catering. And then the next step will be tracking down numbers that I think are much higher than where we were with 1%. Thanks helpful. Thanks, Brian. Yes. And our next question will come from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Hi. Thank you. As usual you kind of gave the metrics, which we could interpret. Revenue at over 6,000 stores, average volumes at least 2.5 million, at least 25% store margins. But the G&A number would be obviously a really important part to kind of having a sense of what run rate operating income might be at the company.
Brian are you thinking in any way of kind of thinking about an appropriate at that level G&A per store, G&A as kind of a percentage of sales that as you think about longer-term revenue goals and longer-term operating income goals that we could perhaps start to anchor around?
And I do ask that somewhat in the context of what you put in your press release and I'm sorry if I missed it in the previous press release or forgot about it, reducing non-essential – focusing on reducing non-essential controllable costs. If you could elaborate on that and kind of how much focus that I guess phrase is receiving within the organization. Thanks. Yes. Sure. Look, I will tell you, I don't know if you've had the opportunity to meet Scott Boatwright. He's in charge of our operations. And Scott and all of our leaders in operations, their goal is to give people a great culinary experience and also give our team members a great culture and the opportunity to grow in our organization and do it in a way where we flow the revenue to the bottom line. So wherever we see an opportunity to get rid of unnecessary costs or frankly labor allocation, we go after it and we'll continue to go after it. And that's why I've got a high level of confidence – a very high level of confidence that the algorithm is going to be intact as we move throughout the year. Because as we continue to regain sales, we do things with our labor scheduling technology. And frankly our operators are laser-focused on giving people great experiences and then flowing to the bottom line accordingly.
Of course, it's something we keep an eye on. So I don't think it's necessary to pick a certain point because there's always going to be opportunities where, if we see an investment that makes sense to grow our business we're going to make that investment. There's just way too much growth in this company to constrain us that way. So Jack I don't know if you've got anything else to add to that. Brian the only thing I would add – we expect to grow sales at a faster rate than our G&A. And so we did step up. We made some investments this year that will set kind of a new baseline for us for this next year. But you can expect to see leverage in that line. In terms of where it's going to be 2, 3, 4 years from now that's -- don't have that great of a crystal ball.
But if we make sure that sales grow faster than that line then three or four years from now the percentage of sales and the margin after G&A -- the operating margin is going to be better -- much better than it is today as we approach the 25% target on the restaurant level and we lever this line. Thanks guys. And our next question will come from Chris O'Cull with Stifel. Please go ahead. Thanks, good afternoon guys. Jack I was curious if you could frame up where the beverage mix is today versus pre-pandemic. And then Brian looking ahead to periods where consumer behavior normalizes is there an opportunity to relaunch the Tractor Beverage program to build awareness once consumers are kind of back in the dining rooms more consistently? And then I had a follow-up. Yes just quickly... Go ahead Jack. Go ahead. I was just going to say real quickly just on the mix before the pandemic our drinks were in call it the mid-30% range of transactions. And that dropped more like in the mid-20% range. So it cut out about 1/3 of our beverages. Our beverages also lean more towards bottled drinks now with the Tractor Beverage.
Tractor Beverage is a -- and Brian is going to talk about it but is more in line with our food ethos. And those have a lower margin as well. So those are the two things that have been a drag on our margins. Yes. And look we absolutely believe there's an opportunity to reintroduce Tractor Beverage once folks come back in the dining rooms. And look the good news is the feedback from those that have tried it they really liked it. That's good. And then just assuming smoked brisket can clear the remaining operational hurdles, does the offering have the opportunity to be rolled out as a permanent offering, or are there supply constraints similar to carne asada? Yes. No smoked brisket will be one of our -- I would call it seasonal specials. It doesn't -- it won't be a permanent item. Okay, great. Thanks. And our next question will come from Brian Vaccaro with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Thanks and good evening. Just a clarification and then a question, if I could. Jack I appreciate the monthly comp commentary. I was hoping maybe we could convert that into absolute sales volumes. And it seems that average weekly sales have stepped up more recently maybe into that 47-a-week range. Is that correct? And then does your Q1 comp guide in the mid- to high-teens does that assume any change in that absolute sales volume later through the quarter? Yes. We don't really look at it internally that way on a weekly volume, but the volumes definitely stepped up. And if you looked at the weekly volumes, we all saw that COVID really came on pretty strong in December. We did see our sales bounce around. So even though our monthly comps were pretty even we softened at the end of November. Right before Christmas we started to pick up a little bit. We surged after Christmas and then surged again in January. So we're definitely at a higher level right now.
And in terms of the guidance Brian mentioned before the first quarter is still difficult to predict. We don't know where COVID is going next. We're optimistic because the vaccines are getting traction. But it essentially takes the last week trend which we talked about in the script. We -- while we did overall 11% for January we had moved down into the high single digits at the last week of January. If you take that trend and move that out over the rest of the quarter that's what we use to calculate that guidance of mid- to high-teens. Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then my question is on the loyalty program. And I understand you're up to nearly 20 million members. But could you comment on how engagement with the program has been trending? Maybe you could give us a sense of how many active users you have and maybe how you define that or perhaps a comment on the percent of sales that are generated within the loyalty program in recent months. Yes sure. So I would say the way we look at it is, it's roughly about 60% are active. And those are the folks that obviously we've got an ongoing program with. We also have programs though with folks that we see that aren't active right to get them to reengage. So we're accessing the full database as well as other platforms on top of it.
So it goes well beyond that 20 million. But like I mentioned earlier we're seeing really good results in our ability to interact with those that are active and then we're able to also get people to be reactive -- or reactivated I guess is the way to think about it. So it's one of those things that we're very excited about because we continue to learn. And so when we see somebody that is no longer active we learn from it and then we figure out how to reengage them.
And then we're having some success in keeping a percentage of those people then becoming active as we continue to grow the total universe. So -- and the good news is we're also modifying the program as we go forward. We're going to continue to keep people excited. And we get feedback on how we can make it better and we'll continue to do that. All right. Thank you. And this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Brian for any closing remarks. Yes. Thank you and thanks everybody for taking the time and asking the questions. I'm just going to reiterate what I really said at the beginning of the call which is really proud of our team members the work that's happened in our restaurants and our support centers through a very challenging year.
I think it just demonstrates our purpose, our values, our culture and the caliber of the people that we have at Chipotle. It really demonstrates the resiliency of the brand and the leaders that we have. And very proud of where we are. And obviously I'm very optimistic about where we're going.
The digital system is strong it's growing and we have plans to continue to grow it. Our in-store business when it can come back I know people will want to come back because the culinary and the food is second to none. And you just put those two things together with the ability to continue to build more restaurants hire more people and grow our people accordingly I think the future is very bright.
And I'm optimistic that COVID is hopefully more in the rearview mirror going forward. So thank you for taking the time. Hopefully all of you are safe and your families have weathered 2020 well. And I look forward to continuing to share the story in 2021. All the best. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

Chipotle is off to a promising start in 2021 which gives me optimism for the rest of the year. There's still uncertainty related to COVID but as more people become vaccinated, including many Chipotle employees, I'm hopeful we're getting closer to brighter days ahead. In fact, all but about 20 of our restaurants are now open with 92% of them offering in restaurant dining with capacity limitations.
For the quarter, we reported sales of $1.7 billion representing 23.4% year-over-year growth, which was fueled by 17.2% comparable restaurant sales growth, including about a 1.5% headwind from winter weather in February, restaurant level margins of 22.3%, which is 470 basis points higher than last year, earnings per share adjusted for unusual items of $5.36, representing an increase of 74% year-over-year, digital sales growth of 133.9% year-over-year, representing 50.1% of sales and opened 40 new restaurants including 26 with Chipotle lane.
Not surprisingly comparable restaurant sales were the highest during the month of March as we lacked easier comparisons. And I'm pleased to report that April is off to a good start. These results highlight that our key strategies continue to resonate with guests and position us to win today, while we create the future.
Let me now provide a brief update on each of these strategies, which I believe will help fulfill our long-term vision of more than 6000 restaurants, AUVs above $2.5 million and restaurant level margins above 25%. These are, one, making the brand visible, relevant and loved; two, utilizing a disciplined approach to creativity and innovation; three, leveraging digital capabilities to drive productivity and expand access, convenience and engagement; four, engaging with customers through our loyalty program; and five, running successful restaurants with a strong culture that provides delicious food with integrity while delivering exceptional in restaurant and digital experiences.
Let me start with our marketing efforts, where the team is doing a great job being agile and remaining relevant to a consumer mindset that continues to evolve. Internally, we encourage curiosity and experimentation, which takes advantage of our digital and social capabilities in conjunction with TV advertising to consistently reinforce our messaging.
For example, we leveraged the return of sports to showcase our brand and purpose. Our first ever Super Bowl commercial titled, ‘Can a burrito change the world?’ was very successful at highlighting Chipotle's dedication to cultivating a better world through real food, sustainable sourcing and a commitment of the farming industry. We also connected and engaged with our guest during March Madness with a mouth watering commercial showcasing real ingredients, real cooking and real people in order to support the launch of our hand-crafted quesadilla.
Not to be outdone, our digital communication strategy involves supercharging the superfans who are true advocates. Content on social platforms is a key way we interact with our guests. The angle for all of our creative initiatives is to drive culture, drive a difference and ultimately drive a purchase.
Helping these marketing efforts were a handful of new menu innovations, which provide wonderful examples of the Stage Gate process and our team's ability to execute new food experiences.
Cauliflower rice, which we launched in early January and will continue through mid-May, is continuing to bring in new guests. In addition, we launched quesadilla across the U.S. and Canada as a digital exclusive offering on March 11. This is our first new customizable entrée in 17 years and was the most requested item by guests not on our existing menu. We made sure we took the proper time to develop an excellent product that consumers love and also works well operationally. The end result is a quesadilla that is perfectly crispy on the outside with delicious melted cheese on the inside. My personal favorite is the barbacoa quesadilla.
The benefits of a digital only offering are that it leverages our digital scale while removing operational friction by utilizing our digital kitchen. Although it's only been out for about a month, we're encouraged by this performance thus far with an incidence mix of approximately 10% and expected to remain a guest favorite moving forward. Last, but certainly not least, we also had Carne Asada for the majority of the quarter and we're pleased to say that it had an incidence mix similar to what we saw last year.
And our talented culinary team has not done innovating. We have several market tests of new items scheduled later this year that have shown promise in early stage consumer testing. We're gaining valuable feedback and we'll update you on their progress as they move through our Stage Gate process. Also, it's likely that we will put another marketing push behind some 2020 initiatives like tractor beverages, later this year to optimize their performance once COVID normalizes
Let me now talk about the next strategic driver our digital platform. Our investments in new digital features and innovations helped Q1 visual sales grow 134% year-over-year to $870 million and represent 50% of sales. Momentum continued to build within the quarter with March setting a new record for digital transactions supported by our best ever digital order ahead month, over 800,000 app downloads and the most new digital customer since May of 2020.
With the overall digital mix, remaining relatively stable for the last three quarters, we were delighted to see that our highest margin transaction digital pickup orders were slightly more than half of digital sales during Q1. Within the delivery channel, about 40% were initiated through the Chipotle app or Web site, while the remainder were through a handful of partners.
Our digital sales are a sticky, frictionless and convenient experience as evidenced by our April digital sales mix holding around 50%. Aided by the quesadilla launch, our digital sales are now slightly above the COVID peak from last year. While we've recovered roughly 60% of in-restaurant sales have dining rooms have reopened. We also continued to see outsides digital performance in Chipotle lanes, which have revolutionized the drive thru experience towards order ahead for pickup transactions, which is our most profitable channel.
As our digital ecosystem has evolved from a commerce system to a platform of engagement, we continue to look for ways to enhance convenience and access including Chipotle lanes, alternative store formats, digital-only menu offerings and Chipotle rewards. We are regularly making enhancements to our app, Web site, delivering group offerings to support the current and expected future growth within this channel.
We'll also continue to make important tech investments to create a path for the future. One such example is our recent investment in Europe, an early stage leader in autonomous delivery. Nuro uses robotics in their fleet of on-road, occupantless and autonomous vehicles to deliver everyday consumer goods and we believe has the potential to take the delivery experience to the next level.
Speaking of our loyalty program, we now have more than 21 million passionate members that receive targeted and personalized messages. We are leveraging the CRM platform for purpose driven messaging, as well as tempting fans with our latest promotions. Communications to our customers are individually tailored so that specific customer activities prompt targeting responses. Each digital message can vary along the customer buying journey, such as the latest promotional offer a new menu item, or a more targeted offer to entice a customer that has not visited a restaurant for a certain period of time.
For example, customers received communication about the quesadilla launch featuring their favorite protein based on their ordering history. Our loyalty program has been very successful in driving additional transactions across our light, medium and heavy consumer segments. But we continue to increase the level of sophistication and experience in our information and targeting, which should bode well for the future of Chipotle rewards.
We're also investing in talent and infrastructure for rewards and have several enhancements to the program planned for later this year that consumers have indicated would increase their engagement and purchases.
Let me end by talking about the foundational ingredient of our success. And that's our restaurant operations, where the team has done a great job staying focused on safety, reliability and excellent culinary. Running great restaurants requires great people and Chipotle is privileged to have amazing employees. Our continued investment in our team members to ensure they have the resources to develop and thrive in their career, including the recently announced expansion of debt-free degrees in agriculture, culinary, hospitality and supply chain is paying off.
Turnover continues to be relatively stable and we are seeing great applicants for open positions to staff our expected growth in AUV and new restaurant openings.
After visiting a number of our restaurants recently, I'm encouraged to see more guests enjoying their food in our dining rooms. As a result, we've been reiterating the importance of executing great throughput by teaching, training and validating the five pillars of throughput every day during every shift. After all, guests need to feel safe and deserve a great and fast in-restaurant experience.
Chipotle is a unique brand committed to fostering a culture that values and champions our diversity, while leveraging the individual talents of all team members to grow our business and cultivate a better world. To show how passionate we are about inspiring real change in people, food and the environment. We have tied 10% of officers' annual incentive bonus to the company achieving certain ESG goals. Our updated sustainability report, which was published last week showcases our desire for transparency and being a leader in sustainability.
I also want to take this opportunity to welcome our two new independent directors, Matt Carey and Mauricio Gutierrez both bring excellent experience to our board and will be valuable assets for Chipotle.
Finally, I want to thank our employees for their incredible level of collaboration and tireless dedication, which were critical in helping demonstrate the brand's resiliency. While the past year has been full of ups and downs and the volatility related to COVID may not be fully behind us, I believe Chipotle is stronger today and is well positioned for growth.
As a result, I'm excited about our future as we remain a premier fast casual brand, focusing on all stakeholders, a leader in culinary, a leader in food with integrity and an innovator providing convenient access inside our restaurants as well as through our expanding digital ecosystem.
With that, here's Jack to walk you through the financials. Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone.
We're proud of our performance during the first quarter with sales growing 23.4% year-over-year to $1.7 billion as comp sales grew 17.2%; restaurant level margin of 22.3% was 470 basis points higher than last year and earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $5.36, representing a 74% year-over-year increase. This included benefit from lower taxes related to option exercises and share vesting, which is more than offset by higher G&A related to performance based catch up adjustment and taxes on equity exercising investments. And I'll discuss these factors in greater detail shortly.
The first quarter had unusual expenses related to our 2018 performance year modification to account for the unplanned effects of COVID, restaurant asset impairments and closure costs as well as transformation costs, which negatively impacted earnings per share by $0.91, leading to a GAAP earnings per share of $4.45. While, the impact from COVID appears to be lessening, we're not quite out of the woods yet as seen by the recent spikes in a few regions as well as a pause in administering certain vaccines and therefore it's still difficult to provide comp guidance for full year 2021. We are encouraged by the strong start and we're optimistic about our full year performance in 2021.
The geometric two year stack for Q1 comp is about 21% due to dining rooms reopening, our cauliflower rice launch, effective marketing, continued digital performance and the introduction of quesadilla which all helped drive a strong finish to the quarter. For Q2, we expect our comp to be in the range of the high 20% to 30% with quesadilla incidents normalizing and a lower marketing investment.
Food costs are 30% in Q1, a decrease of 280 basis points from last year that's due to primarily to menu price increases, a mix shift toward higher margin protein and lower waste, which were partially offset by costs associated with cauliflower rice and fewer sales of high margin beverages. In Q2, expect food costs to be in the mid to high 30% range, but the benefit from our delivery menu price increase will be more than offset by seasonally higher avocado prices.
Labor costs for the quarter were 24.9%, a decrease of 300 basis points from last year, this decrease was driven primarily by sales leverage and efficiencies related to digital orders partially offset by labor inflation. We expect labor costs to be in the low 24% range during Q2 through the benefit or delivery menu price increase as well as seasonally higher sales.
Other operating costs for the quarter were 16.9% an increase of 200 basis points from last year due to higher delivery fees, which were partially offset by sales leverage and a one-time insurance credit. Delivery expenses remained elevated year-over-year given the significant growth in delivery and as you may have seen, we increased our delivery menu prices by 4% earlier this month to help cover the higher cost of this premium access point. And we'll continue to evaluate and fine tune our delivery strategy in this dynamic market.
Marketing promo cost of the quarter were 3.5% a decrease of 20 basis points from last year given a significantly lower level of delivery promotion this year. While, we invested more marketing dollars in order to score in quesadilla and cauliflower rice, as well as the first ever Super Bowl ad. While [existing] [ph] marketing expenses to be in the mid 2% range in Q2, time period tends to be less responsive from those advertising channel.
Similar to past few year, full year 2021 marketing expense is expected to be around 3% of sales. Lower marketing spend in Q2, other operating costs are expected to be around 16% for the quarter. In Q1 restaurant level margin was 22.3%, while our trailing 12 month average unit volumes excluding the delivery menu price increase were roughly $2.27 million normalizing for the higher marketing spend, our underlying restaurant level margin was essentially in line with theoretical margin of 22.7% expected at the sales volume.
We're pleased with this progress and we remain confident that we have taken and will continue to take the necessary actions to ensure the margin stays on the algorithm as our AUVs rise throughout the year. In fact, we expect our trailing 12-month average unit volumes to pass $2.4 million in Q2, we expect our margin algorithm to keep pace.
G&A for the quarter was $155 million on a GAAP basis or $129 million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding $24.4 million for the previously mentioned modification to our 2018 performance shares and about $1.6 million related to transformation expenses. G&A also includes $89 million in underlying G&A, $30 million related to non-cash stock compensation, which includes the $7.7 million increase related to our strong performance in Q1 and $10 billion related to higher bonus accrual and payroll taxes and equity vesting and stock option exercises.
Looking to Q2, we expect our underlying G&A to be around $94 million as we continue to make investments including in technology to support our future growth. We anticipate stock comp will likely be around $25 million in each of the remaining quarters in 2021 to reflect the new round rate, although this amount could move up or down based on our actual performance.
We also expect to recognize around $5 million in each quarter related to performance based bonus expenses and employer taxes associated [Technical Difficulty] during each quarter, as well as $1 million related to our upcoming Virtual Field Leadership Conference in Q2.
Our effective tax rate for Q1 was 20.2% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis. Our effective tax rate benefited from option exercise and share vesting had elevated stock prices. As I'm sure you know, we received a tax deduction for the value our employees received upon option exercise or share vesting, when the net value exceeds the accounting charge of those shares, we'd benefit from a higher tax deduction.
For fiscal 2021, we continue to estimate our underlying effective tax rate will be in a 25% to 27% range though it may vary based on discrete items such as the equity related impact I just mentioned.
Turning now to the balance sheet, we ended Q1 with $1.2 billion in cash restricted cash and investments with no debt along with a recently refinanced $500 million untapped revolver with a five year term and more favorable terms in our previous facility. We also restarted our buyback program in late February when our stock price up and we repurchased $61 million of our stock and average price of $1,425 during the quarter. We had nearly $154 million remaining on our share authorization as of March 31. We expect to continue to opportunistically use excess free cash flow to repurchase our stock.
That being said the best use of our cash remains investing in more Chipotle, which continue to deliver outstanding returns. We opened 40 new restaurants in the first quarter more than doubled the number opened in Q1 last year with 26 of these including in Chipotle lanes. While only 65% of the new units had Chipotle lanes in Q1 for the full year, we still anticipate opening around 200 new restaurants with more than 70% including Chipotle lane.
As of March 31, we had a total of Chipotle lanes including five conversions. Customers love the Chipotle lane experience, as it is the access channel that excels at providing convenient, speed and great value all at the same time. Performance continues to be stellar. In the trailing 12 months Chipotle lane restaurant continue to drive 17% higher overall digital sales compared to non-Chipotle lane. In order ahead, our highest marketing transaction is nearly 80% higher than non-Chipotle lane, while delivery our lowest margin transaction is about 30% lower than our non-Chipotle lane restaurants.
New Chipotle lanes are opening with about 15% higher sales and the comp at the 69 Chipotle lane restaurants that have been opened more than a year continues to outperform the non-Chipotle lane restaurants from the same open period.
Beyond the significant growth opportunity in the U.S., we're excited to accelerate new restaurant openings in Canada, which was recently validated by our stage gate process. We're building a healthy new restaurant pipeline and expect to open a handful of restaurants over the next 12 months, including our first Chipotle lane in late summer.
We'll continue to experiment with different location formats and restaurant designs throughout the country to gauge consumer preferences. Ultimately, we believe we can open at least a few 100 restaurants in Canada, especially what their unit economic now approaching those of the U.S. The recent Surrey British Columbia opening which is our first new Canadian location for years opened very strong and gives us even greater confidence about our growth strategy.
We close by thanking all of our team members who've proven their agility to operate through uncertainty, while also staying focused on our long-term purpose, their commitment to constant improvement of the customer dining experience, while strengthening our branded business is what helps drive our strategic growth initiatives. The combination of investing in our people, delivering the relevant and compelling marketing, leveraging our digital systems to enhance convenient access and great execution of the restaurants is leading to a better guest experience which ultimately allows us to further strengthen our powerful economic model.
With that we're happy to take your questions. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from David Tarantino of Baird. My questions, really about the reopening of the dining rooms to more full extent and the resumption of consumer activity we're starting to see as the vaccines roll out. And I guess, Brian or Jack, can you elaborate on what you're seeing as that activity returns in terms of sales and mix? And then, secondly, based on what you're seeing as the dining room traffic might be coming back, how are you thinking about the overall unit volume opportunity in the U.S. assuming that some of these digital transactions might stick? Thanks. Look, what we're definitely seeing is, people want to be back in our dining rooms. I've had the luxury of traveling recently. And Scott and I've been to numerous restaurants and it's great to see the lines, again, in our dining rooms. And we're seeing a nice rebound, obviously, in those dining room sales because there weren't any a year ago. And at the same time, what we're seeing is our digital business is really continuing to thrive. In the quarter, I don't know if you guys picked up on this, but when we had record sales for our digital business, despite the fact that our dining rooms are opening.
So I think it just demonstrates the power of both access modes, meaning the in-restaurant dining access mode and the digital access mode. And then, not surprising you're seeing the occasions, come back based on whether you're coming into the dining room, or whether you're ordering off premise. And that's more tied to help open the region is, is how I would kind of describe it.
So we're feeling great about where we are consumer sentiment is definitely one where they want to get back out to socialize and get back into the dining rooms and have that in dining experience. And then, at the same token for those occasions that they've built, the behaviors around digitally, those are remaining in the business and I think that's why you're seeing our results in Q1. And frankly, why I'm really proud of our team is that we're managing these two businesses out of one kitchen with really -- excellence. Great. And then, my other question is on the quesadilla and I guess, from a consumer behavior uptake, it sounds like you're getting a high incidence for that product. Do you have information that would tell you whether that's kind of new customers or incremental customers or existing customers trying the product? I guess, what do you think the incrementality of that might look like? Yes. So you're exactly right, David, the incidence is high. We're in that 10% range. I think is what we discovered. And the thing is really exciting is, it's comprised of a lot of new users. So we're seeing two things happen. A lot of new users come into the business, through the quesadilla proposition, and then our existing customers, we're also seeing them utilize that quesadilla platform as part of a new eating occasion.
So, it was actually our highest penetration of new customers in the month of March, which I think is just a testament to, one, people coming back to the dining rooms, and two, I think, a really meaningful innovation around quesadilla. The next question comes from Jon Tower of Wells Fargo. Just curious on the delivery side of the equation. It sounds like Jack, you'd mentioned the company has taken another 4% or so pricing in the delivery channel during the quarter. Where does that set the delivery occasion now relative to an in-store transaction? And do you feel like there's even more potential to take pricing in that channel, if necessary down the line? And when I ask, the percentage piece, from large basis to [Technical Difficulty] Jon, you cut out at the very end. Okay. I was just asking gross profit dollar versus the margin percentage when it comes to the delivery transaction? How those have changed with the incremental pricing versus the restaurant transaction? Yes. Jack, you want me to take that, or you want me to start or… Yes. I'll go ahead and start Brian. Listen, the last price increase that we took, it doesn't get us all the way to where a delivery transaction -- delivers the same margin as an in-store transaction. And certainly not as much as our highest transaction [Technical Difficulty] very, very close. From a dollar standpoint, they're pretty close but as you know, when you are charging higher prices, you're grossing up the sales. And so it makes it a little harder to fully capture that margin. But I would say we're within striking distance where, maybe a few percentage points away if we wanted to completely equalize, the margin on an in-store transaction for a delivery. So we've made a lot of progress over the last year. And when we've taken these increases along the way, we've seen either acceptable resistance. And we've also seen what looks like people are shifting channels, because it does look like our order ahead moves up, when we do see customers maybe resist the higher pricing and delivery channels a bit. Great. And if I may, on the loyalty side of the equation, I believe, Brian, you'd mentioned earlier, there is some efforts internally to improve engagement per customer feedback that you've received. So what have you heard from customers in the loyalty program [Technical Difficulty] done today? Yes. So you kind of cut out near the end, but I think I got the gist of the question, which is, how are we seeing more customers become more engaged within our rewards program? And the simple answer on that is, I think we've gotten a lot smarter with the analytics. So that, I mentioned this in my prepared remarks, we're really trying to figure out how we move just from a commerce experience to an engagement experience. And so what you're seeing is, the power of that playing out by people shopping more often, with Chipotle, experimenting with other things on the menu. And obviously, there's going to be further enhancements to our rewards program going forward because we want to respond to our customers to keep them engaged in this rewards program. The next question comes from Sara Senatore of Bernstein. I wanted to ask a little bit about the loyalty members. And also your comment about the 40% I think you set up delivery orders coming through proprietary apps. So first, just the loyalty members, I guess, do you have a sense of what percentage of your total customers that might represent it? If you have a certain 80 million, 100 million unique customers, something like that? I guess I'm trying to sort of reconcile the loyalty membership with your -- the delivery orders or the digital orders that are coming through your native apps, because it seems like the share of orders that are coming through your own ordering platform has gone up. And I'm trying to figure out, are you shifting people away from a third-party by virtue of incentivizing them through loyalty or that kind of thing? Or is it just that the people who are ordering directly are very high spending customers and they're the sort of minority that will ultimately download your apps versus preferring the convenience of a have an aggregator platform? I know, there's a lot in there, but I'm trying to understand sort of the power of -- the Chipotle brand versus like, kind of like, call it the convenience of the aggregators and who owns the customer there? Yes. Look, I think were you just ended your question is the answer, which is, we have a very powerful brand. And as a result, when people join our rewards program, download the app and start ordering through our app, and they realize that they have the access of order ahead and pick up whether it's at a Chipotle lane, order ahead and pick up meaning, I can grab it off the shelf and go, or I can get delivery through our app.
In all those occasions, you are able to accrue points and get recognized for being an engaged customer. And we're providing lots of access, lots of convenience, with a very powerful brand position behind it. And that's why I think you're seeing our order ahead business continue to grow, our white label or delivery business in our app continuing to grow as a percentage of the delivery occasion. And I think it's just a function of the brand continues to resonate, our first strategy is all about building the brand, trust and love. And I think while we do that and provide a great experience, both digitally and for whatever occasion you want associate with that digital experience. And then, you give them rewards, it's a really powerful system that keeps people engaged. Great. That makes a lot of sense. And then, just do you have any sense of like, kind of what share of Chipotle customers are on your loyalty program versus ultimately what you might get to? Well, look, we've got 21 million customers, in the rewards program, 60% of those are active, ongoing. And then, we've got programs with those that we see lapsing. But we don't see a whole lot of crossover, still between the dining room experience and the digital experience, there's only 10%, 15% that are doing both occasions. So there is still a lot of upside in getting our dining rooms reopen for that customer experience, customer occasion. And that's why I think the earlier question I got, I'm so optimistic about our dining rooms reopening because it's not cannibalizing from our digital business. These are really two distinct occasions that people want to have access to great food with integrity.
So there's 100 million Chipotle customers coming through these doors. And the good news is, we know when we get that dining room open there's a lot of people that are going to come back that we haven't seen in a while. The next question comes from Lauren Silberman of Credit Suisse. So on quesadilla, as you move through the Stage Gate process, you talked a lot about your focus on operations, the quesadilla is now available across the system. Are you seeing any impact on throughput or operations relative to what you expected? Yes. Look, I'm really happy to say the Stage Gate process worked. Because two things. One, we've got the right kitchen equipment to create a great product at great speed. And then two, we got the right operational process in place. So, if in the event somebody does order still on the frontline, obviously our guys will figure out how to accommodate it, but it is a much faster experience with a much better product. So we've improved our employees experience when that happens.
And then, for our customers, their learning, the quesadilla made to be an off-premise solution with Chipotle's food. And I think it's a testament to our teams, our operators that validated it, our marketers that have explained to customers how to use it, and then, the marriage of our technology to actually get the transaction in place. So it's a great example of using the Stage Gate process in the most effective way possible. And I think you've thought, you had the expectations for quesadilla incidents to normalize in Q2. So just to clarify, do you expect the mix to settle below the 10%? And then, how does the attachment rate to the [quack] [ph] inside compared to what you see with burritos and bowls? Yes. So look, we're just saying we're only what a couple weeks into this. And the good news is, we haven't seen -- go backwards yet. So and the feedback from our customers, are they loving it. The attachment rate looks really good. It's frankly, a little bit better than our burritos and bowls. So I think that's the power of showing our food going really well with [indiscernible]. And again, it's Chipotle's food is really good and guess what, it's really good when it's in a quesadilla. The next question comes from Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer. Brian, your line is open. Next question comes from Peter Saleh of BTIG. I want to come back to the conversation around delivery menu price increases. You guys mentioned a 4% increase most recently. I think the test that you guys were running was substantially higher than that on the delivery price increase. So can you talk a little bit about the -- did you see pushback on the test? And why did you decide on a 4%? Why was that the right amount of a price increase to take? Yes. So just to clarify, or go ahead, Jack? Brian, you're probably going to say the same thing I would. Peter, just to clarify, we are running 13 in most of our restaurants across the country. We had a few that were at different levels, so we could see the differences. We took the entire country up another 4%. So we're now charging a plus 17. And the reason we did that was we were comfortable that the resistance that we saw was acceptable resistance that we did see people move into other convenience and other value driven channels. So I think that's a testament to. We had the 13% price increase running for several months. And we were very comfortable that we could go another 4%. So the 4% we just took earlier this month was an addition. Great understood. All right. And then, just on the Chipotle lane conversions, I know you have around 400 freestanding stores and a 1500 to 1600 end-caps. Have you guys thought a little bit more about how many conversions you can actually do? I know I think the quarter or two ago, you said potential for several 100? Has that number increased at all? It hasn't changed per se. Our desire to have more Chipotle lanes and to push the percentage of new restaurants that open with each Chipotle lane. We want to continue to push the envelope there. And then with conversions, we want to opportunistically look at relocations and rebuilds that -- remodels where we can add a Chipotle lane. We still think that we can have hundreds of conversions. It's hard to pin that down though, because, in essence, what you do is, we have to as we approach the end of a lease term. Like let's say you've got a 10-year primary term with options, when you get to year seven or eight that's the time you have the conversation with landlords. If you've tried to have the conversation with landlords to try to get permission to modify the space in year two or three, when you've got seven years left, landlord doesn't really want to have that conversation. So we have those conversations and we have many of them throughout the year. If you look back to 10 years ago, we will have 100 or more, maybe in the 100 to 150 range, where we're having conversations with landlords. Those conversations are going well. But it's too early to tell exactly how many hundreds of these conversions we can get, we're definitely pushing the envelope. The next question comes from David Palmer of Evercore ISI. So I just wanted to get a few clues from you about how the sales layers might shake out after the full reopen, after we get past all the vaccinations and things get up and running at least reasonably so I'm sure work commute will be -- there'll be some areas will be lagging there. But what do you see from some of your early and most reopened markets in terms of that on-premise business sales layer. It looks like overall on-premise might be only 70% of pre-COVID levels right now as a system. But where is that getting to in some of your most reopened markets? And when it does get to that level? How much is your off-premise business, the digital side, really hanging in there? And I have a quick follow up. Yes. So David, the way to think about it is, like in our regions that are the most open, obviously, you're not that far off on your average of the return in our dining business, the places where we're more open, we're above the average. And the thing that I love to see is, regardless, our digital business is maintaining that 80% to 85% run rate. The thing that's also exciting, though, is, as I mentioned, in the quarter, we still had record levels of digital business. And that's because we're going to continue to use our system called rewards, quesadillas to drive people further and further commitment on our digital platform for those occasions where it make sense.
So, in the places where we're more open, we got more of our dining room business back, and our digital business is hanging in there. I'd say it's actually our digital businesses, operating from a position of strength. And then, the places where it's slower, the dining room has come back, thank heavens, we've got such a strong digital business. And I guess this might be one for Jack, in terms of how you think about sales and margins over time, in the past, you've had a rule of thumb of your AUVs tracking with margins, the way the world is working feels like sales will be higher on average for the average company out there. But margins may be more challenged for the average company out there. You might have some better defense mechanisms than others in terms your digital business and whatnot. But how are you thinking about that relationship? Is that changing, even as you see some of the recent measures you've been taking? And I'll pass it on. Yes. David, listen, we still feel very confident that our margin algorithm is alive and well. We made some important steps over the last several months, so that we're within striking distance of that algorithm. And we see from here on out as our volumes grow, our AUV was [2.17] [ph] million and as we grow to 2.4. 2.5 etc, etc, we think that our margin will move to 24 and 25. Now, that's not going to happen every single quarter, it's not going to be perfect. But in terms of seeing our margins move up with our volumes, we still expect that to happen.
Now there is a slight degradation as you move from 2.5 million to 3 million, for example, you might not get to all the way to 30% in terms of the margin for a $3 million restaurant, but you certainly should get in the 28% to 29% range. So we still fully expect that we'll be able to expand margins. And one of the things that's enabling that is, with the growth -- the significant growth in the delivery business that has been still is our lowest margin transaction. But we've close the gaps considerably and our customers are still choosing that channel or they're choosing another channel. So giving the customers choice and let them pay for the more extreme convenience channel of delivery, let them pay the going rate seems to be a workable strategy for us. The next question comes from Andrew Charles of Cowen. Brian, based on the experience with quesadilla, how [open minded] [ph] are you around future digital only menu innovation that can't be done on the front make line, such as the potential for nachos and enchiladas. And perhaps from an ops perspective, are you confined to only one to two possible digital innovations in the new ovens? Or could there be several more items launched before you become capacity constrained on this digital make lines? Yes. Look, the good news is, we're far from capacity constraints on those digital make lines and we're continuing to make enhancements to our digital make line, so that our employees become even more accurate, more efficient. The equipment that we've chosen gives us a lot of flexibility, whether it's additional entrées or desserts, or whatever it may be. The good news is we got a lot of great ideas in our culinary team, obviously, we'll bet them through the Stage Gate process. But, look, the goal is to be balanced, at the end of the day, we want to have a great experience in the restaurant and a great experience, if you choose to go digital. And I don't think you're going to see us ever get out of equilibrium, where we're providing a great experience for whatever channel, it could be. I don't want to come across this DML all of a sudden, you're doing something every month. That's not who we are. Who we are, are great ingredients done in very simple ways, so that you can customize. And the good news is, we've got lots of capacity on that line. And now we've got more flexibility because of the additional equipment that we have. So not surprising, I think there's a lot of growth still to be had on their digital business. And there's still tremendous growth to be had in our dining business. That's helpful. Then Jack, I have a follow up question on development. This might be a little technical, but looking at the proxy, it looks like there were 324 site assessment requests over the next 12 to 18 months. That's about 50% higher versus the 227 that was in the proxy from a year ago. And so, when I look at the guidance for 200 store openings this year, it's not quite 50%, above the 161 you did last year.
So, in terms of the guidance for 200 openings, besides conservatism, just on the availability of construction crews, is there anything else in there that might be presenting pressure on 2021development? No, I would say it's more of a timeline challenge. We've seen that the timeline have elongated over the last, year or two or so. And so, this year, for example, we target 200, first quarter was exactly on pace to do 200. I think you can expect us to see, to open up similar numbers in Q2 and Q3. Now, what might happen, Andrew, we might overperform a bit in the fourth quarter. It's too early to say that right now, we certainly have a very healthy pipeline. That pipeline is chock full of a bolt line. So, we think the numbers go up from here, not down. But right now the responsible number of 200, I think still applies. But let's see how things shape up in quarter two and three, what the fourth quarter looks like. The next question comes from Nicole Miller of Piper Sandler. Just one question for me. I'm curious about, traditionally thinking about restaurants and unit level economics. And what I'm wondering is, with your 21 million loyalty relationships in the CRM platform you're talking about, can you talk now about customer lifetime value? Like, what's the economics of a customer? Now that you found some of them outside of the four walls of the store? Yes, it's a great question, Nicole. One of the reasons why we're so I guess optimistic about our rewards program is, these reward members versus non-reward members, they're coming more often and they're also spending more. So that's obviously a great outcome of putting somebody into a rewards program. And then, I think the team has really become so much more sophisticated in our ability to understand what they want from Chipotle. And as a result, you're going to see us making some further enhancements to the rewards program and the experiences that people can have. So they will be even further engaged. And the whole reason why we're doing that is because we think we can get even more frequency out of people and potentially continue to influence that check further. So it's a very valuable asset. And I think it's going to continue to become more valuable. The next question comes from Jared Garber of Goldman Sachs. I wanted to touch base on the labor environment and what you guys are seeing from that respect, obviously, we've heard a lot in the news lately about the availability of labor and the challenges of staffing up. So I wonder if you could talk there, a little bit about what you're seeing and if you're seeing those similar challenges play out. And then, as it relates to that, how you guys think about potential pricing power and/or pricing in different markets? Thanks. Sure. So, obviously, one of the things that's great is, we're seeing, the economy come back in a big way, with customers out of the balloting, getting back to the business of -- it's a normalcy. With that, obviously, we are quick to want to step up our restaurants accordingly, to be in sync with where our business is growing. The positive is, it came back really fast in March. The negative in that is, you got to play a little bit of catch up with the staffing. But I think our employee value proposition is world-class. And as people realize these opportunities are available, usually we have no problem with the applicant flow. And then, we turn our attention to training and developing these individuals, because it's a great opportunity for not just the job now, but a future career.
So, it's great to see the business come roaring back, it's also exciting to see our need to staff more people because that is the growth that we like to have. We like to have growth that results in more jobs and more people having upward opportunities. We had, I think 13,000 plus promotions recently. So, I mean, that's just a testament to the growth that we have, the strength of our proposition for those that stay with us commit themselves to being developed and trained. And then, obviously, we're going to staff accordingly, as the business comes forward and back. So I'm very optimistic about the people we can attract, the culture that we create for them and then the opportunities that are available for them. And what was the second part of your question? Just as it relates to kind of increasing wage pressures across the industry, how you guys think about mitigating that through price increases? Obviously, you've taken on delivery, but more broadly across even like the dine-in side of the business and how you think about that geographically as well? Yes. I think we've talked about this in the past, the good news is our value proposition is, I would say top, top tier. And so that gives us a lot of flexibility on how we price and when we price. We've taken a very conservative approach on it. We've been more in that 1% to 2% range on an annual basis. I mean Jack has talked about is that usually offsets any labor inflation that we deal with. So, I think we're in a really strong situation, both from a brand value proposition and then the ability to attract and retain people with our employee value proposition. Next question comes from Andy Barish of Jefferies. Just taking that a little bit further. I know, some of the traditional metrics of, I've kind of gotten a little bit skewed by everything going on right now. But can you quantify sort of what type of wage inflation you're seeing? And then, also on the commodity front? Certainly the commodity proteins have been significantly higher, just wondering if you're starting to see that, in the non-commodity markets that you're buying from? Yes. I'll take this. First of all, Andy, in the last year, what we've seen with labor inflation has it's -- and more modest than it had been in the last five years. And last five years, we've seen inflation and kind of the mid-single digit range and with some of the dislocation going on with COVID. Actually, the labor inflation dropped to the low single digits. But we expect I think most people expect that's going to tick back up. And let me just give you an example because the other thing that you might be thinking about is, what if we have a national minimum wage, that's -- that over time approaches $15.
Now, the way to think about this is our minimum wage, or our average wage right now, is $12 for our crew, it's $13 for all of our hourly employees. We're not that far off of like, for example, a $15 number. But let's say for example, that there's going to be an across the board, 10% increase in our wages, that would have an impact on our margins, I will call it 150 to 200 basis points. And that would to offset that with menu pricing that will take a 2% to 3% price increase. So all of that is very, very manageable. And we feel like if there is going to be significant increased inflation there because of market driven or because of federal minimum wage. We think everybody in the restaurant industry is going to have to pass those costs along to the customer. And we think we're in a much, much better position to do that, than other companies out there.
In terms of commodities, the one that we're seeing for sure and this is more of a seasonal shift that we see pretty much every year is avocados. We are going to see an increase in avocado prices as we shift into the next season. We don't see anything else moving up dramatically right now, Andy. I mean, I think everyone's kind of waiting to see what happens in terms of demand and if there are any disruptions with supply chain, we're not seeing any that we're worried about right now.
But with everyone talking about with the stimulus and the reopening and the vaccine, there is going to be a surge in demand. And we think we're well prepared from supply chain standpoint. But that's the only kind of wildcard as the year unfolds is. Will there be maybe a cyclical or interim dislocation where maybe there is some commodity inflation, but nothing that we're seeing right now. The next question comes from Brian Vaccaro of Raymond James. I was hoping to better understand the sales cadence that you saw through the first quarter, perhaps you could comment on the two year stack by month and where that stood quarter-to-date in April. And then, I know you mentioned more normal quesadilla incidents. But could you walk us through kind of the other puts and takes that you considered as you set the second quarter sales guidance? Yes, sure. So, obviously, the first quarter, I think Jack covered it in his remarks, the geometric average was in -- the 20%, 21% range. I would obviously tell you, January was a really good start, February, kind of flattish and March was really strong. Obviously, you got a much easier rollover. And then, we talked about all the things we did around launching quesadilla and dining room, start to reopen, so on and so forth.
As you move into April, if you think about this two year, I think that's probably the best way to think about our business right now, because of what you're seeing in kind of the, the year ago, performance on Easter, and so on and so forth. The good news is, we've seen days and weeks where you're in the 20s, and we've seen days in weeks, where you're in the high teens, so it's bouncing around a little bit. And I think a lot of things are driving that, right, you're still seeing things flash around COVID in different parts of the country. Unfortunately, we had the pause and the vaccines. So you've got some consumer sentiment, I think, bouncing around, which obviously plays a role. And then, obviously, we're going to be more in the leverage phase of our quesadilla launch versus our launch phase, which is what we're taking into account as we think it'll normalize as you go down into the rest of the quarter.
So, those are some of the puts in calls, we're in a couple weeks into the second quarter. We love where we are and we'll see how the rest of the quarter unfolds, because I think we've got the right strategies. So, we're going to stay focused on what we know has been working for us. And could you also comment on California, specifically, obviously, a big important market for you? Could you just ballpark where volumes there are versus the rest of the country? And have you seen an acceleration more recently as COVID restrictions are lifted? Yes. Look, I mean, this is not just a California phenomenon. This is a phenomenon that's happening across the country, which is, as I think places see a reduction in COVID cases and an increase in vaccines and people get back to maybe their old habits, as well as some of the habits they've created in this new environment. You see the business respond accordingly. So more people being out and about results in really good things for a restaurant concept like us, because they only around about Chipotle is a great option. Obviously, we've demonstrated we're a great option when you need that off-premise occasion as well. So the dining rooms become more open, people are more confident to be out and about that bodes well for us in every state. So it's not just the California phenomenon. That's an American phenomenon. Yes. Makes perfect sense. I'm in Atlanta, and I see it every day. So makes pretty good sense. Thank you. I will pass it along. The next question comes from Chris O’Cull of Stifel. Brian, I was curious what you believe the risk may be to sales growth from pulling the cauliflower rice, I think you said in mid-May? Look, I think this is a great initiative that we did. I've mentioned in the past, our goal is to keep people engaged with our menu. We'll have some things on for time period, and then take them off and bring them back. What we've seen, where we've tested this in the past is, it's not anything that results in us taking pause and moving forward with our strategy of taking it out in May.
So, the good news is, we've got a lot of strength in the business. I'm sure it'll be something we'll bring back down the road. But, we feel really good about our strategy of having some items that come off the menu and other items like the quesadilla that'll be permanently on the menu. And then, I was curious if you're seeing a similar level of beverage attachment rate with dine in usage today that you saw pre-pandemic? Well, look, I think Jack's talked about this, that's one of the things that's been a little bit of a drag is, as people stop coming into dining rooms, our beverage incidents went down. We fully anticipate as the dining rooms come back, we'll recapture that beverage incidents and things really start to normalize. I think we've got another shot at making people aware of the new tractor beverage offering, which the reason why we initially did that is, we were hoping to drive more beverage incidents. So that's our plan. As the dining rooms come back, our plan is to figure out how we can drive more beverage incidents accordingly. This concludes our question-and-answer session, I would like to turn the conference back over to Brian Niccol for any closing remarks. Okay. Well, thank you, everybody and thanks for all the questions. I just want to start off with first saying how immensely proud I am of all of the Chipotle employees. I think what we've seen in the last quarter, and frankly, the last year is the power of great people, great culture, being focused on the things that needed to be handled right now. And it's pretty powerful to see an organization of 100,000 people come together and do the right thing for each other and their community. So very proud of this organization, very proud of our employees. And look, I think we're off to a great start in '21 because our employees have demonstrated the resiliency of our business. I'm confident that we will continue to do the right things, so that as the dining rooms reopen, we will give people great experiences, we'll continue to invest in our digital business that's not done growing, as evidenced by what we shared here.
And then, obviously, we talked about this too, we're very committed to seeing the AUV margin algorithm come to life. And that's really exciting to see that starting to emerge in a meaningful way. And then, lastly, it's really exciting to be building 40 plus restaurants in a quarter, we're going to build from here. And I think we're well on our way to getting back to the business of Chipotle growing in a meaningful way, both top-line, bottom-line and new units. And then, that results in great opportunities for all our people that have just demonstrated the power of the Chipotle culture and the Chipotle purpose.
So thank you for joining. Thank you for listening and I look forward to touching base in a quarter Take care. The conference is now concluded.

Chipotle second quarter results highlight the strength of our brand and our people, as we demonstrated growing momentum in our business. Over the past 15 months, our teams have done an admirable job navigating and executing against macro complexities while giving us great optimism for where we go from here.
While COVID challenges remain, including uncertainty regarding the impact of the Delta variant, I'm confident that our teams are up to the challenge and we're hopeful that we'll gradually see a more stable environment over time. Specific to Chipotle, we're pleased that all of our restaurants are now open and most are back to normal operations.
For the quarter, we reported sales of $1.9 billion, representing 38.7% year-over-year growth, which was fueled by 31.2% comparable restaurant sales growth; restaurant level margin of 24.5%, was more than doubled the 12.2% we reported last year; earnings per share adjusted for unusual items of $7.46, representing a significant increase over the $0.40 reported last year; digital sales growth of 10.5% year-over-year, representing 48.5% of sales; and we opened 56 new restaurants, including 45 with the Chipotlane. And I'm delighted to report that Q3 is also off to a strong start.
While our trailing 12 month AUV is $2.41 million, the underlying run rate during the quarter is now above the historical peak of $2.5 million AUV. When we started this transformation a little over three years ago, I was often asked whether I thought we could get back to our peak $2.5 million volumes. My answer was, yes, and when we achieve it, we will talk about growth beyond that.
So it's a nice achievement for organization to have $2.5 million AUVs again. But more importantly, we have growth strategies that will take us to the next leg of our journey, $3 million AUVs, along with industry-leading returns on invested capital that improve as we continue to add Chipotlanes.
Stronger restaurant level economics combined with significant unit growth should allow us to optimize earnings power for many years to come. In fact, we remain confident in our key growth strategies and believe that over the longer term, they will allow us to have 6,000 restaurants in North America with AUVs pushing well beyond $3 million. Yes, the opportunity ahead of us remain significant.
So, what are the key strategies that are resonating with guests and allowing us to win today while we create the future? To no one's surprise, they are the same ones we've been talking about for some time, namely opening and running successful restaurants with a strong culture that provides great food with integrity while delivering exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences; leveraging digital capabilities to drive productivity and expand access, convenience and engagement; engaging with customers through our loyalty program to drive transactions in frequency; making the brand visible, relevant and loved; and utilizing a disciplined approach to creativity and innovation.
Let me now provide a brief update on each of these, starting with our outstanding operations. This is a key focal point, as our business is building on our digital gains along with in-restaurant strength due to a more confident and mobile consumer, as well as the hard work our team has done to build more love for Chipotle.
We've continued to make operational adjustments to adapt to the constantly changing environment, which has led us to recovering about 70% of in-restaurant sales thus far, while retaining about 80% of digital sales. It's no secret that running great restaurants requires great people with a terrific culture and we are privileged to have the best of both.
Despite the labor challenges in certain parts of the country, the team has remained focused on safety, reliability, excellent culinary and experiences. I'm extremely proud of our world-class employee value proposition. We're providing industry-leading benefits, including a new virtual mental health platform, expanded debt-free degrees, attractive wages that were recently increased to an average of $15 per hour, specialized job training and development and significant career advancement opportunities.
And because more than 90% of our restaurant management roles are internal promotes, employees who joined the Chipotle family know they have the opportunity to grow their careers with us. Through investing in our people, we have been able to maintain the stability of our workforce over the last two years.
Knowing that our people are the key to our growth, we have been diligent in our recruiting focus since the start of the year. In reimagining the African experience, we're leveraging partnerships that allow us to engage in authentic conversations with prospective candidates and share all the opportunity Chipotle has to offer.
Our Coast to Coast Career Day event last week resulted in us hiring thousands of additional team members to meet current demand and accommodate future growth. These efforts have dramatically helped to improve our labor position, and as a result, our restaurants are attracting and retaining excellent employees in a tough labor environment.
After visiting several restaurants this past month, I'm encouraged to see more and more guests enjoying their meals in our dining rooms. They order Chipotle, because they can get the exact customized meal they want and with real ingredients faster than anywhere else.
As a result, we are committed to teaching, training and validating the five pillars of throughput every day during every shift to ensure we meet our high standards and provide a great guest experience.
Over the past few years, Chipotle has evolved to a point where we now have two sizable businesses in-restaurant as well as our record-breaking digital platform that are helping us become a real food focused digital lifestyle brand.
During the second quarter, digital sales grew about 11% year-over-year to $916 million and represented nearly 49% of sales. While COVID has, of course, helped bolster these digital gains, ongoing technology investments and operational excellence have been the critical success factors.
Some examples of the digital innovations we've introduced include the addition of our concierge chatbot, Pepper, to the Chipotle app, which has the ability to answer common questions and resolve issues more efficiently, thus freeing up our customer care teams' time to help the guest with more complicated situations.
We also gave guests the ability to easily rate their order rate in the app and online at chipotle.com, providing our restaurant operations teams with actionable insights on how to maintain and improve the digital guest experience.
Additionally, we have opened a digital-only kitchen, continued expanding our digital drive-throughs with Chipotlanes being the majority of our new restaurant openings, refreshed group ordering and invested in digital internationally by launching the Chipotle app in Canada and implementing our digital assets in Europe.
While the results and positive feedback on these innovations show us we're on the right track, we know there is still more to do to enhance the customer experience by expanding access and minimizing friction.
Not only are we pleased with the level of digital sales and overall mix, we're also delighted to see that our highest margin transaction, digital pickup orders is gaining traction, and we expect this to continue as we add more Chipotlanes and customers experience the value of this occasion.
As I mentioned earlier, we held onto about 80% of our digital gains exiting Q2. This highlights our digital experience's sticky because it is everything customers love about Chipotle with added convenience. And due to the pandemic, many new consumers were introduced to Chipotle via our digital channels and are now using us for alternative and often incremental occasions.
Naturally, we believe our digital sales mix will moderate as capacity restrictions ease and guests feel more comfortable physically ordering and dining in our restaurants. However, we expect absolute digital sales dollars to find a new equilibrium in 2021 and grow from there. We're encouraged to see that so far in July, we continued to hold on to these digital gains even as in-store recovery has strengthened.
Moving next to the loyalty program, which is a key enabler of our digital ecosystem and an expanding network that now has more than 23 million members. With this large base of consumers, Chipotle can distribute its own content, more and more effectively, and drive deeper levels of engagement within this community than ever before.
We are leveraging our CRM platform to drive brand engagement and send personalized messages to help supercharge our super fans. We have proven that we can influence decisions along a guests buying journey when we offer them the right individually tailored offers at the right time. We're continuously improving our analytics and are consistently able to generate more transactions from light, medium and high frequency users.
With the recent announcement of Rewards Exchange, we're optimistic we can continue to build upon our success. The updated functionality provides greater customization and flexibility to redeem rewards and allows guests to earn rewards faster, all of which is expected to improve engagement and drive additional frequency. While we are off to a terrific start, we will continue to invest in the program to take it to the next level and have other enhancements to the program that are expected to be rolled out by year-end.
While the loyalty program is used to help drive frequency, our marketing efforts are primarily designed to bring more people to the brand. The combination of reach-based media and a successful frequency driven loyalty program make a great one-two punch that both brings in new users and increases transactions with our existing customers.
The marketing team continues to ensure that relevant creative across a wide variety of media channels enables the brands remain visible and live at the intersection of Chipotle and culture. Their agile approach, innovative mindset and relentless commitment to measurement have led to ongoing success. For example, our campaign to support the Quesadilla launch was omnichannel with relevant creative across online video, digital and social media platforms, as well as via traditional TV spots.
We also celebrated Team Chipotle, a group of American athletes who love the brand long before they became famous. Their personalized unwrapped videos provide an inside look at Chipotle athlete super fans and what it takes to compete at the highest level. It also highlights the training hard and eating real food with real ingredients go hand in hand.
Furthermore, our burritos and Bitcoin campaign around National Burrito Day was one of our most successful social initiatives to date, with billions of impressions for this culturally relevant promotion. These are just a few examples of the brand's work to drive culture, drive difference and ultimately driving a purchase.
Another important pillar of our marketing efforts is a steady stream of new menu innovation, with a cadence of on average about two to three per year. Cauliflower rice was a seasonal item that enhance our Lifestyle Bowls and a successful bringing in new guests.
We launched Quesadillas as a permanent digital exclusive offering in March, and this menu item continues to perform well as it appears in about 10% of our transactions, and it's also helping attract new customers to Chipotle.
Our talented culinary team is far from finished and our pipeline is filled with promise. I'm pleased to report that smoked brisket has been validated by our stage-gate process. In addition, we are also in the early stages of developing other exciting menu items that we will validate using our stage-gate that will bring news and new customers to the brand.
To conclude, Chipotle is a unique brand committed to fostering a culture that values and champions our diversity, while leveraging the individual talents of all team members to grow our business, elevate our brand and cultivate a better world. Well trained and supported people preparing safe, delicious food and delivering excellent guest experiences are at the heart of our success. A big thank you to all our hard working employees for making this possible. As a result, I'm convinced more than ever that we have the right team, the right culture and the right strategy to allow Chipotle to be a premier growth company for many years to come.
With that, here's Jack to walk you through the financials. Thanks, Brian. Good afternoon, everyone.
We're pleased to report solid second quarter results, with sales growing 38.7% year-over-year to $1.9 billion, as comp sales grew 31.2%. Restaurant level margin of 24.5% was more than double the 12.2% margin from last year, and represents the highest margin since 2015. And earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $7.46, a significant improvement over last year's adjusted EPS of $0.40.
Just like last quarter, the second quarter had unusual expenses related to our 2018 performance share modification related to COVID, restaurant asset impairment and closure costs, legal expenses, as well as transformation costs, which negatively impacted our earnings per share by $0.86, leading to GAAP earnings per share of $6.60.
Looking ahead to Q3, while uncertainty still exists with the potential impact of the Delta variant, as well as the pace of the economic recovery, if current sales trends continue, we expect our comp to be in the low to mid double-digit range, which implies a nice sequential acceleration in our geometric two-year stack.
This is due to the menu price increase we took in early June, which is holding strong so far, as well as in-restaurant sales continuing to recover. Of course, we'll closely monitoring developments regarding the Delta variant and follow all local protocols to ensure the safety of our restaurant teams and our customers.
As Brian mentioned, in June, we increased our average hourly rate to $15, and subsequently took a 3.5% to 4% menu price increase to cover the cost in dollar terms. While average restaurant cash flow remains the same, this lowers margin by about 80 basis points, and increases sales by about $100,000 on the annual basis, so the historic margin algorithm we have discussed is not as relevant going forward.
However, we maintain our goal of being able to pass-through approximately 40% of incremental sales to restaurant cash flow, which is an important piece of our earnings growth potential. This is critical as we march towards AUVs of $3 million as higher sales will lead to higher margins and cash-on-cash return - restaurant returns should increase well above the low to mid 60% range we are seeing today.
Let me now go through the key P&L line items. Food costs were 30.4% in Q2, a decrease of nearly 300 basis points from last year. This was due primarily to leverage for menu price increases, as well as lower beef prices, which were partially offset by higher cost associated with new menu items and avocados. Given the current environment, it shouldn't be a surprise to anyone that Q3 is going to be challenged by several industry-wide issue, most notably beef and freight costs, as well as staffing shortages at our suppliers.
We anticipate these commodity headwinds will negatively impact the quarter by an additional 60 basis points to 80 basis points, essentially offsetting the benefit of menu price increases. This will result in food cost for Q3 being at or slightly above the percentage we saw in Q2. Over the next few quarters, we'll have greater visibility on how much of this inflation is permanent versus transitory, and we can take the appropriate actions as needed to help offset any lasting impacts.
Labor costs for the quarter were 24.5%, a decrease of 370 basis points from last year. This decrease was driven primarily by sales leverage, and to a lesser extent, efficiencies related to digital orders, which were partially offset by higher wages that we saw for just one month during the quarter. We expect labor costs to be in the low 26% range during Q3 to reflect a full quarter of wage increase.
Other operating costs for the quarter were 15.2%, a decrease of 400 basis points from last year due primarily to sales leverage and lower promotional expenses. Marketing and promo costs for the quarter were 2.4%, a decrease of 260 basis points versus the prior year due to a significant level of free delivery promotions last year.
We anticipate marketing expense to be in the mid 2% range in Q3, while the full year 2021 marketing spend is expected to remain about 3% of sales. Overall, other operating costs are expected to be in the mid 15% range for the quarter.
G&A for the quarter was $146 million on a GAAP basis, or $119 million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding $23.5 million for the previously mentioned modifications to our 2018 performance shares, $2.1 million for legal expenses and $1.2 million related to transformation expenses.
G&A also includes $92 million in underlying G&A, about $22.5 million related to non-cash stock comp and nearly $4.5 million related to higher bonus accruals and payroll taxes and equity vesting and stock option exercises. Looking to Q3, we expect our underlying G&A to be around $96 million as we continue to make investments, primarily in technology to support ongoing growth.
We anticipate stock comp will likely be around $25 million in Q3, although this amount could move up or down based on our actual performance. We also expect to recognize around $4 million related to performance-based bonus expenses and employer taxes associated with shares that vest during the quarter, as well as about $1 million related to our all major conference scheduled for Q1 of next year.
Our effective tax rate for Q2 was 23.7% on a GAAP basis and 22.4% on a non-GAAP basis. And similar to last quarter, our effective tax rate benefited from option exercises and share vesting at elevated stock prices. For fiscal 2021, we continue to estimate our underlying effective tax rate will be in the 25% to 27% range, so it may vary based on discrete items.
Turning now to the balance sheet. We ended Q2 with nearly $1.2 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments, with no debt, along with the $500 million untapped revolver. During the quarter, we opportunistically repurchased $145 million of our stock at an average price of $1,408. We had about $208 million remaining on our share authorization as of June 30th, and expect to continue to prioritize using excess free cash flow to repurchase stock.
But as I've said before, the best returns we can generate are by investing in more Chipotlanes. And during Q2, we opened 56 new restaurant, with 45 of these including a Chipotlanes. Despite some external challenges, the development team continues to do an excellent job building new restaurant, as well as developing a robust new unit development pipeline.
For the full year, we now expect to be at or slightly above our prior 2021 guidance of 200 new restaurant, with more than 70% including a Chipotlane. As of June 30th, we had a total of 244 Chipotlanes, including eight conversion and six relocations, and they continue to enhance access and convenience forecast while demonstrating superior performance.
New Chipotlanes are opening with about 20% higher sales compared to the non-Chipotlanes opened during the same time period. Over the trailing 12 months, Chipotlanes restaurant continues to drive about a 15% higher overall digital sales mix compared to non-Chipotlanes, and it's skewed heavily towards order ahead, our highest margin transaction. In the two-year geometric comp, at the 88 Chipotlane restaurants that have been opened more than a year continues to outperform the non-Chipotlane restaurants from the same period.
And also it's early days, Chipotlane conversions and relocations, which are both going through the stage-gate process, are yielding encouraging results. We'll continue to learn and refine our approach to judiciously accelerate our Chipotlane portfolio, whether it'd be an older existing restaurant, strategic relocations of existing restaurant or through new restaurant additions.
In closing, I want to reiterate how proud and thankful I am to all Chipotle team members for their tireless efforts. They're helping create value every day for our business, our communities, our shareholders and each other, which is taking our amazing brand to new heights. As one strong team unified by our purpose and values, we remain committed to driving our powerful and durable economic model. Needless to say, my optimism for Chipotle's long-term potential has never been higher.
With that, we're happy to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Nicole Miller of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Just wanted to ask one question around development with just two parts, please. The first is, how are you getting to at least store or maybe above 200 units? When you started the year, that seemed like it could be a really more of a target. So I'm just wondering like what has changed in the marketplace that's allowing you to get there now. And maybe that's a function of also growing the pipeline for next year if there is anything you can say even qualitatively on that?
And then just the second part is around best practices. Like, how are things going outside of the U.S.? How's Canada? I think maybe the first Chipotlane opened. How's Western Europe? I think you're going to suburbs and testing technology. What are some shared best practices? Thank you. Yes, sure. Thanks, Nichole. And we obviously were very delighted with our quarter results. To get to your specific question about new unit openings, obviously, we're halfway through the year, so that gives us more confidence in where we're going to end the year. And I think we talked about coming into the year, how we had a really strong pipeline of units that were planned to be open. The team has done a phenomenal job in securing the people capability, to be ready to open the restaurants. They've done a phenomenal job on the supply chain to ensure that we have everything we need to open restaurants, and we've continued to have really great openings.
So, the combination of sites wind up, supply chain in place, people capability ready to go, gives us just that much more confidence on how we'll finish out the year to reinforce our guidance around 200 plus new openings. And we continue to build a really robust pipeline going forward. That's primarily driven by Chipotlanes, which is also a huge enabler for the business going forward.
Your second question about what we seeing in Canada and Europe. Canada continues to perform. And we're really excited about the opportunity to opening more restaurants up there. Obviously, Canada has been a little bit slower on the reopening process, but even despite that they continue to deliver great economics, and frankly, are performing in line with the U.S., and we're very optimistic about how we can continue to open and grow in Canada.
In Europe, I think I mentioned this in some of our recent investor meetings. We just opened two new restaurants outside of London, and both of those are off to a really good starts. We're just a couple of weeks in. But we love the diversity of assets that we're opening. We love the fact that we have our digital assets all in place. And I'm optimistic about what we're going to learn.
So that we can really give clarity on the opportunity in Europe down the road. But that's still in the early stages of our stage-gate process. And I think I mentioned this in the past, probably COVID has slowed us down in our learning there than anywhere else. But love what we're seeing in the U.S. on new units and it's exciting to see the economics we're getting out of Canada. The next question comes from Dennis Geiger of UBS. Please go ahead. Brian, just wondering if you could talk a bit more about the digital and the dining businesses? I guess, specifically, the customer overlap there, where you think that overlap is now? I believe, historically, it's been sort of in the 10% to 15% range. And just kind of curious if you have any decent sense on where that might be going, going forward, as dining traffic goes from 70% to 100% and depending on where digital shakes out? Just curious how you think about that dynamic going forward? Thanks. Yes, sure. So I think we mentioned this in our comments earlier. But we hung on to about 80% of our digital sales and we're seeing about 70% of our dining room sales recaptured of where we were pre COVID. And what we're seeing is the overlap is still in that 15% plus range, people doing both channels, which leaves the door open for a lot of incremental occasions or different occasions. The one thing that is driving some of the bounce back in our dining room business is, we are seeing more business at lunch. And we're also seeing that lunch business occur Monday through Friday.
And then when you look at kind of like suburban versus urban, that's another place we're starting to see clearly people return to work or return to normal, I would say, behaviors throughout the day. So, the lunch occasion is definitely coming back, while we're hanging on to all these new occasions around dinner and a lot of these off-premise occasions we've been talking about over time.
I'm guessing, we'll continue to see the overlap slowly go up from here, because as more people return to the dining room, I'm hoping they've had really positive experiences digitally that will suggest, hey, want to give Chipotle a try in the dining room and vice versa.
Hopefully, people that are dining room only people have heard great things about our rewards program, our digital system, and they'll start giving that a try. But the thing I love about the two business is, they serve different occasions, different needs, and I think that proves over the long run, these things are incremental or complementary. It's very helpful. If I could slip just one more in. Just curious on the pricing increase point. If you could just comment at all on the customer resistance that you saw there, maybe how that stacked up relative to expectations and what that might mean as you think about the next increase? Thank you very much. Yes, sure. So, obviously, I think we talked about this before, Chipotle has a tremendous value proposition. We always have known - we have some pricing power. It's something we really would prefer to be the last thing we have to use. It made sense for us to take some action, specifically, in the delivery channel and then most recently across our menu. Consistent with the past, we saw very little resistance with the price increase in any of these channels.
So, I would say, went as expected, and we'll continue to keep an eye on our value proposition going forward. And I would tell you the good news is I think our value proposition remains very strong. So that if we're faced with any headwinds that warrants the need for pricing, I think we can do it with confidence knowing that the brand is really strong and our value proposition is really strong. The next question comes from Andrew Charles of Cowen. Please go ahead. This is actually Brian Vieten on for Andrew. Thanks guys for the question. So, just thinking about long-term margins here, now that we're essentially back to peak AUVs as we look ahead kind of $3 million AUVs and beyond, just - I guess just philosophically what's the right way to think about the restaurant margins you can produce at that level, just given the efforts you guys have done to close the margin gap for delivery sales? Well, I'll start, and then Jack feel free to chime in. I think what you're hearing from us is we believe we've got a lot of growth still in front of us from a top line standpoint. And the model of how we flow these incremental dollars is very much strong, and in place to continue to be a leader in the industry on this front.
And as I mentioned, we also have pricing power. So, you kind of pair those things up, you realize - look, we're going to do all the right things we can on the supply chain front, being as efficient as possible, investing in the things that matter to our customers and our employees.
And then, obviously, I think we'll be rewarded with top line, and then accordingly, we'll figure out how best to flow that to the bottom line. But we love the situation we're in. We believe we're going to continue to drive growth from here. And we're very optimistic about our future.
But, Jack, I don't know if you want to comment on anything else as it relates to this question? Yes. Listen, the data point that we shared today about when we grow our sales, we expect about 40% flow-through to the margin suggests there is still a lot of leverage as we grow our volumes from $2.5 million up to the $3 million, that our margin is going up. And I would just - in rough terms, I would say, from where we are today in the 24%, 25% range, we can add hundreds of basis points of margin as we move up from $2.5 million up to $3 million.
And importantly, when we get into that range, we're going to have cash on cash returns on our restaurants, which today are very attractive at 60%, 65%, they're going to be in the 80%, 90%, even approaching 100% returns. And that's - frankly, internally, that's something we've always looked at. We know that if we generate superior returns on all of our invested capital that we can have lots of shareholder value and we expect that to only get better over time. The next question comes from John Glass of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. First, just going back to pricing, just to level set, where will the effective pricing be in the third quarter, just given the price increase you took in the delivery? I just want to make sure I understand that in the context of your comp guidance.
And related to that, Jack, I understand the mechanics of lowering restaurant margin with the increase in the labor. You made it sound like that's just going to be the way it is. But I think previously you've sort of talked about, well, we'll look at pricing over time, so that we can kind of get back to that one-to-one relationship with AUVs and margins. Is that still the goal or do you just think it should be lower because you don't want to get too aggressive on pricing in the near term? Yes, John, I mean, listen, there is still that possibility that we could take additional pricing action to fully close the gap. I just think there is so much going on right now with inflation and the question about whether inflation is transitory or permanent. We've got labor inflation. We took a big move there. We'll see how that shakes out. And now we've got the Delta variant as well.
There's a lot of unknowns. And so what we don't want to do is sit here and declare that we're going to do something with certainly between now and the end of the year. I think we want to do is, let's see how the menu price continues to be accepted by customers, so far, really, really good, really seeing no resistance whatsoever. Let's see what happens to inflation, and let's see what happens to the economy over the next several months, and we'll make the appropriate decisions at the appropriate time.
But I think the important thing, John, is that we've got a lot of upward mobility on our margins. We have pricing power. Now, it's just a matter of how and when we decide to use that pricing power to either protect margins or to invest in our people like we just did with the wages. But nothing has been locked and loaded in terms of what we will do between now and the end of the year. And the effective pricing for the third quarter? Yes, John, it's - the Q2 was about 9%-ish call it. Q3 will be slightly higher. What happens is, you're going to get the full quarter for the wage menu price increase we just took. We got about a month worth of it in Q2. We'll get a full three months in the third quarter. But then we're also starting to lap the delivery increase that we started taking in the third quarter of last year. So to move from about, call it, a 9%-ish increase or the low-9% to about 10% in Q3. And, Brian, just one more. Did the increase in wages solve largely the labor issue? Are you fully staffed in restaurants or you still needing to employ people even with those higher wages? And can you just talk about maybe the tenure of your employees now? I think in the past, tenured employees with great throughput. Maybe there's been more turnover just during COVID. Are you seeing the same kind of performance out of restaurants and throughput that you would hope for given this comp level? Yes. So, to answer your first question, the employee value proposition that we're bringing forward with the higher wages, the ability to grow into $100,000 opportunity in very short order has worked very well. And I give a lot of credit to our guys in the field with being out there, recruiting and retaining our talent. And we're in a really good labor spot relative to - as you look at our historical performances, we're back to where we were in 2019, and frankly, a little bit better, which is great to see. And also the growth in our Company is really resonating with our employees.
Our General Managers know that they have the ability to become Field Leaders. And our Field Leaders know they have the ability to become Team Directors. And folks that are Shift Managers and Kitchen Managers know there's going to be a lots of General Manager jobs available.
So, that's why I say the whole employee value proposition, I think, is really resonating. Combine that with the Company's purpose, and we've made tremendous progress on what was really a difficult situation that popped up in, call it, February and March with the business just frankly coming back faster than we were able to hire. But now our hiring has caught up.
To answer your other part of the question, we still have work to do to get our grade throughput model back in place. It's been, gee, well over a year since folks all lines. And for some of our employees it's the first time they're seeing lines, and for customers too. Part of the process of getting people move down the line quickly is they need to know how to order, what they want to order, and getting back to individual meals, as well as our team members being quick to move them down the line, but doing it in an accurate way.
So, we still have opportunity on the throughput front. But I think that's just a matter of retraining, building that muscle on our throughput pillars, and I'm confident we're going to capture that opportunity. Our operators are focused on it. The next question comes from David Tarantino of Baird. Please go ahead. Brian, I'm curious I think - curious to know how you're thinking about the appropriate growth rate for the business going forward? If you think longer term, you have great returns on capital and the units. You have plenty of capital to put to work. So just wondering how you're thinking about unit development in particular and whether you can accelerate over the next few years? And maybe secondarily, whether Chipotle can return to being a 10% type unit growth story at some point in our future? Yes. Look, I think, here's the good news, David. I think every year since I've been here, we've been able to accelerate new units. And the good news is our operations are stronger. Our people capability, I think, is stronger. The P&L now is stronger. And I think you're seeing our ability to open more units get demonstrated, even in a difficult environment, right. We talked about how we plan on opening over 200 units this year.
So, I think there's going to be an opportunity for us to continue to accelerate. The pace at which we do that, we're going to be probably more on the conservative side than putting the pedal to the metal on that one, because I just want to make sure we continue to open with excellence. And I know there is demand. I know the economics are excellent.
And I know we have the people capability. I just want to keep doing it in a way where we're able to build upon our success and we have tons of runway in this space. So, optimistic about our ability to accelerate from here. What that ultimately looks like? As we get closer to each year, we'll probably have a better idea of what we can build on. The next question comes from David Palmer of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Just a quick follow-up. First on the pricing that you did on the delivery side, did you see a shift to mobile order and pickup? And do you think that's related? And if you did, was it related to the pricing at all? We saw a little bit of a move into our order ahead business, but it coincided, David, with also kind of everything reopening a lot more. So I don't know how much of that was driven by the pricing versus the fact that the customer was now more mobile, and they clearly saw the trade-off in paying for the convenience of delivery versus ordering ahead and picking up.
But we saw very little resistance in our delivery business. So I think it's more to do with people wanting different occasions, and then what they want to pay for those occasions, and the fact that they're are more mobile, than frankly, the pricing driving those behaviors.
But, Jack, I don't know if you want to add anything to that? No, Brian. I would say the same thing. We're really pleased with the trends. We didn't see anything that was a sudden resistance to the delivery menu price, but because it coincided with people becoming out and about a little bit more, we did see a little shift in that business. So, it's hard to sort through and figure out how much is due to pricing, how much was due to just people looking for the in-store ordering process. But the bottom line is our business moved up. It didn't move backwards, it definitely moved up when you combine all channels. Yes. And actually, I think, the only thing I'd add to that, David, is one thing we continue to learn is these occasions are unique. If you want a delivery occasion, you usually don't trade it off with an order ahead occasion. But the ability to have access to both is really powerful. So that's what I think Jack's point is like at the end of day, we saw - we didn't see a step back in our business, we continue to see steps forward. And I think it was more driven by the fact that people were more mobile, and then they realized these additional access points. And just related question about where this on-premise ordering will end up at the end of the day? The consumer has been trained to do digital ordering for you? If you - the on-premise ordering, it feels like it's something like $0.5 million per store lower than it was pre-COVID. And in some ways, you're not missing it because you'd have high margin digital orders, but some of this is probably going to come back because people are still little COVID cautious. You're worker shortages, work from home, and some of those things will burn off. So how do you think about the melt up in that on-premise order business? And how much of it maybe is semi permanently shifted to digital ordering? Yes. Look, I think - I mean, this is us just reading our consumer data, and granted we're only a couple of weeks really in where things are really been open and all our restaurants have been opened. But what is definitely clear is that on-premise occasion is a different occasion. And I think I mentioned this earlier, we only have about 15%, 17% of people overlapping between the occasions.
And when you talk to folks that in-dining room experience - as much as we've replicated the in-line experience online, it's - there is still something to be said to walking down the line, seeing the food, getting the sights, the sound, the smells, and getting probably another level of customization that I think is very engaging to customers, and they want to have that experience.
So, I think, our dining rooms are going to keep coming back. And I also think it's human nature, you want to eat out, like you like a change of scenery, people like to share a meal. And I've probably been one of the few that's keep saying dining rooms will come back, and I think if we give a great experience, they'll come back disproportionately to Chipotle. The next question comes from Chris Carril of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. So, how does the continued recovery of the dining room business factor into how you're thinking about the opportunities across different restaurant types or models with respect to your long-term development plans? And maybe related to that, could you also share any learnings so far from the digital-only restaurant you opened last year? Yes, sure. Look, that's why the focus for us is to build Chipotlanes. It give you all the access points, right. You can order ahead, pick it up in your car. You can order ahead, come in and grab and go. You can come through the line. And we're going to be focused on building as many Chipotlanes as possible.
As we think about these digital-onlys or Chipotlane-onlys or these alternative formats, they really are - I think, about them as like seeing restaurants or opportunistic to the trade area to maximize Chipotle sales coming out of a trade area. But the focus area for us is Chipotlane. We want all the access modes for our customers. Because at the end of the day, I could keep talking about these are different occasions, arguably, you're almost a different consumer when you decide you want to do digital versus being a dining room customer.
So that's what we're after. I think it's what our customers want. And I think it's what maximizes returns for us. Specifically, our digital-only restaurant in the trade area where it made sense to do it is doing really well. But you know what, if the trade area supported putting a Chipotlane, I'll put a Chipotlane in there. The next question comes from Jared Garber of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Somewhat of a follow-up to the last question and your commentary, Brian. I'm just curious how you guys are thinking about sort of the Chipotlane opportunity over the longer term? Obviously, about 80% of the new units this quarter had a Chipotlane versus I think like sort of the traditional guidance of about 70%. If we think about that opportunity over the next several years, are there dayparts, are there menu innovation items beyond sort of the Quesadilla that you're thinking about that can really only be served with Chipotle in that sort of some sort of critical mass that we should be thinking about over the longer term? Yes. Look I definitely think as you get more penetration, the Chipotlane asset, it gives us another opportunity for our operating platform. And the thing I love is we've got a multi-billion dollar digital business that over time is going to have more access, right. So, of course, we're going to figure out how to maximize that, whether that's dayparts, whether that's menu. So, as we get more penetration on these access points for our digital business, they give customers less friction and more convenience, we'll figure out how our operators can best serve it.
But the thing I love is the Quesadilla has demonstrated, we can run innovation of our digital business without impacting our dining room business. And I think we are also going to be able to run innovation on our dining room business without impacting our digital business. And our operators have done a great job of using great culinary with single kitchen back there to then service two businesses, whether it's our digital make line business or our front-line business. So that's how I would think about it. Thanks. And then are there any operational changes you're thinking about as you fully recapture? I know you're - it's about 70% of in-restaurant dining today, obviously, as that continues to increase, if we were to assume that your digital business remains really robust and that's additive business when things sort of fully normalize, you talked about some tech investments that you're making. Are there sort of remodel thoughts about what a sort of a Chipotle of the future might look like as you balance out maybe a very robust in-restaurant experience with the digital side as well? Yes. Look, the way I would describe it is we're going to be investing in ways to get better throughput executed in both the digital make line and our front line. And we're looking at investments on helping our teams with smarter prep, having the right food available at the right time, better forecasting, better staffing. These are all things that will just allow us, frankly, to provide more burritos and bowls digitally, as well as more burritos and bowls on the front line.
So, we're really focused on the fact that we got a lot of capacity in these restaurants. So whatever we can do to invest in our people or our operation to enable them to provide more burritos and bowls per minute is a huge leverage point for us.
So that's like - at the highest level, that's how I think about it. I mean there is various things and simple projects that provide certain benefits, but the higher order thing we're after is how do we ultimately end up with just enhanced throughput, both for the digital business and the front-line business and in such a way where we still get no compromise on customization, quality of food and now our digital business accuracy. The next question comes from John Ivankoe of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. I guess at this point in the call, I was curious if we could have some color about dine-in, and I guess the relationship between dine-in and off-premise broadly in the markets that have been opened the longest like the Southeast and Texas versus, I guess, the Northeast and West Coast, how much of a difference in kind of customer flow are you seeing kind of '21 versus '19? And are there some, perhaps, leading indicators that we can talk about as all markets, I guess, fully normalize and become the same in 2022? Yes. Look, I would tell you that I think the most important leading indicator for us is we're starting to see our lunch business come back. And what's great about that lunch business is, it's usually an individual that, frankly, we haven't seen in a while. And while that's occurring, we still have these, what I would call, the group occasions, that back in 2019, Chipotle didn't participate in to the level that we're participating in. We have started our journey of getting into these group occasions, in these off-premise occasions, but COVID really accelerated that.
So what I would tell you is probably the best piece of news that I've seen in our data is to see that our lunch business is coming back, because as soon as people are given the opportunity to go back to their behaviors of going into their office, dropping their kids off at school, activities, whatever it may be, they're back to wanting to eat our lunch. And that's an on-premise occasion that we have seen a nice uptick probably. The next question comes from Nick Setyan of Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. I wanted to go back to the longer-term commentary on margins again. I think you said 40% flow-through, if I take every $100,000 from $2.5 million, I think that implies about 50 bps of margin uptick per $100,000 or so. I guess is that separate from any future price increases? And also, how are you thinking about sort of labor inflation and overall inflation, in general, as we kind of progress from this $2.5 million AUV to $3 million over the next few years? Yes. Nick, listen, that 40% flow-through is something that will happen if we don't have anything out of the ordinary happening with inflation, meaning if inflation just settles into a normal cadence and we use some of our pricing power to offset that, we'll have the ability to flow that 40% through. If you have a dislocation for some period of time, that 40% is going to vary.
But we know, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, when we know we have pricing power, we're in a position, because we're all company owned and we take a long-term view, we can watch how the inflation unfolds over the next few months, the next few quarters, we can see how much is transitory, how much is going to be permanent, and we can take the right pricing action at the right time.
So, we don't have to be in a hurry to do it like some franchise organizations might be - feel a little bit more pressure to do that. But the 40% flow-through that assumes just kind of over a longer period of time as you're moving from this $2.5 million volume up to $3 million that is long is over that period of time, maybe not every quarter, maybe not every year, but over that period of time, we're able to offset inflation with some modest pricing increases, we can have that 40% flow-through. And then just on the smoked brisket near term, is the timing on that Q4 or Q3? Yes. Go ahead, Jack. Yes. That was timing on a menu price increase, yes, we haven't made a decision on... No. Jack, he was asking about brisket. Oh, okay. Go ahead, Brian. That yours. Well, I do love the brisket. Thank you, Jack. The answer is it's been validated in our stage-gate process. We've not nailed down exactly when we'll do it. But it's always nice to have it ready to go. And we'll look at the marketplace, and we'll figure out the best time to do it. The next question comes from Peter Saleh of BTIG. Please go ahead. Brian, just wanted to come back to that conversation on the brisket for a second. I know you're not disclosing an exact time of launch. But can you talk maybe a little bit about how you're positioning in the menu? Is something else coming off to make room for the brisket, or is this going to be purely incremental on the menu? Yes. So right now, our plan is it will be a seasonal item. And that's the way we tested it and validated it. So, it's a nice incremental occasion is what we've seen. And I look forward to you everybody getting an opportunity to try it, because it's also delicious. And just on the cash balance, I know you guys had indicated about $1.2 billion of cash and investments. I think, Brian, you also indicated, you'll be a little more prudent maybe in development going forward, making sure that you're building the right unit. So, what's the right amount of cash to hold here? I know you guys announced a little bit more on share repo. But any thoughts around maybe returning more of that capital to shareholders through a special dividend or an ongoing dividend anything of that sort? Yes. Well, first of all, I don't want you to misconstrue my comments on new units. Our plan is to continue to demonstrate that we have the ability to add more units. We've done it every year. Every year, we accelerated. And I think we're going to still be able to do that. So - and the good news is, we have the cash to do it. And we also know there is no better investment with our cash than to build more Chipotle.
So, that's always going to be the first priority. And then, obviously, I think Jack talked about in his remarks earlier our share buyback program that's going to continue to be a part of the puzzle, but there is no plans for dividend.
Jack, I don't know if you wanted to add anything? No. Listen, I would agree with that. I only thing I would add is that, we are - we've taken during COVID, and as we now look at the Delta variant and there is some uncertainty with that, we've been even more conservative than normal with our balance sheet. But what I think you can expect to see is, as things stabilize, as they become more predictable, we'll be able to return even more value to shareholders through buybacks.
But we also have the revolver as well, which gives us a little bit of breathing room. But last year when the pandemic started, it became pretty clear that these were very different time and we needed to make sure that we had enough assets or enough cash in the balance sheet, so we can invest in our people, invest in technology, continue to open up our restaurants, and not give up on any of our long-term strategies.
And so we're still retaining a bit of a conservatism with managing our balance sheet. But again, as things become more certain, you can expect to see more buybacks in the future. And again, it will be optimistic. We will take advantage when the price moves down just like we did during this quarter. Our next question comes from Jon Tower of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. A lot of them have been answered already. But I guess I'll circle back on the loyalty platform. The 23 million members that you have today, can you talk about maybe how much that represents of the total customer base today? And then, can you quantify how the rewards member uses the brand versus a non-rewards member with respect to frequency, the spend, the mobile ordering platform versus perhaps just picking up at the store using delivery? And can you maybe even tell us how much that percentage - how much of loyalty membership represents as a percentage of total sales? So, let me - few different questions there. First of all, the rewards program probably represents about 25% of our customers roughly, is the way to think about it. And the thing that's great about our rewards customers are, they have a higher ticket, they have higher frequency, because usually they are more skewed towards digital, which is consistent with what we see in our digital business.
And I do believe as we continue to enhance things like our rewards program, now you can redeem your points for lower denominations and get like chips and guac or a T-shirt or whatever, that's just going to dial-up engagement for people. We didn't change the reward necessary to achieve a burrito, but we did enhance opportunities to engage with the brands at different levels. So, I think that's going to be enticing for more people to join the rewards program. And those that are in, will continue, I think, to incentivize their behavior accordingly.
So, I think I've covered all of them. Was that all your questions? Yes. I think you nailed it. So, thank you. I appreciate it. All right, great. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Brian Niccol, Chairman and CEO, for any closing remarks. Okay. Yes. Thank you. And thanks everybody for joining us. Obviously, I'd be remiss if I didn't repeat what I said earlier, which is a huge thank you to everybody in our organization, all of our operational leaders and folks in our restaurants. I think they have really demonstrated the power of great people, great leaders, great culture, drives great results. And this quarter is truly a reflection of that without a doubt.
The other thing I want to touch on is, obviously, we're very optimistic about Chipotle's long-term growth plans. I think we have the ability to grow units, grow average unit volumes, grow margins, frankly, grow everything you want to grow, and then at the same time, grow our organization. So people have the opportunity to grow with this Company and participate in all this wonderful growth. And that's really what I think is driving the strong employee value proposition that's resulting us being able to staff our restaurants at an effective rate right now.
So, very proud of this organization. Very proud of our results. And also very optimistic about the future. So, thank you for joining us. And we're going to get back to cultivating a better world. All right. Thanks, everybody. The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation.

And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Brian. Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. 2021 was an outstanding year for Chipotle, highlighting the organizational strength and resiliency of our brand. Despite an unprecedented environment, our employees remain passionate about their work, dedicated to delivering excellent guest experiences and aligned with our purpose and values.
Our business is as much about people as it is about food, and I strongly believe that we have the best in the industry. I'm very grateful for our team members' monumental efforts. And together, we accomplished many incredible things and accelerated business momentum, all of which was fueled by our multipronged growth strategy.
For the fiscal year, this resulted in sales growing 26% to reach $7.5 billion driven by a 19.3% comp; digital sales of $3.4 billion, which grew 25% versus the prior year; restaurant-level margin expanding 520 basis points year-over-year to reach 22.6%; adjusted diluted EPS of $25.42, representing 137% growth over last year; and we opened 215 new restaurants.
I'm also delighted with our fourth quarter performance even with the surge in Omicron cases that began in December. For the quarter, we reported sales of $2 billion, representing 22% year-over-year growth, which was fueled by a 15.2% increase in comparable restaurant sales, restaurant-level margin of 20.2%, was 70 basis points higher than the 19.5% we reported last year; earnings per share adjusted for unusual items of $5.58, representing an increase of 60% year-over-year; digital sales growth of nearly 4% year-over-year, representing 42% of sales; and we opened 78 new restaurants, including 67 with the Chipotlane.
We're encouraged by the recent performance but really excites us with the longer-term opportunity as we believe our powerful economic model will deliver best-in-class returns while achieving AUVs well beyond $3 million and significantly expanding the number of Chipotle restaurants in North America, which I'll elaborate on shortly.
There's no doubt in my mind that our 5 key strategies still have a long runway and are positioning us to win today while we create the future. We've revamped them slightly to reflect this transitioning from our turnaround phase to a sustainable growth base. These now include, number one, running successful restaurants with people, accountable culture that provides great food with integrity while delivering exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences; number two, sustaining world-class people leadership by developing and retaining diverse talent at every level; number three, making the brand visible, relevant and love to improve overall guest engagement; number four, amplifying technology and innovation to drive digital growth and productivity at our restaurants and support centers; and number five, expanding access and convenience by accelerating new restaurant openings.
Let me provide a brief update on each of these, starting with restaurant operations. The key to happy customers is a wonderful guest experience that provides consistently great-tasting food prepared and served quickly. This hasn't been easy, especially if the number of COVID cases spiked and, at times, impacted our staffing capabilities. But we're fortunate to have amazing employees at our restaurants who have stayed focused on safety, reliability and excellent culinary while adapting seamlessly to the dynamic environment. Their execution, whether it be on new menu introductions or managing the balance between digital and in-restaurant orders, has been exemplary.
As always, throughput remains a key focal area and something that we're determined to improve, especially as more guests come back to the front line. The critical success factor is ensuring we have proper staffing, which is currently a challenge for many companies. However, ongoing investments in our people, including competitive starting rates, enhanced benefits, debt-free degrees, development programs and transparent career progression opportunities, are resulting in better employee recruitment and retention as well as allowing us to make progress on labor challenges.
But we know there's more work to do, especially to support our future growth. As a result, we are focused on increasing our staffing stability through investing in human capital technology that will enhance our hourly team member experience. Specifically, we are in the process of implementing a new digital scheduling program as well as upgrading our learning management portal.
Also, I know we've mentioned this before, but it's worth highlighting again the importance of the GM role. Their leadership is crucial in executing the fundamentals of our business and setting the standard for how we run great restaurants every day. Additionally, our GMs helped grow the brand and the careers of countless team members, many of whom end up being top-performing leaders in our organization. In fact, during 2021, 90% of our restaurant management roles were internal promotions. Overall, we've promoted almost 19,000 team members in 2021. Our goal is to develop and retain diverse talent at every level of the organization and be the employer of choice, a message we will emphasize at our all-manager Conference in March.
After all, our employees need to be ready to support the consistent demand our talented marketing team creates by making Chipotle more visible, more relevant and more loved. This is done using different advertising channels, including traditional media, to enhance brand awareness and stay relevant.
A wonderful example is our short animated film called A Future Begins, which is a sequel to our award-winning 2011 film Back To The Start, and shines a light on the modern-day challenges the next generation of farmers are facing. While many young farmers value sustainability and ethics in farming like we do, they are struggling with new problems like climate change, technology costs and access to farmland. Launching this film is one of the ways that we are raising awareness of our mission to influence the 2023 farm bill that would facilitate equitable access to up to 1 million acres of land for the next generation of farmers.
We also utilized creative social media to successfully drive culture, drive difference and ultimately drive a purchase. We celebrated the 21-year anniversary of Boorito by providing $5 digital orders and serving up $1 million in free Booritos through a virtual Chipotle restaurant on roadblocks. We're the first restaurant brand to create a virtual experience on the interactive roadblocks platform, which resulted in Halloween 2021 having the most digital transactions of all time at Chipotle. This is a great illustration of us reaching consumers in a unique way to build sales today and the brand for tomorrow.
Enhancing our marketing efforts is a consistent cadence of 2 to 3 new menu items per year, using a disciplined approach to innovation. Not only do these items help bring new guests into the Chipotle family, but they also drive frequency with existing users and give us another opportunity to highlight the brand.
In 2021, we launched cauliflower rice in January, followed that with quesadillas in March and, finally, debuted smoked brisket in September. All of these new items performed very well, driving an increase in both check size and transactions.
In 2022, we have already launched plant-based Chorizo for a limited time across our U.S. restaurants. This entree is made using all real fresh ingredients growing on a farm, not in the lab, and proves that you don't have to sacrifice flavor to enjoy a vegan or vegetarian protein. It is off to a terrific start and is helping drive cultural buzz for its health and environmental benefits.
And there's more on deck. Pollo Asado, the first menu innovation with chicken in our 28-year history, has been successfully validated as part of our stage-gate process, and our culinary team is in the early stages of developing other exciting menu items. So stay tuned.
Another important growth driver that accelerated during the pandemic has been our technology transformation, which is helping Chipotle become a real food-focused digital lifestyle brand. During the fourth quarter, digital sales grew 4% year-over-year to $811 million and represent 42% of sales. We're pleased to see our digital sales dollars continue to grow despite lapping tough comparisons, and our overall digital mix remained steady in what seems like a new normal.
Incredibly, our full year digital sales of $3.4 billion is nearly 3.5x what we did pre-COVID in 2019. Digital has proven to be sticky as it's a frictionless and convenient experience that has been aided by continuous investments, and you will likely see us increasing technology enablement for our restaurants and support centers to amplify innovation, enhance the customer experience and optimize efficiencies to improve operational execution.
As a result of this pandemic, many new consumers were introduced to Chipotle via our digital channels and are now using us for alternative and, at times, incremental occasions. Having 2 large and growing businesses that are supported by separate make-lines makes it easy for guests to access Chipotle through different channels and is a key point of differentiation. Currently, about 2/3 of our guests use in-restaurant as their exclusive channel, with the remainder using Chipotle's digital ecosystem to conveniently access our real food. This dynamic gives us several future opportunities, including adding more guests, converting more of our in-restaurant guests into higher frequency digital users and leveraging our expanding loyalty program.
We now have more than 26.5 million members in our rewards program, which is a key enabler of our digital flywheel. We're focusing a lot more on personalization by creating journeys, primarily for new and at-risk customers that can influence guest behaviors and ultimately drive more frequency. As the program grows and we gain more experience, we are constantly learning, evolving and optimizing. For example, offering greater customization and flexibility to redeem rewards as well as gamifying the program with personalized challenges and badges that helped drive engagement and deepen relationships with our guests.
Not only have we seen strong positive responses from our most loyal fans, but even more exciting is that these program enhancements have increased engagement from our medium and low-frequency guests. We are delighted with our progress to date and believe ongoing investments and further leveraging of data-driven insights will make us even better.
Our last strategic driver is to expand access and convenience, which today is the #1 request from consumers. And we're listening. I'm excited to share that over the long term, we now believe we can operate at least 7,000 Chipotle restaurants in North America, up from our prior goal of 6,000 based on the success of small town opportunities that are delivering unit economics at or better than our traditional locations. We're also in the early stages of testing alternative formats, including seam locations, which, if successful, could further expand our addressable market.
Additionally, given healthy and improving cash-on-cash returns, we are building a real estate pipeline that will allow us to accelerate new unit growth to be in the range of 8% to 10% per year, with greater than 80% of new restaurants having a Chipotlane. And of course, we continue to look for ways to enhance convenience with Chipotlanes, alternative formats, delivery and catering to provide many ways for our guests to Chipotle.
In closing, I can't thank our employees enough for everything they've done to elevate the brand and cultivate a better world for each other, our guests and our communities no matter what external restrictions came our way in 2021. As I've said before, challenges create opportunities, and we are now in a much stronger competitive position than we were 2 years ago.
While we're still navigating through what we all hope is the last phase of this pandemic, I look forward to the future with optimism and can't wait to see what 2022 holds for Chipotle.
Okay. With that, here's Jack to walk you through the financials. Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. We ended the year on a positive note, with sales in the fourth quarter growing 22% year-over-year to reach $2 billion as comp sales grew 15.2%. Restaurant-level margin of 20.2% expanded 70 basis points over last year. And earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $5.58, representing 60.3% year-over-year growth. The fourth quarter had unusual expenses related to legal expenses, our previously disclosed 2018 performance share modification, transformation costs as well as restaurant asset impairment and closure costs, which negatively impacted our earnings per share by $0.89, leading to GAAP earnings per share of $4.69.
As we look ahead to 2022, there remains uncertainty on several fronts, including COVID impacts as well as staffing and inflationary pressures that limit our visibility, and therefore, make it difficult to provide full year comp guidance. These headwinds were significant in January, which also included some challenging weather, which led to a January comp of around 5%. We remain optimistic that as these challenges ease that our comps will accelerate from the January level. While it's difficult to predict the comp for Q1 with precision, we expect it to land somewhere in the mid to high single-digit range, assuming the effects of COVID continue to subside.
There's no doubt our restaurant-level margin is messy in the near term. So let me provide some perspective on Q4 and what we expect moving forward. Besides ongoing labor pressures, our Q4 margin was impacted by a higher level of commodity inflation than we originally expected, primarily due to elevated beef and freight costs. As a result, we took a 4% menu price increase in the middle of December to help offset these headwinds.
Given the timing of this pricing action, it had little impact in the quarter, resulting in our Q4 margin being at the lower end of our 20% to 21% guidance range. However, if you look ahead to Q1 where we will see the pricing benefit for the full quarter, our restaurant level margin is expected to be nearly 22% and normalizing for the elevated marketing spend expected this quarter as well as transitory COVID-related cost pressures, the underlying Q1 margin would be in the low to mid-23% range.
The bottom line is that our underlying margin remains healthy, and we believe we still have pricing power to use as needed if inflation continues to rise going forward. Of course, we'll be thoughtful and patient as we consider these actions to make sure we continue to deliver an excellent value and dining experience to our guests.
Now let me go through the key P&L line items, beginning with cost of sales. While our supply chain team continues to do an admirable job keeping our restaurants and supply key ingredients and managing the cost of doing so, external challenges were quite extreme in Q4, which led to food cost being 31.6%, an increase of 60 basis points from last year. As I just mentioned, inflation on beef and freight and to a lesser extent, avocado costs more than offset the leverage from our menu price increases.
As we think about Q1, the successful premium brisket LTO has ended, and we get the full benefit of our December pricing. These tailwinds will be partially offset by a full quarter of elevated beef prices as well as seasonally higher avocado pricing. As a result, we expect our Q1 food cost to be in the 30% to 30.5% range.
Labor costs for the fourth quarter were 26.4%, an increase of about 100 basis points from last year. This increase was driven by our strategic decision to increase average nationwide wages to $15 per hour in May of last year, which was partially offset by menu price increases and sales leverage. While we're expecting elevated wage inflation to continue, especially given higher exclusion and overtime pay because of the Omicron variant, our December menu price increase should provide some offset resulting in labor costs being in the low 26% range for Q1.
Other operating costs for the quarter were 16.3%, a decrease of about 160 basis points from last year, due primarily to price and sales leverage. Marketing and promo costs for the quarter were 3.6%, about 30 basis points lower than we spent last year, but as expected, 120 basis point sequential increase from Q3 to support smoke brisket and the latest brand messaging under our Behind The Foil campaign. Like Q4, Q1 tends to be a higher marketing quarter to support new menu items like plant-based Chorizo. Therefore, we expect marketing to be in the high 3% range in Q1 but to remain around 3% for the full year. Overall, other operating costs are expected to be in the mid-16% range for the first quarter.
G&A for the quarter was $116 million on a GAAP basis or $133 million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding $18 million related to the proposed settlement of legal matters, $7.6 million for the previously disclosed modification to our 2018 performance shares and $1.3 million related to transformation expenses. G&A also includes about $100 million in underlying G&A, $30 million related to noncash stock compensation, $1.8 million related to higher performance-based bonus accruals and payroll taxes and equity vesting and stock option exercises, and roughly $1.4 million related to our upcoming all-manager conference.
We expect our underlying G&A to be around $101 million in Q1 and grow slightly every quarter thereafter as we continue to make investments, primarily in technology and people to support ongoing growth. Despite the elevated spend, our goal remains to deliver leverage on this line item relative to our sales growth, just like we did in 2021.
We anticipate stock comp will be likely around $30 million in Q1, although this amount could move up or down based on our performance and subject to the 2022 grants, which are issued in Q1. We also expect to recognize around $4 million related to employer taxes associated with shares that vested during the quarter as well as about $17 million related to our all-manager conference.
Our effective tax rate for Q4 was 20.3% on a GAAP basis and 18.7% on a non-GAAP basis. Both rates benefited from option exercises and share vesting at elevated stock prices. In addition, our GAAP tax rate included a benefit for the write-off of uncertain tax position reserves in the fourth quarter of 2021. For fiscal 2022, we estimate our underlying effective tax rate will be in the 25% to 27% range, though it may vary based on discrete items.
Our balance sheet remains healthy as we ended the year with $1.4 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments, with no debt, along with the $500 million untapped revolver. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $169 million of our stock in average price of $1,750. And we continue to -- we expect to continue using excess free cash flow to opportunistically repurchase our stock.
We're privileged to have the financial strength with which to make ongoing strategic investments, including restaurant design and real estate development growth. I'm really impressed by the hard work of our development and operations team as they opened 78 new restaurants in the fourth quarter with 67, including a Chipotlane. This is despite all the construction inflationary pressures, subcontractor labor issues, critical equipment shortages and landlord delivery delays. For the full year, we exceeded our guidance and opened 250 new restaurants with 81% or 174, including a Chipotlane. We ended 2021 with 355 Chipotlanes, including 16 conversions and 11 relocation. And overall, these formats continue to demonstrate a stellar performance.
Furthermore, we're gaining more confidence in our conversion and relocation strategy, which will allow us to enhance the Chipotlane opportunity and provide more access and convenience for our guests. As a result, we expect to open between 235 and 250 restaurants in 2022 with more than 80%, including a Chipotlane. And this guidance includes 5 to 10 relocations to add a Chipotlane. Looking past the pandemic, we expect to be able to accelerate openings in 2023 and beyond and move towards the high end of the 8% to 10% openings range that Brian mentioned.
Let me end by expressing my gratitude to our nearly 100,000 team members in the restaurants and in the support centers for overcoming countless issues in the past year to safely serve and delight our guests. Their focus and strong execution have brought us to where we are today and I believe will be critical to sustaining our industry leadership in the future.
With that, we're happy to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Dennis Geiger with UBS. Wanted to focus a little bit more on the margin. I guess both for kind of the 1Q, I think Jack and Brian, you talked to, I think a low to mid-23 sort of underlying. Wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about what goes into that. And just kind of the go forward, if you could kind of give any kind of color as we go through the year, what that margin trajectory looks like and related -- as it relates to that long-term algorithm you provided, if there's any change there or if it's kind of consistent with what you've messaged prior. Yes. So I'll start, Jack. To answer your question, the long-term algorithm, we still believe we will achieve it. And it's a combination of the sales growth and, obviously, pricing where we need to, when we need to. And then we've got a lot of initiatives going on, make sure that we're as efficient as possible. So long term, we've got 100% confidence in what we can achieve. To your specific question about some of the stuff happening in the short term, I'll turn that over to Jack. Yes. The key things that are happening as you move from Q4 to Q1, our -- the menu price increase we took, we only -- we got like less than 100 basis points of impact in the fourth quarter as we took that in December. We'll get the full benefit of that in Q1. That's going to be offset somewhat by the fact that beef inflation has continued. We keep thinking that beef is going to level off and then go down. It just hasn't happened yet. And so while we got a partial quarter of beef inflation during the fourth quarter, we'll get a full quarter of inflation during that month. So we're just -- mainly those 2 things alone and then brisket -- actually brisket does -- it's a premium priced item, but it also is a premium cost item. So that has a drag on the margin as well. And so that ended during the fourth quarter.
So when you look at what our margin is expected to be in Q1 without considering timing adjustments, it's in that kind of high 22% range. But we're going to spend more than average on marketing because we're going to support -- we already have supported new menu items. We're going to support our next campaign. And so when you adjust for the timing of that and some other timing differences, that's where our normalized underlying margin should be in that kind of 23% range.
And then the other thing I would just add is typically, our winter months are not our high-margin months. So it, of course, depends on what happens with inflation throughout the year. But if inflation doesn't get too much worse, we would hope that we would see margins at or above that 23% range going forward. The next question will be from Jared Garber from Goldman Sachs. I wanted to ask about menu innovation. And 2021 was a year in which you had several really successful innovation come through the menu. I wanted to just get a sense of how you're thinking about that as we approach '22 or head into -- further into '22 and how you think about lapping and maybe what those -- where you're focused on the menu? Yes. Sure. Yes. Well, you touched on the first part. We're really happy with how all of our initiatives performed. I think it's a testament to our discipline around ensuring what we launch has a high probability of success and -- that we're able to execute, supply it and then deliver a great experience. So really delighted with what we did in '21.
As I mentioned this in my earlier remarks, the plant-based chorizo is off to a great start. If you haven't had a chance to try it, I highly recommend to give it a try. It's really terrific. But the way we think about it is we obviously want to listen to what our customers say they would like to see on the menu. That's why we've done things like quesadillas, improved the queso. We want to listen to what habits and trends are happening. So that's why you see us do things like leading with cauliflower rice, plant-based chorizo.
And then we're going to lead consumer pallets. And that's why we're really excited about this Pollo Asado program that we just tested. Obviously, Carne Asada was something that we're really excited about. And hopefully, you had a chance to try the brisket. That was just, I thought, outstanding.
And so we're going to continue to probably do 2 to 3 innovations a year. We're going to use kind of those guardrails, is where our culinary team is looking. And then we're going to continue to use our disciplined approach so that we have a pretty good idea of how it's going to perform when we do roll it out nationally. The next question will be from David Palmer from Evercore ISI. Question on pricing. Is the current year-over-year run rate 12% after that latest increment? And what's going to dictate your pricing strategy through the year? And in particular, I know people are curious about how you view your pricing power. What informs your view about Chipotle's pricing power? And basically, how does that dovetail with your pricing strategy? Yes. So David, I think we're more in the 10% range right now as you look at Q1. And if we were to take any more pricing for the balance of the year, that ultimately ends up being about a 6% or more -- probably a little bit more than 6% for the year.
To answer your question on when and why we would take pricing, Jack can touch on this. Like, we continue to see pressure on wages. We want to make sure that we continue to be competitive on that front. We feel like we're in a really good position right now. As a result, our restaurants are staffed better than they were pre-COVID and, frankly, better than they have been for the last 2 years through this whole COVID period. So we don't want to slip on our wages. So we're going to keep a close eye on that. And then obviously, we'll look for any inefficiencies to help mitigate that, but we do have the pricing lever there.
And then as Jack mentioned, beef and freight and some of these other things that continue to stay elevated. We don't see it abate. We'll have to take some additional pricing there. So it's really the last thing we want to do, but we're fortunate that we can pull it. And we see no resistance to date with the levels that we're currently at.
And I think I mentioned this in my earlier remarks or maybe this was in the interview I did earlier. I mean, keep in mind, when we talk about these percentages, I'd like to run people the absolute dollar. The chicken Boorito for most parts of the country is still less than $8. Chicken bowl is still less than $8. And that's phenomenal value, especially when I see where, frankly, food that I would question the caliber not being what our caliber is, nor what the customization is right in that price point, if not higher. So we've got a lot of pricing power. Our customers appreciate the brand, appreciate the culinary. And we're fortunate to be in that position. And the next question will be from Peter Saleh with BTIG. Brian, I think you just touched on this a little bit, but I'm hoping you can elaborate a little bit. You guys just took another price increase, and you're running with about 10%, but what about the value proposition? And how do you ensure you just don't outprice some of your consumers? Is there a benchmark that you're looking at to price against? Or is there something else we can look at to get a sense on how much inflation you guys are willing to take on? Yes. So look, we do a couple of things. One, we have internal work where we're constantly evaluating the value strength of our brand through, call it, traditional market research. And we also do the analytical side of things, where after we take pricing, we really do analyze what happens to transactions. And the good news is we have so much data now with our loyalty database that we're able to understand are there any behavioral impacts from what we're seeing. And we see very little resistance there.
And then obviously, we look out into the marketplace. You look at -- and all this stuff, right, pricing usually has something to do with your relative options. And when you look at the options, again, this is why I think we get such strong value scores to get our food with our customization, with our access, and frankly, the quantity that you're also able to get. We're kind of in our own space, and we're very fortunate to be in that space. And there's a lot of headroom from what we can tell. And I really hope we never have to use all of it, but we'll be judicious, and when we need to, we will. And the next question is from David Tarantino from Baird. My question is about the unit growth outlook accelerating. I guess first question is just wanted to gauge your confidence level in being able to ramp up to those types of numbers in the current labor environment we're in given how tight the labor market has become. I guess is there certain things you're doing on the staffing side ahead of that acceleration that are worth talking about? And then the second question related to this is, Jack, I was wondering if you could give us an update on what the return profile looks like for the Chipotlanes that you're developing? So yes. So David, your first question, we continue to feel really good about, one, the performance of our restaurant openings, right? So we opened 215, and the performance was excellent. That's a testament to our real estate development team, our operators to ensure those restaurants were staffed for the opening.
And one of the things -- I think I mentioned this in the script. We promoted something like 19,000 people to the manager level. And the one thing that's great about our company is as we close in on having 3,000 restaurants and 4,000 restaurants, our goal is to internally develop our future of leaders. And the reason why that's important is it's a lot easier to prepare for 300 openings when you're working off of the base of 3,000 or 4,000. Or whatever number of openings we want to achieve, the bigger our base is, the more talent we can develop. And I think we're demonstrating we can develop that talent with the fact that we just promoted 19,000 employees. So they'll stay with us. They'll grow with us. They're excited about the growth opportunity.
I will tell you, obviously, COVID made it very hard to open 215 restaurants. That wasn't an easy thing. And again, I give it a real hats off to our team for being able to execute that type of new restaurant opening quantity as well as quality. And the last thing I'll say before I hand over to Jack is the pipeline is very strong. And we're fortunate. People want Chipotle in their towns. The landlords want Chipotle in their centers. And we just demonstrated now we also have the small town opportunity to add to the Chipotlane opportunity.
So we're in a really good position. Obviously, I'm hoping we're in the last phase of COVID and some things get a little bit easier versus harder going forward. But it's a real testament to the strength of our operations, the strength of our development team that we're able to open 215 high-quality new units.
So Jack, I'll let you talk to David's question on Chipotlanes. Yes. David, Chipotlanes continue to outperform our non-Chipotlane restaurants. That's why you've seen us quickly get up to, now 80% of our new restaurants have a Chipotlane. They have higher volume. They skew more towards digital, and that SKU comes from order-ahead, which is a higher margin transaction. And the investment is only modestly higher, call it, in that $75,000 range. So if a non-Chipotlane opening get a cash-on-cash return within a couple of years as the sales grow in that 55% to, call it, 60% return, a Chipotlane is going to generate cash-on-cash returns in the 65% to 70% return. So clearly, exceptional returns.
And then what Chipotlane is also allowing us to do is go into the small towns where we have another convenient access point. And then also, we're starting to get into these seam locations. We only have a few open. But with the extra convenience channel at Chipotlane, it just makes it more doable from a financial standpoint and a convenience standpoint to go into these small towns and seam locations that generate superior returns. So yes, Chipotlane continues to perform at exceptional levels. And the next question will be from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer & Company. Can you just update us again on the pace of the loyalty membership trajectory as we enter 2022? Is it still showing a healthy pace of growth? And with this now a very large base of members in this immense digital ecosystem, Brian, what do you believe is the biggest strategic or operational unlock that still sits in front of you as it relates to loyalty that you believe can be incremental to the business moving forward? Yes. Sure. So yes, look, we are very fortunate that we continue to grow the loyalty population in a meaningful clip. Obviously, it's not at the same speed it was a year or 2 ago, but it's one of the things that's kind of interesting is we add more restaurants and we get people more access, the loyalty/rewards program becomes even that much more of an appealing program that they want to be a part of. So we continue to see people join.
One of the big unlocks for us, frankly, is we still have a lot of people that are only dining room people, and then we have a lot of people that are only digital people. And there's a small group that's doing both. And call it, the 50%, 60% that are dining room-only people, I think if we get those people to have a really positive experience using the rewards program, it's just a tremendous unlock for what that rewards program can grow to be.
As you mentioned, there's a lot of incremental opportunity in that. And just within the universe of people that we have, the guys have really, I think, learned quite a bit about how to do these journeys so that they communicate and engage the right way, so that we get the behavior more frequency, or if we see somebody lapsing, we get them to come back into the business.
So there's incremental opportunities on just getting all those people that are exclusive dining room people to become at least comfortable with using our digital platform. Even if they don't want to order through it, they can at least take the benefits of it. And then, look, as that database grows, we get smarter in the journeys. We definitely have demonstrated inside here that we can use this tool to influence behavior both in frequency as well as staying with the business. And the next question is from Andrew Charles with Cowen. Brian, you were very proactive getting the average wage to $15 an hour back in May of last year, but I was curious about your multiyear view for where wages could go as more national retailers enact formalized programs to get to $17 an hour as you strive to keep Chipotle as an employer of choice. Yes. Look, I think wages are going to continue to go up. And I think the combination of having the right wage and the right development or growth opportunity is what gets people excited to be a part of the company. And that's why I think it's really important. That's why I chose to share, look, even in a tough environment, we still promoted 19,000 people, which tells you 2 things. One, they grew with us, and they stayed with us. So we're going to always make sure that we've got the right wage to get people into our company. And then we also want to make sure that we're growing them so that they're excited to stay with our company.
And I think your point is a good one. I don't want to fall behind. I like being in the position of people viewing Chipotle as a leader in this space. I think our jobs are great. I think our company is special. And if we can get people to experience that, they have a real opportunity to grow with us and ultimately change their lives and potentially their families. So that's one of the luxuries, I think, we get to have at Chipotle is you can really change people's lives with a career here. The next question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. I wanted to circle back on the small town opportunity. One, how many are there today? Like, what's the evidence that you have for this incremental opportunity? Years ago, there was something called an A model. So it was like a lower CapEx, good return, but lower volume unit. Are these lower volume but better returns because they're lower CapEx? Or how should we think about both the returns and the volume calculus as we think about the small market opportunity? And just how many there are so far so we can gauge where you are on that? Yes. I mean the one thing that is nice is it's definitely a little bit higher margin because the cost of the lease is a little bit lower. And what we're seeing, though, is no trade-off in volume. Actually, it's probably an outsized, call it, revenue or sales. So it's kind of a really great proposition because a little bit cheaper to putting some of the fixed cost, and then people view us as an employer that they want to be a part of. So we have a really good success rate in staffing them. And then the towns are really excited to have a Chipotle. So we see great sales -- opening sales and then sales that stay with us.
So look, we feel really good about it. I think there's hundreds of these that we can easily find and build. And Jack, you'll have to correct me here. But I think when we're talking about small town, we're not talking about 5, 10 -- we're talking about like 40,000 plus. So it's still pretty good size. It's small for Chipotle. But I want to make sure we qualify that for you so you realize what we're talking about when we say small town. But Jack, I don't know if you want to add anything to that. Yes. And there are some that will be smaller than that, but it might be like on an expressway or something. But I think the key is that these are restaurants that are not in a metropolis. So it's not in the area with large Chipotlane or Chipotles. So they tend to have 0 impact. The margins are higher. The volumes are about the same. So the returns are higher as well. Typically, the construction cost is higher as well.
The challenge really is just to make sure that we have a strategic process or strategic approach so that we can keep an eye on these. So a field leader, for example, they have to travel 300 miles to get to a remote small town location. That's very hard to do. But if you string a bunch of small towns together where there's one that's 50 miles away and another that's 50 miles away, you stream these along so that a field leader can, over a number of days, make sure that he gets touches with those restaurants, develops the leadership in those restaurants from a financial standpoint and from a bringing a special dining experience to small towns, it's a home run. The next question is from Joshua Long with Piper Sandler. Wanted to see if we could circle back into loyalty and the growing digital base of users that you have. And curious how that's been forming your lifetime value considerations for your customers. I think maybe that dovetails into the -- some of the journeys that you talked about. But curious, if you're able to act on any of that now or how you think about that working into your pipeline going forward? Yes. Look, it's a high, high priority. We were really excited about the size of the database. And then we're really excited about how much learning we've had over the last couple of years so that we can do exactly what you just talked about. We know when we get people into the rewards, call it, system, the average ticket goes up and the frequency at which they shop with Chipotle goes up. So we're winning share of occasions, and that's ultimately what we're after.
I think making access easier, making people aware of that access, really engaging with people in a personalized way, we're able to gain more occasions. And that's really what we use the data to understand. And then the other thing that's powerful, too, and the data is we can see where we maybe aren't executing the experience we want to, and it gives us the opportunity to save what was a less than ideal experience to turn that person from being a lapsed user into an -- coming back to the business and staying with us.
So that's really the mission, and we're very fortunate that we've got such a robust data set now, and we've got a really talented team that's, I think, eager to learn every day and build on what we've done to date. We're not going to be complacent, right? We have a real opportunity here to build on the momentum that we have. The next question is from Brian Vaccaro with Raymond James. I wanted to circle back on labor, if I could. And with 7 to 8 months under your belt since increasing wages and making the other labor investments, I guess I'm just curious to get your assessment of how effective those changes have been and obviously understanding Omicron's had an impact. But how much of an underlying improvement have you seen in retention application flow or, say, the percentage of stores that are still significantly understaffed? And then if you think needs -- more needs to be done, what form would that likely take? Is it more wage increases? Or is it more than just the money issue in the stores that remain meaningfully understaffed? Yes. I mean, look, what I'll tell you is we -- we've made tremendous progress. And even with the Omicron surge, I would tell you we've learned a lot, right, over the last 2 years so that we knew how to go into the markets where we're having a problem. We put a very focused effort on making sure people knew. Those employees that go out on an exclusion, they're coming back. So you're not -- your team is not all of a sudden lost, the folks that went out on exclusion, they're coming back.
And by the way, as your business grows, what we call being at model, we are out actively recruiting so that you're going to have staff so that you can perform as this business grows. So I think we've just gotten a lot better at, one, seeing, okay, this restaurant is about to have a real challenge. We put a very focused effort on that restaurant. We ensure we catch the right wage, the right communication of what this job is all about.
And I'll tell you what, the one thing that we were probably surprised by, and we weren't leveraging enough initially, is telling people the growth story. Like the number of people that I've met that have joined Chipotle that might have been a multiunit operator at another organization, but they were willing to join our organization as a team member, ultimately maybe a service manager, because they want the opportunity to grow with us, because they felt like they were capped out where they were. And so we've really ramped up that communication.
And you'll see that in our marketing materials on what it means to get a job at Chipotle. It's not just the job you're getting now, but you're -- potentially, if you want to stay with us, what you can grow into. So -- but we've made tremendous progress. I think we made the right choice with using the DML as the tool to throttle up and down based on the challenges we were having with staffing. I'm happy to say that's now happening in like less than 2% of our restaurants, which is great.
And the reason why it's so low is because our staffing is so much better across the enterprise. So -- but with that said, we're about to move into the season where we sell even more Booritos, and it's going to require even more employees. So we're staying after it. We think we've learned a lot. And we're seeing pretty good yield as a result of our efforts to date. So we love the position we're in. I really hope we don't have another surge. But putting that aside, I love what Scott and Maurice have done to ensure that our restaurants are staffed. All right. That's great. And I guess I'll circle back on the food cost situation, if I could. And Jack, I think you said you saw beef and freight and a little bit of avocado pressure. But I'm curious to what degree you're seeing inflation on the chicken side, which I believe is your #1 protein? And I know visibility is low, and a lot of things can change on a dime during this environment, it seems. But your best guess or view of the outlook here. Is it reasonable to expect high single-digit inflation for a couple more quarters, perhaps, and then you start to lap some of the increases moving through the second half of '21? Or just curious to get your broad perspective there if it differs from that materially. Yes. Listen, I'm glad you said it's really hard to predict the future because this has been the toughest I've seen in terms of predicting the future about availability and about pricing early in my whole career. Having said that, I would say it's going to take at least a few quarters. Like, I wouldn't expect to see much relief. Hopefully, things won't get too much worse over the next few quarters. But we're not expecting to see much of a relief until later in the year.
Having said that, you asked about chicken in particular. Chicken, knock on wood, has not been that bad. We've had some near misses during the year. It was more driven by availability of labor and people who had to be excluded because they were -- either they came down with COVID or were with somebody who had COVID. And so there were some near misses in terms of our suppliers maybe being unable to meet our demand.
Our supply chain team with Carlos have done a great job of working with suppliers and moving capacity around as needed. And what we've seen over the last several months and what we expect we'll see more of in the future, more pressure on beef, more pressure on freight. Avocados, we think is, -- that's more of seasonal thing, that's more of a cyclical thing. That doesn't feel like a class kind of supply chain issue that we're seeing in this environment. But I wouldn't be surprised if there's going to be another ingredient or 2. There's just been so many disruptions.
So hopefully, things will be reasonably normal. We think we've taken the pricing action we need to for what we've seen so far, and then we'll wait and see what happens in the next quarter or 2. And the next question will be from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. I wanted to get back to the conversation on store level staffing but focusing on the GM. Has there been any change in turnover throughout '21? Has there been any unusual maybe blips in the quit rate that you've noticed? And as you think, obviously, about a growing business going forward, is there anything about training or compensation or the type of person that you're looking for perhaps looking to promote that may change with Chipotle as Chipotle grows as you think about the next era? Yes. No. Look, I got to tell you, we're very fortunate with the general managers we have in our company because those guys, through all this, showed up to the restaurants every single day and figured out how to flex with whatever new thing came their way, whether they were people calling off, whether it was people unfortunately coming down with COVID. There was a time period where people didn't really know what COVID was, and these guys and women showed up every day to lead their teams. And we're very fortunate to have that caliber of leader running our restaurants. And we're also very fortunate that because we're a growing company, those leaders are the leaders that then become our field leaders and our team directors and then ultimately our VPs. And they see it.
And one of my favorite things to do in my company is have the opportunity to go visit them in their restaurants. And I'll tell you what, they are so proud of their team. They're so proud of their results, and they're so proud of where we are. So we're working on being better with our learning and training tools. I think we mentioned this in the call, we're rolling that out for them. We're rolling out for them a new labor scheduling tool. And then obviously, we're looking for ways to make the job more efficient, more consistent so that they can continue to do the great work that they do on the culture and the people and the culinary.
So we're very fortunate. We've not seen the great resignation that you read about -- or hear about at our company and definitely not at our general manager level. So hopefully, some of them are listening right now because I would brag about them for this whole call, if I could. So thanks for asking the question. And the next question is from Brian Mullan with Deutsche Bank. Just a question on the international development opportunity outside of North America. Can you share what the focus is right now in the existing markets, France, Germany, U.K.? And are you also exploring new markets in Western Europe or even elsewhere at this point in time or just really focused on those existing markets right now? Yes. So for right now, we are just focused on those existing markets and really just France and U.K., as you probably have read or know, Germany has been really slow to kind of get out of the COVID challenges. But look, I’m optimistic on what all Western Europe can be. And fortunately, we've had some really good recent openings in both France and the U.K. And I'm optimistic about how we can grow in those countries. And once we feel like we're in a really good spot there, we'll definitely think about how we expand beyond it.
So one thing I know for sure is when you look at consumers in other countries, they like our proposition, clean food, Food with Integrity, high levels of customization, culinary happening right in front of you, labors that resonate, chicken, rice and beans, those are pretty globally accepted ingredients. So I'm optimistic about the future. But right now, we're focused on making sure we've got a winning proposition in the markets that we're currently in, and then we'll expand from there accordingly. The next question is from Chris Carril with RBC Capital Markets. So can you expand on delivery mix today and how the margins for those orders compare to other channels with the incremental delivery menu pricing you've taken over the past year plus? And how are you thinking about delivery mix and impact to margins from delivery as we move further into '22? Yes. Sure. So obviously, delivery, we've got 2 kind of businesses there, right? We've got our in-app delivery business or what we call white label and then, obviously, the third-party partnerships we have with like Uber Eats and DoorDash in marketplace. And you mentioned this, we took some pricing so that the margin issue became less of an issue. And unfortunately -- or I guess the reality is that channel comes with additional cost. If you want that convenience, it comes with some additional costs.
And what we've seen is people recognize that and are willing to accept that for those occasions. So our digital business is roughly 42% of the business. Today, delivery is about probably little less than 20%, roughly 20%. And the good news is our order-ahead business continues to grow as we build Chipotlanes and as we continue to, frankly, market against the idea of order-ahead and pick up yourself. So not nearly the margin dilution that delivery used to be but still our best margin transaction as the digital transaction where you order-ahead and pick up.
Jack, I don't know if you want to add anything to that. No. Brian, you said it [perfect]. And the next question will come from Andy Barish with Jefferies. Just wanted to circle back on some of the operational efficiencies, Brian, that you've mentioned a couple of times now, making kind of the team members' jobs a little bit easier or implementing technology. Can you give us an example or 2 of where you're heading down that road? And what -- maybe also what things would be a nonstarter in terms of Chipotle's credo? Yes. Sure. So look, we're trying to find -- well, first of all, as I mentioned, right, just getting a better labor scheduling tool that uses artificial intelligence and analytics that doesn't rely on just looking back past 4 weeks but can look at things happening real time so that the team is able to prep accordingly, we should then end up in a scenario where we don't run out of guacamole at the end of the day, right?
And so we're working on technology where just that occurs. How do we help our team members know when to cook more chicken throughout the day, when to make guacamole and how much guacamole to make after lunch because we want to be in the Chipotle business from open to close. Nothing disappoints our teams more than when a customer shows up at 8:00 or 9:00 and they're out of something. And so if we can give them tools where they don't have to worry about making too much or not making enough, it just makes their job so much easier. It eliminates one stress. They don't want a disappointed customer.
So we're working with that type of technology to help them do just that. And then we're also looking at technology, whether it's robotics, automation, how do we get rid of the jobs people frankly don't love doing, right? Cleaning dishes all day, not a fun job, our job, frankly, wet job. And it's like if we can find ways to eliminate those tasks, right, like we're always going to be cutting and coring avocados. But if there was a way to cut and core the avocados so that all our team number has to do is mash and add the salt, add the lime, add the onions, that would make their job so much better.
So it's those types of things. We're not going to walk away from having great culinary. You're always going to see our chicken seasoning on the poncho, all right? That's just one of the sounds and sites of Chipotle and, frankly, the smell that I think makes our experience unique. And then obviously, we're looking for ways to be even more accurate, more timely on the digital make-line. So there's real opportunities there. I think we've got a great system, and I think we can build on what is really been something that's worked really well for us. So that kind of gives you a flavor of the various things we're looking at. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Brian Niccol for any closing remarks. All right. Thanks. And thanks, everybody, for all the questions and dialing in. Obviously, very proud of our team, everybody in the restaurants. 2021 was a lot of ups and downs, but I think couldn't be prouder of the results to deliver a comp north of 19%, business now bigger than $7.5 billion, a $3.5 billion digital business. These are all big milestones for our company. We opened over 200 -- we opened 215 restaurants. I mean we're literally achieving new highs in all fronts. Our average unit volumes are well beyond the $2.5 million now.
So obviously, the fourth quarter had some challenges. Inflation is something that we'll continue to deal with. Staffing, we've made tremendous progress on. And as I look at where we are in 2022, I just believe we're positioned to execute the Chipotle business better than we probably have in a while. And it's exciting to be staffed at pre-COVID levels again. It's exciting to see people getting promoted in our organization. And it's exciting to see the customer reward us with their business every day.
So again, really, strong position for our company. I think it demonstrates our pricing power, our resilience and the strength of our culture and people. And luckily, we get to celebrate with everybody at our all-manager conference in March and look forward to catching up with everybody next quarter.
So thank you for all the questions. And hopefully, you get out there and try the Plant-based Chorizo. All right. Take care, guys. Thank you. Bye. And thank you, sir. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Adam Rymer, VP of Finance. Please go ahead. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call. By now, you should have access to our earnings press release. If not, it may be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.chipotle.com. I will begin by reminding you that certain statements and projections made in this presentation about our future business and financial results constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current business and market expectations, and our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Please see the risk factors contained in our annual report on Form 10-K and our Form 10-Qs for a discussion of risks that may cause our actual results to vary from the forward-looking statements.
Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found via the link included on the presentation page within the Investor Relations section of our website. We will start today's call with prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer, after which we will take your questions. Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A session.
And with that, I will turn the call over to Brian. Thanks, Adam, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I share our first quarter results, I want to express my gratitude for the 3,200 outstanding general managers and field leaders that attended our All Managers Conference in Las Vegas last month. It was our first time together in nearly four years, allowing us to celebrate our general managers as well as inspire and learn from one another as we codified our 2022 strategic priorities. It truly was great to be back together again.
Chipotle's performance in the first quarter was strong despite challenges from the Omicron variant. For the quarter, sales grew 16% to reach $2 billion driven by a 9% comp, in-store sales grew by 33% over last year, digital represented 42% of sales, restaurant level margin was 20.7%, a decrease of 160 basis points year-over-year, adjusted diluted EPS was $5.70, representing 6.3% growth over last year and we opened 51 new restaurants, including 42 Chipotles. Although our restaurant margins remain bumpy due to inflation, we have the ability to be patient while costs are volatile, and the growth in pricing power to recover our margins over time. And I'm pleased to report that Q2 is also off to a strong start, fueled by Pollo Asado our most popular new protein to date.
Our five key strategies continue to position us to win today while we create the future. These include: number one, running successful restaurants with a people accountable culture that provides great food with integrity, while delivering an exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences; number two, sustaining world-class people leadership by developing and retaining diverse talent at every level; number three, making the brand visible, relevant and love to improve overall guest engagement; number four, amplifying technology and innovation to drive growth and productivity at our restaurants and support centers; and number five, expanding access and convenience by accelerating new restaurant openings.
Let me provide a brief update on each of these strategies, starting with restaurant operations. Our people are our greatest asset and well trained and supported employees preparing delicious food served quickly equates to an excellent guest experience. We are currently focused on improving our throughput as our sales continue to increase throughout the spring, and our in-restaurant business continues to grow. Recently, I was in Denver at our 6th and Broadway location, which opened in March of 2000, and I met two employees who have been with this restaurant since the day it opened, so it's 22 years. They were training our new team members on line, demonstrating how to execute with excellence and speed. It was incredible to see our teach and taste Chipotle value being brought to life.
We know throughput, a foundational element of convenience that our guests value is an opportunity for us, and we are committed to teaching, training and validating the five pillars of throughput every day during every shift to ensure we meet our high standards and provide a great guest experience. We have daily goals in place for the number of entrées per 15-minute period on the front make-line and promised time execution on the digital make-line. These goals are now included in the restaurant manager and crew bonuses to better drive performance and accountability, and both measures improved during the quarter. We are also in the process of rolling out a new scheduling tool, which will help ensure the right people are in the right positions at the right time.
I believe that we are finally getting back to pre-pandemic operations, and I couldn't be more excited. We have been intentional in our recruiting efforts, and we have made investments in our people. We offer a world-class employee value proposition that includes industry-leading benefits attractive wages, specialized training and development, access to education and a transparent pathway to significant career advancement opportunities. We believe these efforts are helping to attract and retain great employees as our staffing levels are better today than they were in late 2019.
We are constantly looking for ways to be better at training and development. With that in mind, we have enhanced our training and development programs, recently rolling out an AI-based learning management system, the Spice Up, which offers immersive learning and development opportunities and upskilling for future roles for all employees. We believe our team members of today will be our leaders tomorrow, and we are looking for them to grow with us.
Opening 8% to 10% new restaurants per year means we need more crew, more GMs, more field leadership. In fact, team members can advance the restaurateur, the highest general manager position in as little as 3.5 years with average compensation of $100,000, while leading a multi-million dollar growing business. And it doesn't stop there. A GM can become a certified training manager, a field leader, a team director and a regional vice president. In fact, we just recently promoted an individual to regional vice president, who started as a crew member and he's the second one of our regional vice presidents to share this incredible career trajectory.
Our marketing team continues to do a tremendous job of keeping Chipotle relevant in culture, driving difference as well as transactions. We continue to leverage both traditional and non-traditional media to increase awareness and amplify the brand. You may have seen our Knowing Tastes Better television campaign, which highlights Chipotle's real ingredients like antibiotic-free chicken, freshly prepared food like our hand-mashed guac and features our real team members.
Additionally, we remain a leader in the digital space with our latest Chipotle metaverse experience that launched on National Burrito Day garnering more than 4 million game plays in the first week. From a product innovation standpoint, we generally introduce two to three new menu items per year using a disciplined stage gate approach to innovation.
These new product introductions are extremely effective as they bring in additional customers, drive frequency with existing users and increase check while giving us an opportunity to create buzz around the brand. Pollo Asado was our first chicken innovation in 29 years. And the reaction has been outstanding. In addition to adding new variations to our health-oriented lifestyle bowls in January, we also attracted new guests with our plant-based chorizo limited time offering, which proved that you don't have to sacrifice flavor or food with integrity to enjoy a vegan or vegetarian protein.
And we're far from being done. We've got an exciting new menu item that will start testing in the coming weeks, which I think guests are going to love. And we have a robust product pipeline for the remainder of 2022 and beyond. A key part of guest engagement is our Chipotle Rewards program, which now has nearly 28 million members. We recently celebrated the three year anniversary of the program by relaunching Guac Mode, an exclusive benefit for Chipotle Rewards members that unlocks access to surprise free guac rewards throughout the year, which resulted in our highest social engagement of all time and loyalty enrollments of 35% week-over-week.
We continue to leverage our CRM sophistication by focusing more on personalization and using predictive modeling to trigger journeys that can influence guest behaviors as well as make their experience with Chipotle more relevant for them. This approach uses personalized messaging to learn more about an item, the guest has previously ordered, view their ordering preferences or to see their cumulative real food print, which is a guest potential environmental impact based on their order history. We are constantly learning, evolving, and optimizing to drive more frequency with rewards members.
We are pleased with the progress to-date, but believe we will get even better over time. Our ability to share relevant, personalized communications with our guests will ultimately deepen the relationship between reward members and the brand. Our digital sales remain a big part of our business due to it being a convenient, frictionless experience that has been enhanced by continuous technology investments to improve operational execution.
On average, it only takes about 10 minutes from the time a guest places an order until it's ready for pickup, which is simply outstanding. Chipotlanes also continue to outperform non-Chipotle locations due to the convenience, which is encouraging since digital order pickup is our highest margin transaction.
We continue to look for ways to increase access and convenience through alternate restaurant formats, digital-only menu offerings and leveraging our large and growing loyalty program. As a people first company, we are investing in human capital technology to enhance the team member experience in our restaurants, creating a more efficient, consistent and compliant environment. We recently rolled out a new labor scheduling program as well as began testing radio frequency identification technology to enhance traceability and inventory systems. Also in test is an autonomous kitchen assistant, Chippy that integrates culinary traditions with artificial intelligence to make tortilla chips in our Cultivate Center Innovation hub.
Our goal is to drive efficiencies through collaborative robotics that will enable Chipotle's team members to focus on other culinary tasks in the restaurant. We will not sacrifice quality and deliciousness. We are going to place Chippy in a Southern California restaurant soon we can leverage our stage gate process to listen, test and learn from our crew and guest feedback before deciding on our implementation strategy. To accelerate our strategic priorities, we recently announced that we created a new venture fund called Cultivate Next to make early stage investments into strategically aligned companies that further our mission.
As a digital disruptor, we are looking to support early stage companies that are forward thinking and will enhance our employee or guest experience, advance our food with integrity mission and perhaps revolutionize the restaurant industry. Our last strategic pillar is to expand access in convenience, which today is still a top request from consumers. In less than 30 years, we reached 3,000 restaurants with over half in the last 10 years.
We are relentless in our pursuit of bringing food with integrity to more communities. We're even halfway to our goal of reaching 7,000 restaurants in North America and are building a real estate pipeline that will accelerate new unit growth in the range of 8% to 10% per year, with more than 80% of new restaurants featuring a Chipotle. Our digital order drive-thru pickup line continues to be a favor among guests, giving customers more easy ways to access Chipotle.
Last week, we issued Chipotle's 2021 sustainability report update, which highlights our commitment to people, food, and animal, and the environment. We've tied a portion of our executive compensation to achieving various goals, to ensure we've held ourselves accountable for making business decisions that cultivate a better world. The report talks about how we invested in our people, supported our communities and worked to reduce our environmental impact.
I'm proud of the strides that we have made to showcase real meaningful action and measurable change. In closing, none of the results that I've shared with you today would be possible without our world-class teams. I want to thank our employees in the restaurants, field teams and support center staff for constantly pushing the boundaries of what's possible.
As I mentioned at the start, we just brought together 3,200 of our general managers and field leaders and hearing their ideas, passion and enthusiasm for this company convinced me more than ever that we have the right people and the right strategies in place to position Chipotle for accelerated growth in the years ahead.
With that, here's Jack to walk you through the financials. Thanks, Brian and good afternoon everyone. Sales in the first quarter grew 16% year-over-year to reach $2 billion as comp sales grew 9%. Restaurant level margin of 20.7% decreased 160 basis points compared to last year and earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $5.70 representing 6.3% year-over-year growth. The first quarter had unusual expenses related to our previously disclosed 2018 performance share modification transformation cost as well as restaurant asset impairment and closure cost slightly offset by a reduction of legal expenses, which negatively impacted our earnings per share by $0.11, leading to GAAP EPS of $5.59.
As we look to the remainder of 2022, the remains uncertainty from macroeconomic impacts as well as COVID and make it difficult to provide full year comp guidance. Comps in April so far have continued right around the same 9% we saw in Q1. And while it’s difficult to predict the comp in Q2 due to these factors, assuming current sales trends continue, we expect it to be in the 10% to 12% range as we expect the comp to increase throughout the quarter. Our restaurant level margins continue to be impacted by unprecedented levels of inflation.
Our Q1 margin was impacted by a higher level of commodity inflation than we expected, primarily from avocados, tortillas and dairy resulting in our Q1 margin falling below the nearly 22% guidance we provided on our last earnings call. To offset these rising costs, we increased menu prices over 4% at the end of the quarter. And looking ahead to Q2, we expect our restaurant level margin to be around 25%, which will benefit from a full quarter of the new menu prices and assuming we don’t see additional inflation above our current estimates.
I’ll now go through the key P&L line items beginning with costs of sales. Costs of sales in the quarter were 31% an increase of about 100 basis points from last year. Costs were higher across the board, but most notably beef, avocados and paper, and more than offset the leverage from our menu price increases. Additionally, cost for avocados, tortillas and dairy increased during the quarter. And in Q2, we expect our cost of sales to remain near 31% as the benefit from our menu price increase will be offset by a full quarter of these elevated costs.
Labor costs for the quarter were 26.3% an increase of about 140 basis points from last year. This increase was driven by our decision to increase average wages to $15 per hour in May of last year, which is partially offset by menu price increases. In Q2, we expect our labor cost to be in the mid 24% range due to leverage from our menu price increase as well as seasonally higher sales.
Other operating costs for the quarter were 16.4% a decrease of about 50 basis points from last year. This decrease was driven by menu price increases as well as the decline and delivery expenses, partially offset by higher costs across several expenses, most notably utilities, including natural gas. Marketing and promo costs for the quarter were 3.5%. The same level we spent last year to support a plant-based chorizo, as well as the launch of pollo asado.
In Q2, we expect marketing costs to step down to the mid to high 2% range with the full year to remain around 3%. In Q2, other operating costs are expected to be in the mid 14% range. G&A for the quarter is $147 million on a GAAP basis or $144 million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding $3 million related to the previously disclosed modification through 2018 performance shares and $1 million related the transformation expenses offset by a $1 million reduction related to legal settlements.
G&A also includes $101 million in underlying G&A, $20 million related to non-cash stock compensation, $6 million related to higher performance based bonus accruals and payroll taxes and equity vesting and exercises and $17 million related to our all-manager conference. We expect our G&A, underlying G&A to be around $104 million in Q2 and continue to grow slightly thereafter as we make investments in technology and people to support ongoing growth.
We anticipate stock comp will likely be around $27 million in Q2, although this amount could move up or down based on our performance. We also expect to recognize about $5 million related to performance based bonus accruals and payroll taxes on equity vesting and exercises, bringing total G&A in Q2 to around $136 million.
Depreciation step up in the quarter to $72 million as we accelerated depreciation for several in-store tech items we plan to upgrade this year, for example, adding contactless payment for our in-restaurant guests, as well as for remodels and relocations, that will expand our Chipotlane footprint. We expect depreciation to remain at an elevated level for the next few quarters.
Our effective tax rate for Q1 was 16.7% for both GAAP and non-GAAP and both rates benefited from option exercises and share vesting at stock prices above their grant values. For fiscal 2022, we estimate our underlying effective tax rate will be in the 25% to 27% range, though it may vary based on discrete items.
Our balance sheet remains healthy as we ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments with no debt along with the $500 million untapped revolver. During the first quarter, we repurchased $260 million of our stock at an average price of $1,490. We increased our level of stock repurchases during the quarter when our share price fell with the market overall, and we’ll continue to opportunistically repurchase our stock.
We opened 51 new restaurants in the first quarter of which 42 had a Chipotlane. The performance of our Chipotlanes continues to be strong driving our new store productivity to record levels. Development team continues to do a tremendous job delivering new restaurants, despite the many issues we’re facing, including construction labor shortages, permitting delays and raw material and equipment shortages. Although these issues have lengthened the timeline of our new restaurants, our pipeline continues to be strong and we expect to open between 235 and 250 new restaurants in 2022 with at least 80%, including a Chipotlane.
Let me end by expressing my appreciation to our over 100,000 team members in our restaurants, in field leadership teams and in our restaurant support centers for their efforts to serve and delight our guests. I was thrilled to see our general managers and field leaders at our all-manager conference last month and personally thank them for their dedication and hard work over the past several years and share with them the opportunity that they all have as we grow from 3,000 restaurants to 7,000 restaurants in the years to come.
With that, we’re happy to take your questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will be from Nicole Miller with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Good afternoon and thanks for the update. If I could just ask two quick ones, I guess, both really centered first on the top line. If the comp is set to improve through the quarter, is it basically saying you haven’t seen any pushback on price? And if I’m looking back in a year ago in 2Q, it looks like traffic comparisons ease as you exit the quarter? Is there anything else – is that what’s going on? And is there anything else we have to take into consideration in terms of a digital influence or a party size influence around mix shift? Yes. I mean, obviously what we’ve seen is very little resistance to the pricing so far. And in regard to kind of entrees per ticket as our in store business goes up, I think it was up like 30-some-odd percent this quarter and kind of digital is held as a percentage. You’ll see some shifting number of entrees per ticket just because the in-store occasion is more of an individual occasion than the digital occasion. All right. So that’s where you see a little give back in the mix shift, right, is around an individual order essentially versus a big party order? That’s right, Nicole. Because our transactions actually are up, even though we had pricing that was in that about 10% range. Our transactions are up 5%, but our check is down 6%. That’s partly because of group size, which is the shift from digital to in-store that Brian talked about. And then also with digital, you tend to have attachment rates that are a little bit higher with things like queso, avocados, extra meat. And then we’re also comparing against Cauliflower Rice from last year as well. So those are all the things that drove the checkdown. But underlying transactions are healthy. And the price increase is sticking just as expected. We don’t see any resistance. Okay. And so just a second and last question, I mean, that’s exactly what we’d be looking for any weakness you would observe in the consumer on price or other behavior. And it’s really just a reconciliation of the in-store. I could see one of the criticisms down the road, if the consumer does weaken or the macro, whichever way you want to take it, I’d be curious, if you’re underlying assumption with the development going to be a record setting year, you don’t have franchisees that slow you down. You don’t have landlords or lenders that slow you down. So if you feel the pressure on the consumer, will you slow that development purposefully to lower end of the range? Or will you just keep pushing through? No. I mean, our plan is to grow and we think the strategies that we have and the results that we’re getting give us a lot of confidence to stay the course on our growth plans. Yes. And Nicole, I would just add. I literally just had a conversation with Tabassum who heads up our Real Estate. We had a leadership meeting and she’s out in the field with her teams and we had that conversation saying, listen, there’s a lot of noise going out there. The market is under stress, interest rates are going up. But no matter what happens out there, we have a strong balance sheet. We know we have a strong economics and we’re in this for the long haul. So make sure your teams realize we’re not slowing down. If anything, if there’s opportunities because others do pull back, let’s take that as an opportunity to go faster, not slower. Thank you. Thank you. And the next question will come from David Tarantino with Baird. Please go ahead. Hi. Good afternoon. Jack, I just want to come back to the Q2 guidance for my first part of my question. Could you just explain why the comp you expect to get better as the quarter goes on? Is it strictly related to comparisons or is it something else that you think... There’s a lot going on, David, comparisons a lot of it. Easter shifted, we see a nice seasonally shift right after Easter and we saw the nice shift this past week. Easter last year was in the first week, it was like the third or fourth. So it was two weeks later. So we definitely saw that step up, which gives us confidence that now we’re in kind of a normal post-Easter phase. In the last week or so since Easter is behind us, we are seeing that step up. We’re seeing the full flow through of the menu price increase and we take those sales trends and then project them through the rest of the quarter. It gives us confidence that we’re going to step up from the approximately 9% that we’ve seen so far month to date in April up to that 10% to 12% guidance ranges that we gave. Got it. Okay. That’s helpful. And then I wanted to come back, Brian, to your comments about throughput. I guess, this is one of the first calls you’ve highlighted that as a big opportunity in a while. Could you maybe give us a framework for where you are on the metrics you’re tracking versus where you used to be? I guess, prior to the pandemic, I guess, to frame up how much opportunity there is to really drive better throughput and potentially better sales through that attribute. Yes. Sure. So if you kind of go back just to kind of set kind of like a range for you. In our best time period, we were kind of in the low 30’s per 15 minutes peak. And then I think you heard me talking about this before the pandemic, we were targeting to get back to the mid 20’s, high 20’s and we were making a lot of great progress where we were closing on the kind of mid 20’s. And now where we are is we’re closing back in to get back to those mid 20’s. So, still a lot of headroom for where we can grow from here.
But the thing that’s been really nice is as we’ve gotten stability in the teams, the restaurants are staffed, we’re seeing performance in throughput and we’re also seeing great performance in our digital make line of being on time and accurate. So lots of opportunities on both of those, but to kind of give you the gauge we’re kind of in the mid 20’s on throughput and we’d like to get closer to 30% sooner rather than later. So lots of work to do, lots of opportunity though with it. Great. Thank you. And the next question will come from Andrew Charles with Cowen. Please go ahead. Great. Thank you. Jack, if we look out past the commodity and labor inflation that’s weighing on the industry in 2022, you guys have previously talked about 27% plus margins when $3 million volumes are reached. Is this still realistic? Is this still a real realistic level that could be reached without having taken outsize level of pricing? Yes. Andrew, listen, we still can get to that level. I mean the question is, when and how bumpy is it going to be between here and there. I mean, this really has been the most difficult period I’ve ever seen in terms of commodity month to month, quarter to quarter. But we know that we told in our guidance, we share that we expect to get back to the mid 20% range. And based on that volume to go from the current volumes in the $2.7 million range up to $3 million most of the flow through, most of the GAAP from the mid 20’s to get up to 27% will happen from flow through. And I think there’s going to be other efficiencies that we can find along the way, again, in a normal operating environment. So I still think that 27% is in play at that kind of volume. Super that’s very helpful. And then Brian, I know we’re talking a lot on this call as dine in rebounds about priorities in place before the pandemic, where such as throughput. One question I have for you just on catering. Can we talk about the opportunity there and how Chipotle is positioned sees on that as gatherings are happening. I know May is obviously a high volume month for you guys for catering given Cinco de Mayo, given graduation parties. How is Chipotle set up to capitalize on this opportunity? Yes. Look, it’s a great question. And I think it’s a great opportunity for us. The good news is we’re already seeing catering interests come back. And you mentioned you kind of got kind of the key events for a group gatherings coming up with graduation season. And the team’s done a great job I think of making our digital process a much easier process for people to do the catering. And then, we’ve got a team focused on how we continue to drive those group occasions going forward. So we think there’s upside for sure in it. It’s nice to see the consumer coming back to the occasion and I think we’re well positioned to continue grow in that space. Very helpful. Thanks guys. And the next question will come from Jared Garber with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Hi. Thanks for taking the question. My question’s related to the labor line. Wanted to get an update on where you are, I guess at staffing levels. And maybe I don’t know if the best way to frame that is versus pre-COVID or maybe more appropriate is where those staffing levels are versus how you’re expecting them to run right now, given the level of volume in the business? And then a follow-up on that. We saw last week in one of your releases that turnover was high. I mean, I’m sure it was you as the entire industry. But just wondering if there’s any way to frame, maybe how much incremental labor costs flowed through the system last year and are still are flowing through the system, given some of the incremental training costs and maybe some lower productivity from new employees. Yes. So the first part of your question, I would say the good news is we’re in the call it 85%, 90% of restaurants being staffed at model, which is really tremendous. We’ll always want to strive for 100%, but being that 85%, 90% range is really something that would say is better than we were pre-pandemic just to kind of give you a gauge. Pre-pandemic, we’re probably more in the 80% range.
Going forward, one of the things that we’re really happy to see actually is at the manager level and above we’re seeing more stability. So we’re seeing less turnover take place there. Usually, how that works then is that cascades into the crew. You are coming up on kind of a season where you’ve got some transition just with kids coming out of college and the end of the school year for people it’s just a shift in people’s working habits.
So we do see some bumps in kind of turnover at that timeframe. But I really think we got a lot of strength in our management leadership and when you have strength in the management leadership that cascades into the crew. So we’re liking how we’re set up for kind of coming into the spring summer season. Great. Thanks. And then Jack, I’m not sure if there’s anything on just thinking through labor productivity in the stores, as we think about the margins for the balance of the year and go forward. Yes. Jared, I would say we’re in a – like a – I’d say a normal operating environment meaning our turnover is normal at the crew level. It’s better than normal for the past few years at the manager level. So that means we always have hours built into our P&L for training. And that works as long as you have a few people a month that you’re bringing on in terms of new crew to train.
Now during a time like last year at about this time when we were losing more people, our turnover was up and it was harder to rehire that would put a lot of stress on the system, put a lot of stress in terms of training, put a lot of stress in terms of overtime. So there are stresses not just from how the teams are forming the customer experience, but also the stress on the P&L.
And I would say, we’re back to business as usual right now. So I think other than the inflation that we’ve already taken on the labor line, I think going forward in terms of the training, the turnover exclusions, knock on wood seem to be largely behind us with Omicron. It’s business as usual with our hiring training and leading our crew. Very helpful. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question will come from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Thanks very much. First just a follow-up. Where did wage inflation fall in the first quarter? Some of some of your competitors are starting to talk about some stabilization of wage growth. So it's not that it's getting better, but the rate of inflation is starting to go up. Are you experiencing that? Or is it still an inflationary, meaning accelerating quarter-over-quarter or month-over-month? No, it was normal, John. It was more in kind of that mid-single-digit kind of range. I mean, remember, we took that big step up, that 15% raise back in the second quarter. And so, it's been more in the normal range, but it's on top of the 15% we already took. Thank you. And Brian, you mentioned automation and this Chippy robot or whatever it is that that makes chips. How big an opportunity do you see this? I understand these are longer-term bets. But is there – how big an automation opportunity is there within Chipotle? Is this something that could have a meaningful impact over time on store margins? Are there more tasks you're looking at to automate? Or is this sort of a one-off and kind of an interesting thing to test? No, look, I think there is a real opportunity frankly to make the restaurant be much more efficient. Obviously, Chippy is our first attempt. And we've worked with a lot of our employees to identify what are the tasks that they would love to see us bring automation to or AI, so that hopefully the role can become less complicated. And then I think there is just other places in the back of the restaurant where we have the ability to automate, whether it's on the digital make-line or other tasks. I think there is just tremendous opportunity for us to become even more efficient where it results in a better employee experience and also a better customer experience. And that's really the lens we're using on this. And do you think that's years away or quarters away? And what's the time – as you look at where the technology is today? Or what's the time horizon which this starts to really materialize? Look, I think the technology is very close in. The ability then to scale it and get it installed. That's what we have to learn. And we're getting ready to put Chippy into a restaurant and then we've got a lot of other initiatives in works at our Cultivate Center. So the technology is actually close in. The prototypes are close in. It's then putting it through the stage gate process and really understanding people's ability to scale up and then actually install, assuming it performs the way we think it's going to perform. Okay. Thank you. The next question is from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Thanks. A quick follow-up on the throughput opportunity you mentioned. Where do you often see the bottleneck if there is one or that maybe on the other side lead you to an initiative or an area of focus for you? Obviously, you're measuring people against this in terms of speed. But maybe there is a certain area in that, whether it's a kitchen or other. And I'm wondering also is your labor scheduling tool a part of this solution? Yes. So it's twofold. It is having better deployment, which, obviously, the labor scheduling tool will help us with that. It also better informs our forecasting as well versus moving from just looking back over the prior four weeks and trying to project up prior four weeks. It's now using real-time information to project what's going to happen in the coming week. So what we see is a better forecast, which results in a better schedule. And then what it also helps us do is deploy correctly. And the reason why the deployment is important is we need people to be in their positions, right. And the most – probably most pressing spot is that expedited role, which is really in between kind of the last phase of making your bowl of burrito and getting to cash.
And if the team isn't deployed correctly, but sometimes that's the spot that doesn't get the right support. And as a result, it kind of slows the line down. But obviously, it all has to work in concert, right. You need to have people that have had a lot of reps. They need to be trained to be able to move people down the line and make the bowls and burritos correctly. But it's the combination of those two things, having people in the right positions and arguably one of the most important positions is that expediter position, the way you get there is to make sure you got a right forecast. And then I just – one about just insights. As we get into a little bit more of a mobile consumer environment and maybe people getting back to work, are there any sort of emerging realities that are surprising to you about perhaps your dinner staying were at higher levels, your lunch not coming back as quickly as you'd like, maybe competition taking share as they're reopening in certain trade areas, any insights there about the reopen. No. The biggest thing I would tell you is the more we see people have mobility, the more we see our lunch business come back. And the nice thing is we've seen these new occasions whether it's a dinner occasion or a group occasion remain pretty sticky in the business. So I think the thing that is playing out is what people that have had experience with us for new occasions love the culinary and they're using us for these other occasions. And our rewards program, I think, is doing a nice job of understanding those journeys and then building the right engagement going forward. So mobility is a key piece of the puzzle because you want people out and about and you want people go into their office or going to their activity. That's how you get that restaurant experience back. Thank you. The next question will be from Jon Tower from Citi. Please go ahead. Awesome. Just quick in terms of a – well, bookkeeping and then a question. In terms of the delivery mix in the quarter, I was wondering if you could comment on where that settled. And then just thinking about the labor situation going back to that point, I know obviously, you guys have made quite a bit of investment in your employees over time and have given them a nice path to make a lot more money over time, assuming they earn it in the system. But I'm curious, when you think about the investments that you made, do you think that's enough to keep people engaged into the balance of this year and going forward? Or do you foresee perhaps even more labor investment necessary in the future outside of just normalized inflationary spend? Yes. Look, I think the one thing I want to emphasize on labor is what we've heard from people that are with our company. So they've been with us five, six, seven years, what they get excited about is all the growth because they can go from being an apprentice to a general manager to a field leader to a team director, regional vice president. And it's a reality because we're building 200, 300 restaurants a year. They know they have to be developing themselves and others, so that they can step into the next opportunity. That's where they get the greatest change in both, I would say, professional satisfaction as well as the wages that come with it.
We do know we've got a very competitive starting wage, but what people get really excited about is where that starting wage can take them. And our company can take them really far and also really quick. So it's great that we have all the other benefits that I think separate us and continue to be consistent with our purpose of cultivating a better world. But when I've had the opportunity to get out in the field and talk to people, what they're really excited about is the fact that they're a part of a company that's committed to its purpose and committed to growth. And that growth is both for them as an individual as well as those that work around them. And that's what we're going to keep investing in. So we haven't seen a whole lot of pressure on the starting wage, where we are putting a lot of pressure is on making sure that we're developing our people, so they're ready for the growth. Got it. And just delivery mix and then the second piece in terms of… Yes, sorry, delivery mix is like low 20s, 20%, 21%. Okay. And in terms of thinking about. Sorry about that. No, no. Go ahead. I was just going to ask about pricing expectations for the balance of 2022. Obviously, you just took a chunk recently. Curious if all else holds for the balance of the year based upon your expectations for wage rate inflation and obviously commodities appear to be all over the map. But at this moment, are you anticipating future pricing action in the balance of 2022? You know, gosh, I really hope we don't have to take more pricing, but I'm going to kind of give you the same answer I've been giving you for the last, call it, 12 months, which is, if it moves and we can't find efficiencies to offset it, the good news is we've got the pricing power to make a move. I really don't want to be ahead of it. So I think a great example is probably what you just saw over this last quarter. Look, inflation continued to move in a big way. We saw it wasn't going away, so we had to take the pricing action that we did. And hopefully, that won't continue to be the case. But if it has to be the case, we have, I think, the organization, the people and the pricing power to do it, but it really is the last thing I'd like to do. Got it. Thanks for taking the questions. Thank you. And the next question will be from John Ivankoe with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Hi, thank you. I wanted to revisit some of the numbers that were in the ESG report that you guys published because it did look like some of the general manager and field level turnover was actually up 2021 versus 2020. Was that something that just happened maybe in the middle of the year as part of kind of the great resignation we've seen a significant improvement in trends? I guess did that surprise you in any way? And I guess how has some of that normally maybe slightly more stable, your employee base changed as we've come into 2022? Yes, sure. So obviously, that's looking back at 2021. And yes, look, there were a lot of ups and downs with Omicron. There were a lot of ups and downs with wages. And obviously, that was a tough time to be running restaurants. There was a lot of situations where you were understaffed. And then it was very hard to get people to sign up to work. And the good news is we've made tremendous progress. Obviously, we've increased our starting wage. I think we've done a much better job of explaining the growth path at our company. And then illustrating that growth path by having 90% of our promotions come from internal promotion – internal employees. So that's why when you fast forward to 2022, we're in just such a better place with stability, definitely at the manager level. And then I think that will follow into the crew. So what the challenges were in 2022. I think we get them. And we're leaning into our purpose values and growth platforms to keep people excited about being at Chipotle. And hopefully, this is an appropriate follow-up. But obviously, in the last six months or so, labor units have really become a very topical subject for companies that didn't quite frankly, even mention them for years of discussion of covering some of these means, both in the retail and the restaurant side. It's obviously great that you guys recently had in all manager conference that was just in March. I guess what can you do? I guess you'd kind of always stay in front of that issue and maybe de-risk that from a Chipotle perspective? Again, hopefully, that's a perfect question to ask in a public call. Yes. Look, I mean, what we're committed to is developing our people and growing people that want to be at Chipotle. And the best thing we can do is make sure that they're trained, so that they're successful in their job, and then that we give them a culture and a leader that develops them so they realize they have the growth opportunities at Chipotle. And that's why – look I can't remember who asked the question, but it's kind of – hopefully, you're not surprised by my answer when you asked like, well, what's next after Chippy. Well, the answer is we talk to our employees to find out what would be the tasks that would make sense for us to automate in the restaurant to make the employee experience better because we know if the employee experience improves, we'll have better retention and also we'll have better execution than for our customers.
And so we really spend a lot of time communicating and taking action on how we can improve the employee experience. And then we spend the time developing our people. And you mentioned, we just had this all manager conference, right. I mean, it was electric man. It was so great to have all our leaders in one place understanding the future of Chipotle and how they play such a critical role. And we had the opportunity to have everybody in the room stand up that's been promoted over the last four years and you know what, almost every person in the room was standing up.
I don't think there are many places where that happens, so we have to continue to stay committed to our purpose, our culture and the development of our people. So that when you end up at all manager conferences, and you got just about everybody in the room standing up because they've been promoted or they've developed others that have gotten promoted so that's what we're focused on. That's our proposition. That's who we are. If you want to be a part of that we're going to be building lots of restaurants that present an opportunity for you to be a part of it. That's great. Thank you. The next question is from Dennis Geiger with UBS. Please go ahead. Great. Thank you. Jack, I wanted to ask another one on margins and thinking about cost pressures over the balance of the year. Great insights on the 2Q and kind of getting back to that mid-20s level already and recognizing there's a lot of moving pieces through the year, but is there any additional color that you could share even at a high level in thinking about back half restaurant margins with respect to food inflation? I guess particularly in light of how Brian, just spoke to pricing philosophy, if there's anything you can add at a high level there? Yes. We – again, we just had at our leadership meeting, of my group, we talked to Carlos, our Head of Supply Chain and there's nothing we can see on the horizon that says, things are going to retreat, that things are going to go down, but things have at least for the time being stabilized. So that's what right now we can hope for as a stable environment, we do expect there's going to be an inflection point at some point. The pressures of getting some of our like packaging, for example, in from overseas, the pressure that some of the suppliers are having, whether it's from a labor standpoint or just from a cost standpoint for their input costs, what we can hope for is that, that they don't step up from here. They stabilize. And at some point they just kind of normalize in the future, but right now, if I was going to build a model, I would not build in a reduction in food cost for the fourth quarter, it looks like it's more going to be something in 2023 before we see that. Great. Thank you. And then just one quick one, apologies if I missed it, but could you guys speak to kind of the percent of the dine-in sales or traffic that have recovered at this point, I don’t know if you can touch on kind of that overlap with digital, that digital dine-in customer. And then related to that, just how exciting the further dine-in recovery can be here as it relates to how low that that overlap is, if there's any commentary there. Thank you. Yes, look, I think one of the things we mentioned was our in-restaurant sales increased by 33%, while digital remained roughly 40% of our business, right. And one thing that I mentioned earlier in the call is as we continue to see people increase their mobility, I think we will continue to see gains in the in-restaurant experience. And I don't see these digital occasions just disappearing. I think they're going to continue to play their role and we're working hard on keeping digital to be frictionless and just completely intuitive.
And then at the same token, we're working hard on having great throughput with great culinary and the good news is there's a lot of room to grow in both of these things. That's why we're optimistic, we'll get to 3 million AUVs. And while we do that, we're going to build a lot of restaurants. So I think we're in a really good spot. And obviously I'm excited for, hopefully COVID staying behind us and inflation stabilizing, and hopefully in 2023 maybe you can see some improvement on that front. But regardless, I think we've demonstrated we've got a business, a brand and an organization that can handle it all. Great. Thank you very much. The next question is from Lauren Silberman from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Thank you for the question. Jack, I think you had mentioned new store productivity at record levels. Can you just provide an update on where new unit productivity and cash on cash returns are running today? Yes. The productivity's been in that kind of mid-80s to high 80s, depending on the quarter, it may have touched like 90% from time to time. And what I mean by that is that's the percentage of mature restaurants of our comp restaurant when we deliver those kind of openings, sales, when most of them are Chipotlane, which is more efficient than a non-Chipotlane. Our cash-on-cash returns are in the 40%, 45% range out of the box. When you put a couple years of comp on that, as they basically close the gap and get very close to our average volumes, our comp restaurants, we're talking about returns in the 60%, 65% returns within just a few years. Great. Thank you for that. And just on menu innovation, can you talk about how you are thinking about menu innovation for the rest of this 2022 and specifically just how you're thinking about opportunities for innovation around proteins versus other parts of the menu? Sure. I think we've kind of established a pretty good cadence here where we do, call it two to three menu initiatives a year. And we have a few protein initiatives in place that, I'm sure you'll see in test. And then we're continuing to work hard on trying to figure out a dissert proposition or another call it add-on item, right. So to compliment how we have guac on, 50% of our transactions, I think queso on like, what is it, 20 some odd percent something of our transaction. So it's like if we could find another add-on like that, whether it comes as a dessert or in that space, like a queso guac, you'll see us continue innovating in those areas.
But we think we've got a lot of room to still I think excite and engage customers with the chicken steak plant-based solutions and at the same time look at these other add-on opportunities. Great. Thank you guys. Sure. The next question is from Brian Vaccaro from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Thanks and good afternoon. Question was on the commodity inflation backdrop and sorry if I missed it, but Jack, what was inflation on the basket in the first quarter? Yes, it was in that like 12% to 13% range. Again it's the highest inflation I've ever seen. Yes, I guess… Hopefully we've seen the last of it. Like I said, in a few comments ago, things have stabilized for now. If you get one month in a row, that's stabilized, that's a start, but let's see what happens the next two or three months to see if we see stable costs. Right. And if you did see that stabilization sort of hold, would you start to see that year-on-year inflation moderate into Q4 or at this point, are you just thinking, we'll be in the low teens for now, until that dynamic changes? Yes. I mean, listen, as you go throughout the year, if it stabilized completely that 13 is going to tick down as we compare to some of the inflation we saw last year, but most of that 13 is going to be with us for the rest of the year. I think importantly is the food cost that we talked about being in kind of that 31% range if commodity costs stay stable, we should stay in that range for the rest of the year. And we know that our margin, we have our full margin potential ahead of us, if we keep our food costs in that like 31% range. So knock on wood that things stabilize to make pricing increases we've taken so far will give us that margin potential that we know is possible. All right, great. That's helpful. And then on the comps, could you just level set, if you don't take additional pricing, where would effective pricing be over the next couple quarters? And then on mix specifically, does that start to normalize now on a year-over-year basis? I know we're kind of, there's been some funky comparisons on the mix front, the last four quarters now it seems, does that sort of flatten out next several quarters? Yes. Well, on menu prices, they'll step up a bit in the second quarter. So we'll move from like call it a 10, 10.5 to like call it a 12.5, something like that. Then it steps down to a little under 10, then it'll step down in the fourth quarter to like in an 8.5. Mix, it just depends on the mobility that we talked about before, mix for the foreseeable future is going to be at this lower check size, because we're comparing to – last year where most of the year, a good part of the year still had very heavy digital. I mean, we did start stepping down near the end of the year. So I think you're still going to see like year-over-year, the group size is going to be lower.
There's going to be relatively, in terms of a percentage growth, like we saw 33% growth in in-restaurant versus digital. I think you'll see some numbers like that. So I still think you're going to see some distortion where the group size is getting smaller and you're going to see transactions grow while the average check, excluding menu price increase is going to decline a bit, but we'll keep you guys updated each quarter on what those components are. All right. That's very helpful. Thank you. I'll pass it along. Operator, is there one more question? Hello? Well, I don't know if we're having technical trouble. We can't hear the operator or anyone else. We're about at the end of the time. So Brian, I don't know if you want to make a closing comment. Yes, sure. So I'll just close this real quick. Thanks for taking the time. Thanks for the questions, obviously very proud of our results in the quarter. Very proud of the work that's been done today. I think the one thing that's worth reminding people, there's a few things that haven't changed, right. We have a great brand, we've got a great culture. We've got a unique purpose around cultivating a better world. And we've got tremendous growth in front of us both within the existing restaurant, between the combination of our in-restaurant opportunity and our digital business, as well as adding additional restaurants across the country.
And one thing that I'm confident about is our culture. Our people will capture the upside for this business and continue to drive growth going forward. So thank you for taking the time. And I look forward to talking to you next quarter. Take care.","all participants will be in a listen-only mode . i would now like to turn the conference over to Adam Rymer, VP of Finance .",0.0

And with that, I will turn the call over to Brian. Thanks Cindy and good afternoon everyone. We are pleased with our second quarter performance during a period of inflation and consumer uncertainty. For the quarter, sales grew 17% to reach $2.2 billion driven by a 10.1% comp; in-store sales grew by 36% over last year; digital sales represented 39% of total sales; restaurant-level margin was 25.2%, an increase of 70 basis points year-over-year; adjusted diluted EPS was $9.30, representing 25% growth over last year; and we opened 42 new restaurants, including 32 Chipotlanes.
I would like to spend a couple of minutes providing insight into current trends and our outlook. Regarding Q2, through mid-May, comparable sales were on track to reach the top end of our guidance range. Since then, the underlying trend has decelerated and we anticipate mid- to high single-digit comps for Q3 with planned pricing in August.
There are a couple of key things we have learned during the quarter. Our pricing power is strong and the brand is resilient, our culinary and food with integrity commitment is a key point of difference, our restaurants are staffed with terrific people despite a difficult hiring and retention environment, and our people are still getting up to speed on running a growing multimillion-dollar digital business as well as a growing multimillion-dollar in-restaurant business.
To accelerate this learning curve, we are instituting an ops initiative focused on being brilliant at the basics. We did this in 2019 and saw a positive impact on the business right up to the pandemic in 2020. I will discuss this in more detail later.
And finally, we are focused on the right strategies. It is as important as ever that we remain focused on our five strategies that help us to win today while we create the future.
Now, let me provide a brief update on each of these strategies, which include number one, running successful restaurants with a people-accountable culture that provides great food with integrity, while delivering exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences. number two, amplifying technology and innovation to drive growth and productivity at our restaurants and support centers; number three, sustaining world-class people leadership by developing and retaining diverse talent at every level; number four, expanding access and convenience by accelerating new restaurant openings; and number five, making the brand visible, relevant and loved to improve overall guest engagement.
Let's start with discussing running successful restaurants. I'm happy to say that I've seen lines out the door in mobile pickup shelves full in Boston, Philadelphia, Denver, Austin and Arbor, Dallas, Cincinnati, London, Paris and Los Angeles. I think everybody gets the point.
Fortunately, we were staffed with terrific employees, and they were working hard with smiles on their faces and great attitudes. I'm very proud to say that our restaurant teams have successfully grown average unit volumes to about $2.8 million, with 39% being digital.
Our general managers and teams have adapted well to our growing digital and growing in-restaurant business. However, customers were waiting on digital orders and the front line was moving, but it could have been quicker. I know we can be better.
This is why we have launched an ops initiative, focused on retraining our crew members on the fundamentals of our business. These fundamentals include having great culinary prepared and ready to serve, open to close in a food-safe environment; ensuring that restaurants are staffed and appropriately deployed across both the digital make-line and front make-line; improving order accuracy and timing for the digital business; and increasing throughput in hospitality for the in-store business.
Additionally, we completed the rollout of our new labor management tool that helps put the right people in the right place at the right time. We believe the combination of being brilliant at the basics with the new labor management tool will drive meaningful productivity in our restaurants.
Along with our labor management tool, our technology road map remains robust. I think it is worth highlighting how we are investing in technology to support strong execution of the basics.
We just installed new customer-facing pin pads that offer faster and contact-free payment options. We've deployed a new learning management system that enables immersive ways for our employees to experience training and provides digitally enhanced e-learning courses, videos and resource materials.
We also are in the process of updating our POS hardware across the system, which should be completed by this year, and we have made DML enhancements that aid accuracy and throughput. These recently completed or in-flight programs will all be positive for our restaurant teams and guest experience.
Additionally, we will continue to invest in possible technology for the future, like Chippy, the autonomous robot we are testing that integrates culinary traditions with artificial intelligence to help our teams make tortilla chips, bringing up their time to serve and support our guests. And we are exploring an automated real-time kitchen production system that ensures high-quality food is available to meet the needs of our guests.
This brings me to our Cultivate Next venture fund, which is off to a great start and is giving us a front-row view of emerging food technologies. We are interested in our breadth of innovations, including sustainable farming, supply chain advancements, restaurant operating efficiencies and ways to elevate the employee and guest experience. We've received a lot of interest with over 200 inquiries for investments. And as you may have heard last week, we announced our first investments in Hyphen and Meati.
Hyphen is a food service platform that automates the assembly of meals on a make-line and could help fulfill our promise to deliver on time, accurate orders for our digital guests. We look forward to sharing more investments in the future that will help us drive meaningful change at scale.
I do want to take a moment to discuss our people. Despite a challenging labor market, I am proud to say our staffing levels remain above 2019 levels. Our purpose of cultivating a better world with Food with Integrity has created a brand that people are proud to represent and be part of.
We continue to offer a world-class employee value proposition that includes industry- leading benefits, attractive wages, specialized training and development, access to education and a transparent pathway to significant career advancement opportunities. We believe these efforts, along with our growth and purpose, are helping to attract and retain great employees.
And our people development program is important in order to accelerate our new restaurant openings. The real estate pipeline remains strong and supports our target of 8% to 10% new restaurants per year with more than 80%, including the Chipotlane. We now have 430 Chipotlanes, and results continue to exceed our expectations with Chipotlanes generating higher average unit volumes and higher restaurant level margins. In fact, a recent opening of a Chipotlane in a small town in California had one of the highest opening day sales in the company's history.
In addition to the US, we are also excited about our progress in both Canada and Europe. Canada has hit a stride with AUVs and returns that are at the same level as the US, and Canadian comparable sales trends remain strong. We currently have 29 locations in Canada and longer term; we see room for several hundred, which is included in our target of 7,000 restaurants in North America.
And Europe continued to move through the stage-gate process. We have made significant progress in improving the economics in Europe, driven by operational efficiencies, adding our digital systems and opening smaller formats that resemble the US restaurants. We have opened five new restaurants in the UK over the last 18 months, and results have been strong. We are gaining confidence that Europe could be another layer to our growth story in the future.
This brings me to making the brand visible, relevant and loved everywhere we operate. Our Real Food for Real Athletes campaign focuses on helping athletes across all levels perform their best by providing proper nutrition through real food and real ingredients. As on official sponsor of the NHL, we activated this relationship through traditional media and creative promotions to highlight Chipotle, including having our logo in the ICE for every game of the Stanley Cup Playoffs.
Additionally, we have partnered with US soccer to create behind the scenes content that showcases how Rose Level and Sofia Smith overcame the challenges of competing at the highest level of women's soccer. And later this year, we will file the US Men's National team via our sponsorship and with advertising during the World Cup.
We also continue to appear in nontraditional channels to drive difference, culture, and ultimately, a purchase. We recently launched Burrito Builder on Roblox on National Burrito Day. The first 100,000 players to successfully roll a virtual burrito at a virtual Chipotle earned a free entree unwrap. These led to one of our best digital sales days and marks the first time a brand enabled Roblox player to earn and exchange virtual Roblox currency for real-world items.
Okay. Moving on to the menu. Our pipeline remains robust. Building upon the brand's recent success with menu innovations, including smoked brisket and Pollo Asado, we have tested and successfully validated Garlic Guajillo Steak, and this steak is ready for rollout in the future.
Shifting to our digital experience. We now have a digital business tracking towards $3.5 billion in sales, and we currently have over 29 million rewards members. We are mining the data every day for insights, while leveraging the information to influence behavior and drive greater frequency. We are also working aggressively on greater personalization across the customer journey and obtained valuable insights on, which incentives provide the greatest ROI.
Additionally, we're excited about the recent launch of the rewards program in Canada, which will provide another way for Canadian guests to engage with the brand and provide Chipotle with the ability to further delight its Canadian Rewards members. Finally, our digital ecosystem is rolling out in the UK, and France will follow shortly thereafter.
To conclude, there is much uncertainty we are all dealing with, but what I am certain about is Chipotle and its people will remain committed to leading and growing.
I'm certain that over time, we have the ability to grow our average unit volumes and achieve at least 7,000 restaurants across the US and Canada. I'm certain that we will move our purpose of cultivating a better world forward in a meaningful way. I'm certain that Chipotle provides one of the best value propositions in the industry. I'm certain that we have the right teams with the right focus to navigate whatever comes our way and that our culture will continue to offer our crews terrific career opportunities.
Finally, I'm certain that we are well positioned for long-term growth. Lastly and very importantly, I want to thank our restaurant teams for their hard work and contributions to making Chipotle one of the best restaurant brands in the world.
With that, here's Jack to walk you through the financials. Thanks, Brian. Sales in the second quarter grew 17% year-over-year to reach $2.2 billion as comp sales grew 10.1%. Restaurant-level margin of 25.2% increased about 70 basis points compared to last year. And earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $9.30, representing nearly 25% year-over-year growth.
Second quarter had unusual expenses related to certain legal proceedings, our previously disclosed 2018 performance share modification, transformation costs as well as the restaurant asset impairment and closure costs, mostly offset by an unrealized gain on investments, which negatively impacted our earnings per share by $0.05, leading to GAAP earnings per share of $9.25.
Regarding our sales trends. As Brian mentioned, we were on track for comparable sales to reach the upper end of our guidance range for the first half of the quarter. Since then, we've experienced a step down due to a combination of macro pressures, our ability to handle the growth with relatively new workforce and a return to normal summer seasonality for college-based restaurants. For perspective, about 15% of our restaurants are in college town, and we've not seen normal seasonality in 3 years.
Looking ahead to Q3. With pricing from last year rolling off, our current trends in July are running in the mid-single-digit range. Assuming current sales trends continue, we expect our comp to be in the mid- to high single-digit range, which includes our planned August pricing increase of about 4% to help offset incremental inflation pressures, especially in dairy, tortillas and packaging as well as pockets of wage pressure throughout the country.
I'll now go through the key P&L line items, beginning with cost of sales. Cost of sales in the quarter were 30.4%, about flat to last year. The benefit of menu price increases
offset elevated costs across the board, most notably in avocado, packaging, dairy, beef and chicken. In Q3, we expect our cost of sales to be about 30% of sales, as the benefit from the menu price increase will be partially offset by the higher cost of dairy, tortillas and packaging.
Labor costs for the quarter were 24.8%, an increase of about 30 basis points from last year. This increase was driven by our decision to take a meaningful step up in wages last May, which is partially offset by menu price increases. In Q3, we expect our labor costs to be about 25% due to leverage from our menu price increases offsetting pockets of wage pressures across the country.
As Brian also mentioned, we have now completed the rollout of our labor management tool. While our teams are still learning how to use the tool, we believe it has the potential to lead to better deployment to both make lines during peaks, which we think will eventually lead to better throughput on our front serve line and better on-time results for the P&L.
Other operating costs for the quarter were 14.3%, a decrease of about 90 basis points from last year. This decrease was driven by menu price increases, as well as a decline in delivery expenses, partially offset by higher costs across several expenses, most notably utilities, including natural gas.
Marketing and promo costs for the quarter were 2.5%, 10 basis points above last year. In Q3, we expect marketing costs to remain in the mid-2% range with the full year to average right around 3%. In Q3, other operating costs are expected to be in the mid-14% range.
G&A for the quarter was $141 million on a GAAP basis or $130 million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding $7 million due to the settlement of certain legal matters, $3 million related to the previously disclosed modification to our 2018 performance shares and $1 million related to transformation expenses.
G&A also includes $106 million in underlying G&A, $25 million related to non-cash stock comp and a $1 million benefit related to lower performance-based bonus accruals, partially offset by payroll taxes and equity vesting and exercises. We expect our underlying G&A to be around $111 million in Q3 and continue to grow slightly thereafter as we make investments in technology and people to support ongoing growth.
We anticipate stock comp will be around $25 million in Q3, although this amount could move up or down based on our performance, bringing our anticipated total G&A in Q3 to around $136 million. Depreciation was $70 million, and we expect it to remain at this level for the rest of the year.
Our effective tax rate for Q2 was 25.3% for GAAP and 25.1% for non-GAAP. For fiscal 2022, we estimate our underlying effective tax rate to be in the 25% to 27% range, though it may vary based on discrete items. Our balance sheet remains healthy as we ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments with no debt along with a $500 million untapped revolver.
During the second quarter, we repurchased $261 million of our stock at an average price of $1,350. We increased our level of stock repurchases during the quarter when our share price fell with the market overall, and we'll continue to opportunistically repurchase our stock.
During the quarter, the Board authorized an additional $300 million to our share authorization program. And at the end of the quarter, we had $320 million remaining. We opened 42 new restaurants in the quarter, of which 32 had a Chipotlane. The performance of our Chipotlanes continues to be strong, maintaining record-high new store productivity.
In terms of development, we continue to navigate various challenges, including construction and permitting delays and material shortages. However, our team has done an outstanding job of anticipating these challenges and mitigating delays where possible. And we still anticipate opening between 235 and 250 new restaurants in 2022 with at least 80%, including a Chipotlane.
As I mentioned last quarter, once we move beyond these development challenges, we expect to be able to accelerate openings and get closer to the high end of the 8% to 10% opening range.
In closing, I've experienced Chipotle's resiliency over the past 20 years through both great times and challenging times, and I share Brian's confidence in our ability to navigate the current environment. Looking forward, I'm excited about the growth opportunity ahead of us with a runway to more than double our restaurant base and grow AUVs beyond $3 million with a 40% flow-through. I want to thank our 100,000 employees in our restaurants and in support roles for their continued effort and commitment to Chipotle.
With that, we're happy to take your questions. Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] And the first question will be from Nicole Miller with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Thank you. Good afternoon. Hoping you could talk a little bit more about labor in terms of staffing. In the context of AUVs being up versus 2019, well more than 20%, just because you had mentioned that in regards staffing levels in regards to 2019 today, are you suggesting that it needs to be more efficient in terms of labor or that you need more bodies in terms of staffing? Like, how does it compare to the context of the AUV increase, if that's applicable? Yes. Hi, Nicole. The way to think about it is, obviously, our labor model reflects our increase in transactions and sales. So we look at it as, is the restaurant staffed at model given the volume and transactions that the restaurant has. And what we're referring to is, the percentage of restaurants that are staffed correctly is better than what we -- where we were in 2019. So that's what we're referring to.
And then what we're talking about is, obviously, a lot of the people that have joined our company over the last two years, they really haven't experienced the front line and what it means to grow that in-restaurant business, while also growing the digital business. And that's why Scott and the operators are focused on ensuring that everybody is brilliant at the basics to execute our growing two lines of business. Okay. And then, just can you briefly discuss in terms of last year's 15% comp, how things tracked in July, August and September? So we can understand a little bit about what to think about compares from the prior year period. Yes. Nicole, this is Jack. You'll remember that in the second quarter of last year, we did have a staffing challenge, and that's when we took the significant increase. So we did compare during part of the quarter to a little bit of a softer comparison.
But since we announced in May, I think it was like around mid-May that we were increasing wages, and right at that moment, we started paying the higher rates as new people are coming in.
And the announcement that we made at that time was also a signal to our existing teams that you're going to get a raise in early June. So we saw staffing stabilize, and then we saw our sales recover. So we did have a several week period during the quarter where we did have a little bit softer comparison. Okay. And how about July, August and September of last year? The comp was 15% last year, right, in the third quarter? Is there anything -- how does that look? Those were -- I would call those normal comparisons. By then, our staffing has stabilized. And so, those are other tougher comparisons. Okay. So each month was kind of 15%? There was no notable difference between the months? Yes. Listen, they vary very month-to-month, but there was nothing during the quarter that I would tell you makes that comparison. I would say, if anything, Nicole, just compared to Q2, it's just a little tougher of a comparison overall. But each month was fairly… They didn’t bounce all over the place. They didn’t bounce all over the place. Yes. Okay. Thank you. And the next question is from David Tarantino from Baird. Please, go ahead. Hi. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask you a couple of questions about the comp trend. I guess, I first wanted to understand how you're thinking about the slowdown you saw towards the end of the quarter. And I know you rolled over some pricing, so maybe had some less pricing contribution.
But you seem to be also pointing out some operational challenges that may have caused that. And I guess, how do you determine whether it's that versus maybe just a general slowdown in consumer spending, if you will? Yes. Hey, David, obviously, it's hard to tease out some of the macro pressures versus what we're seeing as far as people peeling off the line for potentially not being happy with potential order time. But what we've definitely seen, as I've been out visiting restaurants, and when we talk to our leaders in the field is we've got a lot of new people that are still getting trained up on, frankly, the basics of great throughput. And I feel like this is rinse and repeat, but that's what our business is a little bit, which is we got to have our aces in places. You got to have the expeditor. You got to have the linebacker. You can't work around those things to try and service the business.
And we just have a lot of new people that don't understand how important some of those roles are as well as general managers, too. A lot of these managers have gotten promoted over the last 18 to 24 months. So, we know there is upside in taking the combination of this new labor tool, deploying people correctly and then ensuring that those people are trained and actually experience what great throughput looks like.
That's the other biggest thing. These -- a lot of these folks haven't experienced what -- how fast the line can move. So, I think in some cases, folks think they're moving pretty quick when in fact we could be moving a lot faster. Got it. And Jack, could you help us understand what your transaction levels or growth was in the second quarter and what your third quarter guidance implies on that metric? Yes. David, the transactions were up in the quarter between 3.5% and 4%. We also had a mix shift. We didn't talk about that for a number of quarters now as our business has moved more towards in-restaurant. The average group size -- well, the mix shift was about a negative 6%. The average group size dropped by about 4.5% and that drop is mostly a drop from the business moving from digital into in-restaurant.
So, as we move to Q3, we do expect that -- because of the downturn that we saw the macro effects in the second quarter, we do think that transaction comp will ease a bit, but we also think that the negative mix shift should ease a bit as well. And Jack, one clarification. When you say ease, do you think it will stay positive, I guess? Was this your guidance to assume it's positive, or are you thinking… David, it's going to be right around slightly positive or right around flattish, right around in that range. Okay. Thank you very much. Thanks David. The next question comes from John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Thanks very much. My first question is just maybe clarify a little bit more why seek more pricing now. It seems like your margins are where you thought they should be you're sort of balancing the inflationary impact versus pricing. And you're also now confronting a weaker consumer. So, why now versus maybe letting some pricing lapse and maybe waiting longer and just out of the abundance of caution? Maybe your thoughts on that, please. Yes. What we've seen is -- unfortunately, a lot of things have stuck versus gone away as far as inflation. And then we've got some key items that have frankly continued to be inflationary. And I think Jack highlighted it right. We've got avocados, we've got dairy, tortillas, some packaging.
So, unfortunately, we were hoping we'd see some of the stuff pull back. We haven't seen that. But there are other parts of the business that we have seen plateau, which gives us optimism that, hopefully, we won't have to continue to pull the pricing lever. And I think you've seen this with us. We really do try to wait until we truly understand what feels like is something that's an ongoing cost that we need to handle with pricing versus, hey, we're going to wait this one out and see if it pulls back. So we figured best to share where our heads are on this one now. I appreciate that. On -- thinking about your softness that you experienced post May, was there any particular part of the business that it showed up in first? I'm thinking did the delivery channel, for example, exhibit weakness? What piece of the business decelerated more than others? And was there any signal in that in terms of the behavioral change of the consumer? Yeah. I think what we saw was probably not all that different from what people have been saying. The low income consumer definitely has pulled back their purchase frequency. Fortunately, for Chipotle, that is not the majority of our customers. The majority of our customers are a higher household income consumer. And we've actually seen their frequency increase and potentially not experience, I'm guessing, some trade-down from other areas where they were choosing to get their leading occasion. So probably the first indicator was in our, I'll call it, our rewards data, where we saw some of these low income consumers starting to slow down on purchase frequency. And not necessarily impacting the delivery channel specifically, which one might think of as being an expensive channel? No. No. Actually, that's been pretty stable throughout. Okay. Thank you. And the next question is from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Thanks. Just a question -- a follow-up question on the topic of mix and the impact of essentially the number of people per order. One casual dining company out there said that family seemed to be getting back to pre-COVID summer behaviors. So perhaps that family orders that happened last summer are going away as they get back to doing some of those other activities. Do you think -- is it, I don't know, possible for you to see that in the numbers or in any of your insights data that perhaps there's almost a seasonal headwind that's going to be particularly bad here over the summer and it coincided with that, not just economics? I mean, David, there is the other thing that we saw was even a group size in-restaurant did decline a little bit. It didn't decline as much. Overall decline was in that 4.5% range, and it was bigger -- the bigger piece of that is a shift from digital to in-restaurant. But even within the in-restaurant customers, the group size did shrink a little bit. So I don't know if I would connect those dots. But if you're seeing other evidence that families are returning to the way that they would dine three years ago where they're not all getting together and dining together, that could be at play.
We also, for the first time in three years, saw kind of normal college seasonality, meaning the college restaurants really performed exceptionally well during the school year because they were all in-person. And then we saw seasonality that we haven't seen in three years, where the college students go back home and they tend to eat less. I don't know if that's more mom's home cooking. But they -- when we track the individual customers, they tend to visit Chipotle to a lesser degree when they're away from college than at college. So we are definitely seeing some normalization under the overall trends. And in the past, you've talked about an incremental margin framework. Maybe something like 35% to 40% would be normal. Obviously, the first half has been below that, particularly in the first quarter, maybe catching up to a bit here in the second quarter. With the four points of price that you're talking about, do you feel like you're going to be getting back to that incremental margin from here on out? That's right, David. In fact, that's exactly why we did what we did. We still have some additional going to see carry into Q3 for tortillas, dairy, packaging and some known increases related to beef that we've known for a while all those roll into Q3.
And really, what this allows us to do is, when we get up to this, we've talked about a $3 million average volume, and then our margin should be somewhere in the 27% range that gets us back to that kind of a situation. And the pass-through for every incremental sales dollar we get in should be right back to that 40%-ish flow-through that we've talked about in the past. Thank you. The next question will be from Sara Senatore with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Thank you. I wanted to ask about throughput and I know a lot has changed as we think about transaction baskets. But historically, you've given some estimates about peak-hour throughput. And I just wanted to see if you could give some context around where you are now, especially now that you have a second make-line, whereas previous peak would have been mostly the front make-line.
And is there a way to kind of quantify what improving throughput could do for transactions to your point about not losing people off the end of the line? Is there sort of a framework we can think about that says, one transaction per hour is equal to a point of comp or something like that? I'm just trying to understand as we think going forward, the guidance for transaction contemplates any improvement in throughput? Yes. I mean -- so here's one of the things that we have done because you point out that we've now got this multibillion-dollar digital business, multibillion-dollar in-restaurant business. We've separated out the metrics for the frontline and the digital make-line. And we've got very specific. On the digital make-line, it's about being on time and accurate. And on the frontline, it's about throughput. And we believe on that frontline, we can get back to where we were. Let's check, like 2014, '13, where we were in the high 20s, low 30s. On a 15-minute basis. On a 15-minute basis, that's what we're going back after. And that's why it's so important. We really kind of did this exercise back in 2019 and we're starting to see it pay dividends in kind of early 2020. And then, unfortunately, COVID hit. And so, we're confident that if we can get our team members to understand what it means to be, call it, rush-ready in their places and ready to go, there's no reason why we can't get back to those high 20s, low 30s on a per 15-minute basis. I don't know if we've talked about exactly how the transactions translate into sales… I don't know if you want to go that far. Well, here's what I would say about that, Sara. It's hard to tease through and find out when you increase. Let's say you move from like 22 to 27, okay, that's a 5-entree increase. As a perspective, each – every time you add by transaction, that's a percent of comp, okay, for that day. We're measuring the fastest 15-minute period.
So, what we believe is that when you go faster in 15-minute period, you're going to go faster in multiple 15-minute periods. So, the opportunity to add quite a bit of comp is there. But to Brian's point, we just need to get more reps. We have a lot of folks that really haven't been on the frontline. They haven't even managed a restaurant when we had the in-store business coming back the way it is today. So -- but we believe that there's definitely the opportunity to add some meaningful comp here. That's super helpful. Thank you. Sorry, just one follow-up on mix. Was there any sort of lower attachment or anything like that, or it's strictly the sort of lapping the order aggregation? No. I mean the only thing I would clarify on that, Sara, is there is a higher attachment rate to digital. And so when you see people move from digital to an in-restaurant visit, then you also see a return to less attachment. We also -- by the way, we are seeing higher drinks. The fact that we've got more people coming into the restaurant, we are seeing more drinks. And just to give you a perspective, about 40% of our transactions in restaurant included a drink. Only about 20% or slightly less than that of a digital transaction. So as we've seen this shift, there's been a positive shift as well but not enough to offset the lower group size. Thank you so much. The next question is from Jared Garber from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Thanks for – thanks for the question. I wanted to just ask about menu innovation. Brian, I know you mentioned that the Guajillo Steak is sort of past its stage-gate process and ready for launch, whenever that may be. But wanted to also get a sense if you could update us on the other item that's in test, which is the Mexican cauliflower rice and how you think about maybe more permanent menu item as a plant-based base for consumers over time. Yes. Obviously, we're very interested in that new way of eating. And I think we mentioned this in our earlier comments. We've invested in a plant-based company called Meati. And the idea is how can we continue to find plant-based items that are consistent with our food ethos, that also are delicious from a culinary standpoint.
So we've obviously done the cauliflower rices. We have the sofritas that's on our menu all the time. I'm optimistic that hopefully, we can find another center of plate or call it center of bowl solution that's plant-based, which we haven't done to date, right? It's really been a plant-based read. So the qualifier of these things have been more perceived as, I would say, a piece of your bowl versus the centerpiece of your bowl. And so that's what we're working towards. And I'm excited to see what we learn as we partner up with Meati. And obviously, our culinary team continues to work aggressively in this space. Thanks. That's helpful. And then just one follow-up on the throughput, which seems to be a little bit of the topic of the day. Is there anything similar across maybe either geographies or store bases that you're seeing throughput as more of a challenge? Maybe that's an urban thing or a suburban thing. Just curious what you guys are seeing in terms of any read across or tie-ins across the geography. Thanks. Yes. No, really, you're not seeing that. I'd say probably the experience is where we see the biggest difference. We have restaurants that are doing $6 million, $7 million. That team has been together for years. And when -- as soon as kind of all the COVID restrictions went away, they went right back to running Chipotles really successfully. And that's why we're so confident in so much opportunity in just getting people, the reps, getting them trained up on the basics and then, frankly, just for them to experience the success that they have by following these basics. So ultimately, what we're really after is the better throughput actually results in a better employee experience as well.
And we probably should talk about that a little bit more because our employees that are more successful -- and then obviously, they give a great experience to our guests. But yes, I'd say the biggest thing -- and fortunately, we have experienced managers all over the country, so we don't see any variability from like region or suburban, urban. It's more along the lines we just got to get more people trained up. Great. Thanks for the color. The next question is from Andrew Charles with Cowen. Please go ahead. Great. Thanks. Brian, can you talk a little bit more about how Chipotle plans to flex value in the menu in the current consumer backdrop as you run double-digit pricing while lapping what looks like about 10% price in the back half of 2021? I know earlier in your career, snacking and looking at the shoulder period between 2 and 5 PM was an opportunity. Is that something that you think applies to Chipotle just given the background for lower income consumers? I really believe the value proposition what we sell today is our strongest proposition. We looked really hard at this. When you look at a chicken burrito, steak burrito and you compare that to your alternatives, the value is there. And so if -- I think we execute great accuracy and being on time and we execute great throughput. That's our winning formula. That is the value proposition that wins. And that's why we're very much focused on executing our basics. The basics drive our value. So great culinary, customized, and then with Food with Integrity is a winning value proposition for all income levels. And my follow-up question is just on another one on culinary. Just talking a little bit more just around Pollo Asado and the ability to keep that on the menu. I know it's a higher margin, obviously, tested very well and it's done very well for you guys. Is the plan to keep that permanently? It's gone a little bit longer than a typical limited-time offer would run? No. The plan is not to keep it permanently. I think we've talked about this. Ideally, we like having menus two to three times a year. And if we get some that can carry longer, we stay with them longer. But that will eventually be coming out here in the next couple of months. And hopefully, we'll have some other menu news that gets people equally as excited. Looking forward to it. Thank you. The next question is from Lauren Silberman from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Thank you for the question. On unit growth, so on track to accelerate unit growth to 8% to 10%. Can you talk about what you expect with respect to cannibalization and just the trade-off between unit growth and comp? Yeah, Lauren. We measure the impact, and we don't see -- we've never seen impact go above a 1% comp impact. We've seen it go up to 0.7%, 0.8%, something like that. So it's still very, very manageable. And so every time we do a deal, we go through a routine where we have an algorithm where we measure what we think the impact is going to be. Our team does a really good job of measuring that. It's still an estimated part art, part science, but we look to do deals that are going to give us a superior after impact return.
So we're not looking to put restaurants right on top of each other and cause excessive impact, but there's just a lot of white space out there still. We -- with this idea of getting from 3,000 to 7,000 restaurants, we've modeled that after our three or four or five most end markets, and those are markets that we already have the density that represents what we would be on a national basis at 7,000 restaurants. And those restaurants are very high-volume and very high-return restaurants. Great. Thank you for that. And then just on potential AUVs, the AUVs are now running at 2.8 million, high end of restaurant peers. You've talked about the opportunity for increased throughput. 40% o f sales going through the secondary digital make-line. How are you thinking about peak AUV levels and where that can go? Is there a level where it makes more sense to open another restaurant? Yes. Look, I think one of the things that truly special about Chipotle is we are not capacity-constrained with our front line or our digital make-line. So I mentioned, right, there's restaurants doing $5 million, $6 million, $7 million. And obviously, it presents an opportunity for us to build a lot more restaurants without having really any meaningful impact. But I think it also just demonstrates the four walls that we're already running Chipotle has tremendous upside as well.
So I'm feeling really confident we're going to get past $3 million, and I'm sure we'll probably be talking about how we get to $4 million at some point. But I first like to get past the milestone of $3 million. We can celebrate that milestone. And the good news is I don't see any capacity constraints that would prevent us from saying $4 million is next up. Great. Thank you so much. And the next question is from Dennis Geiger from UBS. Please go ahead. Thank you. Brian, a quick follow-up on throughput question again. Is there anything else to stare on sort of that opportunity to get back by 2030 throughput for 15 minutes? Can you do that in the current staffing environment? And is it really more about training the ops initiative that you mentioned as well as the experience, I think, of the teams work there? Just trying to get a sense for how generally quickly gains can happen across the large system as we think about throughput kind of frame that up for us. Yes. Look, I think the good news is we have lots of opportunity to execute what we know are the basics of great throughput, right? Like -- unfortunately, I've gone into a lot of restaurants, and we don't have our expeditor in place. That is a key piece of the puzzle. And the good news is our operations leadership is very much focused on explaining to people how important that expeditor role is. Because if you're new, you could see why you would think of, maybe I can flex that person when, in fact, that's the last person you want to be flexing if you want to really achieve great throughput.
So look, the good news is staffing is not a barrier. Frankly, the barrier we have to get -- we have to overcome is getting people to experience what it's like to run a restaurant with everybody in the right place, doing the right role through a peak. And obviously, it will take a little bit of time, but that's something that we can train, people can experience. And like I mentioned, we saw a lot of progress on this when we did this back in 2019. So I'm confident, we can get focused and get the reps and then get the execution that then results in the comp growth. That's great. And then you spoke to this some, but I just wanted to ask a little bit more on resiliency, sort of your expectations for resiliency, increasingly difficult macro environment. The brand meaningfully outperformed in 2008, 2009. Obviously, you've been extremely resilient and brand strength over the last several years. But anything you could kind of highlight, maybe differences or similarities prior tough economic periods where the brand has outperformed? And just broadly, anything additional that you could add on sort of resilience for the brand from here? Thank you. Yes. Sure. Well, look, I think probably the thing that's common when you look back to what we're seeing right now is the strength of our higher-income consumer. That's a common factor. So even though the lower income consumer is slowing down, we've not seen that happen with our higher income consumer. And fortunately, for Chipotle, we over index with higher income consumers. And I think the other piece of the puzzle, too, is now we've got a database of, call it, 29 million, 30 million people, where we can hopefully be on the front-end of what is happening out there, so that we can hopefully pivot and communicate correctly with our customers. And what we've heard over and over again is our value proposition is probably our greatest strength, meaning terrific food or terrific culinary, unbelievable customization, if you want it digitally, it's on time, right, and it's accurate. And if you come into our restaurant, you love the customization and the speed of which you can get it.
So good news is it's a lot of similarities of what we've seen in the past. The one thing I know for sure is something will be different. So that's why I think it's important to talk about just how resilient the organization is to also handle whatever unexpected headwind we'll deal with. Thank you very much. The next question is from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Hi, thank you. Hopefully, a slightly different take on the throughput question. Is your throughput -- is it constrained, the 12:00 to 1:00 and 6:00 to 7:00, kind of the classic times that you used to be busy, or are there kind of pockets throughout the day, I guess, is kind of the first main question?
And secondly, if there are just certain hours where you're throughput constrained because of staffing, I guess, what is the store manager? What does the system do? I mean people obviously don't want to come in and work for an hour shift or even a two-hour shift. Does the brand have the flexibility? Does the model have flexibility to bring people in for four to eight hours to maybe cover a couple of busy hours? So just kind of walk us through, I guess, the practicalities of actually staffing that store, that front make line or the second make line, during those 15 minute windows as if you really are capacity-constrained? Yeah. Well, first, so we're not capacity constrained at 12:00 to 1:00 or 6:00 to 7:00 or 1:00 to 1:30. The good news is we've got capacity in every 15-minute increment. Now your question about how do you best deploy so that you have the right amount of people in place ready to go, that's really the reason why we've implemented this new labor tool. It's going to do just that, right?
So, it’s going to go ahead and say look at like this restaurant is slammed from 11:00 to 11:45. This restaurant is slammed from 12:00 to 12:30. This restaurant has a really big dinner business. So it takes into that account so that we deploy the right amount of people against those peaks. We're not capacity constrained. So if we can get the people at the right time in the right position, our throughput is going to go up.
For a second there, John, I thought you worked for Cronos. But… And just by capacity constraint, it's capacity constraint for given number of employees that you have on that given shift, not for the overall box itself. I get that. Okay, okay. Yeah, yeah. And that's exactly what this is supposed to help us address so that you don't end up with you're understaffed from 11:00 to 11:45 and you're overstaffed from 12:45 to 1:30. The idea is we get our people in the right places at the right time. So -- and that's the tool that we just rolled out. And now we're training against the tool to ensure people are in their place so that we can execute the maximum throughput we can in each of those 15-minute increments. And just to add on, Brian, the tool also recognizes like where is the business? Like how much is digital? How much is front line? Oh, yes. Good point, too. Our old tool wasn't as sophisticated. And so if one restaurant has 20% digital, another has -- like in our Chipotlanes have 55% to 60% digital. The staffing model is very different for those two things. So our ability to really put exactly the right people with the right skills at the right time throughout the day to drive throughput has never been better.
Now this is a brand-new tool. It's like learning how to drive a Ferrari. When you first get in the car, there's -- it's a very, very highly sophisticated tool. And so we're learning how to use that. But the capabilities are much higher than what our previous tool allowed. No, thank you for that. And if I can, obviously, this wouldn't be rolled out in the system unless it obviously went through the extensive operational stage-gate system. I mean how big of a pilot did you do for the system before you decided on the system-wide rollout? And how effective was it in that collection of pilot stores? Yes. Yes. So look, we've been piloting this for over two years. And we did really the bulk of the rollout for the last six months across our restaurants. So it's a new tool for our teams. The good news is it's not a new tool for our organization to manage, train against and get people to use it to its best ability.
Look, there is a change management process, though, in anything. No matter how good it is, sometimes people really like the old approach better even though the new approach is going to help them perform better. So we're going through the change management process as any organization would but the good news is we've done the due diligence on the front end so that as we learn things -- and we're dealing with 100,000 people. So I'm sure we will learn some things even beyond our pilot. We have the know-how, though, to pivot accordingly and maximize the tool. Thank you. And the next question will be from Chris O'Cull from Stifel. Please go ahead. Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. I had a follow-up on the value question that was raised earlier. It seems like a potential scenario could be where commodity prices start to ease, traffic continues to soften for the industry, and that would cause some change to be more aggressive with either price-led value promotions or even maybe new value menus to kind of reset their pricing. I'm just wondering how Chipotle might respond, if discounting or menu reset like that were to start to impact that value gap it has with the competitive set? Yes. Look, obviously, if our value proposition changes dramatically, we have to reevaluate how we're providing our customers value. I haven't seen it happen yet. And when you go back and look the 20-plus years of the company, the thing that drives the best value with our customers is this commitment to Food with Integrity, it is this commitment to culinary and then it's this commitment to getting you exactly what you want. So I'd be hard-pressed to believe we would want to abandon what makes us Chipotle.
And my experience as well as what I've seen in the company is our value proposition is very strong. So long as that is the case, we're going to keep doing what we know drives value with our customers. Fair point. Jack, I apologize if I missed this in the presentation, but can you speak to the level of inflation you're seeing in construction cost? And maybe describe some of the most common challenges you're seeing with hitting project time line? Yeah. The time line, it's a myriad of challenges. Sometimes it's permitting, sometimes it's contractor labor. Like if somebody has call-outs or exclusions because of COVID exposures that will slow down a deal as well, and then materials as well. I mean, some of the electronics, like for some of our HPC, walk-in coolers, things like that, have been a real challenge. So it's been a myriad of challenges.
The pipeline is really, really strong. That's what gives me great confidence that not only will we hit between the range this year. But when these things ease, our pipeline is still there and we'll be able to accelerate from there.
In terms of the inflation, it's at least in the several percent range, maybe even more than that. The deals have varied throughout the country, but definitely our investment cost this year are much higher than they have been in the past and higher than we expected them to be. Great. Thanks guys. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Brian Niccol for any closing remarks. All right. Thank you. And thanks, everybody, for joining and all the questions. Obviously, we're very proud of our results. I think it speaks again to the resiliency of both the Chipotle brand, all of our employees out in every restaurant, their ability to execute great culinary, great throughput. And I also think it speaks to the strength of our value proposition. So I know there's a lot of uncertainty out there. I said this in my earlier remarks.
The thing we spend our time on are the things that we can control, the things that we're certain about. And what I am certain about is Chipotle has got great people running restaurants that do food in a different way. And we continue to give people great access through digital and great throughput on the front line with good hospitality. I think we'll continue to be rewarded with more business. And we're proud of where we are, and we're really excited about where we're going.
So, obviously, we'll see what comes next, but I think we're ready. And we'll continue to do what we know how to do best, which is make great burritos, great bowls. And hopefully, we continue to delight our customers so that they come back over and over again. So thank you for taking the time and we'll talk to you all in three months. Thank you, sir.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Cindy Olsen, Head of Investor Relations and Strategy. Please go ahead. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call. By now, you should have access to our earnings press release. If not, it may be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.chipotle.com.
I will begin by reminding you that certain statements and projections made in this presentation about our future business and financial results constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current business and market expectations, and our actual results could differ materially from those projections in the forward-looking statements. Please see the risk factors contained in our annual report on Form 10-K and in our Form 10-Q for a discussion of risks that may cause our actual results to vary from these forward-looking statements.
Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found via the link included on the presentation page within the Investor Relations section of our website.
We will start today's call with prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer, after which we will take your questions. Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A session.
And with that, I will turn the call over to Brian. Thanks, Cindy, and good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter results demonstrated the resiliency of the brand and strength of our organization in managing through a difficult consumer environment along with the inflationary headwinds we have experienced over the past 18 months.
For the quarter, sales grew 14% to reach $2.2 billion, driven by a 7.6% comp. In-store sales grew by 22% over last year. Digital sales represented 37% of sales. Restaurant-level margin was 25.3%, an increase of 180 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted diluted EPS was $9.51, representing 35% growth over last year. And we opened 43 new restaurants, including 30 Chipotlanes.
In the third quarter, we continue to see a widening of trends by income level with the lower income consumer further reducing frequency. Fortunately, for Chipotle, the majority of customers are from higher-income households, which continue to increase purchase frequency. While it is difficult to predict the macro impact on future spending trends, we know our value proposition remains strong and we experienced minimal resistance to our price increase in the quarter.
To put it into perspective, our average chicken burrito or bowl, which makes up about 50% of our orders across the U.S., is below $9 in our restaurants. This is a tremendous value when you consider the quality of our food, including our food with integrity standards, the fresh preparation utilizing classic cooking techniques, the customization, generous portions and of course, the convenience and speed.
Our fresh preparation is particularly unique when comparing Chipotle to other restaurants. There are not many restaurant options that prepare their food fresh daily, and we do it in all 3,000-plus restaurants. Our restaurant teams begin preparation at 7:30 in the morning to be able to serve our delicious food by the time we open.
We only use 53 real ingredients, all of which you can pronounce and our dedicated employees prepare the food in our open kitchens using classic cooking techniques. This includes grilling Fajita Veggies and Adobo Chicken on the Plancha and mashing avocados to make our signature guacamole and making our chips fresh every day.
So again, when you combine all these elements, you get an industry-leading brand with a tremendous value offering. And our five key strategies will continue to help us win today while we create the future.
Now let me provide an update on each of these strategies, which include: number one, running successful restaurants with a people accountable culture that provides great food with integrity while delivering exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences; number two, amplifying technology and innovation to drive growth and productivity at our restaurants and support centers; number three, making the brand visible, relevant and loved to improve overall guest engagement; number four, expanding access convenience by accelerating new restaurant openings; and number five, sustaining world-class people leadership by developing and retaining diverse talent at every level.
First, starting with our restaurants. We remain focused on being brilliant at the basics, including staffing our restaurants with talented team members focused on the foundations of the business. These include having great culinary prepared and ready to serve, open to close in a food-safe environment, improving order accuracy and timing for the digital business and increasing throughput in hospitality for the in-restaurant business.
At the end of last quarter, we rolled out an updated training program called Project Square One, which includes training around throughput, digital execution, food quality and hospitality to deliver an exceptional customer experience. We've made some progress during the quarter, but we are not where we need to be. The capabilities of our teams needs to and will improve. Chipotle is a restaurant business with high standards, and we need to train and develop our teams so that these standards are met.
Additionally, in these uncertain times, it is critical that we treasure the guest, and this will be a primary focus of everyone in operations and across our company. With so much change over the past couple of years brought on by the pandemic, it has been refreshing to focus on the foundation which Chipotle was built.
We do see that our highest volume restaurants are meaningfully outperforming lower-volume restaurants in terms of throughput. What these restaurants have in common is experienced managers include that understand the importance of the foundations. As our newer restaurant employees go through the training and get more real-time reps, we believe we will see consistent improvement over time.
As we discussed last quarter, we continue to look for ways to enhance our tools and systems to support in-restaurant execution and improve the overall experience for our employees and guests. I am excited to share a pilot that we recently announced as well as an update on Chippy. We are piloting advanced location-based technology to enhance our app functionality and provide a seamless, convenient experience for our guests.
For guests who opt in, the program can engage with Chipotle app users upon arrival to our restaurants and utilize real-time data to enhance their experience with our order readiness messaging, wrong pickup location detection, reminders to scan the Chipotle Rewards QR code to checkout and much more. And I'm happy to share that Chippy is now in one of our restaurants, and we are excited to test and learn from the autonomous robot that helps our teams make tortilla chips, bringing up their time to serve and support our guests. Chippy is trained to replicate Chipotle's exact recipe to cook the chips to perfection, finishing with a hint of lime juice and a dusting of salt. Additionally, Chippy can make chips throughout the day, which results in fewer outages and improves freshness.
Moving to our branding, our Real Food for Real Athletes platform continues to expand as we rolled it out to football, America's most watched sport. The campaign focusing on athletes that love to eat at Chipotle as part of their training and lifestyle as it helps them to perform their best by providing proper nutrition through real ingredients. At the pearl level, we brought together The 88 Club for the first time in an ad with Dallas football greats who were the #88: CeeDee Lamb, Michael Irvin, Dez Bryant and Drew Pearson. The 88 Club TV ad premiered during Sunday night football and all of the athletes go-to Chipotle orders were featured in our app. Chipotle's 88 Club content achieved great engagement with millions of views across channels.
Additionally, at the college level, we took a local approach with the Real Food for Real Athletes campaign in Ohio, which is one of our biggest markets and where we have our largest restaurant support center. We partnered with Ohio State offensive lineman and running back TreVeyon Henderson, on an ad narrated by former Buckeye running back great Archie Griffin.
Tapping into the passion, the fans have for their favorite teams and game day excitement, the ad showcased TreVeyon's journey before he runs onto the field and was amongst our highest engaged videos in social media channels.
Shifting to LTOs. We remain comfortable with our cadence of one to two LTOs a year as it excites our guests and is driving both higher frequency and spend. As you may have seen, we launched Garlic Guajillo Steak in mid-September, which is an entirely new flavor profile featuring tender cuts or freshly-grilled steak with the bold flavor of garlic and guajillo peppers and finished with fresh lime and cilantro. In maintaining our relevance in the Metaverse, we premiered the Garlic Guajillo Steak to our community on Roblox where users could grill, season, cut and virtually taste the steak. The first 100,000 users who successfully completed the Chipotle Grill simulator, received a promotional code that can be redeemed in our restaurants. Again, showing our ability to blend the Metaverse with real life.
Complementing the Roblox experience, we also provided early access to our 30 million Rewards members as we continue to provide Rewards members with added value. While still early days, Garlic Guajillo Steak is getting excellent customer feedback and is driving a higher check as a premium protein experience. However, it is faced with the challenge of rolling over our highly successful Brisket program last year. As a reminder, Brisket ended in mid-November and the Garlic Guajillo Steak program will go through the end of the year.
Additionally, following the success of Pollo Asado, we began testing Chicken Al Pastor in Denver and Indianapolis. Chicken Al Pastor adds an exciting level of spice to guests' go-to orders. And if successful in the stage-gate process, it could be available for rollout in 2023.
Our next strategic pillar is expanding access, which is still a top request from consumers. We remain on track to open 235 to 250 new restaurants in 2022 and anticipate opening between 255 to 285 restaurants in 2023 barring any further delays in construction or equipment availability.
Our pipeline remains strong. And as these challenges ease, we are confident that we can get to the top end of our targeted 8% to 10% range.
In addition to expanding in our core markets, we remain excited about new opportunities, including Alberta, Canada and small towns in the U.S. We plan to enter Alberta, Canada in 2023 with our first location in Calgary. Alberta makes the most sense as our next market to open in Canada as it has two of the main cities, including Edmonton and Calgary, each with relatively large populations. Additionally, there is brand recognition as people from Alberta have visited Chipotle restaurants in British Columbia and Ontario.
In the U.S., our small town strategy is also performing very well. Overall, small town restaurants have comparable margins and returns to the company average, and we're excited about the growth opportunity, which is included in our 7,000 long-term restaurant target. I'm also proud to share that opening day sales for a restaurant in a small town in Texas was a new company record. I would like to express my congratulations and gratitude to the restaurant and development teams for making that one happen.
And speaking of teams, our purpose of cultivating a better world starts with our people. The importance of developing our people is paramount to running great restaurants as well as developing future talent to grow. I'm delighted that over 90% of our promotions are internal, and I believe we will continue to see that percentage go up. There are many examples of senior leadership roles that started out as crew members.
In fact, one story that particularly moved me was about our team in the Mid-Atlantic region, where our Regional Vice President, Team Director and Field Leader were all promoted from within the organization in March. Our RVP immigrated to the U.S. from Egypt and his first job was as a crew member in 2009. He is another person that has worked his way up from a crew member to Regional Vice President overseeing $1 billion in sales. For perspective, that would be the fourth largest company in Egypt.
His successor as Team Director immigrated to the U.S. from Palestine in 2017 with his first job as a crew member and now oversees a $200 million business. And finally, his successor is a field leader who is a woman, who immigrated to the U.S. from Ethiopia in 2015, who also started as a crew member and now oversees 7 locations totaling $20 million in sales.
Their perseverance is inspiring to many and a great example of how our growth and brand changes lives and communities for the better. Each of these individuals is also developing terrific talent that has the ability to become future leaders. For perspective, each year just in the United States and Canada, we have the opportunity to promote more than 1,500 managers to open our new restaurants.
In addition to career opportunities in industry-leading benefits, we also believe that communication between leadership and our restaurant teams is critical. We do this through several ways, including chitchats, where members of our executive leadership team meet with our restaurant teams to listen to their feedback. Through this feedback loop, we were able to identify that our teams wanted more educational benefits, which is why we implemented debt-free degrees and career certificates. And team members who have participated in our educational programs are 2x more likely to be retained and 6x more likely to be promoted. Supporting, developing and growing our people will remain a core focus for Chipotle and is key to growing to 7,000 restaurants.
In closing, I want to thank our employees for another great quarter. We remain committed to getting back to the basics and running great restaurants. I believe these actions will position us for strong performance in any environment and more importantly, is key to delivering an excellent customer and employee experience. I'm excited to see everyone back in our restaurants next week for our 22nd year at Boorito.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Jack. Thanks, Brian. Good afternoon, everyone. I want to start by reiterating Brian's commentary about treasuring our guests and earning every single transaction.
During past periods of economic challenges, focusing on our guests, getting the details in the restaurants right and providing a great dining experience has served as well. As Brian mentioned, this will be the primary focus of our organization and what we believe will lead to building an even stronger brand for the future.
Now moving to our third quarter results. Sales in the third quarter grew 14% year-over-year to reach $2.2 billion as comp sales grew 7.6%. Restaurant-level margin of 25.3% increased about 180 basis points compared to last year and earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $9.51 representing over 35% year-over-year growth. The third quarter had unusual expenses related to onetime employee separation expenses, corporate and restaurant asset impairments, corporate restructuring and our previously disclosed 2018 performance share of modification.
Looking ahead to Q4, our current comparable sales trends are choppy as we lap our Brisket LTO from last year and we expect our October comps will likely end in the mid-single-digit range. Assuming current sales trends continue, we expect our comps to be in the mid- to high single-digit range for the full fourth quarter as Garlic Guajillo Steak will be in restaurants through the end of the quarter compared to Brisket, which ended in mid-November of last year.
Earlier this month, we took a price increase in around 700 restaurants to address pockets of outsized wage inflation. Menu prices in each restaurant increased between 2% and 3%, which had a company-wide impact of about 0.5% overall. And I'll go through the key P&L line items, beginning with cost of sales. Cost of sales in the quarter were 29.8%, a decrease of about 50 basis points from last year. The benefit of menu price increases offset elevated costs across the board, most notably in dairy, packaging and tortillas. In Q4, we expect our cost of sales to remain at about the same level as the benefit from the menu price increases will be offset by higher beef, chicken, dairy and tortilla.
Labor costs for the quarter were 25.1%, a decrease of about 70 basis points from last year. This decrease was driven by sales leverage and somewhat offset by wage inflation as well as lapping the employee retention credit that we received in Q3 of last year. In Q4, we expect our labor cost to be in the mid-24% range due to leverage from our menu price increases as well as our premium price Garlic Guajillo Steak.
Other operating costs for the quarter were 14.5%, a decrease of about [60] basis points from last year. This decrease was driven by sales leverage as well as a decline in delivery expenses due to lower delivery sales, partially offset by higher costs across several expense categories, most notably utilities, including natural gas.
Marketing promo costs for the quarter were 2.2% or 20 basis points below last year. And in Q4, we expect marketing costs will be in the mid-3% range with the full year to come in right around 3%. In Q4, other operating costs are expected to be around 15%.
G&A for the quarter was $141 million on a GAAP basis or $136 million on a non-GAAP basis excluding about $4 million in employee separation and corporate restructuring costs and $1 million related to the previously disclosed modification to our 2018 performance shares. G&A also includes $115 million in underlying G&A, $21 million related to noncash stock compensation, a $1 million benefit related to the reversal in lower performance-based bonus accruals, mostly offset by payroll taxes on equity vesting and exercises. We expect our underlying G&A to be around $120 million in Q4 and continue to grow slightly thereafter as we make investments in technology and people to support our ongoing growth.
We anticipate stock comp will be around $25 million in Q4, although this amount could move up or down based on our performance and $1 million for costs associated with our field leader conference in early 2023 bringing our anticipated total G&A in Q4 to around $146 million.
Depreciation was $71 million, and in Q4, we expect it to increase slightly to $73 million. Our effective tax rate for Q3 was 24.4% for GAAP and 23.4% for non-GAAP, and both rates benefited from option exercises and share vesting at elevated stock prices. For Q4, we continue to estimate our underlying effective tax rate will be in the 25% to 27% range, though it may vary based on discrete items.
Our balance sheet remains strong as we ended the quarter with over $1.2 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments with no debt, along with a $500 million untapped revolver. During the quarter, we repurchased $107 million of our stock at an average price of $1,438 and we've repurchased a total of $628 million year-to-date so far. We increased our level of stock repurchases during the quarter when our share price fell with the market overall, and we will continue to opportunistically repurchase our stock. During the quarter, the Board authorized an additional $200 million to our share authorization program, and at the end of the quarter, we had $413 million remaining.
We opened 43 new restaurants in the third quarter, of which 38 had a Chipotlane, and we remain on track to open between 235 and 250 new restaurants in 2022 with at least 80%, including a Chipotlane. As Brian mentioned, we anticipate opening between 255 and 285 restaurants in 2023 with at least 80%, including a Chipotlane. Development delays remain a headwind, including equipment and construction material shortages, construction labor challenges as well as permitting, utilities and inspection delays. While we expect these challenges to persist into 2023, our pipeline remains strong, and we expect to move towards the high end of our targeted 8% to 10% openings range once these headwinds subside.
To conclude, we believe we have a tremendous growth opportunity ahead of us with room to more than double our current presence in the U.S. and Canada over the long term. We will remain focused on what makes our brands special. And that is our purpose of cultivating a better world, our food integrity standards, a strong unit economic model and of course, our talented and dedicated teams.
With that, we're happy to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from David Tarantino of Baird. I have a two-part question related to your pricing and traffic trends. So first, I was wondering if you could share what your transaction trends were in the third quarter and what the guidance implies for the fourth quarter? And then I have a follow-up related to that. Yes, sure. So in the third quarter, I think of transactions were down roughly 1%. A lot of the additional headwinds we've had with kind of the mix shifting as people return to their kind of normal course behavior has resulted in smaller group sizes. So that's kind of consistent with what we've seen. And then in the current quarter, obviously, we've got Garlic Guajillo Steak, launching right now going over top of the Brisket. And then I think as we mentioned, we're continuing to see some pressure on the low-income consumer. So we're still seeing transactions be pushed in that negative range. And obviously, we'll continue to keep an eye on it as we go forward.
Jack, I don't know if you want to add anything to that. Yes, just pricing during the quarter, Dave, we're running right around 13%, and that will move up a bit in the fourth quarter. So that's part of our guidance as well. I think the big thing in the fourth quarter to note is just Brisket was very successful last year, and we ran out of inventory in the middle of November. And so the comparison actually gets easier in the second half of the quarter. Great. That's helpful. And then my follow-up, Brian, is I think you're aware there's been a lot of concern about the pricing strategy hurting the traffic. And I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you're not seeing resistance to the price increases yet. So I just wondered if you could comment on, I guess, how you're thinking about your price position now and how you think about the traffic trends you're seeing and whether or not you think that you've seen any resistance. It doesn't sound like you think you are, but I guess the traffic being slightly negative, just wanting you to have a chance to address that. Yes. Sure. Well, I mean, look, the simple fact is the absolute price point in the business is still very competitive and frankly, very attractive relative to -- you look at regional players. The -- when you look at the fast casual competitors, we're anywhere from 10% to 20%, 30% less than what you see on their menu. So you've seen, unfortunately, in all this inflationary environment, everybody is taking price. So our costs, I think, are up over 20% over the last two years. Not surprising, other people are experiencing something similar and they've taken pricing accordingly.
So our relative position to our competitors or the alternatives for what you can get when you read out, really, we stayed in a really strong position. So that value proposition remains strong. And then when you look into the business, we're not seeing people all of a sudden not buying guacamole or also changing what they typically add to their order or switching between proteins. Things have stayed pretty consistent.
And then the last piece I'd add to that is if you go to the grocery store, there's a lot of inflation there, too. So if you think about all the places where you can get food, they're way up. And our relative performance in that environment is one where we're still a great cost opportunity, I guess, for the consumers, the way I would describe it. So getting a chicken burrito exactly how you want, at the speed at which we can provide with the culinary and the ingredients that we provide for roughly $9 or less. That's tremendous value. The next question comes from Nicole Miller of Piper Sandler. On that point of price, components of mix and traffic. Can you just talk about the price piece? So what is the art and science that you blend for the here and now? And how do you think about using that tool to protect margin? But then also long term, how do you exercise that pricing power or not against the long-term like unit opportunity, which I imagine really is requires affordability, right, appealing to the masses. So if you could talk about that a little bit, that would be great? Yes, sure. So I mean, that's exactly right, Nicole. The way we're trying to balance this is really only use price as the last lever to pull. And I think that's what we've done throughout the course of the last, call it, two years because we like having the strong value proposition, frankly. I like being in the position where we have the best culinary with the best ingredients and arguably the best price. And so it's a position of strength and it's a position we want to hang on to as we go forward.
The reality is in an inflationary environment, you're going to have to pull that lever. And that's why I think it's really important to look at how your pricing stacks up relative to people's alternatives. Those alternatives are either the grocery store or other restaurants. And when you look at those, our value proposition remains in a really strong place. So we're delighted to continue to see new units opening at a terrific opening rate. They're still achieving 80%, 85% of what our typical restaurants do. Our Chipotlanes continue to outperform. And then frankly, even in our small towns, we're continuing to see just tremendous opening.
So I think that tells me we're getting signals in all different fronts that our value proposition remains really strong whether it's a new restaurant coming to an area or an existing restaurant competing in an area that we've been competing in for a while. So that's the needle we're trying to thread. And as that applies to the fourth quarter commentary then, is that just price that's flowing from August into 4Q? Or could you speak to incremental price in the fourth quarter to get above that 13%? And is that essentially being used to protect margin, even though, I guess, you're really hitting that 25% profile or algorithm margin you'd be looking for? Yes, Nicole, there's actually three things that are going on when you move from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. First, we took our last price increase around August 1. So that hit part of the third quarter. So the rest of it, the fourth quarter is going to get a full hit. We also, on a very targeted basis, we identified pockets throughout the country, and there were 700 restaurants that had accelerating wage pressures. So if you look at what our typical wages are across the country and we took that very large 15% increase, we got everybody up to $15 or more in the second quarter of 2021, we have individual pockets in these restaurants that we identified that were going $1, $2 and $3 above what the rest of the country was doing. And that's just because the labor market was so tight there. So what we did, we just tried to up the menu prices just to cover some of that, not to get our margin back. But just to try to cover some of that, then ended up being somewhere between 2% and 3% in those 700 restaurants. That's about 50 basis points or so overall to the company.
And the third piece, Nicole, is we took our price increase in the fourth quarter of last year around that December 7, December 8, something like that, and that rolls off. So those are the pieces. So you'll actually see for the quarter, the pricing will bounce up a little bit before it drops back down in the first quarter. So it will move from 13% up closer to call it 14.5% or approaching 15% before it drops down to 11% in the first quarter of next year. Our next question comes from David Palmer of Evercore ISI. Two questions. The first one is a question on food costs that those costs are down under 30%. And obviously, that's well off where they used to be. I'm wondering if that's just all pricing net of commodity inflation? Or is there something else going on in there? For example, the fact that more is being made off the digital make line that's helping your portion sizes, your portion control or the rebound in beverages or something like that. I'm wondering if there's more than just price net of commodities and I have a quick follow-up. Yes, David, there's really -- there are two other things. One is, remember, we're pricing -- we've got higher menu prices for our delivery business. Our delivery business is about 17%, 18% of our business. And so we actually rest in charging fees. We charge virtually no fee. We charge $1 fee, then plus a small commission. So our menu prices are much higher there. So that gives you what appears to be a much lower food cost, all right? So you get a benefit on the food line.
The other thing when we talk about inflation over the last two years, food inflation has been about 20%, but labor inflation has been more like 24%. So any time we take price increase to cover labor when labor is inflating at a higher rate than food cost, again, you get some of that benefit in the food cost. So that's why it's under 30%. You're right, historically, we've generally not seeing our food cost under 30%. And just a follow-up, whether the weakness in the low end is -- pertains to your pricing or the fact that certain customers are getting priced out or not. I'm wondering what actions you think you have in your stable of potential tactics that you can deploy to correct that? Are there -- is this something where you really dial up the CRM and start doing tax to keep people sort of in the tent and keep their -- get people back in the flow again? How do you think you'll address that weakness, if at all? Yes. I mean, look, one of the things we're definitely evaluating is how do we separate these groups into understanding their current situation. And then what do we need to do to ensure that they can still have access to the Chipotle experience. And the team is hard at work in figuring out how best to use our CRM/rewards program to be very targeted with the different cohorts that we have. Some of it is obviously the low-income consumer. Some of it is also what they're interested in, whether it's having more access digitally or having a different experience when it comes to coming into our restaurant. So -- that's one of our key tools that I think that's one of the big advantages that we have, frankly, going forward is we've got this tremendous database that we can then smartly communicate with customers so that we're giving them relevant messaging that keeps them engaged with Chipotle. The next question comes from John Ivankoe of JPMorgan. The question was on Project Square and, Brian, you specifically mentioned in your prepared remarks that there is still more to do there. And I just wanted to get a sense or improvements that you could still make relative to how you're currently executing. I wanted to get a sense of how much of that is just giving the employees and the managers more time to work with the current system? I mean, is it just muscle memory that needs to increase? Or are there changes that you can make or would consider things like increasing staffing levels, increased pay, technology, what have you? Anything that you can do on your end that can, in the near term, improve some of the customer metrics that you're striving to achieve? Yes. Thanks for the question. Obviously, one of the things that has been, I guess, a breath of fresh air is we've now had the ability to get back to focusing on the basics of Chipotle. And obviously, it starts with great culinary and then it starts with great teams being trained and developing each other. And look, I think the other thing that we're now surrounding these teams with is technology to have more real-time information on the performance of the restaurant so that our field leader, our General Manager and our team knows either where there's an opportunity to be better or where there is success, let's put more energy to where that success is.
The fact remains, since January, we've got roughly 50% of our field leaders are new to the company. And -- I'm sorry, not new to the company -- new enroll, right? So 90% have been promoted internally. But we've got a lot of new people in the Chipotle business at new levels of responsibility. And so that's what Project Square One's all about is making sure if you're a newly promoted field leader, you know how to do the job. You're newly promoted General Manager, you know how to do the job. Maybe you're new to our company all together at the crew level, you know how to do the job. And over the last two or three years, we've had to flex based on different regulations coming at us for how we wanted to run the restaurants.
Now we're getting back to what we believe is the right way to run a Chipotle in an environment that allows us to execute our standards, our processes and our culinary. And so there's still opportunity for us to get better at it because the teams need more reps. But I think we're also surrounding them now with, I think, clarity on what the standards are as well as tools to give them clarity on how they're performing real time. And have you actually noticed any changes in your guest satisfaction scores? Or is that something that you're just trying to achieve internally? Yes. No. I mean we've seen improvements definitely in our in-store experiences. And I think that's a testament to folks getting back to the business of running the front line. We still have opportunities to get better on that digital business when it comes to accuracy, specifically. And it really that accuracy shows itself more in a delivery occasion but we're seeing evidence where we're continuing to make great progress. I think I mentioned this earlier, in our higher-volume restaurants where you have more tenured field leader, more tenured general manager, more tenured crew, they're really outperforming on all these metrics and their satisfaction scores are higher. Their volumes are higher, the turnover is lower. So we know when we get teams to stabilize have high levels of capability, we get great results. And that's what Project Square One is all about. It's just reestablishing those processes, those standards and then ensuring that people have the capability to deliver on those processes and standards. Our next question comes from John Glass of Morgan Stanley. Brian, can you talk about the efficacy of the LTOs you're running today versus a year or two or three ago? Is this driving incremental traffic? Or is this just like a check benefit, right, as people sort of purchase these new, but you're not really driving as much in terms of new customers. I guess where I'm going with this is you're on kind of a treadmill now of sorts, right, where you have to continue to innovate to make sure that you're covering last year's promo. Is there an off-ramp to that? Do you think about ways to broaden or differentiate promotions beyond just protein differentiation into other things that might help you as you start to -- eventually, you're going to have a protein that doesn't do as well as the year ago then what? Yes, sure. Look, this is something that, obviously, we evaluate. But I don't think of our business is relying on one thing. When we are executing, like for right now, we're doing Garlic Guajillo Steak. I think there is incremental business to be had because we have better throughput, better execution in the restaurant. There's incremental business to be had because we have better digital execution. And then there's business to be had because we give people some menu variety. And then frankly, in this environment, you're dealing with some macro headwinds on a lower income consumer.
So I never really think of this as -- it's just one thing to lap the prior year. I think of it as like how are we growing our brand every month, every year, every day. And that's why I think one of the advantages Chipotle has is we have these layers of business that continue to grow with us. Obviously, we've got some macro issues that we're dealing with between inflation and the challenges in the lower-income consumer. But I think our strategy still has a lot of growth in them, and it's not one is overwhelming the other. Can I just clarify when you made the comment about traffic and the dynamic between mix and more people are coming back to the restaurants? Shouldn't that benefit traffic and maybe to the detrimented mix? I think you made the comment that, that was impacting traffic. But I would have thought that would have been a positive to order accounts even if it was hurting mix. Do you see it that way? Or do I have that wrong? Go ahead, Jack. Yes. The main mix we're seeing, John, is group size. So as we're seeing customers kind of return to more normal habits, so it's less digital more in-restaurant. And even in the in-restaurant channel, there's a slight decline in the group size. So what's happening, what seems to be happening is people rather than working from home and going with like family, for example, we're bringing dinner home for their family. They're kind of back to eating more on their own as an individual that they might be out with a group of 4 people, but they're all paying for their own lunch. So the group size across all the channels and then because there's still a shift moving from digital to in-store. The group size is the biggest mix thing that we're seeing. And that ends up meaning we're selling less burritos per transaction. So it's got a negative mix impact. But a positive traffic impact? It does have a positive traffic impact. That's right. The next question comes from Danilo Gargiulo of Bernstein. So I would like to understand a bit more whether the demand and the comp is coming from mostly new customer acquisition versus essentially like improving on the throughput in your high-volume stores. Well, so we definitely have -- as we look at our data, at least in the digital space, we have an understanding of new customers versus -- and as we define a new customer that hasn't been at Chipotle in the last year. And we continue to see that group be highly represented. Where we're seeing the most gains in frequency is what not surprisingly, our more heavy user. And so that continues to be the case -- that's one of the things I think that the digital business fit for us. If you go back three or four years ago, one of the big surprises for us is it really attracted a lot of new users. And then obviously, during COVID that ramped up quite a bit because of our digital business growing. So we continue to stay focused on bringing in the new user, but we also have an equal effort on how do we get more frequency out of our medium and heavy users. Got it. And then one more question. I know you mentioned there is a comparable level of margin between the kind of small town store versus the kind of the urban store. I wonder if you can also like compose for us kind of the high-level economics. And if we were to talk about pricing versus traffic, are you seeing any major differences between the urban stores versus the small town stores? Yes. I mean just at a very high level, the small town restaurants, on average, I mean, we've had some barn burners that are breaking records in terms of sales. But in terms of as a group, all of our small town restaurants are a little bit below what our average restaurant would be, so maybe by $150,000 or so. But the cost structure is more favorable in the small town. So our margin, actually, even though it's kind of smaller volume is actually higher. The investment costs tend to be lower as well. So the cash and cash returns in these small towns are stronger than what you're seeing in a typical average Chipotle.
Now if you go back to urban, urban is still, if you're talking about real central business district, those restaurants are still not all the way back. They're much better and they're outcomping the nonurban locations. But if you go all the way back to 2019, they still have not quite kept pace. And so the urban restaurants, they tend to have higher cost of doing business. They tend to have higher rents. And because the volumes aren't keeping pace with the nonurban locations, those are under a little bit more pressure. But again, they're out comping their non-urban cohorts. So we think give enough time that hopefully will come all the way back. The next question comes from Dennis Geiger of UBS. Brian, wondering if you could highlight the biggest opportunities a bit more from a transaction perspective. The -- you mentioned kind of running slightly negative in the quarter. I mean, quite frankly, all most all brands are running negative transactions right now. And so you guys actually look fairly solid relative to the industry. But I guess in looking ahead, curious if you can just highlight some of the bigger levers that support transaction growth rest of the year and into '23. I know you just commented that it's not one thing. But just in thinking about the throughput, the innovation, dining room traffic can still improve, thinking about the macro improvement. Just wondering if there's any more detail on kind of unpacking that and kind of how you think about transactions improving again from here? Sure. I mean, look, obviously, one of the biggest opportunities for us is to make sure our restaurants are staffed and trained. And I think Jack mentioned this, we still have pockets of areas or we're still battling that very challenge. And I think as long as we have the ability to attract people and use obviously all of our benefits and purpose of the brand. But at the end of the day, you have to make sure the wage is attractive and retain people. So the ability to keep these restaurants staffed, have the teams fully trained and then executing against our standards, I think there is a lot of transaction opportunity in that, both on the frontline as well as in the digital business. And doing both of those things really well. I know there is upside in the business going forward. I think we've made tremendous progress coming out of kind of the COVID challenges and then coupled with the labor challenges and the inflationary environment.
So we're in a position of strength, but I think we can be a lot stronger and better going forward and that will manifest itself, I think, in some additional transactions in a tough environment. That's why you hear us talking about, hey, look, we've got to treasure every guest because we got to get it right, because it's going to be a tougher environment for the consumer going forward. So that's a big opportunity without a doubt.
And then obviously, we'll continue to take advantage of our CRM tools, our marketing capabilities to continue to keep people engaged and hopefully loving the brand so that they want to come as well.
The other thing I should mention, too, is we're going to open a lot of restaurants in the fourth quarter. just the fact that we're going to be opening more restaurants gets us more new users and gets people to have more experiences with Chipotle, which continues to build on itself a positive kind of vibe for a growing vibrant brand. And people like to work there, people like to eat there. So we're going to keep pushing that path forward too. The next question comes from Sara Senatore of Bank of America. I wanted to just ask a little bit about your customer base. It's kind of a two-part question. The first is that among -- in smaller towns, you're talking about kind of lower volumes. Typically, I think of those as a slightly lower income cohort, but we spent a lot of time talking about low-income consumers. So I just wanted to see if you could kind of reconcile those and whether this means something different about your value proposition in small towns.
And then the other piece is just thinking about your marketing campaigns and emphasizing athletes and gaming. Could you talk a little bit about who your customer is? It seems like it's mostly targeting younger men, although I'm either young nor a man, so I can't speak to that from personal experience, but maybe just talk about those two components. Yes. Well, look, the first piece, just on the consumer. We continue to overindex with young people. It's pretty evenly split between males and females. We do have a little bit of a skew towards higher income. But when we talk about that SKU, we're really talking about north of $75,000. And we want to be showing up in the places that are a part of culture. So I mentioned Roblox, which is obviously a Metaverse type initiative. I mentioned athletes, which is, I think, just another way of talking about selecting the right nutrition for the performance you want to achieve.
So you got to think about these things as like how do you make sure you're staying relevant in culture and how do you both follow culture and then at times lead culture. And that's what we want to be doing. We know there's a lot of power in being with young people, and we're always going to be figuring out ways to stay young. That's not to say that we don't have all age groups eating at Chipotle. We do. But we like the idea of having a position of strength with call it, the teen to 20s and then also a position of strength with the higher income cohorts. So that serves us really well. That's going to be some of this continue to be a position of strength.
As far as small counts go, I mean, we're seeing tremendous success in these small towns. And that's why I think it's important to remind ourselves when we're talking about higher income, we're talking about $75,000 or higher as an overindexing. It's not to say that we don't have people that earn less than $75,000 coming to Chipotle as well. And I think when you demonstrate great culinary, great ingredients, great speed, great customization and people decide how am I going to spend my $10. It's hard to beat Chipotle in that equation. So I think that's why we continue to have units open very successfully, small town, urban, suburban. We're having a lot of success as we open new units, and we're continuing to have a lot of success within the four-walls of the units that we currently have opened. So we like the composition of our customer, and we like the economics that come with it. The next question comes from Andrew Charles of Cowen. Brian, I wanted to come back to your comment on the layers of business you're evaluating. And I know you noted continued confidence in Chipotle strong value offering, but with greater concern around the lowering consumer and your concerns on the consumer in the coming months from a macro perspective. Could we see this manifest in focusing more on the snacking occasions or perhaps offering more value during shoulder periods when restaurants are underutilized? And then I have a follow-up question. Yes. Look, I mean what we've really spent a bunch of time on is looking at what happened in the last kind of recession or slowdowns. And the good news for us is, yes, you had some low-income consumers step away, but we also had higher income consumers trade into our business. And then as economics improved, all cohorts came back to the business in a big way. So we didn't lose those that came in and we regained those that unfortunately got hit by some tough economic headwinds. So we're not going to be chasing with discounting in the traditional sense. We are going to use targeted CRM initiatives that we know get a great return and also play a meaningful role in the consumer that receives that message.
So we've seen it work in the past. We believe it will work going forward. And I think, the key thing for us to do through this whole period is execute our basics really well. That's our strongest point of differentiation. Our strongest point of differentiation without a doubt is our culinary, our ingredients, our customization and our speed. We do those things really well, we'll be rewarded with people's business. Very helpful. Jack, just with October disclosure running around mid-single-digit comps. Can you talk about the scenario where you would hit the high end of 4Q same-store sales? The entirety of that driven transactions were to accelerate? Or is there a scenario where you'd look to take pricing in December similar to past years practices? No. Andrew, when we provided that guidance, we did the -- basically, the analysis and the forecast, it's really all about Brisket. The idea here is that we've got Garlic Guajillo Steak through the entire quarter. And Brisket was very, very successful. But then we ran out. We ran out in mid-November. So when we look at what's going to happen in the second half of November and then as we move into December, those comparisons alone getting easier, give us the confidence that we can get to -- we think we'll move up. That's why we kind of range-bounded the guidance from the current trend we're running today, which is mid-single digits, up to high single digits because we do think that easing of comparison is going to lift our comp. But we don't have any incremental pricing into that guidance. The next question comes from Jon Tower of Citi. Two questions, if I may. First, Jack, I was wondering if you could talk about the total cost basket or buckets that you're looking at for 2023. Obviously, right now, we're seeing some commodities come off the boil and food prices are more favorable than where they were just a few months ago. So I'm curious how you see those persisting into 2023. And then more importantly, on the labor side of the equation, how you see that playing out 2023 versus 2022? Yes. It's tough to predict. I mean, in the last year, if you took a look at anybody's crystal ball, nobody really had this figured out and a place just kept coming and coming and coming. It does seem like things are getting closer to stable right now. The areas that I would say there is more upward pressure would be in terms of beef, in terms of our cooking oil. I mean that's still significantly affected by the situation going on in Ukraine and Russia because so much of the oil that we use comes from that area. And then tortillas as well is another area that we're concerned about.
Chicken, we feel pretty good about. We do have contracts for chicken. And so we feel good about that. Paper and Packaging, that's driven significantly by the cost of freight because most of the packaging comes from overseas, from Asia. And it looks like some of the crazy freight costs that we've been paying in the past are easing.
Dairy has been elevated, and so we're optimistic that there will be some additional supply into next year. So there's kind of some pluses and some minuses. Overall, what we're hoping is for mostly stabilization. So if some of the softening in commodity costs can offset some of the pressure we're seeing, especially in beef and cooking oil, and if we could break even for a while and not have to see either margins degrade or have to consider another price increase, that would be fantastic to be in that position for a while. And then just on labor? Labor is unpredictable because we thought it was settling into this normal kind of mid-single-digit range, and that's what I'd like to say. And yet as we did analysis, we found these 700 restaurants. So it's about 1/4, a little more than a 1/4, a little less than 1/4 in a restaurant that we're having to take $1, $2, $3 increase in starting wages just to make sure that the restaurants were staffed. So with what the Fed is doing, you think that the higher interest rates is going to have an impact on the labor market. And so that would be good news in terms of access to labor. But it's a bit of a well cut. Right now, if I had to put a stake in the ground. I would say the inflation expectation would be kind of mid-single digit but there's going to be a caveat to certain pockets throughout the country that we're going to have to do what we have to do. To Brian's point, to make sure those restaurants are staffed. We can train people and we hold on to them once we get to my board. Great. And then just on the comment regarding return to or a chance to get the 10% unit growth over time. I know in the past that the big governor of growth has been human capital, it doesn't sound like that's necessarily the problem any longer. It sounds like it's more related to development headwinds on equipment, construction material, et cetera, and construction labor challenges. So what sort of lead time do you have on that potentially improving? Meaning, how quickly could you ramp that growth if you started seeing, say, all of those things improve? Yes. I mean, the inventory is there. So we've got inventory right now that could get us close to, if not all the way to that 10%. But what's happened is two, 2.5 years -- like before the pandemic, we can open up a restaurant from the time that we go see a site, we like the site, we start serious negotiation to when we get that restaurant open, it could be a 14- or 15-month period. We're now looking at 20, 21, 22 months. So I mean it's a significant increase, and it's because of all the factors that I mentioned in my prepared comments. So the biggest challenge we've had is, frankly, supply. I mean, if it's components, for example, for a walk-in cooler or the HVAC, you can't get the restaurant open. There's just no chance of doing that.
So if we see some easing in the supply chain for the materials and the components that we need for the restaurant, that all by itself could knock off a couple of months. But then there's also construction labor. There's also permitting. And so we really need kind of all of those things are themselves. But our ability to get the restaurant to open on more of the time line we saw a few years ago was there as long as the rest of the piece is falling into place. The next question comes from Jared Garber of Goldman Sachs. Brian or Jack, I wanted to just get an update maybe on some of the labor and efficiency tools. I know you talked about it a little bit earlier, but I think on the last call, you had given some more specific updates on the throughput where you are sort of today versus where you were maybe historically and during your peak throughput years. So if you could give us an update maybe on where you are on that and how you see that going forward? And maybe a time frame of how you expect or when you expect maybe to get back towards those pre-food safety levels? Yes, sure. So right now, we're running in kind of the low 20s on that [max 15th] measure that we've been talking about. The thing that's nice to see though is in our higher-volume restaurants. Those guys are running now in the high 20s. So if you go back to like 2019, we think there's a real possibility for us to get the entire system in the mid- to high 20s. And then obviously, as we've talked about this many times, when that starts happening, everything around it starts going up too. And -- so that's what we're after. That's why we're making sure that we've got these restaurants staffed. They're getting trained and that the culture is focused on the standards and the processes that we know result in great throughput, which ultimately means great experiences for our guests. And I guess, if I could just follow up, is there a way to maybe frame how -- what the traffic trends look like in some of those higher volume stores where you're seeing better throughput versus those lower volume stores just to contextualize it a little bit better? We'll just check. We've said every like 4 points, 5 points. Every five transactions gets you a point of comp. Every five transactions -- there it is. Every five transactions is a point of comp. So that's the way to think about it, Jared. Yes. And Jared, the higher-volume restaurants, they have not just higher volume, they tend to out comp. They tend to be much more predictable. But to Brian's point, they tend to also have more tenured management teams, more tenured crew. So they don't just have the reps in a few of the team. I mean the entire team has been attacked or been with Chipotle for quite some time. So that's why we're pretty confident that if we can get all of our new folks from field leader through the management ranks and into the crew, just get them more reps and more experience. They gain a lot of confidence. They gain skill, and we know the throughput numbers are going to go up. That concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference over to the Chairman and CEO, Brian Niccol for any closing remarks. Okay. Yes. Thank you. And thanks for all the questions. I appreciate all the conversation on pricing and value. Obviously, it's front and center for us as we navigate kind of the most recent challenges.
The one thing I just want to reiterate is the proposition as it relates to value for Chipotle remains very strong, no matter how you look at it. Whether you look at it on a relative basis to what's competitive pricing look like or you look at it to alternatives like with the grocery store, whether you look at it how new units are opening and how we're performing on that front. But we continue to demonstrate in all areas that the Chipotle brand is strong, and we continue to have a really strong value proposition.
The other thing I just want to emphasize is the focus on having our restaurants staffed, trained and executing against the standards that we know provide a great experience for our customers and our employees is what Project Square One is all about. And the teams are focused on achieving it, which we know then will result in better throughput better experiences for everybody involved.
So the combination of, I think, these five strategies we've talked about with the focus on Project Square One and keeping a close eye on our value proposition, I think, sets us up for a very long runway of growth, and we couldn’t be more excited about where our future is headed. And obviously, we'll deal with the headwinds accordingly.
So thanks for everybody for taking the time. And we'll talk to you next quarter.","the third quarter results conference call is being recorded . if not, it may be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.chipotle.com . we will start today's call with prepared remarks from Brian Niccol .",0.0

And with that, I will turn the call over to Brian. Thanks, Cindy, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered another year of strong results in 2022, expanding AUVs and restaurant-level margin despite facing one of the highest inflationary periods on record and an uncertain macro environment. These results demonstrate Chipotle's resiliency driven by our talented teams, delicious food made fresh daily, convenience, customization, and of course, our tremendous value. For the year, sales grew 14% to reach $8.6 billion driven by an 8% comp. Digital sales represented 39% of sales. Restaurant-level margin was 23.9%, an increase of 130 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted diluted EPS was $32.78, representing 29% growth over last year, and we opened 236 new restaurants, including 202 Chipotlanes.
Turning to the fourth quarter. While we are pleased with our overall growth, our results were impacted by a few factors that were unique to the quarter, including a lower-than-expected benefit from garlic guajillo steak and a headwind from loyalty accounting. For the quarter, sales grew 11% to $2.2 billion driven by a 5.6% comp. In-store sales grew by 18% over last year. Digital sales continue to represent 37% of sales. Restaurant-level margin was 24%, an increase of 380 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted diluted EPS was $8.29, representing 49% growth over last year, and we opened 100 new restaurants, including 90 Chipotlanes.
Our transaction trends improved throughout the quarter as we lapped brisket, and I'm pleased to report that our underlying trends have further improved entering 2023, with transaction trends turning positive. For the first quarter, we anticipate comps in the high single-digit range. Our focus on getting back to the basics and running great restaurants is beginning to pay off, and we plan to further emphasize this in 2023. Additionally, we will continue to build upon our five key strategies that will help us to win today while we create the future.
Now let me provide an update on each of these strategies, which include: number one, running successful restaurants with a people-accountable culture that provides great food with integrity while delivering exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences; number two, sustaining world-class people leadership by developing and retaining diverse talent at every level; number three, amplifying technology and innovation to drive growth and productivity at our restaurants and support centers; number four, making the brand visible, relevant and loved to improve overall guest engagement; and number five, expanding access and convenience by accelerating new restaurant openings.
Beginning with our restaurants. As we discussed on the last call, Chipotle is a restaurant business with high standards, and it is critical that we treasure the guest and delivering an exceptional experience, including great culinary and in-restaurant execution. During the pandemic, there were unforeseen challenges, such as supply outages, staffing challenges and exclusions from COVID that resulted in a need to create workarounds. We have been eliminating the workarounds and reestablishing operational standards with Project Square One while continuing to build a culture of excellence in every aspect of our business. This means ensuring all ingredients are in stock, that our teams are fully staffed and properly deployed during peak periods to drive throughput, that our delicious food is prepped and cooked on time, that we are improving throughput on the frontline and improving on time and accuracy on the digital make-line; and of course, that we are delivering exceptional customer hospitality. Project Square One has helped to lay the foundations, including training in each of these areas. We are also bringing back more shoulder-to-shoulder training.
One thing that I believe everyone has learned from the pandemic is that virtual training is not the only tool needed. So we are reducing the amount of virtual training and bringing new crew members into our restaurants sooner for on-the-job training. This helps to accelerate onboarding and gives more confidence to our new crew members as they are learning by doing. Shoulder-to-shoulder training by experienced managers is an essential process. I'm also happy to see an improvement in turnover with December being one of our best months in the past two years for both hourly and salary turnover rates. And our staffing levels continue to improve with 90% of our restaurants fully staffed. This, combined with better stability, leads to more experienced teams.
When you combine this with Project Square One training for the past two quarters, positive signs are emerging across the operation. We are focused on operational excellence and have intensity and collaboration to achieve it, great people and great culinary drives performance. And speaking of great people, I'm proud to share that in 2022, we promoted over 22,000 people, surpassing 2021, and 90% of all restaurant management roles were internal promotions. And we have tremendous growth ahead. In 2023, to open our new restaurants, we will have the opportunity to promote over 1,800 hourly manager roles, over 255 GMs and over 40 field leadership positions. And these numbers will continue to grow as we expand our restaurants by our targeted range of 8% to 10% per year.
As we have said in the past, our goal is to be the employer of choice. In addition to career advancement opportunities, industry-leading benefits and competitive wages, we will continue to look for ways to improve the overall experience for our teams. We know one way is to continue to invest in technology and innovation. There are a couple of new stage gate initiatives that I'm excited to share along with an update on improvements to our app functionality. First, we are currently testing a new grill to improve the overall cooking process for our chicken and steak. The grill is much faster and has consistent execution, which lowers the learning curve significantly. Importantly, we believe it maintains our high culinary standards and can cook the chicken and steak to perfection. We look forward to further validating it through our stage gate process.
And second, you may remember that in the second quarter, we announced Hyphen as one of our first investments in our Cultivate Next Fund. Hyphen is a food service platform that automates the assembly of meals on the digital make-line and could help fulfill our promise to deliver on-time, accurate orders for our digital guests. This would allow our restaurant teams to focus more on our in-restaurant guests on the frontline, further improving throughput. I'm thrilled to share that together with Hyphen, we are developing our first automated digital make-line prototype, which we will test and learn on, and we expect to have it in our Cultivate center in the first half of this year.
Speaking of our digital business, it is over $3 billion in revenue and represents 39% of our sales, and we're constantly looking for ways to improve the experience for our guests. Last quarter, we started testing advanced location-based technology to enhance our app functionality. For guests who opt in, the program can engage with Chipotle app users upon arrival to our restaurants and utilize real-time data to enhance their experience with order readiness messaging, wrong pickup location detection, reminders to scan the Chipotle Rewards QR code at checkout and more. The results from the stage gate process were very encouraging, including an improvement in delivery speed, a reduction in customers going to the wrong location and an improvement in the experience for our rewards guests, allowing them to quickly scan for their rewards points without impacting throughput. As a result, we rolled it out nationwide last month.
Moving on to making our brand more visible, more relevant and more loved. Our Real Food for Real Athletes platform has been a success as we partner with athletes of all levels who are fans of Chipotle and focus on helping them perform their best by providing proper nutrition through real food and real ingredients. During the fourth quarter, we teamed up with U.S. Men's National Soccer Team stars, Christian Pulisic and Weston McKennie to showcase their journey to soccer's biggest international tournament while featuring the athletes' go-to orders in our app. We also continue to leverage social media to remain relevant with our consumers, especially Gen Z. This year, we surpassed 2 million TikTok followers, which to put into context rival some of the largest brands in the world and we were the first brand to launch on the new social media platform, BeReal.
Shifting to menu innovation. As we mentioned last quarter, 2023 will consist of one to two LTOs. I'm delighted to share that Chicken Al Pastor has been validated and ready to be rolled out in the near future. This new menu item is operationally simple to execute while still providing a new exciting flavor that drives transactions and sales. We also recently launched a new lineup of Lifestyle Bowls that cater to contemporary wellness habits of Gen Z and millennials. The lineup spans a wide range of healthy habits such as our Balanced Macros Bowl, our High Protein Bowl and our Grain Freedom Bowl. Lifestyle Bowls are a great way to show our customers that they can create balanced meals made with our existing ingredients that taste great and that they feel great eating.
Turning to our Rewards program. In 2022, we increased our rewards members by 20% to 31.6 million. Our program continues to get more sophisticated as we better understand who our members are and serve them with relevant content, targeted offers and gamified badging to help drive transactions. In 2022, 60% of our rewards program promotions were personalized, and we plan to increase this going forward. To drive engagement and enroll new members, we recently introduced Freepotle, which offers each rewards member 10 personalized free rewards throughout the year.
Our fifth strategic pillar is to expand access, and our development team has done an outstanding job of navigating headwinds such as material shortages and permitting and inspection delays while successfully opening 236 new restaurants in 2022, including 202 Chipotlanes. In fact, we opened 100 new restaurants in the fourth quarter, which was a record for the company. We also opened our 500th Chipotlane during the quarter as we expanded access and convenience through our unique digital drive-through format, and the performance of Chipotlanes continues to be strong. In fact, since we began opening Chipotles in 2018, our new restaurant productivity has improved by about 1,000 basis points. We plan to open 255 to 285 new restaurants in 2023 with over 80% including the Chipotlane.
Within our 2023 expansion plans, we will accelerate new restaurant growth in Canada and continue to open restaurants at a measured pace in Europe. In Canada, we have built out a strong local field leadership team that works closely with our U.S. team to ensure best practices and a consistent culture, while adapting to local needs. We are now ready for accelerated growth and plan to add around ten new restaurants in 2023, which will be the fastest development growth rate since we entered the Canadian market.
We also remain encouraged by the performance in Europe despite a challenging macroeconomic backdrop. In 2023, we plan to add a few additional locations in the UK, and we are also rolling out our digital capabilities to further expand access. We remain optimistic about the growth opportunity, and we will continue to update on Europe's progress of the stage-gate process along the way.
In closing, I want to thank our restaurant and support center teams for another terrific year. Our focus on getting back to the basics is starting to pay off. Our teams are energized, and I'm excited to see further progress over the coming quarters. We have a long growth runway ahead with the ability to more than double our restaurant count, grow AUVs beyond $3 million and expand margins. I believe we have the right team and strategy in place, and we will remain focused on meeting the standards of excellence that make Chipotle, Chipotle.
And with that, I will turn it over to Jack. Thanks, Brian. And good afternoon, everyone. Sales in the fourth quarter grew 11% year-over-year to reach $2.2 billion as comp sales grew 5.6%, which included about an 80 basis point headwind related to our loyalty program. In Q4 of each year, we reevaluate the estimated loyalty breakage for points that will expire. And this year, we decreased our estimate due to higher member engagement.
Restaurant-level margin of 24% increased about 380 basis points compared to last year. In addition to loyalty program headwind, restaurant-level margin was impacted by a higher level of sick pay and medical claims in the quarter compared to our expectations. Earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $8.29, representing 49% year-over-year growth. The fourth quarter had unusual expenses related to legal expenses, our previously disclosed 2018 performance share modification and corporate restructuring.
Turning to our sales outlook for 2023, as Brian mentioned, we've seen the transaction trends turn positive as we remain focused on delivering a great guest experience. January comps were in the low double digits. For Q1, factoring in momentum we've seen quarter-to-date as well as tougher comparisons as we move through the remainder of the quarter, we anticipate comp sales to be in the high single-digit range. While it's difficult to forecast comps for the rest of the year, considering economic uncertainty, including the possibility of recession, we expect comps to moderate as we lap menu price increases in early Q2 and the middle of Q3.
I'll now go through the key P&L line items, beginning with cost of sales. Cost of sales in the quarter were 29.3%, a decrease of about 230 basis points from last year. The benefit of menu price increases and lower avocado prices offset elevated costs across the board, most notably in dairy, tortillas, beans, rice and salsa. In Q1, we expect our cost of sales to be in the high-29% range due to higher prices across several items, including queso, salsa, spices and oil.
Labor costs for the quarter were 25.6%, a decrease of about 80 basis points from last year. The benefit of sales leverage was somewhat offset by wage inflation in addition to higher-than-expected sick pay and medical claims. For Q1, we expect our labor cost to improve slightly, but remain in the mid-25% range, due to seasonally higher employee taxes as employee taxes start the year at an elevated level due to resetting of wage caps.
Other operating costs for the quarter were 15.7%, a decrease of about 60 basis points from last year. This decrease was driven by a decline in delivery expenses due to lower delivery sales as well as sales leverage, partially offset by higher costs across several expenses, including natural gas and maintenance and repairs.
Marketing and promo costs for the quarter were 3.4%, 20 basis points below last year. In Q1, we expect marketing costs to be in the mid-3% range with the full year to come in around 3%.
In Q1, other operating costs are expected to be in the low 15% range.
G&A for the quarter was $135 million on a GAAP basis or $129 million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding $4 million in legal expenses, $1 million related to the previously disclosed modification to our 2018 performance shares and $1 million related to transformation expenses. G&A also included $119 million in underlying G&A, $18 million related to noncash stock compensation, which includes a reduction in the estimated payout levels of our performance-based stock awards and was offset by $8 million reduction in performance-based bonus accruals.
We expect our underlying G&A to be around $121 million in Q1 and continue to grow slightly thereafter as we make investments in technology and people to support ongoing growth. We anticipate stock comp will be around $25 million in Q1, although this amount could move up or down based on our performance and is subject to the 2023 grants, which are issued in Q1. We also expect to recognize around $7 million related to employer taxes associated with shares that vest during the quarter and $2 million for costs associated with our field leader conference in February, bringing our anticipated total G&A in Q1 to around $155 million.
Depreciation for the quarter was $74 million or 3.4% of sales. And for the full year 2023, we expect it to inch up slightly each quarter as we open more restaurants. Our effective tax rate for Q4 was 26.3% for GAAP and 25.1% for non-GAAP. And for 2023, we continue to estimate our underlying effective tax rate will be in the 25% to 27% range, though it may vary based on discrete items.
Our balance sheet remains strong as we ended the quarter with $1.3 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments with no debt, along with a $500 million untapped revolver.
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $199 million of our stock at an average price of $1,487. And we repurchased a total of $827 million in 2022, which was the largest amount ever repurchased in a single year. We increased our level of stock repurchases during the quarter when our share price fell with the market overall, and we'll continue to opportunistically repurchase our stock.
During the quarter, our Board authorized an additional $200 million to our share authorization program and at the end of the quarter, we had $414 million remaining.
We opened a record 100 new restaurants in the fourth quarter, of which 90 had a Chipotlane. And we remain on track to open 255 to 285 new restaurants in 2023 with at least 80% including a Chipotlane.
Development delays remain a headwind, including utility installations, permitting and inspection delays, construction, labor challenges, and component and raw material shortages. While we expect these challenges to persist into 2023, our pipeline remains strong, and we expect to move toward the high end of the 8% to 10% openings range once these headwinds subside.
To conclude, we're off to a strong start in 2023 with early signs of progress from our focus on getting back to the basics of running great restaurants and treasuring our guests. While we cannot predict how the macroeconomic environment will play out over the next 12 months, we will continue to strengthen our operations and work hard to earn each and every customer visit.
I want to thank our restaurant teams and our restaurant support teams for all their hard work this year and for their commitment to Chipotle.
With that, we're happy to take your questions. Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will be from David Tarantino from Baird. Please go ahead. Hi. Hi, good afternoon. I have a couple of questions about your commentary on traffic trends. I think Brian, you mentioned that underlying traffic trends have turned positive if I heard that correctly. So I'm wondering what you meant by the word underlying if you're making some adjustments to that. And I know January had a lot of puts and takes with respect to the comparison against Omicron last year, and then perhaps we had some favorable weather this year. So I'm wondering, it seems like you're linking some of the traffic progress towards some of your internal initiatives. And I'm wondering how you're adjusting for some of the factors that maybe were outside your control. Yes. So, first of all, underlying just means transactions. There wasn't anything there. So, thanks for asking for the clarity. And basically, what we saw is as we exited the quarter, our transactions turned positive, and then we saw that continue to build in January.
You are right, there was some Omicron and then there were some good weather. But what we've also seen is our staffing is at the best it's been. Our turnover is at the best it's been in two years. And I think the combination of focusing on the basics, meaning no menu deactivations, keeping the lines open, both our frontline and digital make-line from open to close, teams deployed correctly, is also a key driver in why we're seeing the traffic progress in January throughout that whole month.
So we're feeling good about where we are operationally. We believe we can still get even better as we get closer and closer to our infamous burrito season. But it's a great position of strength that we're walking forward from. And we like how we exited December and we like how January shaped up. Great. And if I could just ask one follow-up on the operations, I'm wondering if you could maybe elaborate on what metrics other than transactions that you're focused on and how those are progressing? And what you think maybe the ultimate target for those should be as you progress through the year or maybe work towards your goals there. Yes. Sure. So I'd like to put a little color on this, menu deactivations in our digital business. Obviously, during the course of the last couple of years, we've had a lot of supply chain challenges, and one of the workarounds we created was allowing teams to deactivate certain items, right, so whether it's clock or chips or anything on those lines. And we've kind of just reestablished with both our suppliers, our distribution partners and our teams that that's not a fallback position anymore.
The expectation is – I don't know. Can you hear me, David? I can. Thank you. Okay. The expectation is you should be in stock, and then you should be prepared from open to close with those items. So there were points and times during that quarter where we had hundreds of menu deactivations, and now we're back into the single digits on how that's going. So that's a key metric.
Another key metric would be our digital on-time percentage. That's improved by nearly ten points. And so I think that's a function again of being deployed correctly, staffed correctly and then obviously, having the ingredients you need in order to build the order correctly. And then we've seen some progress on throughput as well on the frontline. And I anticipate really where we'll see big movement on throughput is more towards the second quarter, when we get into kind of more of our peak performance, and that's why you saw us focus on hiring so many additional people.
So there is a lot of good indicators beyond just the traffic trends that we've seen. I always like to start with, hey, if you got more stability, your teams are deployed correctly, they are trained correctly, and then we keep it very focused on the basics of running the restaurant, we know we get good outcomes. Great. Thank you very much. And the next question is from Sara Senatore from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Hi, thank you. I have a follow-up on labor and staffing and then a quick one on the new units. So just on the labor piece, I guess, could you help me reconcile? I think you’ve been saying mid-single-digit wage inflation, and I think you had something like 15% price on the menu. So were those hours coming from what you were talking about like the sort of shoulder-to-shoulder drop training? Or is that 90% staff – 90% fully staffed, is that a lot higher than it was? I just trying to think about as we look forward to the year if the late there should be more labor hour investments. Yes. Well, I think what we’ve been referring to more often than not is just the absolute wage that we’re paying and then what that inflation subsequent with that has been. The stores, fortunately, are – we keep track of an at-model metric. And that’s what we’re referring to, where we’re closing on 90% of our restaurants being at-model.
In regard to the shoulder-to-shoulder training, that’s just part of our process. And I think there was an element at some point where we’re maybe getting too reliant on virtual training versus the shoulder-to-shoulder training, meaning our field leaders, our team directors also need to be in the restaurants doing shoulder-to-shoulder training with our general managers and our new crews. So that should not result in any additional labor cost with having more shoulder-to-shoulder training. But Jack, I don’t know if there’s anything you want to add to that. No. No, I think that’s right, Sara. And we don’t think we need to have incremental investment in labor for the training, because the best training is, you put your teams in position. You have somebody that’s chosen what to do and you have somebody that’s watching them to kind of self-correct along the way. So it shouldn’t be extra labor per se. Now when we hire 15,000 people, there’s going to be some additional training. But I don’t think it’s going to be anything that you’ll see will blow up the labor line on the P&L going forward at all. Okay. So, just as we’re thinking about kind of the labor, there’s still room, I think, what you’re saying for improvement on just the restaurant-level margin line is the new comp? Yes. Definitely. Okay. And then just quickly on the new store productivity. Could you clarify that sort of there, it’s 1,000 basis points better? Is that because the Chipotlanes open at higher volumes than non-Chipotlanes, and so it’s just sort of comparing the different models? Or is there something else going on where across the board, new store productivity is better? Thank you. Yes. Sara, I’ll take this. I think it’s really more based on the Chipotlanes. Because if you look over the last four years or so, you got to look over a longer period of time to look at all the opening, we’ve moved up our productivity. So for example, today, our restaurants open up on average around 85% of what our existing comp stores are doing. If you look back three years or four years ago, we were in kind of the high 70% range or so. So there’s been a step change. And the biggest thing that’s happened from the three years, three and a half years ago to today is we’ve moved from having just a handful of Chipotlanes to having the majority of our portfolio is Chipotlane.
And we still – when we look at what our Chipotlanes are doing, the 85% compared to 15% without a Chipotlane, they continue to outperform that non-Chipotlane cohort. So, we think the main driver is the Chipotlane and the convenience that our customers find with that digital drive-through. Thank you so much. The next question will be from David Palmer from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Thanks. I wanted to ask a question about digital orders. I’ve been somewhat surprised by the level of decline there. I think back in the third quarter, we estimated that digital traffic per store decline in the mid-teens. That’s including both delivery and pickup. Maybe you can comment on where you think that was correct, but also how much you think digital traffic per store declined in the fourth quarter. And just relatedly, what are your thoughts about that channel? I know it’s important to you. What’s your outlook for it? And are there things you can do to stabilize that line? Thanks. Go ahead, Jack. Yes. I’ll get started, David. Listen, there’s a couple of things that are driving it. One is, we’re having a surge in return to in-restaurant. And so that part of our business is growing very, very healthily throughout the last year and a half or two years since we’ve been moving away from the pandemic. But secondly, delivery has been declining as well. Delivery transactions in the fourth quarter declined 15%, and that’s I think just again a normal kind of move away from people getting out and about. And I think there’s probably some people who are deciding that while that channel adds a lot of convenience, there is a higher price that comes with that. So those are the two main drivers.
And we figured that digital would kind of settle in this high 30% range. And so we’re at 37% range now. So it’s within the range that we thought we would be in. And early on in the pandemic, we saw our two markets that were the least affected, that’d be the Southeast and the Southwest. When they were starting to normalize, they were normalizing towards that high 30% range. So it feels like about the right range for us. So is your view that you’re going to start to kind of lap the second quarter, things really step down? Or do you think you’re going to enjoy that comparisons when it comes to digital orders and start to stabilize on that channel, and then perhaps enjoy some of the benefits you’re talking about with throughput on the front make-line? Is that – is your belief that you’re going to get a dual benefit there? Yes. That’s right, David. I mean the way we think about it is, we feel like we’ve reset the delivery business to be now where it makes sense economically. And as such, our order-ahead business, I think, has started to show the right trajectory. And then obviously, our in-store business has shown tremendous acceleration. So, I think you said it well. Thank you. The next question is from Andrew Charles from Cowen. Please go ahead. Great. Thanks. Jack, I have two margin questions for you. There’s obviously a lot of noise in 4Q. Labor cost was 1Q guidance for labor. And I’m curious what the impact of higher expected sick claims have in 4Q. And then I missed the term, but there’s some external factors that you’re betting within the mid-25% labor margins. Can you just help tease us out in terms of what that impact is from that external factor?
And then my real question is that if we zoom out and fast forward to when you get the $3 million sales volumes, what’s your level of confidence in achieving 27% restaurant-level margins relative to what you might have said a quarter ago if the sales structure has obviously been up and to the right and you’re rapidly getting towards that target? Yes. So let me start with the fourth quarter. Our expectations were that our margin would be more in the 25% range rather than the 24% range. And when you look at the pieces of how we got down to 24%, part of it was the loyalty breakage. Frankly, there was an 80 basis point change year-over-year in the comp related to just that journal entry that we had to book for the breakage. If you look at just the – there was 30 basis points of additional or reduced breakage that we had to reflect this year, that cost us 20 basis points on the margin. It was 60 basis points on – we saw higher-than-expected medical claims and sick pay during the quarter as well. We typically do see those things pick up a little bit in the fourth quarter and especially in December. But it – the surge was more than we expected. That’s not something that we would expect to recur.
And then sales softened during December as well. I think that went hand-in-hand with softer retail sales. We know there was some weather and a seasonal shift in the holidays and things like that. And that was 20 basis points, 30 basis points or so. So, we look at that margin in the fourth quarter. And we think if those things normalize, there is as much as 100 basis points or so that we can get back. We don’t get it back all at one time, but we definitely think we have the potential to do that.
So with that in mind, if you’re looking at more of that high 24% and that 25% range on a normalized basis, then we are confident that as we move from the current volumes on a menu price-adjusted basis just over 20 – $2.7 [ph] million up towards that $3 million, the flow-through that we know our model provides will still get us to that 27%. And can you just clarify – I’m sorry, you said sales were a bit softer than you guys expected in December. But I think earlier in the script, you guys talked about how there was improvement through the quarter. So was that just a reflection that December didn’t perform to the level that you guys were really expecting? Yes. I mean, listen, the way I would describe the quarter, we started out soft and we talked about that in October that we were doing a mid-single-digit comp, that GGS, while there was an attachment rate that was as expected, it wasn’t driving transactions. So, we started out soft in the quarter. We picked up as we stopped comparing against brisket. That was in the middle of November. So we had, call it, high single-digit comps for a while. And then we lapped the menu pricing increase from December of 2021.
And then just as we got around the holiday, we just didn’t see that pop, that momentum that we normally see in – so December. So the way I would describe it is, frankly, we started the quarter soft and we ended the quarter soft. Now what we’re happy about is, as the holidays – we got through the holidays and we got into January, that’s where our transaction, not just from a comparison standpoint but just on a trend month-over-month, really did improve. And so we feel good about where we go from here. But yes, listen, the fourth quarter was a tough quarter for us. Thanks for the color Jack. Next question will be from Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer & Co. Please go ahead. Thank you. Thanks for the question. As you move throughout 2023 and you lap some of these large menu price increases as the year progresses, would you think about replacing them with some type of increases, albeit probably a lot more normalized, more lower price increases? Or do you plan to let these fully roll off? And Jack, as you sit here today, what do you anticipate the total pricing factor to be for the full year 2023 for the same-store sales model? Yes. So, I mean I’ll start with that and then we can talk about expectations. We’re running right now in that kind of 9% to 10% range. And as I mentioned, it rolls off early in Q3. And then in – I’m sorry, early in Q2 and mid-Q3. And then there were a couple of delivery adjustments, target adjustments in there as well. We’ll end up being somewhere in that kind of mid-single-digit because by the time you get to the end of the year, we’re running basically zero pricing. So overall for the year, it will be somewhere in that kind of mid-single-digit. In terms of pricing action, we're not going to take a price increase just to cover a lap over last year. The main thing we're going to do is we're going to want inflation, and we're going to hope that inflation is tame.
Right now, we know that there is some pressure on a few of our ingredients. Beef is the one that we keep hearing about. We haven't seen it yet, but everyone is predicting that there's going to be greater supply versus demand. But we'll watch that carefully and see what inflation does. But it's going to be more about inflation and wages, inflation and ingredients and do we need to take pricing action to cover some of that, but I – we wouldn't take a price increase just to cover a comp lap. That makes sense. And just a clarification on the same-store sales guidance for the first quarter. I know you've talked a lot about traffic flipping positive here in January. But if we just hypothetically land in that high single-digit range for the first quarter, what do you think mix and traffic would separately be in that build if it kind of played out how you thought? Yes. I mean, right now, we're running, call it mid-single-digit positive traffic. We expect for the quarter, that guidance range assumes that we're also going to be positive transactions more in the low-single-digit as we move away from Omicron. Pricing will be that 9% to 10% range that I mentioned. And then there's going to be a mix component. We think it's kind of probably be in that low maybe 2-ish, 3-ish percent something like that. Mix is a little harder to predict, but those are the main components. Great. Thank you. Thank you. And the next question will be from Jon Tower from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Great. Thanks for taking the question. Quick clarification on the question. On the new store productivity, I know we talked on this a little bit earlier. During the quarter, was there anything about timing where – based on the way that we can calculate it looks like the productivity of the stores might have been a little bit lower than the normal. And I don't know if that's related to timing or something else. That's kind of the clarification.
The question is then on thinking about the Garlic Guajillo Steak, it didn't live up to your expectations. Curious if you could dissect that and give us a reason as to what you might have missed. I know it hasn't been that long, but curious to know how it didn't perform versus your expectations and why you think that happened? I'll let Jack answer the first one on the store productivity, and then I can chime in on the... Yes. You hit the nail on the head. We opened a record 100 restaurants during the quarter, but it was very, very back-loaded. Our teams did a great job of just scratching, clawing and doing everything that they could to get the restaurants open. And I think we probably had a record opening in the month of December as well. We had more than half of the openings or in the last month of the year. So yes, you're not – you didn't see a typical sales flow-through, considering we opened 100 restaurants. Thank you. And then on your question about Garlic Guajillo Steak. Look, I think it's one of those things where we tested it in a very different environment than when we rolled it out. And as a result, we got the check benefit, but we didn't get the transactions. And it also had the challenge of rolling over brisket, which was arguably one of our best-performing menu items that we've done to date. But we'll continue to analyze that we make sure we learn from it going forward and that's why we use the stage-gate process so that we are always learning. Thank you. And our next question will be from Sharon Zackfia from William Blair. Please go ahead. Hi. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask a question about staffing and the lower turnover that you're seeing. Is there a way to kind of compare and contrast tenure on the frontline now versus 2019? And if we think about throughput opportunity as we enter high season, I mean, how much is the frontline because it is less experienced kind of lagging where you were in 2019 or dimensionalize kind of how – how much throughput opportunity is really on the table here as you have more productive frontline staff? Yes. Look, thanks for the question on this because I think this is an important one, which is what we know is when we have our teams at model and deployed correctly with leadership present for shoulder-to-shoulder training, our restaurants perform and that's what we saw in 2019, and that's what we anticipate occurring going forward.
So we know there's upside in how much throughput is our teams are capable of doing. And obviously, we're targeting to get those throughput numbers back to where they were in, call it, the 2019-time-period. The one thing that's nice is our turnover levels have dropped. So we're getting more stability in the teams, which means they're getting more reps. So that as we walk into these higher-level or higher-volume months, they've got more reps and being deployed correctly, working together correctly to ensure that we get more throughput. And that's what we're focused on is the people that we have today, how do we get them trained, how do we get them deployed and then how do we make sure those teams stay together. Yes. And Sharon, just to add, when we look at the timing position back to 2019, and there's two factors here. One is turnover. The other one is promotion rates as well, but when your turnover slows down, people are going to be in their position longer. In for example on the kitchen manager, we're very close to where we were in 2019. So the average tenure in the kitchen manager role was like 0.69, meaning it was about eight months or so. Today, it's like 0.64. So it's like maybe seven, 7.5 months something like that.
In apprentice, we're not quite back to 2019, but we're ahead of where we were a year ago, and we're in striking distance again. So those are areas that we were seeing that our average tenure was going down during the high-turnover period of the last year – year-and-a-half or so. But those numbers appear to just like with the turnover be stabilizing and moving back up. Thank you. And the next question will be from John Ivankoe with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Hi. Thank you. I know you've been working on a number of different automation or technology practices in the store that could potentially reduce the demand for labor and also make you efficient and perhaps more consistent in some ways. So I was just hoping you could take a few minutes or a few seconds and just kind of talk about some of the different packages that you have. How far along they are and when you – we actually might be able to start to see some benefit, even if it's on a limited basis at a market level? Thank you Yes. Sure. So probably the one that's closest in is the new grill work that we've got going on, which I mentioned in my earlier remarks. It just gives our teams a tool that allows them to cook the chicken, frankly just perfect every time and a lot faster, significantly faster. And the same thing goes for steak. And we're actually moving that from a one-store test now to a multi-store test as we speak. So we're excited about that one. Obviously, we're working on an automated digital make-line, which is in partnership with Hyphen. And we'll get the first one of those into a real live prototype in our Cultivate center probably end of this quarter, early in the next quarter. So that one's a little bit further out.
And then we just got rolling with a live pilot on the, what we call Chippy, which is our automated arm or robotic arm to fry chips. And – so I have much more information on that as that goes live in the one restaurant. So I'd say the one that's probably close in is the grill, and the ones probably furthest out probably is our digital make-line – automated digital make-line. But all these are really promising because when you can significantly reduce cook times and then make the practice of grilling chicken and steak easier, good things happen with our culinary, and that's what we've seen in the one restaurant. People are giving us feedback that the steak and chicken taste great. Our team members are giving us feedback that they love using the new grills, and so we're more consistent with great culinary, everybody wins. Thank you. The next question will be from Dennis Geiger from UBS. Please go ahead. Thank you. Just first wondering if it would be possible to give the traffic mix price for the 4Q? And then the question is really about pricing – another one on pricing. Just curious if you believe you've seen any customer resistance to pricing levels, how that's kind of shaped how you thought about the pricing that you talked about for the year. And related to that, any kind of update on value scores, the low-income customer that you spoke to last quarter, anything as it relates to shaping your view on how the business performs into a potentially tougher macro? Thanks guys. Yes. Sure. So look, we really have not seen any meaningful resistance to our pricing, especially as it relates to our in-store experience. Obviously, the delivery channel was down, but I think that's a function of a couple of things. One, you do have to pay a premium for that occasion, combined with that the in-store experience is back and people are back out and about. So potentially, they see the convenience, the customization of coming in the restaurant and getting it on kind of their control terms.
We continue to see the higher-income consumer, the individual that earns over $100,000, coming more often. And frankly, I think the same thing would have happened with the low-income consumer regardless of what the pricing was that we acted on. And we made the decision not to go chasing people with discounts. That's not what our brand is, and that's not what we're going to do. We're better off winning the value gain through great culinary, great speed/convenience, terrific customization, and we know that continues to resonate. Our value scores continue to be really strong.
If you look at people that I would say are comparable that are in the fast-casual category, we're still at 10% to 30% discount. So look, I think we've made a lot of really good moves to kind of move with the challenges that we've had to deal with. And as a result, I think we're seeing stronger operations, stronger teams. And we're seeing, I think that work come out to bear in January and where we are here in February.
So Jack, I don't know if there's anything to add to that. No. I think you said that perfectly, Brian. And just – I think you were looking for the components in the quarter. The components of our pricing was about 13.5%. Transactions were down about 4%, mix was down about 3%. So that gets you to an underlying comp about 6.5%. And then we had the journal entry that deals with breakage, and that was 80 basis points. So that gets you to the 5.6% comp. Great. Thank you guys. And our next question is from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Please go ahead. Great, thank you very much. First question is just on the restaurant margin. I know for full year 2022, you ended in that 24% range, though you talked about maybe some headwinds in the fourth quarter that brought that in below expectation. Just wondering, if you can give any specific thoughts as you look to full year 2023. I know you gave some color specific to the first quarter, but as you think about the environment going forward, your pricing perhaps rolling off by the end of the year and what you know today based on kind of the key cost pressures.
And just wondering your thoughts on the full year 2023, whether it’s reasonable to assume or return to 25% plus in 2023 or beyond. I know you mentioned getting to more like 27% when you hit the $3 million, but just wondering kind of on the interim what you’re thinking specifically of the 2023. Yes, I mean, it’s so hard and the reason we gave, some color on the first quarter, but not beyond that is we don’t know what’s going to happen to the economy. We think inflation will be reasonably tame. Hopefully that will come true. And we don’t, we haven’t made any decisions on pricing action right now. So Jeff, the way I would think about it is we’re going to kind of let the year play out. We’re going to do everything we can in terms of managing supply chain, managing as we recruit people we’ve got to pay the wages to, make sure that, we gear up for burrito season.
We’ll watch how the inflation element plays out. And we don’t have any plans right now to take pricing action. So we might be, more patient this year than we were last year. The inflation kept coming at us, and then we could see more ahead and we take pricing action, we see even more ahead. It doesn’t feel like it’s, at that fever pitch. So I think, you could see us being more patient this year. What I can tell you is when things do normalize, whether that’s later this year or into 2024, we absolutely have at these kind of volumes, the ability to get a margin up into that 25% range on a sustainable basis, and then it’ll grow from there.
I just don’t want to make any promises on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Just because so many things has happened – have happened in the last several quarters, and it’s hard to predict what’s going to happen, but I do know that our model is intact. Understood. And I’m just following up on a couple of bigger picture topics. I think, Brian, you mentioned that international growth’s going to be at, I think you said a measured pace. I’m wondering if the headwinds, to your point about the economy in Western Europe perhaps, is the primary reason why it’s measured or maybe there are other causes for concern. Anything around that international acceleration and when the timing of that might be would be great. Thank you. Yes, sure. So obviously Canada its full steam ahead, right? We’re opening; I think the most restaurants we’ve ever opened from a percentage standpoint and probably absolute standpoint ever in Canada which is really exciting. And those economics continue to perform really well. When you look at Europe, look, the top line is really performing. And frankly, we’ve been much more patient on pricing there because we want to make sure that people have the experiences with Chipotle. So, there’s a lot of inflation that we’re still dealing with in Europe. But look, we like what we’re seeing; the good news is feedback on the experience is really very positive. Feedback on the culinary is very positive, and the most recent restaurants that we’ve opened are performing really well.
So, we’re just taking our time with it because unfortunately, the last three years have not been normal in any way. So we just make sure we aren’t getting any false positives or false negatives on any part of the business. So the good news is we’ve got a tremendous growth runway in the United States that we can be, very patient with how we approach our international expansion. But look, the early signs are people like burritos and bowls and they like our culinary and they like the convenience and they like the speed. So that’s a recipe for a lot of opportunity down the road. Thank you. And the next question is from Danilo Gargiulo with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Great, thank you. So if I understand correctly, the traffic improvement you’re seeing seems to be standing primarily from productivity and operational improvement also as you are moving along in 2023. But I’m wondering your expectations on the demand side from consumers and in particular, whether you are seeing or expecting any trends that could be possibly offsetting the productivity and operational improvements as we are moving along in 2023? No, look, the consumer demand, especially if we use kind of our in-store experience right now looks to be there. Especially as you look at the higher income consumer, their purchase frequency has actually gone up. So, we fundamentally believe that better we operate, the better our performance will be. And that’s why we’ve got, Scott and the team have a full court press, frankly on, great people, great culinary. If we do those two things against our operating standards, we believe we’ll continue to make progress on throughput and we’ll continue to see the gains that hopefully, we’ve experienced in the first part of this quarter. Thank you. And I think you also mentioned there are some positive signs that are emerging from Project Square One. I was wondering if you can elaborate on that one and maybe like share a couple of metrics, where you’re particularly proud of. Yes, look I mentioned this earlier obviously one of the things that we’ve seen is a lot less incidents of many deactivations. So when you go to order online, all the products are available chips, guac, chicken, steak. That is dramatically decreased. And we know that’s a big deal because when you order online, if you don’t have what you want available your conversion rate goes down. And so we’ve seen when we have the products in stock, our conversion rate gets back to where it should be.
We’ve also seen a huge step up in our on-time percentage, on-time in a meaningful way. And then we’ve also already seen some progress on throughput, albeit small movement, but I think that has more to do with the time of year than a testament to the impact of Project Square one. What I also think is also really great news is we have more stability in our teams than we’ve had in over two years, and we’ve got more teams at model with less turnover, and I think Scott’s got these teams focused on deploying correctly and getting trained shoulder-to-shoulder, so that they’re ready to go when the rush shows up. Thank you. And our final question today will be from Brian Harbour from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Yes, thank you. Maybe first just a question on delivery, are you able to see in your data that those customers have shifted to coming into the stores or mobile order-ahead, or do you think those customers have basically fallen off as you’ve seen that business decline a little bit? What it looks like to us is we’ve definitely seen people make a shift in restaurant and then some shift to order ahead. That’s probably been the biggest trends that we’ve seen. Obviously the premium especially when you operate in our white label execution is one of those places where you can quickly compare, like what’s the difference between ordering delivery versus ordering pickup. And that’s an obvious one where I think we’ve seen as a result, people they toggle between the two and then they choose order ahead.
So yes, we’ve seen people stay committed to the idea of getting Chipotle. I’m sure there are those customers where if something’s, free somewhere else for delivery, they might take advantage of a freebie. But look, we’re not interested in renting or borrowing customers. We want people to be a part of the Chipotle business because the value proposition is right for them, they buy into, the food that we provide, the culinary that we provide at the convenience and speed at which we provided. So that’s been a conscious choice, and I think it’s going to serve us well in the long run. Okay. And maybe just a related question on kind of some of the new perks that you rolled out, the Freepotle that you launched in January. I mean, is it your view that, that drives kind of a step up in frequency or how else do you think it’ll affect customer behavior? Is there any margin impact of that? And then I guess, also you, it sounds like you’ve seen kind of mobile ordering stabilize, but do you want that to grow as you go into the next couple of years and do you think this can kind of be a catalyst for that? Yes, look it’s doing two things. One, it’s hopefully keeping more people engaged in the loyalty program. We’re only what, one month in on it. And then also acquiring more people into the rewards program. And so it looks really promising that it’s doing exactly what we’ve want it to do. But again, it’s only one month in. And what was your second part of your question? Just if you think that, that’s kind of the, the next catalyst for driving greater, more order penetration. Yes, look, what we definitely know is when people are engaged in our rewards program, we get more purchase frequency out of them. And the most engaged people come through our digital business when it comes to our rewards program. So I do think the combination of, high engagement with rewards specifically around the amount of personalization that we’re doing here, will result in more frequency out of customers down the road. And usually, that comes via a digital experience is where you see more of the impact from the rewards program. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Brian Niccol for any closing remarks. Okay, thanks. And thanks everybody for all the questions and being a part of the call. Obviously, 2022 was another one of these years where a lot of unexpected things occurred. But I do think once again, we’ve demonstrated the resiliency of Chipotle and the power of our food with Integrity purpose combined with the culinary and convenience that we provide. Again, we were able to expand our AUVs our margins. We had a record number of store openings in the fourth quarter. And, we’re optimistic about where the business is today because of the focus on great operational execution, combined with great culinary and great people. And you’re going to continue to see us stay focused on executing those basics while we continue to execute against the other strategies to make the brand more visible, loved and hopefully engaged with. So off to a good start in 2023 and we’re optimistic about our growth runway going forward. So thanks everybody for being a part of the call and we’ll talk to you soon, I’m sure. Take care. Bye.

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian. Thanks, Cindy, and good afternoon, everyone. 2023 is off to a great start with first quarter sales and margins ahead of our expectations. For the quarter, sales grew 17% to reach $2.4 billion, driven by a 10.9% comp. In-store sales grew by 23% over last year. Digital sales represented 39% of sales. Restaurant level margin was 25.6%, an increase of 490 basis points year-over-year. Diluted EPS was $10.50, representing 84% growth over last year. And we opened 41 new restaurants, including 34 Chipotlanes.
These results demonstrate that our focus on running great restaurants with exceptional food and exceptional people is driving performance. Additionally, we benefited from exciting new menu innovations including Fajita Quesadilla and Chicken al Pastor. Transaction trends were positive throughout the quarter and the strength has continued into April.
I would like to note that beginning this quarter, we are returning to our pre-COVID practice of providing annual comp guidance and anticipate comparable sales to be in the mid-to-high single-digit range for the full-year. We will also continue to provide quarterly comp guidance for the remainder of this year and anticipate second quarter comps in the mid-to-high single-digit range.
Now, I would like to provide an update on our five key strategies that will position us to win today while we create the future, which include: number one, running successful restaurants with a people accountable culture that provides great food with integrity, while delivering exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences. Number two, making the brand visible, relevant and loved to improve overall guest engagement. Number three, amplifying technology and innovation to drive growth and productivity in our restaurants and support centers. Number four, expanding access and convenience by accelerating new restaurant openings. And number five, sustaining world class people leadership by developing and retaining diverse talent at every level.
First, starting with our restaurants. We recently held our Field Leader Conference, which included all Field Leaders, Team Directors’ and Regional Vice Presidents, as well as leaders from our restaurant support center. The message was clear. We are focused on developing exceptional people and preparing exceptional food. It was truly inspiring to see over 600 highly motivated leaders aligned to deliver Chipotle's standards of excellence and I'm proud of the progress our restaurant teams are making.
We had another outstanding quarter for turnover, with both hourly and salary metrics being some of the best I've seen in five years. The stability of crew and managers and a return to shoulder-to-shoulder training is helping to translate Project Square One into results. As our teams are getting more experience, we are continuing to see improvements in each of the Project Square One focus areas, including throughput on the frontline, on-time and accuracy on the digital make line, being prepped and ready with our delicious food, and the overall customer experience.
Specifically on throughput, while we are making progress, we see opportunities to do better. One area we are focused on is deployment on the front make line and the digital make line during peak periods. We have noticed that when the digital make line gets busy, our managers tend to pull a crew member from the frontline to help, which is impacting throughput. We are currently testing changes to the smarter pickup times logic based on different sales and deployment levels in several markets, and early results show that we are increasing throughput on the frontline and increasing on time on the digital make line without impacting sales.
Leveraging our stage gate process, we will continue to fine-tune our testing before rolling it out in phases across our restaurants. We have also added an additional incentive for our teams as we recently rolled-out digital tipping across our restaurants as part of our ongoing effort to enhance our crew member benefits. This will enable our teams to be rewarded for their efforts in preparing delicious food and providing a great experience for our guests.
Overall, our focus on being brilliant at the basics and reestablishing our standards of excellence is resonating well. Our teams love to be held to a high standard, because when you achieve it, you feel like you were part of a winning team with the ability to be rewarded through bonuses and growth within the organization. We are starting to feel this again in our culture and in our people.
When operations are running better, it helps all other drivers of sales to perform better, such as menu innovation, which brings me to our brand. As we often discuss, we continue to look for ways for the Chipotle brand to be more visible, more relevant and more loved, and we had a couple of very exciting new menu innovations that did just that. We responded to a real-time opportunity to support our passionate TikTok fans, who wanted Fajita veggies and Chipotle honey vinaigrette as options for our digital exclusive Veggie Quesadilla. We worked with two popular TikTok food reviewers, who made the idea go viral at the start of the year and leveraged our strength in digital marketing and culinary to creating exciting new menu items utilizing all existing ingredients. The results have been outstanding.
During the launch, we nearly doubled our Quesadilla business and had two of our top digital sales days of all time. We have decided to make this a permanent menu item as the addition of Fajitas to our Quesadilla along with dipping it in a combination of our Honey Vinaigrette and Sour Cream is really delicious. The best part is, that it is made of all existing ingredients which limits additional complexity in our restaurants and we continue to see incremental Quesadilla sales because of this launch.
We also launched Chicken Al Pastor as a limited time offer. Al Pastor store has been gaining mass appeal in recent years and we tapped into these consumer trends to offer our own spicy spin on Al Pastor with our freshly grilled chicken. As we mentioned last quarter, this is also operationally simple to execute as it is our existing Adobo Chicken cooked on the plancha and then mixed in an Al Pastor marinate. This has allowed for an exciting new menu item, while still maintaining our focus on Project Square One.
Additionally, this is the first time we have launched a new menu innovation globally, as it was rolled-out in the U.S., Canada and Europe. The launch has been a success, and early indications show that it is outperforming Pollo Asado, which was our most successful protein LTO ever.
Turning to rewards. We now have 33 million rewards members and we saw a nice pickup in enrollments as we rolled out Freepotle, which was designed to deliver a strong value proposition and attract new members through our transaction-driving rewards program. Throughout the year, our members will receive 10 personalized free rewards ranging from a signup cloth, to a bag of chips, to a free fountain drink. In addition to driving enrollments, we also saw an increase in member engagement as Freepotle gained traction throughout the quarter.
Shifting to amplifying technology and innovation. We continue to leverage technology to improve our in-restaurant and digital experiences. As we mentioned last quarter, we began testing a new grill to improve the overall cooking process for our chicken and steak. The grill is much faster, allows for more consistent execution, and maintains our high culinary standards as it cooks the chicken and steak to perfection with the same sear and char. The feedback from our teams and our guests has been tremendous and we are currently in the process of rolling out the grill to 10 additional restaurants as a part of further validation through our stage gate process.
During the quarter, we also rolled out our advanced location-based technology for our app, which allows for a more seamless process for scanning rewards, as it prompts reward members to scan while they are waiting in line. This has resulted in more rewards members scanning for points in our restaurants, which drives further engagement in our rewards program.
For digital orders, it also alerts app users when it appears they are ordering from or heading to the wrong location, as one of our most frequent refund request is due to guest arriving at the wrong restaurant. Since rolling out this feature, we have seen a meaningful reduction in those refunds.
We are also investing in technology and innovation through our Cultivate Next Fund to help us scale and advance our Food with Integrity mission. We recently announced two new investments, including Local Line and Zero Acre Farms. Local Line is a leading local food sourcing platform connecting local producers with buyers and helping them digitize their operations and sell products. We believe Local Line will help Chipotle increase the amount of local food for our 3,200 restaurants. And Zero Acre Farms is a food company that is focused on healthy, sustainable cooking oils made by fermentation that are more environmentally-friendly.
Additionally, we recently announced our new Responsible Restaurant Design, which includes features like rooftop solar panels, all electrical equipment and systems, LED lighting, Cactus leather chairs, and electrical vehicle charging stations at select locations. While the pilot will go through the normal stage gate process, we believe it will enable us to take successful elements and incorporate them into future restaurant formats. These investments and initiatives will help to further our purpose of cultivating a better world and reflects our commitment to inspire real sustainable change with a potential impact far beyond our Company.
And this brings me to expanding access convenience with a long-term target of 7,000 restaurants in North America. We remain on-track to grow new restaurants 8% to 10% per year for the foreseeable future, with at least 80% including a Chipotlane. The expansion of Chipotlanes adds additional convenience by adding our unique order pickup channel, which comes with a larger digital penetration driven by the order-ahead business.
In Canada, we opened our first Chipotlane in Ontario and we also expanded access and convenience with our recently-announced partnership with SkipTheDishes, which is Canada's largest food delivery network. Finally, new openings in small towns continue to be a success, with the recent opening of a restaurant in a small town in California that had the second-highest opening day sales ever. In fact, within the last year, we had our top five openings in the Company's history, of which four were in small towns.
I'll turn now to sustaining world-class people leadership by developing and retaining diverse talent at every level. Our recent Field Leader Conference was a time to celebrate the achievements and career progression of our teams and I'm always amazed by all the inspiring stories of our leaders. In fact, one of our Field Leaders from the Arizona sub region, who won the award for best throughput has been with Chipotle for 20-years. She is clearly doing a terrific job leading her patch of restaurants. However, what is even more incredible is that she has two sisters, one a Team Director, who has been with Chipotle for 24-years and is consistently a top performer in her region. And the other is a recently promoted Field Leader who has been with Chipotle for 18-years. Each has a unique story, but all three sisters started as crew members and said that Chipotle changed their lives for the better and gave them the ability to develop and grow others within the organization.
When you combine our industry-leading benefits with our tremendous growth, performance culture, and then layer on top exceptional leaders, who will help to grow and develop our future leaders, Chipotle really is a special Company.
In closing, I want to thank our restaurant and support center teams for all their hard work in delivering a great quarter. Our focus on getting back to the basics and reestablishing Chipotle's Standard of Excellence is beginning to drive strong results. We will continue to develop exceptional people and prepare exceptional food and of course treasure our guests. In doing this, I strongly believe we can make Chipotle better than ever.
With that, I will turn it over to Jack. Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone.
Sales in the first quarter grew 17% year-over-year to reach $2.4 billion as comp sales grew 10.9%. Restaurant-level margin of 25.6% increased about 490 basis points, compared to last year. Relative to our guidance, restaurant-level margin benefited from leverage from higher sales, labor efficiencies and lower avocado prices.
Earnings per share was $10.50, representing 84% year-over-year growth. The first quarter did not have any material unusual expenses or our GAAP earnings and non-GAAP earnings are the same.
As Brian mentioned, we are going back to our pre-COVID practice of providing annual comp guidance. We anticipate comps in the mid-to-high single-digit range for the full-year, assuming we do not see further deterioration in the macro environment. As a reminder, for Q2 and the full-year, our comp stepped down when we lapped the menu price increase we took in late March of last year, and we anticipate comps will step down again when we lap the menu price increase we took in early August of last year. We'll continue to provide quarterly comp guidance for the remainder of this year and we anticipate comps in the second quarter in the mid-to-high single-digit range as the transaction trends for the first quarter has continued into April.
I'll now go through the key P&L line items, beginning with cost of sales. Cost of sales in the quarter were 29.2%, a decrease of about 180 basis points from last year. The benefit from last year's menu price increases and lower avocado prices more than offset a mixed headwind from the Garlic Guajillo Steak limited time offer which ended in mid-February, as well as higher prices across several items including queso, beans, rice, salsa and tortilla.
For Q2, we expect our cost of sales to remain in low 29% range. The mix benefit from the Chicken Al Pastor limited time offer and lower dairy costs will be offset by higher costs in other areas, most notably avocados. We anticipate avocados to increase from the current favorable levels, which are some of the seasonally lows we have seen in the past few years.
Labor costs for the quarter were 24.6%, a decrease of about 170 basis points from last year. The benefit from sales leverage was partially offset by wage inflation. For Q2, we expect our labor cost to remain in the mid-24% range as continued labor inflation will be offset by leverage from seasonally higher sales.
Other operating costs for the quarter were 15.3%, a decrease of about 110 basis points from last year. This decrease was driven by sales leverage and a decline in delivery expenses due to lower delivery sales, partially offset by higher costs across several expenses, including natural gas and maintenance and repairs.
Marketing and promo costs for the quarter were 3.2% and in Q2 we expect marketing costs to step down to the mid-2% range, with the full-year to come in right around 3%. In Q2, other operating costs are expected to be in the low 14% range.
G&A for the quarter was $148 million, which includes $119 million in underlying G&A, $19 million related to non-cash stock compensation and $10 million, primarily related to payroll taxes and equity vesting and exercises, higher performance-based accruals, and costs associated with our Field Leader Conference. We expect our underlying G&A to be around $122 million in Q2 and continue to grow slightly thereafter as we make investments in technology and people to support ongoing growth.
We anticipate stock comp will be around $22 million in Q2, although this amount could move up or down based on our performance. We also expect to recognize about $4 million related to performance-based bonus accruals and payroll taxes and equity vesting exercises, bringing our anticipated total G&A in Q2 to around $148 million.
Depreciation for the quarter was $77 million or 3.2% of sales. And we expect depreciation to increase slightly each quarter as we continue to open more restaurants. Asset retirement stepped up to $8.4 million in the quarter. This includes charges related to the replacement of equipment such as fryers, grills, rice cookers and other restaurant equipment as we have been more proactive under Project Square One in preventing ingredient outages.
In the near-term, we expect asset retirements to remain around this level as we continue to prioritize the guest experience and focus on great ops. Our effective tax rate for Q1 was 22.5%, which benefited from option exercise and share vesting and stock prices above the grant values. We continue to estimate our underlying effective tax rate will be in the 25% to 27% range, though it may vary each quarter based on discrete items.
Our balance sheet remains strong as we ended the quarter with nearly $1.5 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments, with no debt, along with a $500 million untapped revolver. During the first quarter, we repurchased $132 million of our stock at an average price of $1,553. We increased our level of stock repurchases during the quarter when our share price fell with the overall market and we'll continue to opportunistically repurchase our stock.
At the end of the quarter, we had $282 million remaining under our share authorization program. We opened 41 new restaurants in the quarter, of which 34 had a Chipotlane and we remain on-track to open between 255 and 285 new restaurants this year, with least 80% including a Chipotlane. We continue to experience challenges including utility installation, component and raw material shortages, and permitting and inspection delays, which have extended our development timeline.
And while we anticipate these challenges to persist throughout the year, our pipeline remains strong and we expect to move toward the high-end of the 8% to 10% of openings range once these timeline challenges subside.
In closing, 2023 is off to a great start as our focus on strong operations and treasuring our guests is driving an improvement in sales and margin trends. While we are proud of the progress our teams have made in a short period of time, we recognize that there is still opportunity for us to be even better. We believe that these efforts will position us to successfully navigate through macro uncertainty and more importantly, strengthen our foundation for sustained long-term growth.
With that, we're happy to take your questions. We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Dennis Geiger with UBS. Please go ahead. Great. Thank you and congrats on the strong results. Brian, I want to ask a little bit more about throughput and the operations opportunity. Could you all frame up a little bit more some of the gains that maybe you're starting to see over this past quarter from Project Square One and some of the other initiatives that you spoke to? And then kind of more importantly, just thinking about the opportunity from here based on initiatives currently in place and maybe even some of the technology you guys have highlighted in recent months? Thank you. Yes. So look, Project Square One has been something we've been working very aggressively for probably, I guess now we're going on almost nine months and our operators have done a terrific job. Scott and the team have really, I think, retrenched on getting back to the basics. And some of things where we make great progress on are just being in-stock with great culinary. We're experiencing too many times where we're out of guac, we were out of chips, we were out of chicken, so we've made tremendous progress on that front. We also have made a lot of progress on keeping both lines open from open to close.
And both of those reasons that we've improved dramatically are driven by I think more stability in the restaurant with better training and then holding people accountable to those standards. On the throughput side of things, we've made some progress on the frontline, we've definitely made some progress as it relates to being on time and accurate digitally, but we still believe there's a lot of room for improvement. I think you heard in our prepared remarks, we're still working through I would call it better deployment in managing during peaks. So that we service the DML business effectively without jeopardizing the service of the people that are right in front of us in the restaurant.
So we still believe there's a lot of runway in front of us on great throughput. We won't get the great throughput though if we don't have great stability and great culinary having both lines open from open to close, and we've made tremendous progress on those foundational elements. So really proud of where the team has moved the organization, but I'm really optimistic about where they can get to. Appreciate that, Brian. And then just a quick follow-up on that. Just some of the tech stuff that maybe is still a little bit early days. How exciting is that for you and what that can do either for throughput, as well as maybe some cost efficiencies as we think about the potential there? Yes, no thanks for the – thanks, I forgot to answer that part of your question. So thanks for the reminder. Look, tremendously excited, that's why we're investing in it, right. These clamshell grills that we're rolling into 10 restaurants now make the job easier, make the culinary better and make the culinary more consistently better. So that's a huge win for our customer and our employees. I think I've talked about this, it makes the cooking time dramatically go down. So chicken goes from 12, 13 minutes to two, three minutes and you get perfect sear, perfect char, just really delicious culinary.
So that's a big unlock for us, because the grill position is one of the hardest positions to train. So we can make that job easier and then we also free up more space on the plancha, it just eliminates any potential bottleneck for our future growth. The other thing, it's a huge exciting one for us, it's a little further out, is Hyphen. We talked about this quite a bit, which is automating the digital make line. That will enable us to be even more accurate, I think probably get a little bit faster and I think give people more consistent experiences. So, all these things are driving towards hopefully better guest experiences, but also a better work environment for employees. And then, obviously with that, I think will be more efficient in both cases.
So, really excited about both initiatives. Obviously, the clamshell grills are a little bit closer in. Hyphen is a little further out. And then we've got some other exciting initiatives on making our prep easier, right, frying chips or cutting and cleaning avocados. So, we're making a lot of investment and we're going to continue to experiment. Not all of it will work, but I'm confident having innovation in this space is a big unlock for our brand in the long-run. Great. Thank you, Brian. The next question comes from David Tarantino with Baird. Please go ahead. Hi, good afternoon. Jack, I have a question on the margin outlook. I think based on your guidance for the second quarter and what you delivered in the first quarter, it looks like maybe the business is doing about a 26% restaurant margin for the first-half of the year or at least that's what you expect. Is that the right run rate to think about for the year at the current sales levels or is there anything maybe on the horizon in the back-half that might I guess surprise one way or another? Yes, David. In the first half, you're thinking about it right. We definitely expect our margins to step-up from here. Q2 from a seasonal sales standpoint is a stronger quarter for us. We typically see higher margins in the second quarter. We also have relatively lower marketing in the second quarter and there is some offsets like, like a little bit of inflation in the labor line, but still you're thinking about it right for the first-half of the year. What's unknown in second-half of the year is inflation. We're still thinking there's going to be continued labor inflation in the mid-single-digit. And even though our commodity has been largely tame, where we've had some pluses and minuses that have largely offset each other.
We think in the second-half of the year, there is still the possibility of inflation. For example, we don't necessarily expect, we'd love avocados to remain at this level for the rest of the year, but we're being realistic and thinking that may not happen. And there may still be inflation upbeat, we haven't seen it really yet in what we buy, but there is that possibility as well. So, it's really a wildcard about inflation up. Inflation is tame in the second-half of the year, that will obviously lead to even better margins in the second-half of the year, but I think you're thinking about it right. Great. And then the follow-up is about your pricing philosophy, and I don't know if Brian or Jack, you want to take this one. But I guess how are you currently thinking about your pricing as you think about the inflation you just referenced and I think now that you've rolled over the pricing in April, you're running one of the lowest year-over-year price increases in the industry. So, just wondering how you're thinking about when you pull the lever on pricing again? Yes. Hey David, this is Brain. We're staying the course on our approach to pricing, which is, if we see inflation that warrants us needing to take additional pricing, we'll take it. I think we've now demonstrated we do have pricing power. We have a really strong brand and we don't want to be in front of the inflationary environment, but we also don't want to fall behind.
So, the good news is, we're in a really strong position that when we're ready and we believe it's necessary to pull that pricing lever, we can and we continue to have a really strong brand to do it with. So, we have not made any definitive plans on pricing for the balance of the year, but we're going to stay the course on the approach we've taken over the last, I'd say 18, 24 months. Great. Thank you very much. The next question is from Sara Senatore with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Thank you. A question on labor and then as a follow-up on loyalty. Can you maybe talk a little bit, labor was, I think, better than you had expected or we had anticipated certainly I was wondering if you could just talk, is that just because transaction growth was better. I don't know, if you can decompose the same-store sales for us. Is it the lower turnover? Just trying to understand where the improvement came from?
And then a question on loyalty is you mentioned, kind of, improved sign-ups. I guess when I look at loyalty membership growth year-over-year, it looks like it's still kind of in that 20% range. Do you have any thoughts about how big that could be or what share of your unique customers, you're seeing members of loyalty. Just trying to understand like sort of the run rate for that as a comp driver. Thank you. Yes. Yes, I'll take the labor piece first, Sara. First of all, it was most of the benefit that we saw was sales driven in the quarter. We saw our transaction turn positive. We're still running menu price increase compared to last year and about a 10% range. So when you have that kind of a flow-through where transactions are flowing and menu prices are flowing as well. That was a significant benefit in the quarter. We did have some labor inflation, so that was an offset to it. And then we did see some efficiencies. So we did see, really, for the first time, the labor scheduling tool we put into place last year was really starting to pay off.
And then the fourth thing I would just say is normally this time of the year as our sales begin to increase seasonally, that is the time where our labor tends to be more efficient. It tends to happen where the weather starts to get warmer, our sales start to grow and our managers are trying to keep up on the schedules, but they end up basically driving a little bit of efficiency. They always seem to be maybe a step or 2 behind. The good news is, as Brian mentioned, operationally, we feel like the restaurants ran really well, and we drove that additional labor efficiency. Thank you. And then just on loyalty? Yes, I can say on the loyalty, your question there, what we've definitely seen is we see people higher enrollments when we make it easier to be engaged in the digital system. So a couple of things happen, right? I mentioned this in my earlier remarks. The team improved your ability to redeem rewards by alerting you, so that you don't forget this can form. We also improved your ability to end up going to the right restaurant for your order, which was a big deal. That's one of the biggest misses we seem to have with customers where they didn't realize they were ordering from different restaurants than where they were intending to go.
So those types of things make the engagement easier for people, which then they stay in the program. And now doing things like free Potle, Fajita Quesadilla, digital-only just attracts new people to come into that space. And that is what we want to do. We want to continue to have acquisition and then we want to dial up the personalization and make it super easy to stay active and engaged, because we know the more engaged you are it plays out in more purchase frequency and higher ticket.
So we'd love to get $33 million to $40 million. I don't know where the ceiling is on this thing, but we're going to continue to push towards getting as many people involved and then work very hard to turn it into a very personalized program that keeps them engaged. Okay. Thank you very much. The next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Thanks. I wanted to double-click on that labor productivity stuff. In the past you've talked about the number of orders you could do in a 15 minute block during those peak hours in the front make line, could you give us a sense of where you are now and where you think that can go realistically over the next one or two years. And then what that would mean to your sales, if you got there? Yes. I mean, I'll cover a couple of stats and then Brian, you can add-on as needed. First of all, in terms of the first quarter, we did push past our 15 minute max, compared to last year. So, it was nice to see as our transactions turned positive during the quarter, that we did push past last year. We actually at the end of the quarter and as we moved into April, we actually push past where we were in the second quarter of last year as well. So, we're seeing nice progress, but we're still in that low 20%s range, David.
We think we can get into the mid-20%s. Mid-20% is comparable to what we were doing in 2019, before the pandemic, if you adjust for the shift in our digital business. But beyond that, if you go back even a few years before that, we don't think there's any reason why we can't get back into at least the high 20s or maybe even into the low 30s as well.
Now that will take a few years, but we think that's one project that Brian mentioned, his idea of experimenting with, how can we make sure that we've got basically the labor deployment and we've got the cadence of orders coming through to the DML, to be set such that our teams can with confidence, they can run both lines without feeling this pressure to pull from one line to the other.
And typically what happened is the DML, if the orders are coming through pretty high on the DML, there is a tendency to pull somebody from that frontline and I think we're basically seeing some good early results to tell us that we think there's going to be a way to breakthrough and allow our teams to really execute it out at a really high-level on both lines. So, I think that's potentially and a lot to get to some of these higher number 15 minutes throughput figures. And if I look back a decade, you're your labor as a percentage of sales was in the 23% area. I know a lot's changed in the labor market since then, but you're working on a lot of stuff, not just the focus and the training, but also the double-side grills and hopefully some breakthroughs with hyphen. I mean do you think you could get back there? Is that the sort of labor productivity that's possible that you can imagine over the next few years? It's theoretically possible. I think the one thing, David, that is different now is labor rates are much, much, much higher. And our menu pricing hasn't really stayed caught up all the way with the labor over the last few years. And in fact, the biggest move that we made in the second quarter of 2021, we basically raised wages by 15% and only a raised price by 4%. So we basically offset the dollar value of that. We didn't try to protect the margins and certainly didn't try to protect the labor line at all. So I think there's been a bit of a dislocation there.
Having said that, we do have a very efficient labor model. We do have a lot of investment in technology. We do have a lot of things that I could see over time as we grow to $3 million volumes and then $3.5 million volumes. And as we really create solutions so that our teams can be more efficient. I think it's certainly possible. It's not necessarily a goal of ours, but we could land there someday. Thank you. The next question comes from Lauren Silberman with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Thank you very much. My question is on transaction, great to see the positive transactions in the quarter. Within the mid-single to high single-digit comp guide for the year, what are you embedding for transactions? And what do you see as the most meaningful drivers of positive traffic growth through the rest of the year? Yes. Look, I think the drivers for traffic growth are going to start with Project Square One. We have to have great operational execution. We staff trained, deployed, lines open from open to close and giving people great experiences. So that's initiative number one, to keep the traffic moving in the right direction. Obviously, doing things with our loyalty program, our CRM database. We continue to talk about how we're on that journey of continuing to engage with our customers at another level and we'll continue to invest in there, continue to experiment and continue to execute.
And then as I've talked about these in our strategies, having the brand visible for what makes Chipotle truly unique its purpose around food with integrity. That resonates with our customers. It resonates with our team members, because it's -- our employees feel great about the food they're serving and our customers. This is the food they want to be eating. And a great example of that are just some menu innovation things that we've added, right, the Fajita Quesadilla. Right now, we're doing Chicken Al Pastor. We made the Fajita Quesadilla program permanent. And we'll continue to do menu news. I think we've talked about this one or two a year.
So it's the combination of all those things. that will continue, I think, drive great traffic. And I don't want to walk past the fact that we continue to have tremendous value scores. When you look at what you get from Chipotle for what you pay relative to your alternatives. We continue to get feedback that we're one of the best. And whether you're comparing to other restaurants in our space or even the grocery store. So we love our value position, and then we love the initiatives that we've got in place. Great. And just a follow-up on traffic. Where is it coming from? Is it primarily your existing customers, new or lapsed customers, anything notable to share in terms of what you're seeing across income cohorts? Thank you very much. Yes. I mean, formally, it's broad-based. So we're seeing new customers come in, and we're also seeing existing customers increase their frequency. So the operational focus, combined with kind of the marketing and menu innovation is doing exactly what we would want it to do. Thank you very much. The next question comes from Andrew Charles with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Great. Thanks. Brian, would you be able to talk a little more about what you attribute the sales strength in March and April 2 that exceeded your guidance at the time when the fast casual industry slowed? If you had to tease it out, just -- not looking for specific numbers, of course, but just direction of magnitude. Is it the improved staffing, wasn't Chicken Al Pastor, something else that perhaps externally, we may not be appreciating? Look, I hate to just kind of repeat myself, but I'm going to repeat myself here, which is Project Square One and getting the foundational elements of Chipotle's execution back to Chipotle standard of excellence. I can't emphasize enough how important that is to have our digital make line open from open to close to have ingredients on that line from open to close, to being staffed and trained on the front line, so to get people down the line really fast with exactly what they want. I can't emphasize enough how important that is because everything then builds from there, right? Our digital personalization program builds on that. Our menu innovation builds on that, talking about a brand with purpose builds on that.
And I just think a myriad of things worked really well. The Fajita Quesadilla program was received really well. The Chicken Al Pastor program was received really well. But I know they wouldn't be as powerful if we didn't have Project Square One driving behind it. So I think we've talked about this a lot, Andrew. One of the things that makes Chipotle really special is its operational ability to achieve tremendous throughput with unbelievable culinary and unbelievable customization. We got to nail that. And we have to nail it both on the front line and in the digital experience. That's helpful. And one thing I wanted to revisit as well as just the international opportunity. Obviously, a lot of the focus in the last five years has been domestically and recognizing how much strength you guys have domestically, as well as opportunities to further spread the domestic momentum and further enhance the divest momentum, what do you need to see to lean in more on international, whether it's accelerating development, you're entering new markets, potentially testing out franchising? I would love your thoughts as we think broader beyond Canada. Yes, sure. Well, I don't want to just walk by Canada. We're getting ready to expand into Alberta. We'll open probably 10-plus restaurants up there, which is like a 50% increase. So not and the team in Canada are doing a fabulous job. We're going to continue to drive that market. Specifically on Europe, Jim and the team have done a great job. Our U.K. business has got great momentum. Not surprising, there's a lot of inflation in the P&L there. and we have not priced for it because we think a lot of it is temporary, and we're still establishing ourselves in those markets.
And I'm optimistic because if you can get the top line, usually, the rest worked itself out. And we're putting in place the digital system, the operational excellence, the great culinary. So I'm optimistic we're going to get there where we'll move this thing out of the stage gate process, but we're going to take our time, because we want to get it right. We don't want to just be fast. And that's what the team is after, and they're making great progress. Appreciate it. Thanks for the help. The next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Hi, thank you. I was hoping that if you could give a little bit more transparency in terms of especially the month of April, what's happening on the customer cohort level? I mean, are you seeing more higher-income customers come? Are you seeing some lower income customers maybe coming a little bit less or changing their order patterns? Some people would say maybe attach is a little bit lower than it used to be or the consumer is becoming a little bit more price sensitive, but clearly, that wouldn't be the case in the traffic numbers that you've talked about in April similar to the first quarter.
So just wanted to -- just get a sense if there's anything kind of happening beneath the surface that you can talk about or maybe some shifting customer behaviors that actually might be positive for you longer term? Yes. It's actually two things happened for us. One, the higher income consumer continue to come and hardly came at a little bit faster pace from a frequency standpoint. And then we did see some, I would call it, recovery in the lower income consumer, still not all the way back to where it was, call it, a year ago, but an improvement from where it was over the last six months. So we've seen nice improvements across all of our income cohorts, and we continue to see great strength in the higher income. Interesting. And secondly, if I may, in terms of personalization on Chipotle Rewards, where are we in that journey? I mean, how do you feel that you're doing, are there any near-term opportunities or some near-term functionalities that you're going to add as the system continues to learn and get better on an individual customer basis. Yes. Thanks for the question. This, I think, is a big opportunity for us because we're still very much in the early days on this. I think the teams have done a great job of turning the data into action through, call it, like CRM programs. And we're just starting to tip our toe into the personalization opportunity. And I think you're going to see really kind of CRM evolve into personalization at meaningful scale. So I think there's a lot of opportunity to be had in this space. I'm proud of the work that's been done to-date and where we currently are. But I just think there is tremendous opportunity going forward. assuming we can get this personalization program, right? Thank you. The next question comes from Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. In the past, you've commented just on kind of delivery sales and what that looks like for the quarter? And then maybe also just kind of what the mix component of your same-store sales for the quarter was? Would you be able to provide some color on that? Delivery was still right around 20%, right? Like high teens. Yes, high teens. And we saw a nice strength in our digital business, a little bit of a rebound in the delivery business, more so probably in the marketplace. But we're feeling really good about how we're positioned in all those access channels. Order ahead, delivery and coming into the restaurant. Okay. And then seeing how the Fajita Quesadilla did quite well. Are there kind of other opportunities like that where you lean into just existing menu items and do something akin to that. You've obviously done very well with kind of protein LTOs, but what else could be further afield that kind of continues on that success? Yes. Look, we are really delighted by how well the Fajita Quesadilla performed for the very reason you just mentioned, right? It's all existing ingredients. It required some work on the digital side of things. But for the most part, this was a really easy one for operators to execute. So the team is doing some work to figure out other opportunities like that within our menu and maybe could apply for both the frontline and the digital line. I do believe there's still a lot of hidden gems within the Chipotle menu. And I think we have the opportunity to talk about them in a more visible way. So more to come. I know Chris and the team are working through, can we find something that can perform as well as Fajita Quesadilla following those kind of requirements. Thank you. The next question comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Please go ahead. Hey, good afternoon. I was hoping to get an update on Chipotlanes. I think around this time last year, you gave us some ROIC metrics on Chipotlanes versus non-Chipotlanes and kind of the sales lift and digital mix component. I'm just curious now that we're a year later, how those compare the Chipotlanes versus the non- Chipotlanes? And then Jack, did you actually give us kind of what mix and traffic were in the quarter, that would be helpful to have. Thank you. Well, I'll do the first one -- or the second one first. And I'm surprised it didn't get asked before. So no, we provide it. I just thought I space it out to Jack. We're almost not in Sharon. So yes, listen, transactions were in kind of that 4%-ish kind of mid, low-single-digit. It's a nice turnaround from what we saw in the fourth quarter that we saw a check the net check was 7%, so that gets you to that kind of 10.9%. And of the check, it was about 10% pricing and then a 3% mix. And just as a further clarification, the 10% pricing is about 8.5% is in our in-store and our order ahead business. And then on top of that, there's a 1.5% for delivery.
And then on Chipotlane, Sharon, largely the same. I mean, Chipotlane still perform higher from a sales standpoint, higher from a margin standpoint and then higher from a return standpoint. I think we have mentioned in the past, it's -- the comparisons aren't as great anymore. So in other words, a few years ago, we would open up restaurants that could have a Chipotlane, but didn't as we were kind of executing the strategy.
And today, when we have 80%, 85% of our restaurants have a Chipotlane, the 15% or 20% that don't can't have one, meaning it's an urban location, it's an in-line location. So it's really different trade areas. So we're starting to see that some of the sales comparisons are getting a little bit not necessarily relevant. We're still seeing the Chipotlanes perform at a higher level, but it's a little bit like comparing an apple to an orange, but still margin return and from a sales standpoint, they're still great.
It still does generate higher digital mix by several hundred basis points, and there still is a shift where delivery takes a step down from something in the high teens into the mid or low teens, and order head steps up quite a bit from something in the call it the low 20% up to the high 20s or even the 30%. So all the same kind of directional thing that we've seen, all the benefits that we've seen with Chipotlane are continuing to show up. Thank you. The next question comes from Jon Tower with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Great. Thanks for taking the question. Curious, Brian, you mentioned earlier in the call that your smaller market stores are coming in strong, perhaps even better than you had anticipated. So I'm curious, I know you've recently offered the 7,000-store TAM for North America. But given the success you're seeing as well as some of the new technology like the clamshell grills that you're still testing or you can heighten on the horizon, does that maybe alter that opportunity for new stores over time? I mean, look, obviously, as we get closer to that 7,000 number. We'll have a much better idea of whether or not we can grow beyond the 7,000. The good news is we've not seen any slowdown in our performance. So all the restaurants we're opening. They're opening with strength. And obviously, we look at this every year as we kind of take another look at our market planning.
And the good news is we're opening restaurants in -- for Chipotle, I would say, somewhat penetrated markets, and they continue to perform really well. And that gives us confidence because then we can kind of start thinking through like, well, you start extrapolating that across the country, you could see how you could get beyond 7,000. But not ready to take the number up just yet. I love seeing great performance. It's great to see the small towns do really well. And it's great to see, frankly, the restaurants do really well in urban and are more penetrated markets. So lots of opportunity in front of us on new restaurant opening frontier. Great. And just one more follow-up. Do you have any more planned LTOs for 2023? We always think through kind of something in the front half and something in the back half. We haven't definitively made a decision on what we're going to do in the back half yet. The good news is our pipeline is really strong, and we've got some flexibility. But we want to see where the consumer is, the strength of Project Square One and that will inform what we choose to do in the back half of the year. Got it. Thank you. The next question comes from Peter Saleh with BTIG. Please go ahead. Great. Thanks for taking the question. Brian, I want to ask about the hyphen automation. I think you mentioned that's for the digital make line. When you're thinking about this, and I know it's still early, is this more for new restaurants? Or can you fit this into your existing footprint in some of your existing locations? Yes. No, one of the things that's great about this is it would fit in our existing locations. It's almost pull off the current line, put in the new line kind of idea, which is really exciting. Probably the first place you'd see us do it. It will be with new units just because it's easier to implement. But the good news is Kurt and the team are designing this so that it will work with our existing restaurants. Great. And then just one question on the Chicken Al Pastore LTO. It sounds like it's performed exceptionally well. Is it bringing in new guests to the brand previously haven't come to Chipotle? And is there a level at which an LTO has so much success that it becomes a permanent item? Or do you always consider it as an LTO? Yes. Well, the good news is Chicken Al Pastore has been broadly appealing. So both to new users and existing customers. The decision to make it permanent would be something we would do after we finish this LTO 1. So we haven't come to the conclusion that we would make this permanent, but your statement is correct, it's definitely performing really well. And crew member feedback is this is an easy one for them to make, and customer feedback has been really positive as well.
So we did decide to make the Fajita Quesadilla permanent in our digital platform, but that's a little different than making Chicken Al Pastore permanent. So for this one, it's definitely planned to be an LTO, we'll execute it as an LTO, and then we can always revisit whether we make a permanent menu item down the road. Thank you. The next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Please go ahead. Great. Thank you very much. Two questions. The first one is on the comp guidance. The fact that you're resuming guidance for full-year. I assume that's an indication of stabilization that you're seeing maybe more week-to-week or month-to-month or your visibility -- just wondering if you can share why that has returned. And maybe what are the components you're assuming in that mid to high-single-digit in the 2Q and full-year? Just trying to gauge what the pricing would be if you took no further and what the traffic assumption is? And then I just had one follow-up. Yes. On the guidance, it assumes we don't take any additional pricing similar to the comment that Brian made before. Right now, we're staying the course. So what it assumes is we continue the same transaction trends that we've seen in the first quarter continue into second quarter. It recognizes that we took some menu price action last year, and those will roll off. And so that's, in essence, what we put together for the full-year guidance.
And the idea here, Jeff, is that we don't know if we're going to continue like beyond the next few quarters and give quarterly guidance all the time. You might remember a few years ago, we used to give just the annual and then not talked about what the quarterly guidance is. And so what we're doing right now is we're kind of doing both for a while, and then we'll see how the trends unfold. We'll see what happens to the macro. And we'll make a decision in terms of what our guidance is going to be. But we actually think about our business in terms of a longer-term approach than quarter-to-quarter. And so we think the guidance ought to match that as well. So that's the reason for the change. Understood. And then just on the marketing front, I think you said the mid-2% range for the second quarter. I know it was in the 3s in the first quarter. I'm just wondering, just talk about the thought process around marketing, whether this is a conscious pullback for any particular reason or how you measure the returns kind of your how happy have you been with the marketing you've had thus far and the outlook going forward? Thank you. Well, we've been really happy with how the brand has shown up and the initiatives that we've rolled out on the percentages, I think that has more to do with timing than anything else. It's timing. It's been planned, and we tend to spend more in the first quarter first part of the year and in the back half of the year and typically to support these LTOs. Well, I think Chris here, you'd also say too, like the summer months aren't the best time for broad-based media, right? So I think that's part of the timing. Thank you. Today's last question comes from Jake Bartlett with Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Great. Thank you so much for taking the question. Jack, I had a question on commodity inflation. I was wondering whether you could kind of handicap the likelihood of deflation in the back half. It feels like there's some big chunks of poultry dairy seem to be likely solidly deflationary. Just kind of wondering what the moving pieces are in your mind, how much visibility you have? And just what do you think the chances of deflation are in the back half? Yes. It's not our -- it's a good question. It's not our base case. Our base case is to see modest inflation in the back half of the year. We're predicting somewhere in the low to mid-single-digits. We've been really pleasantly surprised by what's happened so far. We have had a number of miscellaneous items where we've seen inflation like some of our oils tortilla, some of our sauces and things like that, but even offset by lower-than-expected avocado cost. So that's why our food cost has been steady for two quarters in a row.
And it's been a number of quarters that that's happened where we haven't seen any net inflation. So I do think it's a possibility. It depends on what the Fed does. It depends on what happens to inflation broadly. The wildcard there is if inflation disappears, you have to also then wonder, okay, what's happened with the macro economy, what's happening with unemployment and consumer demand as well.
So right now, we kind of like the environment we're in right now, where consumers have jobs. They have money. They're visiting restaurants, and the inflation that we're seeing is pretty modest. So that base case that we put together and how we plan the rest of the year feels pretty good to us. We wouldn't mind inflation going down, but we'd love it if it didn't. Also be accompanied with a softness in demand. Great. And that answer kind of flows into my next question, which was I think as you talked about the annual guidance for same-store sales, you talked about the macro environment staying as it is now. So I just wanted to kind of make sure I understood what your kind of base case is for the macro environment in the back half of the year. And should we think of the range kind of slight recession on the low end? How should we think about the macro outlook in your guidance? And maybe how you think you're positioned if we do see a deceleration in the consumer? So first of all, in our prepared comments, we did say our guidance assumes that there's not a meaningful change in the macro environment, okay? Because obviously, all bets are off that happens. But in terms of our outlook, our outlook does not -- our base case does not include a recession or certainly not a meaningful recession. Again, it looks like unemployment is holding up really well. It looks like consumer spending is strong right now.
I mean, Brian mentioned our -- we saw softness in the second-half of last year, especially the fourth quarter in lower income consumer. We saw those consumers come back almost at the same rate as our higher income consumers. And so we see that as a positive in a positive macro sign. So we're cautiously optimistic about what's going to happen in the second half of the year.
Now if there is a recession, we feel like we're really well prepared. We have -- we own all of our restaurants. We don't have any debt. So we don't have the possibility of franchisees under pressure if they have debt payments and that there is a softening of demand. And we don't feel like we have to run the business based on a quarter-by-quarter and tally. So if we need to write a couple of tough quarters here or there, we certainly think we have the financial wherewithal and we have the long-term view to do that. But again, we're cost optimistic that the economy will hold up. Great. I appreciate it. Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back to Brian Niccol for any closing remarks. Okay. Thanks. And thanks, everybody, for joining the call and all the questions. Obviously, we're very proud of the work that has gone into achieving these results. I think I mentioned this before, Chipotle has got one of those special brands strengths when you look out there. There aren't many companies, I think, that are growing top line, expanding margins and building new units to the tune of 8% to 10%.
And then when you combine that with the strength of the balance sheet, the strength of our economics, we're very confident in the strategies that we're continuing to execute we are not slowing down, though on Project Square One, and we're not slowing down on providing digital access, and we're not going to slow down on making the brand visible and loved. And at the foundation of all this when we have great people, with great culinary, we usually end up with great experiences for our guests.
So we're staying the course, and we believe the strategies and these focus areas are going to deliver results for the long-term. And we're optimistic about our long-term future of getting to those 7,000 restaurants and AUVs well beyond 3 million. So thanks again for taking the time, and we'll talk to you in a couple of months, if not sooner. Thanks. Bye. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian. Thanks, Cindy, and good afternoon, everyone. The strength in our business continued into the second quarter, driven by our focus on exceptional food and exceptional people, as well as the success of Chicken al Pastor.
For the quarter, sales grew 14% to reach $2.5 billion, driven by a 7.4% comp. In restaurant sales increased 16%, digital sales represented 38% of sales. Restaurant level margin was 27.5%, an increase of 230 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted diluted EPS was $12.65, representing 36% growth over last year, and we opened 47 new restaurants, including 40 Chipotlanes.
For the third quarter, we anticipate comps in the low to mid-single-digit range, driven by transaction growth, as we are rolling off of pricing. For the full year, we continue to anticipate mid to high-single-digit comps. Before reviewing our strategic priorities, I want to share a few organizational updates.
As a way of maintaining a healthy growth mindset, we proactively conducted an in-depth review of our business needs and organizational structure to ensure we can deliver on our aggressive growth goals for future growth. This resulted in investments in areas like development, digital marketing, and international expansion. At the same time, we also identified areas where we could better optimize our organizational structure, such as putting our end-to-end digital experience, including product design, analytics, and the customer journey under Kurt Garner, our Chief Customer and Technology Officer.
Additionally, we streamlined our strategic project management process to focus on key projects and to enable faster and more efficient decision-making. These changes will further support our five key strategies that will position us to win today while we grow our future, which include, number one, running successful restaurants with a people-accountable culture that provides great food with integrity while delivering exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences. Number two, sustaining world-class people leadership by developing and retaining diverse talent at every level. Number three, making the brand visible, relevant, and loved to improve overall guest engagement. Number four, amplifying technology and innovation to drive growth and productivity at our restaurants and support centers. And number five, expanding access and convenience by accelerating new restaurant openings and laying the foundation for international expansion.
Starting with our restaurants. While Project Square One is wrapping up, we have made the decision to permanently embed the program within our training DNA. On a quarterly basis, our crew members will be retrained on key components, ensuring we are always focused on being brilliant at the basics and that we never lose sight of training and developing exceptional people and preparing and serving exceptional food.
Next quarter, we will reemphasize throughput and elevate our focus on proper deployment standards during peak periods, where we often only have three crew members on the front make line versus our minimum deployment of four. The fourth person, which is often the expediter, may leave the front line to help the digital make line. Our focus will be on coaching the expediter to stay on the front line and to bring together the items and in order and communicate them to the cashier as alleviating this bottleneck is critical for delivering great throughput.
Additionally, we believe we have an opportunity to better optimize our smarter pickup times and deployment of labor on the digital make line during peak periods. As you may remember, we began testing changes to the cadence of orders on the digital make line in several markets to see if we could improve throughput by eliminating the need to pull a crew member from front line to help the digital make line. The good news is that in these restaurants, we are seeing an improvement in throughput on the front line and an improvement in on time on the digital make line.
We will continue to test adjusting the cadence of orders on the digital make line at certain restaurants and roll out where we see the opportunity to improve the overall experience. We remain confident that balancing the deployment between the front and digital make lines along with continuous training and reps will further drive improvements in throughput. In fact, we have seen evidence this in certain restaurants.
I was recently in New York at Chipotle on 50th and Park and it was a great experience with delicious food and fast throughput on the front line compared to my experience at the same restaurant exactly a year ago. The improvement in throughput was certainly noticeable as the employment of labor between the front make line and the digital make line was more balanced.
Over the last year, the field leader responsible for this patch of restaurants in New York City worked with the GMs and crew members shoulder to shoulder on throughput fundamentals. During his regular restaurant visits, he also followed up with consistent feedback like reminding his restaurants to have an expo in position during peak periods. By having the proper deployment with an expo in place and the right balance between the front make line and the digital make line, throughput in his patch of restaurants improved by nearly five entrees in the peak 15 minutes as compared to the prior year.
His restaurants are also outcomping his region and the company average demonstrating throughput drives performance. This is the type of leader we want to develop; one that builds a strong team, runs world-class restaurants, ensures we serve exceptional food every day and inspires our teams to achieve great results. And this brings me to our world-class people leadership.
As part of our focus on developing our teams, we’ve relaunched Cultivate University for our newly promoted field leaders which is a three-day training program on the skills they need to truly excel in managing their patch of restaurants. This includes developing future leaders, the foundations of exceptional throughput and culinary, why it's critical to protect our economic model and a culture of accountability.
One of the most challenging transitions is from general manager managing one restaurant to field leader and managing around eight restaurants. Cultivate University is a program that will be offered each year to support our new field leaders as they make this transition to managing a $20 million business.
We remain committed to hiring and developing the best people to work at Chipotle, through our competitive wages, industry-leading benefits, and tremendous growth opportunity. In fact, we are on track to surpass our 22,000 promotions from last year and create over 7,000 new jobs with our restaurants anticipated to open in 2023.
We are also relaunching our successful and long-running behind-the-foil ad campaign. This campaign provides unfiltered and emotional testimonials from our team members about the impact Chipotle has had on their lives, as well as it glimpses into our daily preparation using our real ingredients and classic culinary techniques, a key differentiator for Chipotle. What better way to make the brand more visible, more relevant, and more loved than to feature our talented restaurant team members preparing exceptional food?
And speaking of exceptional food, our menu innovation has been outstanding this year. Chicken al Pastor has proven to be a popular LTO with one in five transactions, including the new protein. It is boosting transactions with a strong repeat and is attracting new customers to Chipotle. It also delivered the highest positive social sentiment of any new menu introduction, and importantly, was simple for our teams to execute, which resulted in a win all around. As Chicken al Pastor wraps up in late August, we have a planned new menu item for later in the quarter.
Our rewards program is another way we aim to drive frequency within our existing customer base, as our reward members come more often and spend more than non-rewards members. We’ve launched Freepotle earlier this year, which was designed to deliver a strong value proposition and attract new members with 10 free rewards dropped into our members' accounts throughout the year.
Freepotle has been successful in driving enrollments in the first half of the year as we surpassed 35 million reward members. With each strategic Freepotle drop, we are learning more about our customers' behaviors and utilizing those learnings to personalize future offers. We will continue to look for creative ways to drive enrollment and improve engagement in our rewards program.
In traditional media, we remain top of mind at sporting events as we leverage the basketball playoffs as a high-profile opportunity to spotlight the Chipotle brand, and through our NHL partnership, our Chipotle logo was featured on the ice during the Stanley Cup playoffs. Additionally, the return of the popular Chipotle Hockey Jersey Bogo Day had the highest participation in the history of the program.
Chipotle's ingredients continue to power many of the top male and female athletes on and off the field. Through our Real Food for Real Athletes campaign, we have showcased the inspiring journeys of athletes across all levels of sports and how Chipotle can help them perform their best by providing proper nutrition. Partnering with athletes and teams along with traditional media around big sporting events has been an authentic and successful way to connect the brand to some of our biggest fans.
Shifting to technology and innovation in our restaurants. First, I wanted to provide an update on the benefits we have seen from the dual-sided grill, which we discussed last quarter. The new grill can cook the chicken in under four minutes versus 12 minutes on the plancha and can cook the steak in under one minute versus four minutes on the plancha. This allows for a faster recovery of freshly grilled chicken and steak, resulting in more opportunity to remain in stock during peak periods, as well as the ability to cook smaller batches, ensuring superior culinary.
Additionally, the grill allows for more consistent execution with the same sear and char and maintains better moisture, resulting in juicier chicken and steak with less waste.
Finally, it takes one of the most complex positions in our restaurants and significantly improves the learning curve, making it a more desirable role for our teams. The feedback from our guests and our teams continues to be very positive, and we recently completed the rollout of the dual-sided grill into 10 high volume locations as the next step in the stage gate process.
We also began to do a broader rollout of our new third pan rice cookers, which eliminates our large rice pots and cooks the rice in our third pans that you see on the line. This streamlines the rice cooking process while delivering fresh, high-quality rice that's cooked perfectly to our standards. It can also make single batches, allowing for a faster recovery time, less waste during non-peak periods, and the ability to make white and brown rice at the same time. We have rolled this out to our new restaurants with plans to add it to another 200 existing restaurants this year.
And as part of our Cultivate Next fund, we recently invested in [Veedu], and together we are exploring collaborative robotics that will drive efficiencies and [easy paying] points for our employees. One device that we are in the process of developing cuts, cores, and peels an avocado. It's called the autocado. This co-botic prototype saves time and eliminates a less favorable task, but still allows our teams to hand mash our signature guac. As you can see, all of these initiatives have a common goal, which is to improve the in-restaurant experience for our teams and our guests while maintaining or improving upon our high culinary standards.
I'm really proud of the work the teams are doing to leverage automation, technology, and artificial intelligence, and it was nice to be recognized as one of Time magazine's most innovative companies last month.
Our final key strategy is to expand access and convenience. I'm thrilled to share the addition of Stephen Piacentini as our new Chief Development Officer. Stephen has extensive experience as some of the largest restaurant brands, and will lead our very talented and tenured development team as we look to reach 7,000 restaurants over time in North America. This year, we continue to target 255 to 285 new restaurants with over 80% including a Chipotle, and in fact, this quarter, we opened our 600th Chipotle.
In Canada, performance remains strong with 34 locations, and we are on track to add about 10 new restaurants this year. We had our highest opening day ever in Canada this past quarter, which is a testament to the increasing excitement around the brand and our growth opportunity in the country. We also believe there's even more opportunity on the 7,000 restaurants we were targeting longer term in North America, and we were laying the foundation for further international growth.
For our recent reorganization, we added resources to our European operations, including bringing over one of our top U.S. operators to Europe to drive productivity and better align our operations with the U.S. We look forward to continued progress in Europe over the coming quarters as we aim to set up the region for long-term growth.
And finally, we’ve recently announced our first ever development agreement with the Alshaya Group to open restaurants in the Middle East, which will further accelerate our international efforts. The Alshaya Group has successfully expanded many of the largest global brands into the Middle East, North Africa, and Europe, and they plan to open our first restaurants in Kuwait and United Arab Emirates in 2024.
We're excited to offer guests in the Middle East our responsibly sourced, classically cooked real food and look forward to furthering our purpose to cultivate a better world in this new territory.
In closing, I want to thank our 114,000 employees for all their hard work to reestablish Chipotle standards of excellence in culture of accountability. Earlier this month, Chipotle celebrated its 30th anniversary of the opening of the first Chipotle restaurant in Denver, Colorado. What makes Chipotle special and has driven our success over the last 30 years is our people, our purpose of cultivating a better world, and our focus on delivering exceptional food. Our culinary, using the highest quality ingredients and classic cooking techniques, makes our food delicious.
Our customization, convenience and speed are differentiators and our value is simply tremendous. This has resulted in an industry-leading brand with industry-leading economics and we still have a long runway for growth. We are well positioned to win today while we grow our future over the next 30 years.
And with that, I will turn it over to Jack. Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. Sales in the second quarter grew 14% year-over-year to reach $2.5 billion as comp sales grew 7.4% with over 4% transaction growth. For the third quarter, we anticipate comps in a low to mid-single-digit range driven by transaction growth as we roll off nearly 500 basis points of pricing in early August. We continue to forecast full-year comps in the mid to high single-digit range. Restaurant level margin of 27.5% increased about 230 basis points compared to last year and earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $12.65, representing 36% year-over-year growth.
The second quarter had unusual expenses related to corporate restructuring and corporate and restaurant asset impairments, including the closure of Pizzeria Locale. I'll now go through the key P&L line items beginning with cost of sales.
Cost of sales in the quarter were 29.4%, a decrease of about 100 basis points from last year. The benefit from last year's menu price increases and lower avocado prices were partially offset by elevated costs across the board, most notably in beef, tortillas, dairy, salsa beans, and rice.
For Q3, we expect our cost of sales to be around 30% due to higher beef and avocado prices. Our supply chain team has done a fantastic job at diversifying our avocado exposure, and in the third quarter, the majority of our avocados will come from Peru. While prices are higher than the very favorable levels in the second quarter, we are less impacted from the volatility in the Mexican avocado market.
Labor costs for the quarter were 24.3%, a decrease of about 50 basis points from last year. The benefit from sales leveraged is partially offset by wage inflation, and for Q3, we expect our labor costs to be around 25% reflecting continued labor inflation and seasonally lower sales.
Other operating costs for the quarter were 13.9%, a decrease of about 40 basis points from last year. This decrease was driven by sales leverage. Marketing and promo costs for the quarter were 2.4%, and in Q3, we expect marketing costs to step down to the low 2% range before stepping up in Q4 with a full year to come in right around 3%.
In Q3, other operating costs are expected to be in the mid 14% range. G&A for the quarter was $157 million on a gap basis, or $153 million on a non-gap basis, excluding $3.5 million related to corporate restructuring expenses. As Brian mentioned, we recently went through a review of our organization needs to assure we're well positioned to meet our long-term growth goals. G&A also includes $119 million in underlying G&A, $29 million related to non-cash stock compensation, and $5 million related to higher bonus accruals and payroll taxes on equity, investing, and exercises.
For Q3, we expect our underlying G&A to be around $125 million, and to grow slightly their efforts would make investments in technology and people to support ongoing growth. We anticipate stock comp will be around $31 million in Q3, although this amount could move up or down based on our performance.
We also expect to recognize about $4 million related to performance-based bonus accruals and payroll taxes on equity, investing, and exercises, bringing our anticipated total G&A and Q3 to around $160 million.
Appreciation for the quarter was $79 million at 3.1% of sales, and we expect depreciation to increase slightly each quarter as we continue to open more restaurants. Asset retirement stepped up to $16.2 million, which includes $8.5 million related to corporate and restaurant asset impairments, including the closure of Pizzeria Locale.
In the near term, we expect asset retirement to be around $8 million per quarter as we continue to prioritize the guest experience and focus on great ops. Our effective tax rate for Q2 was 23.8% due to an increase in tax benefits related to option exercises and equity investing. We continue to estimate our underlying effective tax rate will be in a 25% to 27% range, though it may vary each quarter based on discrete items. Our balance sheet remains strong as we enter the quarter with over $1.8 billion in cash, restricted cash, and investments with no debt.
During the second quarter, we repurchased $88 million of our stock at an average price of $1,937. At the end of the quarter, we had $295 million remaining under our share authorization program. We opened 47 new restaurants in the second quarter of which 40 had a chipotle and we remain on track to open between 255 and 285 new restaurants this year with at least 80% including Chipotle. Our development timeline remains extended, but our pipeline remains strong, and we expect to move toward the high end of the 8% to 10% openings range once these timeline challenges subside.
In closing, when I joined Chipotle, we were approaching our 10th anniversary with just over 200 restaurants. We were determined to change the way people think about and eat fast food by preparing delicious, fresh food using classic cooking techniques, sustainably raised, wholesome ingredients, and serving it quickly.
Brian mentioned Chipotle celebrated its 30th anniversary earlier this month, and those fundamental values that made Chipotle successful are still deeply ingrained in our brand. Along the way, we've invested in food with integrity, expanded access and convenience through our digital channel, Chipotle's an international expansion, and continue to innovate within our restaurants to improve the overall experience. We still have a long growth runway ahead, and a talented team excited to continue to build, expand, and evolve our brand and our purpose of cultivating a better world over the next 30 years.
With that, we're happy to take your questions. We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Charles from TD Cowan. Please go ahead. Great, thanks. I wanted to talk about pricing plans in the second half, just given inflation of the beef and avocado categories. What I'm looking to better understand is that is a price increase on the table for December when you historically took price in 2018 through ‘21, or does the resumption of student payments on September 1 that could weigh on restaurant industry spending, leads you to want to bear potentially weight on that and see how that plays out? Yes Andrew, this is Brian. Our approach on pricing has been obviously, it's a lever that we will pull as kind of the last thing we like to pull, but I think we've proven time and time again that the brand is very strong, the value proposition is very strong, and we have that pricing power to use. Obviously, I think you heard Jack's comments. We're seeing some inflationary pressure both on the labor line and in some of the food areas when you pull on avocados. It's something that we're looking hard at, and as we get closer to that fourth quarter, we'll make a decision on exactly what we want to do on the pricing front. I don't know if you want to add anything there, Jack. No, I think Brian summarized it well, but we've had underlying inflation in the last two quarters, but we've had benefits from lower cost avocados, that's offset that, and then also we've got a benefit because Chicken al Pastor has really shifted some of our customers from the more expensive beef into the less expensive chicken, that's been a benefit as well. As those benefits subside, that's when the inflation will flow through, and that's where we'll have a clear view of the inflation impact. We will, as you suggested, look at our customer demand transaction patterns as well before we make any final decisions on price. Okay, that's helpful. Then just on the 3Q guidance, I know that you guys call it out that you're seeing about five-year base points of price that rolls off in August. Can you just comment as well about the lower income consumer? I know last quarter you guys were talking about sequentially. They were seeing some strength in that consumer. I just wanted to know what you guys have seen in recent months to relate to that consumer. Yes, I mean, this is one of the elements of, I guess, the consumer demonstrating how resilient they are. Both the lower income consumer and kind of our higher income consumer are showing really good strength. I think that's why we had such a strong traffic performance in the quarter, and we continue to exit that quarter with really healthy traffic or transaction trends. So we're not seeing any weakness in the lower income consumer. If anything, they've continued to improve, and we're feeling really good about the value proposition. We're providing all income levels. Very helpful. Thanks, guys. The next question comes from David Tarantino from Baird. Please go ahead. Hi. Good afternoon. First question, I just want to clarify how you're thinking about the third quarter from a comps’ perspective. And maybe, Jack, if you can just talk about the underlying traffic trend you're assuming in the third quarter relative to what you saw in the second quarter and whether that would imply any slowdown versus what you've been running? Yes, David, the components of our guidance just give kind of general ranges, and the menu price increase remaining after the August from last year rolls off will be called in that 2.5%, 2.6% range. We're still expecting positive transactions throughout the quarter. In fact, we expect the transactions will probably be in the plus 3% to plus 3.5% range, somewhere in that range. We're still seeing a little bit of a mixed impact. Our group size continues to normalize as people are returning to work, and so there's less of a channel shift between digital and in restaurant ordering, but we are seeing that the group size is lowering. So this is the hardest part to predict, but we're assuming that somewhere in that two-ish range, we'll see a negative mix because the group size, somewhere in that 2% range. So those are the general components we're thinking about. And Jack, when you seasonally adjust the trends, would it imply a slowdown or is this more of the same of what you delivered in the second quarter? I just want to make sure I understand whether you're seeing a slowdown in traffic. Yes, so there is a subtle seasonality shift that we're seeing, David. We saw in early June as schools were letting out and as people started traveling more, we saw a little bit of an inflection point in transactions. We also, when we stratified our restaurants, we did see that restaurants in more touristy areas were benefiting, restaurants in non-touristy areas were a little bit softer. And just recently, within the last week, week and a half or so, we're starting to see some normalization of that.
So we're still reading through that. We assume there's not going to be a full bounce back in the fourth quarter, but we did assume the normalization, or the rest of the third quarter, but we did assume that the normalization that we're seeing last week or so, that some of that will continue. So we're still trying to do a read-through, but it looks like there was maybe a little early vacation taking this year that didn't necessarily happen last year. Great. Thank you. The next question comes from Sara Senatore from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Great. Thank you. I just wanted to talk about throughput in the context of that sounds like the traffic's fairly stable. You talked about new equipment. I understand that cooktimes are down pretty dramatically. Could you translate that into, some sort of throughput measure and kind of what you're seeing both presently and then what the opportunity is, I guess, as we think about throughput, the capacity is one side, but then making sure that, you have enough demand there to move the customers through and I'm trying to sort of understand the dynamics there. So anything you can tell us about throughput now and what you're seeing with the new equipment? And then I'll just have a quick follow-up. Yes, sure. So we've made some really good progress on the throughput side, but we're not all the way to where we want to be. I think I mentioned this earlier, where the good news is we now consistently probably have three people on the front line, but really what that needs to be is four people in order for us to achieve kind of our pillars of great throughput. And that's probably why we're retrenching again on throughput, kind of going forward here. But as I mentioned in my comments earlier, in the places where we've seen restaurants or patches adopts I'll call great throughput execution and you're definitely seeing a move on to the two three to five transactions in their best 15 minutes. So, we know it's out there, we just seem to do it as an entire enterprise and we're focused on that piece going forward.
As it relates to equipment and other tools to help us become even I say more efficient and faster, the double-sided grills are now in 10 restaurants and so not obviously across the system by any means but rather just move into our stage gate process that just enabled cooking times to dramatically decrease. So, checking goes from 12 minutes to three to four minutes, stage goes from three or four minutes to a minute. It makes the position a lot easier, it makes the culinary much more consistent and then obviously it gives us much more capacity on the plancha. So, that's where we are with that.
And then things like avocado and raisin very much still into pilot phase meaning like prototype phase but we're pretty optimistic about what both of those can do for us but we're not in any restaurants yet with either one of those items. And then just to sort of clarify as to follow-up is even through or again throughput and we've seen some really nice improvement in the last couple of quarters and transaction and traffic growth here it sounds like that anticipation as that'll be fairly stable. I understand the comparisons I entered that like would you expect a kind of another step change in traffic as some of what you're talking about best practices sort of disseminate across the system again just to understand how to translate throughput. Yes. No, absolutely. I mean I think there is a real opportunity for and not only the continued strength in traffic but a step up in traffic. As we get better at executing the tortilla is a throughput in, now that's why I wanted to get that example of the one restaurant in New York. That restaurant's outperforming a region, that's doing a really nice job. And the reason is because they are executing every element of our throughput tilla's with excellence. And so, as that happens more consistently across more patches or more restaurants. We anticipate we're going to see increases both in traffic and total comp.
So, obviously that comes with time, we're dealing with a 110,000 employees that need to learn what great throughput is and what it looks like. But the teams making great progress, we're focused on it and I'm confident we're going to need a culture of throughput building this organization. Great. Thank you, very much. The next question comes from Danilo Gargiulo of Bernstein. Please go ahead. Thank you. So, with the low-to-mid single-digit expected comp since 3Q, what is giving you the confidence to meaningfully accelerate a trajectory in 4Q to meet the full-year guidance, especially as we think about the 4Q compatible sales potentially becoming more from traffic versus from versus from pricing action. What actions are you contemplating to sustain the momentum? Yes. I mean, obviously we're going to stay first and foremost on enhancing our operational performance as it relates to throughput. So, that will be a piece of the puzzle. We've got a new menu item that we'll be bringing out after we finish the run on Chicken Al Pastor and then obviously role will evaluate what component and pricing it has in the fourth quarter as well given some of the inflationary pressures we're seeing. So, you line those things up plus the strength of the trend that we already have and we feel really good about our full-year guidance. Thank you. And maybe beyond this year or thinking a bit more multi-year on a multi-year basis, historically you have it secured it a more constant international roll out across Canada and Europe. So, what drove you to on the statement sizing and specifically why are you starting with the Middle East. So, can we expect a combination of co-op and concise mixing international market or is this more in a monetary step to fine tune your international expansion plans going forward? Yes. So, you can probably anticipate more of a mix. We still believe company ownership in Western Europe makes a lot of sense. We just had the opportunity to visit with the team there and in the last week or so, and we're making great progress in London, Frankfurt, and obviously Paris. I mean, as we mentioned in the call too, Canada continues to really perform. So, we're going to fill 10 new restaurants on a base of 34. So, you can see how we're stepping up the development there and the team they face to a great job.
As it relates to the Middle East and the partnership with Alshaya. As we looked around the world, we see there are certain regions where it's like hey this makes a lot of sense for us to partner as opposed to try and go at it on our own. The Middle East is that region, Chipotle as a concept based on the work we've done, we believe it will resonate and perform really well. And then, when we have the opportunity to partner with Alshaya which we believe is one of the best operators in the region, we thought this is a great opportunity for us to experience what it's like to work with a great operator in more of a franchise environment.
So, we're optimistic, we're excited about getting those restaurants opened in Dubai, and Kuwait, and we look forward to a really successful partnership with them. But we're really excited about where international can go both from a standpoint of partnerships and then company ownership. The next question comes from David Palmer from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Thanks. First I wanted to follow-up on the double sided growth question and then touch on the personalized marketing. On the double sided growth, you mentioned you're in 10 stores now and that it's maybe a third of the cook times. What is the pace that you anticipate on rolling that out and in as far as the metrics that we would focus on, what do you think ultimately would be the benefit to sales and profit from those growth? So, look we're obviously really excited about what we're already seeing just in the 10 restaurants both from a standpoint of yield, quality of culinary and then the team's ability to execute over and over again. So, the excitement around the new cooking equipment is terrific you see because that means we're going to get the execution that we want. To rule this out this product a year plus project, and the good news is the manufacturers have the capability to scale to what we need once we give them the green line. So, we're pretty excited about this because obviously the bigger the volumes get with the amount of transactions that we're doing, the fact that we now have even more capacity on the plancha, is a terrific outcome.
And then it turns one of the harder jobs to train into one of the easiest jobs to train. And when the culinary is consistent, people get great chicken or steak, we know they love to pull in they come back. So, and we're still dialing through all the components of the puts and calls on this but it looks very promising based on where we are in the first 10 stores. Thanks for that. And my first one is marketing. I think you recently launched that this seems to be something that would have a long runway to it where you could have different iteration and ultimately having AI be a component to it. Are we already seeing anything different from personalized marketing, where do you see this going and maybe give us a sense of how this could be impacting your business going forward? Thanks. Yes, sure. I mean, look, probably the most visible spot is just in the app with the suggestive sale. You'll see already some personalization on what we're offering and as far as recommendations go to add the order based on your history with the brand, and then obviously this goes all the way into the cohorts and the journeys that then we create. And we believe you do this across our 35 million rewards customers and now has meaningful scale where the customization results in loyalty that results in obviously additional sale. So, the most visible space, probably you'll see it in the app at the web, and then it's probably more new launched in how we communicate awesomely communicate with you and what exactly we say to you.
But all the experiments we're running, we're continuing to see nice positive outcomes with every iteration that we do. The next big step for us is to roll this out in a way where it covers a lot more people at much more meaningful scale so that you feel it on the entire enterprise. All right. Thank you. The next question comes from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Hi, thank you. I actually want to meet with a comment about excess capacity on the planche. It's actually an interesting point. Do you think that it significantly broadens additional product opportunities that you totally can do? I mean that, double-sided grill takes care that, the chicken and the steak and presumably, maybe the planche can be used for something different than what you're already selling. How big of an opportunity is that in your mind? I mean, look, we always want to make sure we execute the menu with excellence. And we like the cadence that we're doing as far as new menu items go right now. But yes, it definitely frees up the capacity, which then allows us to evaluate how we do new menu items and maybe how long we want to keep certain menu items on. And so that is a big unlock for us. I'd say the biggest benefit, though is and when the restaurant opens at 10.30, you don't have to start cooking chicken at eight in the morning. Because now we can be ready for that lunch business closer to the timing of lunch because it just takes a lot less time to cook all the chicken to be prepared. It also allows us to recover a lot faster.
So in the event, you have a really big, lunch push at 11, you have the ability to recover for that lunch push that might be coming at 12. And so these are the things that I think are going to be really powerful for us going forward. And then also the simplicity at which the cooking creates for the team members is a big unlock too because then the culinary is just that much better every single time. Yes, I got it. And I agree in experience. Let me turn it to another question. You've been alluding to, including on this call, upward bias to the 7000 North American store target. I guess, are you prepared to start thinking about numbers and there's a thousands at thousands. And I want to ask it in a question some years ago. I remember, I don't remember exactly when it was, it used to be discussed that Chipotle would be a $10 billion brand. Well, here we are in '23 and all likelihood it will be a $10 billion brand. Sorry for that. If you were to just look at the overall North American opportunity today, and I guess to some extent free the economy, how big of a brand do you think Chipotle could be just based on what you know about, the North American consumer market today in terms of how big we could expand from here? Yes, sure. I mean, look, we're not ready to change the number yet, but the good news is the economics of every new restaurant that we open continue to be just terrific economics, where hopefully we'll get closer to the higher end of that age to 10% once kind of we work through a little bit of the bottleneck that we have on development. But I believe we're going to continue to grow the four wall revenue and then obviously the economics that come with it.
So without even moving the $7,000 store count, if you all of a sudden find yourself at $3 million, $4 million average unit volumes, you're in that $20 to $28 billion range. So lots of growth in front of us. And that's without having to be really all that aggressive. That is just executing the plan we've been talking about. And I think as long as Chipotle stays focused on great culinary, great throughput, developing team members so that we're ready to go when we open new restaurants, the number will grow. I think Jack told me when the company first went public, what was the number Jack? 3000. We said we were going to maybe do 3000 restaurants. So here we are. We're at 3000 restaurants. I'm sure as we continue to grow both the AUVs will go up and the store council will go up. But yes, it's pretty fun to think about we're closing it on $10 billion and then I'm sure we'll be talking about $20 billion and then probably from there we'll be talking about $30 billion. So I don't see a cap on this business anytime soon. Excellent. Thank you so much. The next question comes from Brian Mullan from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Hey, thank you. Just a question on automation, robotics in general. Hypothetically, if all your combined efforts were to yield a couple hundred base points of margin over, the next many number of years, are you inclined to want to let that all fall to the bottom line? Or perhaps would you want to let some of it fall to the bottom line and then spun the consumer value proposition with the rest? Maybe it's too early to say just wondering if you're already having those questions internally, even if it's just philosophical right now. Yes, look, I mean, obviously the good news for us is. We aren't capital constrained to invest in continuing to drive the Chipotle business, both in growth and in value as it relates to giving a great experience for a customer and a great experience for a team member. So obviously as we get closer, we'll have a better idea of how much of it falls to the bottom line. But, right now I'm hoping a lot of it falls to the bottom line. But we'll know a lot more as we get closer to when we roll it out. Thank you. The next question comes from Chris O'Cull from Stifel. Please go ahead. Hi, thanks for taking the question. Brian, it sounds like the hyphen make line is close to that testing stage. So, can you help us understand how long you expect it to be in that phase and maybe walk through what the validation stage could look like? I'm also curious if you could describe what KPI is the team's monitoring to determine the success of that make line? Yes, sure. So we have an inter-cultivate center right now. It's fun to see it actually producing bulls and the team has done a phenomenal job of taking this from, a concept to a prototype to now a working prototype. We've learned a lot. We're getting ready to figure out what the next gen version on this is, but it looks really promising. Obviously, key components of this are how fast can it do bulls, per 10 minutes, how accurate can it do the bulls, and then obviously our ability to expedite those bulls, meaning getting it to the customer in the correct order.
So we think assuming the prototype continues to evolve and grow the way it has demonstrated its growth over time, we'll have something to be putting into restaurants here in the next 12 to 18 months. So optimistic about where this gets to, but it's one thing to run it in our cultivate center. It's another thing to run it in a restaurant. And until we run it in a restaurant, it's hard to really talk about the benefits or what the timing is of it. But conceptually, and what it looks like right now, still very promising a top priority to figure out how we get this thing into a restaurant sooner rather than later. Great. And then I just had a follow-up. Jack, the step up in the underlying G&A run rate was pretty considerable. Can you break down maybe what's driving that in a little more detail, and then how we should be thinking about the core run rate in the fourth quarter, and then maybe even just underlying growth for the out year? Yes. I mean, any increase in our underlying G&A is around some of the things that Brian mentioned, and it was part of our review where we're investing in resources for Europe. We're adding resources, frankly, for some of the innovation that we're talking about in terms of probiotics and things like that. There's some items in there where our equity, we're expecting our equity based on our projections. We'll step up. These are three-year calculations that you're making.
So, but in terms of underlying G&A, it's going to be either people to support our growth or tech to support our growth. We haven't given fourth quarter guidance, but I would expect there'd be another slight, a step up from Q3. Not a huge step up, but a modest step up. As we make sure we've got our teams all stepped up for the growth that we want to support, not just for this year but for the next several years going forward. Great. Thanks, guys. The next question comes from Jon Tower from Citi. Please go ahead. Great. Thanks. I just wanted to dig into development a little bit. And, Jack, I know you and your prepared remarks talked about some delays in the system, and I was hoping maybe you could drill into it a little bit, especially as you're thinking about, getting to that 8%-10% range in terms of unit growth over time. Can you really get into what's driving some of the delays in the market today? Is it, say, local market permitting, builder or developer issues, or are there problems with accessing equipment? I was hoping you could flesh that out for us. Yes, it's not really equipment anymore. That was a challenge through the pandemic, and as we got out of the pandemic, but our teams have done a good job to pre-order, so we had bulk ordering. We've had good relations with our suppliers, so we get priority. So it's really down to things that are city, under the city control, like getting utilities to the site. Sometimes it takes us weeks to just get somebody, to come out and make sure that we have utilities in, that are coming to the site. It does involve things like permitting, and then you talk about inspections as well.
So it's really a lot of these cities, what we're hearing from our teams is that a lot of them are still working remote. And so to get somebody to show up when they need to show up and do the work has been a real challenge. Now, what we're doing, Chris is here and Chris has been sending this message to the team is, we really got to rise to the city, okay? We have to make sure we're calling, calling, calling because they're doing some work and whether they're working at home or whether they're working in the office, they're doing some work. Let's make sure that we're at the top of the list, that they're hearing those often. And if they hear us more often, it's likely they're going to move it. So that's the strategy to try to hopefully remove that bottleneck. Got it. And just pivoting to the throughput initiatives, I appreciate all the training you guys have been doing. I'm just curious, I know Brian, you mentioned that, like, even on the make lines, making sure people, four people are on the front line at peak. Do you think you need to add labor hours to stores? Is it purely just getting people back to the aces and their places kind of belief? Yes, no, it's more to do with getting the trust in the team to have the confidence to stay aces and places. Just yesterday I was in a restaurant and staffed, the deployment was right, the culinary was right, the restaurant looked great. Unfortunately, we didn't have aces and places. You had too many people leaving the line to do other tasks that they shouldn't have been doing when they got a line to the door. And I think once they understand that they stay in those places, they'll power through that line to then go take care of the tasks accordingly.
So I think it's an element of they got to see it for themselves, they got to experience it, they got to trust it, because sometimes it's hard. I mean, it's hard to just stay in position when you, think you might need some more napkins out by the drink station. It's like, well, hang in there, get through the line, and then you can go put additional napkins in the drink station.
So I think it's a component of they need experiences with it so that they can trust it. And I know Scott and the team are laser focused on getting the pillars of great throughput back into our culture, not just as an initiative. And the good news is, we're staffed, turnover is looking really good at the general manager level. And we're now in the low 20s. So their leader is staying much more consistent. I think you have consistency in leadership, consistency in message, we'll get consistency in execution. So I'm very optimistic about where Scott and the operators are going to get us to when it comes to throughput. Got it. Thanks. And then just lastly, I know your, your lines are somewhat capacity constrained. So in terms of adding additional items to the menu, not always easy, often times at the rotate, but with,-- I think chicken al Pastor, I believe you said about 20% of your mix, transaction mix came from that during the period. So how, how, when do we think about that potentially becoming a permanent menu item? Well, look, it's something we definitely will go back and evaluate. Obviously this was one that struck a chord with a lot of people and I can understand why it tastes great and it is great. So we'll reevaluate if and when it makes sense to bring it back, how long we bring it back for, and if it should be a permanent item. The challenge for us is I think if you, we wanted to add something permanent, we got to remove something. So, that'd be something that we have to work through to just make sure we understand the trade off. Got it. Thanks for taking the questions. Yes. The next question comes from Dennis Geiger from UBS. Please go ahead. Great. Thank you. Just wondering if you could provide a breakdown of the, the traffic price and mix for the, for the two queue. I think you gave the, the traffic component, but if you could kind of loosely break out those, those others, that'd be helpful. Yes. The traffic, I mentioned traffic in my comments, better than 4%, you know, on a positive side on traffic, the menu price increase was in the mid five, I call it 5.5, 5.6, something like that. And then we had this, this mix item that I've mentioned, we're talking about the third quarter that actually reduced the comp by about 2.5%. And that, that mix is entirely due to group size. The group sizes continue to normalize as we continue, you're watching people going back to the office. You're seeing our, our urban locations, our outcomping or suburban location. So there's still been a normalization since the pandemic and our group sizes are still continuing to normalize. They're still group size. They're still ahead of where we were in 2019 before the pandemic, but they, they continue to normalize pretty much each quarter. Very helpful Jack. Just one or just, I know mix is probably a tough one group size in particular to, to predict. You give us the, the three queue as we look to the end of the year. Can that still be, I think closer to flat by the end of the year, or is that a little bit of a moving target given, given group size behaviors? And maybe that's tough to predict. Thank you. Yes, I don't think it'll be totally flat, but it should narrow. In this current quarter, we're about 1% group size over where we were in 2019. If you look at Q3 and Q4, they were about 3% to 4% it was, it was, 4% and Q3, 3% and Q4. So we've still got a gap there. That's still to close, but it should diminish the two and a half that we saw on Q2 should diminish each quarter. I don't think it'll be totally flat by the end of the year though. Thanks, Jack. Appreciate it. The next question comes from Brian Harbour from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. Jack, could you just elaborate on some of the food cost drivers? I mean, you mentioned kind of what's, what's really driven a year-over-year, but maybe just versus last quarter versus some of your expectations. I'm sure avocado is part of it, but anything else. And also just as we, think about the rest of the year, will this new item, affect food costs in any way that we should think about? Yes. I mean, during, during the quarter, we had just a number of things that just had a slight increase. We had, some of our salsas or tortillas, our rice, our spices and all those, if you look at just the quarter, and if you look at the quarter consecutively, so Q2 versus Q1 that added like 40 or 50 basis points, but those were offset by a combination of favorable avocados compared to last year, as well as chicken al Pastor, as I mentioned before, it actually did ship people from steak and barbacoa, which is more, more expensive, higher food costs to our chicken, which is a lower food cost. So we've had this, just call it low grade inflation.
That's been hitting the P&L the last couple of quarters, but it's been offset by favorable avocados and then favorable mix. One reason why, as we look forward into the, into the third quarter we do think there's going to be a bump up in food costs. And that's really attributable to this same kind of low grade inflation that we expect will continue into Q3 but we're not going to have as avocado prices normalize. And as we shipped away from chicken al pastor, we won't have that kind of offset to offset some of the inflation that we're seeing. Okay. Thanks. Could you also just elaborate on what you said about Europe? And I guess the, the broader question is just how fast might we see that grow as we start to think about the next few years? Yes, look, I think very similar to what we did with Canada is the way to think about Europe, once we get performance consistent in Europe, like we did in Canada, we'll start building much more aggressively. The team is very much focused on ensuring that we're building a brand. And as we build the brand, we have the economics that support building a lot of restaurants and like I mentioned Jack, myself and Scott, we were just over there and the team has a terrific plan. The thing I love to see is when I was in, Frankfurt, Germany, there were a lot of Germans in a Chipotle enjoying Chipotle.
When we were in London, there were a lot of Brits enjoying Chipotle. The thing that I also saw was a lot of people walked up at the restaurant and had no idea of what Chipotle is. So we still have a real opportunity to build a brand. And while we build that brand, ensure that we've got great economics that justify, building a lot more restaurants. Canada is a perfect example.
We put a great leader in place there and not she's headed out of the park, the economics perform. She's doing a nice job of growing the brand, not surprising. We're building a lot of restaurants. So, most recently, we just sent one of our top operators over to London to be a part of that team, lead the team with that work that he's putting in place. I'm already seeing, big, big improvements in operational execution and I'm confident the economics will follow and I'm confident we'll build a terrific brand. So assuming that all happens, you can see us then quickly being able to invest into building a lot more restaurants in those countries.
So I think we've been pretty consistent on this. It's like we're in no rush to just start building restaurants for the sake of building restaurants. We want to have people that are ready to go. We want to have economics that makes sense and then we want to have a great brand that we can execute against time and time again. So that's served us well in the United States. It's serving us well in Canada. I believe it'll serve us well in Europe. Thank you. And the last question comes from Zach Fadem from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Okay, good afternoon. This is John Park on for Zach. I guess on the franchising side, are there any more details you guys can provide on your new agreement with Alshaya? I guess around like the number of units in the initial development agreement, anything on the royalty rates, things like that. Not really. We're just getting started with Alshaya. We're excited to get the first couple of restaurants open. Obviously, both of us have expectations of a lot more restaurants than just a handful. And I'm confident we're going to have great openings and this is going to turn into something that hopefully Alshaya considers a huge success and we consider a huge success. So more details to come, but we probably need to open the first one. Got it. And then just kind of switching gears a little bit. On the labor side, have you guys kind of started to see any leveling out of wage inflation for new hires as you kind of move through Q2 and into Q3? I would say it's more normal. It's in the 4%, 3% in that range. So there's still inflation. It's another consideration as we look at our model, look at our margins when we take pricing action. So it's not anything we can't handle. The great news is the applications are coming in. Our restaurants are doing a great job of staffing the restaurants. They're doing a great job of getting our restaurants to model. So this is, I would call it again, kind of a low grade normal inflation going forward. Nothing that our model can't absorb. Great, thanks a lot. This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Brian Niccol for any closing remarks. All right, thank you. And thanks everybody for all the questions. I'll just wrap up with, again, I think Chipotle's demonstrated an excellent quarter. And I think it demonstrates the strength of our business. Very proud of what our teams have accomplished in the field. If I think about where we are today versus where we were a year ago, we are operating these restaurants significantly better. I believe there's still a lot of upside in our ability to drive throughput going forward. I'm confident the teams are focused on it and we're going to, see that happen.
The other thing that I'm really excited about in our business is that we're growing our business through traffic growth, and we're doing it, in my opinion, the right way, where we're continuing to drive our value proposition forward with great culinary, great people, and obviously great new restaurant opening. So very proud of our results, very optimistic about the future, and look forward to sharing our results next quarter with you all. Take care. The conference has now concluded.

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian. Thanks, Cindy, and good afternoon, everyone. Our focus on exceptional food and exceptional people continues to drive strong results, including positive transaction trends that accelerated throughout the quarter. 
For the quarter, sales grew over 11% to reach $2.5 billion driven by a 5% comp. Digital sales represent 5% comp. Digital sales represented 37% of sales, restaurant-level margin was 26.3%, an increase of 100 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted diluted EPS was $11.36, representing 19% growth over last year and we opened 62 new restaurants, including 54 Chipotlanes. 
Trends remained strong in October, and we anticipate comps in the mid to high which includes our recent pricing action.

Beginning with running successful restaurants with a people accountable culture. It was exactly a year ago that we made a big effort internally to get back to Chipotle's standard of excellence, and I'm proud of the progress our restaurant teams have made over the course of the year. This includes staffing and turnover that are back to or better than pre-pandemic levels. Restaurants that are prepped and ready, resulting in fewer outages, improvements in on-time and accuracy on the digital makeline and continued progress on throughput. Our focus on ops is strengthening a core piece of our value proposition, which is customized, delicious culinary served quickly with great hospitality. 
As a result of improvements in operational execution, along with keeping our menu pricing accessible, our value proposition has never been stronger. This is certainly translating to great results with transaction comps positive all year and up over 4% in the third quarter.
While we are sitting on a strong foundation, we see an opportunity to be even better, particularly when it comes to throughput. We have 2 key initiatives that we recently rolled out that we believe will drive further improvement. 
The first is adjusting the cadence of digital orders to better balance the deployment of labor, eliminating the need to pull a crew member from the front makeline to help the digital makeline during peak periods. And the second is a renewed focus on throughput training in our restaurants by bringing back a coaching tool that we had in place prior to the pandemic.
Feedback from our restaurant teams on these 2 initiatives has been very positive, and we are seeing that restaurants that have the right cadence of orders on the digital makeline and that are executing the 4 pillars of throughput are seeing an improvement of 4 to 5 entrees in their peak 15-minute period. 
As I mentioned in the past, we hold our teams to a high standard because when they achieve it, they feel like they are part of a winning team with the ability to be rewarded through bonuses and growth within the organization.
For our crew members, throughput is a key performance factor in the crew member bonus plan. It is also a component of the bonus measure for general managers, field leaders, team directors and regional vice presidents. As we coach and make progress on throughput, they will enable more restaurants to achieve their quarterly bonus and importantly, will drive a better overall experience for our guests and our teams. 
Speaking of our teams, we recently brought back our Behind the Foil campaign, which features our crew members, giving a glimpse into daily preparation using real ingredients and classic culinary techniques, a key differentiator for Chipotle. The fact is we don't have freezers in our restaurants and our teams begin preparing at 6 or 7:00 in the morning to be able to serve our delicious food by the time we open at 10:30. This includes grilling fajita veggies, and adobo chicken on the planchas, slicing and dicing onions, jalapenos and cilantro by hand, also hand-mashing avocados to make our signature guacamole and making our chips fresh every day.
This campaign is a great way to put a spotlight on our talented teams and their hard work to prepare our exceptional food. 
One of our team directors that's featured in Behind the Foil started as a crew member and within 7 years, moved his way up to team director, managing a subregion of 49 restaurants at just 29 years old. His passion for the brand and helping to deliver an excellent customer experience has driven his success. In fact, he is one of the best-performing subregions across the company. He truly believes in Chipotle's purpose, and wants to position his team to be able to replicate the same opportunities that have been given to him.
Our people are our greatest asset and developing future leaders is critical in delivering on our growth goals of reaching 7,000 restaurants longer term and surpassing 90% internal promotions. We will continue to find ways like our Behind the Foil campaign to celebrate our team's growth, hard work, success and passion for Chipotle. In addition to this campaign, our marketing team has done an outstanding job in finding authentic ways to make the brand more visible, more relevant and more loved.
Last month, we brought back our fan favorite and highly requested carne asada as a limited time offer and the reception has surpassed our expectations. Carne asada is a delicious combination of responsibly raised premium cuts of steak, seasoned on the grill with a blend of signature spices that's finished with freshly squeezed lime and hand-chopped cilantro. We also introduced an entirely new way to try carne asada with the carne asada quesadilla and it's just truly delicious.
I'm really proud of the cross-functional effort it took to make sure we could bring back this popular LTO, which is especially impressive given that we estimate only about 5% of U.S. beef meats our Food with Integrity standards. 
In sports, as college football season kicked off, we leveraged our Real Food for Real Athletes platform to partner with players and teams to showcase their inspiring journeys, their love for Chipotle and how our food can help them perform their best by providing proper nutrition.
We also leverage creative gaming integrations as a fun way to connect with some of our biggest fans. We brought back Chipotle IQ in August as a one-of-a-kind digital trivia game, testing the knowledge of Chipotle's real ingredients, leading food standards, culinary techniques, sustainability efforts, brand history and community engagement.
Shifting to amplifying technology, we're making progress on a couple of innovations that ultimately could help to improve the overall experience for our restaurant teams and our guests. The first is our automated digital makeline, which we recently installed at our cultivate center to test and learn on.
Through our partnership with Hyphen, we've been testing Hyphen makeline, which fits into our existing digital makeline footprint and automatically makes bowls down below with the ability for our team to build tacos, burritos, kids meals and quesadillas on top.
There are many reasons why we are excited about automating the digital makeline, such as increased capacity and improved speed and accuracy, which could further help with the balance of labor between the front makeline and the digital makeline. 
Additionally, Autocado, which cuts cores and scoops avocado is also at our Cultivate Center and our restaurant teams are providing feedback to be included in the next phase of the prototype. As we mentioned last quarter, Autocado could save time and eliminate a less favorable task, but still allow for one of their favorite parts of the job, which is to add in freshly chopped onions, jalapenos and cilantro, seasoned with some citrus and salt, and hand mashed or signature guac.
While we still have some iterations to make to Hyphen and Autocado before they're ready to be tested at a restaurant, I am excited about the progress the team is making, and we will continue to provide updates on the path through the stage-gate process. 
Finally, moving to expanding access and convenience. We are on track to reach our guidance range of opening between 255 to 285 new restaurants this year, which will mark a record for the company. And we surpassed 700 Chipotlanes this quarter. As we look out to 2024, we anticipate opening between 285 to 315 new restaurants with at least 80% having a Chipotlane. 
This month, we opened our first location in Calgary. This was the first entrance into a new market in Canada since we entered Vancouver in 2012, and it is clear there is strong demand for Chipotle with opening day sales hitting a new company record. The team in Canada has done an outstanding job with company-leading throughput on the front line and on time and accuracy on the digital makeline. AUV's margins and returns are on par with the U.S., and I remain very confident in Canada's long-term growth potential. 
Outside of North America, we have outlined a plan for Europe to deliver economics that would support accelerated growth. This includes improving our operations by aligning our training tools, systems and culinary with our U.S. operations where it makes sense and is feasible as well as building brand awareness.
Similar to our strategy when we first entered new markets in the U.S., we are building brand awareness in Europe through more local initiatives like partnering with local universities, local sports teams and focusing on activities, which gets our food into the hands of potential guests.
The good news is our restaurants are staffed stable and the talent we have coming through is exciting.
Finally, in the Middle East, we are collaborating with Alshaya Group across development, culinary, supply chain and food safety to support a successful opening of our restaurants next year in Kuwait and Dubai. 
In closing, I remain really excited about all the growth ahead of us, both in the U.S. and internationally. I want to thank our restaurant and support center teams for all their hard work and dedication to Chipotle. Our results demonstrate that we have a winning team that sets high standards and delivers.
We have a lot of opportunity in front of us, and we will continue to push the boundaries of what is possible in terms of running great restaurants, with exceptional people, exceptional food and fast throughput.
I'm more confident than ever that we have created the foundation to achieve our aggressive growth goals and further our purpose of cultivating a better world.
With that, I'll turn it over to Jack. Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. Sales in the third quarter grew over 11% year-over-year to reach $2.5 billion as comp sales grew 5% with over 4% transaction growth. Restaurant-level margin of 26.3% increased about 100 basis points compared to last year, and earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $11.36, representing 19% year-over-year growth. The third quarter had $1 million in unusual expenses related to corporate restructuring.
Looking ahead to Q4, based on the trends we've seen so far in the quarter, including mid-single-digit transaction comps, we anticipate comps in the mid- to high single-digit range, which includes our recent price increase of about 3%.
As reminder in the fourth quarter, we will reevaluate estimated loyalty breakage for points projected to expire, which may require a catch-up adjustment that could have a negative or positive impact on our comps, and that's not factored into our guidance. We continue to forecast full year comps in the mid- to high single-digit range.
I'll now go through the key P&L line items, beginning with cost of sales. Cost of sales in the quarter were 29.7%, a decrease of about 10 basis points from last year. The benefit from last year's menu price increases was mostly offset by inflation across several food costs, most notably beef and queso. For Q4, we expect our cost of sales to be right around 30% as the benefit of the menu price increase we just took will be offset by the mix shift from Chicken al Pastor to carne asada as well as higher cheese and avocado prices. 
Labor costs for the quarter were 24.9%, a decrease of about 20 basis points from last year. The benefit from sales leverage was mostly offset by wage inflation. And for Q4, we expect labor cost to be in the mid-25% range as the benefit of the menu price increase will be offset by continued labor inflation. And within our guidance, we anticipate a similar level of paid time off and other benefits that we experienced in the fourth quarter of last year.
Other operating costs for the quarter were 14%, a decrease of about 50 basis points from last year. This decrease was primarily driven by sales leverage. Marketing and promo costs for the quarter were 2% and in Q4, we expect marketing costs to step up to the mid-3% range with the full year to come in just below 3%. In Q4, other operating costs are expected to be in the low 15% range. 
G&A for the quarter was $159 million on a GAAP basis of $158 million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding $1 million related to corporate restructuring expenses. G&A also included $120 million in underlying G&A, $34 million related to noncash stock compensation. $3 million related to higher bonus accruals and payroll taxes on equity vesting and exercises and $1 million related to our upcoming All Managers' Conference, which is scheduled for Q1 of next year.  For Q4, we expect our underlying G&A to be around $125 million and to grow slightly thereafter as we make investments in technology and people to support ongoing growth. 
We anticipate stock comp will be around $33 million in Q4, although this amount could move up or down based on our actual performance.
We also expect to recognize about $3 million related to performance-based bonus accruals and payroll taxes and equity vesting exercises and $2 million related to our All Managers' Conference, bringing our anticipated total G&A in Q4 to around $163 million.
We anticipate the preopening expenses to be around $15 million in Q4 to the cadence of new restaurant openings. And as a reminder, about half of preopening expense is noncash preopening rent related to straight-line accounting rules. 
Depreciation for the quarter was $79 million or 3.2% of sales and for Q4, we anticipate depreciation expense to step up by $4 million to $5 million due to a larger number of expected new restaurant openings.
Asset retirements was $7.2 million in the quarter and in Q4, we expect asset retirement to be around $8 million as we continue to focus on proactive equipment replacement as we prioritize the guest experience through great operations. 
Our effective tax rate for Q3 was 24.2%, which benefited from higher-than-expected tax credits. We continue to estimate our underlying effective tax rate will be in the 25% to 27% range that may vary each quarter based on discrete items.
Our balance sheet remains strong as we ended the quarter with over $1.9 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments with no debt.
During the third quarter, we repurchased $226 million of our stock at an average price of $1,914 more than 2.5x our Q2 purchases as we were optimistic as the market softened. At the end of the quarter, we had $368 million remaining under our share authorization program.
We opened 62 new restaurants in the third quarter, of which 54 had a Chipotlane. And we remain on track to open between 255 to 285 new restaurants this year. And as Brian mentioned, we plan to open between 285 and 315 new restaurants in 2024, of which at least 80% will have a Chipotlane.
We anticipate that our time line will remain extended, which is preventing us from reaching the higher end of our 8% to 10% new restaurant opening guidance range in 2024. We continue to see permitting and inspection delays, utility installation delays along with developers delaying projects due to macro pressures and rising interest rates.
Considering our current pipeline and time line and assuming conditions do not worsen from here, we believe we can approach 10% new restaurant openings by 2025.
To conclude, I want to once again thank our 114,000 employees for treasuring our guests and earning every single customer visit. We have exceptional people working hard every day to serve exceptional food to our guests, and that shows through these terrific results. As Brian mentioned, we have a lot of opportunity in front of us and as we continue to make meaningful progress in improving the guest experience through faster throughput in our restaurants. This will further strengthen our brand and industry-leading economic model and continue to position us for long-term growth. 
With that, we're happy to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sara Senatore with Bank of America. I just wanted to ask about unit growth, if I may, both the U.S. and then Europe. Jack, you noted that you could get to the high end of that 8% to 10% for 2025. I guess I'm curious how or what you're doing to sort of address the construction permitting delays that I think should probably continue. Are you sort of widening the funnel in terms of the sites that you identify and the kind of work you do to start? I guess I'm trying to understand the sort of the confidence in getting back there, assuming the environment doesn't change that much.
And then for Europe, you talked about getting economics you could support accelerated growth. Do you need to get AUVs higher? Or are the sales volumes there, but it's really about kind of operational efficiency and the training that you talked about? Yes. Sara, I'll start within the U.S. When we talk about getting to the high end of the 8% to 10% range by 2025 that actually assumes that we don't get better in terms of the time line. It assumes that things stay as they are. What that tells you is just every year, our teams are doing a great job of building a very robust pipeline. And so that pipeline is really filling up. And as these time lines have been extending, that pipeline just keeps getting bigger. And so if you just assume we have the same time lines going forward for the next couple of years, we should get close to that 10% range.
Now having said that, we've also challenged our teams. We've challenged our teams to take a look at what is causing some of the delays, what can we do from a mix standpoint? Are there simpler deals that we can go after that would shorten the time line? Can we work with developers, if developers are getting cold feet in terms of -- if that's what's slowing things down because of higher interest rate. We have a strong balance sheet, not that we want to give away the farm, but there are things that we can do from an economic standpoint that might accommodate that.
So we challenge our teams to shorten the time line. But in terms of us getting to 10%, our -- frankly, our pipeline, we think, can get us there if the time line stay the same.
And then, Brian, if you want to comment on Europe? Yes, sure. So on Europe, Sara, you basically -- in your question was the answer. So the top line looks really good. We're working hard on how we get that to flow to the bottom line. So some operating efficiencies and just getting better at managing the business is really what we're focused on. Our next question comes from David Tarantino with Baird. My question is about the traffic performance you're seeing. I think, Brian, you mentioned that it accelerated as the quarter went on and stayed strong in October. And we've been hearing, I guess, more broadly that the consumer spending environment may have done the opposite. So I was wondering if you could maybe unpack the drivers that you think drove the divergence that you're seeing in your trends versus maybe what others are seeing? And specifically, I was hoping that you could talk about the comparison related to Garlic Guajillo Steak and also what you're seeing on the throughput side as a contributor to that? Yes. So yes, David, our transactions actually throughout the quarter, every month showed improvement, and we continue to see that transaction strength where we are today. So the things that we've been focusing on is, look, get staffed, get trained, get deployed. And kind of the way we describe this is we got a great people, great culinary, great throughput. And I think we're seeing that come through in our results. 
Combine that with the fact that we just launched carne asada, and the foundation of operational performance, I think, is critical in making carne asada to be, probably, a performer that will outperform what we saw with Garlic Guajillo Steak. I know that was a favorite of yours, but I'm sorry to say that carne asada is probably going to outperform it. But regardless, I think what's really important is our operators have done a terrific job of getting back to the basics of staffing, training, deploying and then holding ourselves accountable to great through putting.
We're seeing every month some improvements in through putting and that continues to be the case as we entered the fourth quarter and I think that's why we continue to see really good traffic results, and we're going to protect the value proposition, and we're going to protect the brand positioning that we have. And I think we'll get rewarded with hopefully more than our fair share of transactions. Yes. And the only thing I would add, Brian, to that is we're reading the same things, David, that you are. And the consumer is clearly under pressure with inflation over the past year and pretty much everything with gas and groceries, and really across the board, higher interest rates. We continue to do well not just across our income levels, but with the lower income, they're holding up really well. They're really hanging in there at the same -- at about the same level as our medium and high income level. So I think that Chipotle value where we haven't raised prices in over a year until this latest action, I think, is coming through and people are choosing to dine at Chipotle because we are very affordable. And sorry, one other thing because this is a favorite topic of ours here is we do love the fact that our growth is being driven by transactions, which I do think is really important to ongoing health for our business and our opportunity to grow going forward. So really proud of the team, really proud of the result for this quarter. Our next question comes from Dennis Geiger with UBS. Wondering if there's anything else to highlight on the strength of the margins in the third quarter? And I guess, more importantly, how that's shaping -- how you're thinking about next year? And specifically, Jack, you [indiscernible] 27% margin at a $3 million AUV if that's kind of still the right way to think about the margin AUV dynamic? Yes. So we're like -- I would describe our margin right now. We're not quite at $3 million, but we're knocking on the door, we should get there next year. And we're knocking on the door of 27%. We're not all the way there yet. We're at 26.5% year-to-date and 26.3% for the quarter. Fourth quarter typically is a lower margin quarter for us, so it will be closer to 26% and 27%, but I would call that knocking on the door.
And just give you an idea, we're not going to do this. But if, for example, we chose to take an extra 1% or 1.25% in pricing, our margin would be at 27%. 
Now we're not going to drive our margin based on that. We're really using menu pricing just to offset inflation. But it gives you an idea with a little bit of extra pricing or with a little break in terms of some of the commodity cost, the ingredient cost next year. We've had multiple years of inflation, if those ease a little bit. If labor inflation eases a little bit as well. There's a number of ways to get there.
And I would use the algorithm as more of long-term guidepost rather than something we're going to look to be right on the money every single quarter, every single year. So I feel like our economic model is really, really healthy. We're really knocking on the door of that 27%. And with the break here or there, I think we will hopefully get there next year. That's great. And then just I appreciate the strong traffic number in the third quarter. Can you just provide the price and mix breakdown in the third quarter, Jack, and if you care to talk at all about how to think about those components into the fourth quarter level, thinking about that mix in particular. Yes, sure. The price we are running in the quarter was in the high 2s, call it, right around 2.8-ish, something like that. And remember, that's all from pricing we took last year. We didn't take any additional pricing until just recently. And mix did ease a little bit. Mix was more in the 2% range. So you add that on top of a better than 4% transaction comp during the quarter, and that's how you get there. 
Looking forward into Q4 with the 3% we just took, remember, we took it in the second half of October. So that will average out to about a 2.2%-ish, call it low 2s menu price increase. We are starting -- or we did start to see the mix -- negative mix component eased during the quarter. And if that continues, we would expect that the mix component would be still a drag, but it would be hopefully closer to a drag of 1% than the 2% that we saw in this quarter. And then of course, Brian mentioned, we continue to see strong mid-single-digit transaction comps in the fourth quarter so far. Next question comes from Andrew Charles with TD Cowen. Jack, just a quick clarification. Do you consider the recent 3% price increase to brace yourselves for AB 1228 next year? Or -- are you planning a separate California target price increase to be utilized sometime around April to help mitigate the impact of the higher California wages? Yes. This does not consider anything -- any part of the California wages that will happen next year. We've been studying that, Andrew, as you can imagine, already. It's going to be a pretty significant increase to our labor. Our average wages in California are right around 17%. So to get the minimum up to 20%. We have to make sure that we take care of compression as well. We're going to have to increase wages in, call it, the high teens to 20% or so.
We haven't made a decision on exactly what level of pricing we're going to take. But to take care of the dollar cost of that and/or the margin part of that. We haven't decided where we will land at that. It's going to be a mid- to high single-digit price increase, but we are definitely going to pass this on. We just haven't made a final decision at as to what level yet. Got you. Okay. That's helpful. And then, Brian, question on the innovation. It looks like there's no innovation in the stage-gate process, it's obviously, you're prioritizing operations in Project Square One. I'm curious, what do you need to see to resume new menu innovation, in particular, if it's reaching a number of transactions per peak 15-minute or some other measure you're looking at to resume new menu innovation piloting? Yes. So the teams are still working and iterating on menu innovation. One of the things that they uncovered, what I'm really excited about is we have an opportunity to just talk about our core menu. So there's very little awareness and understanding of what barbacoa or carnitas are. And you'll probably be seeing our teams doing some work on how do we bring to life what we currently have on our menu so that customers can understand and truly enjoy everything that we currently offer.
At the same token, they're still doing some work on what are some new menu items, and we're also doing work on bringing back some menu innovation that we've done in the past that has really rung the bell. So I'm feeling really good about where our menu stands and the pipeline that we have for news over the next, call it, 18 to 24 months. Our next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. A question on labor productivity. I'm wondering how you're thinking about the drivers and getting back to something like you've done in the past that 23% or so labor margin. What are the key unlocks from here? You're obviously finding some traction on just paying attention to how you deploy labor and some of the things you're doing even with computer vision and whatnot. But then there's the other side, which might be the bigger leap stuff with equipment. So I'm wondering how you're thinking about the timing of these things and how -- I'm really obviously thinking about 2024 and what drivers you see there? Yes, David, I don't know that we'll see 23%, at least not in the near future. We've taken on some significant labor inflation over the last few years. And this California Act that we just talked about, California is only 15% of our restaurants. But that's all by itself. Next year, that's going to add 2.5% to 3% inflation to our overall company inflation and labor. So I don't know that we'll see '23.
But the answer to your question is, what are we going to do to continue to be efficient with labor. And I think you hit on all the key pieces for what we have in our restaurants today, we're really efficient. It doesn't mean we don't have some opportunity, but our teams are doing a great job.
And for the most part, they're using the labor that they need to throughout the day. I think the unlock is that we have the labor deployed properly. Brian mentioned this during his prepared comments, so that we have the right people that are staying in the front line so we could drive better throughput. When we drive better throughput, we know with a 40% flow-through. And we know with our ability to lever labor that, that labor percent will go down.
And then over the, I'll call it, the medium term and long term on things like at Autocado and with Hyphen. I think there's opportunities for us to try to offset some of the labor inflation. But I just don't know that we would be able to get all the way down to 23%. That would be -- I mean, that would be an 8% deflation. And that would be, I think, difficult to accomplish.
But rest assured that there's a lot of things that as we're working on investments that can make not just reduced hours, but also make the jobs of our crew easier, better and free them up so they can provide better customer service, we're definitely going to invest in that. Yes, if it makes feeling any better, I don't think anybody has 23% in their models or anything but... Okay. I just wanted to make sure. Yes. When you mentioned the 4% to 5% -- 4 to 5 entrees in that peak 15-minute window improvement, what is the benefit to same-store traffic and/or just labor productivity you're getting from that? Can you put that into perspective? Yes. I mean on -- in terms of like comps, for example, we need about 5 transactions in a day to get a 1% comp. And so if you get 3, 4 additional transactions in that 15-minute period and do that for multiple periods, you can easily add up the map and you can get a 2%, 3% additional comp in all those restaurants that are seeing that additional flow through. 
In terms of leverage, David, I'd have to go through the math. Generally, as you add 2, 3 additional transactions you're going to see tens of basis points. You're not going to see 100 basis points or anything like that. You're going to see tens of basis points of leverage on the labor line. So it's certainly nice, but it's not -- again, it's not going to get you down to anything in the sub-24% range.
But keep in mind, the important thing from a margin standpoint, every single additional transaction we bring in, there is a 40% pass-through down to the cash flow line, and that's how we want to grow our margins. Our next question comes from Lauren Silberman with Deutsche Bank. I also wanted to ask about throughput. So one of the key initiatives being the right cadence of digital orders. To what extent had rolled out that specific initiative across the system? Or what percentage of the system do you see opportunity to improve that labor allocation? You're referring to the digital makeline and smart pickup times? Yes, It's in -- it's about half of our restaurants right now, and we're seeing great outcomes from that. We're being more on time, more accurate with our digital business and where we have the correct deployment or bases and places on the front line, we're seeing some nice improvement in entrees -- number of entrees per 15 minutes. So -- we still have work to do, though, on executing the deployment on the front line so that people don't leave their position.
But for the most part, we're seeing really nice progress on the on-time and accuracy on the DML and we're seeing some throughput gains on the front line. But I think there's opportunity for us to get even better as we keep people in position during the entire peak that they're faced with. Great. And just -- you've historically, I believe, talked about the peak throughput being high 20 or low 30 orders peak 15-minute period. As you work to return to those levels, is there room to exceed prior peak throughput as you now utilize the second makeline to a much greater level? Or is there any constraint at that high 20, low 30 order level across the restaurant? Yes. The good news is there's no real constraint. We've got the opportunity to exceed that. Obviously, when we were doing those numbers, that was when the entire business was off the front line. So the good news is no bottleneck. The other really piece of good news is if that does occur, we've got a significantly bigger business than what we have today. So we think there's a lot of room for growth. We just got to execute this throughput program with excellence on the front line.
And I was just with all of our team directors, frankly, this morning, and it's the #1 initiative on everybody's mind. Great people, great food, great throughput. We do those 3 things, we're going to continue to drive growth from our operations. Next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. The question is related to throughput, but I think it's more specifically on unmet demand. And I was wondering if your data, specifically on the digital makeline side, showed how much unmet demand that you actually may have based on the wait times that are quoted to customers? In other words, they get to the end of the transaction, they see a wait time and they just don't complete the transaction. Is that something you can measure. And related to that, do you have a sense of how many stores actually are at capacity, maybe still in Midtown Manhattan and in some other places where people do walk by a line that has 15 or 20 people in it perhaps and just go to a place that's less. Is there a way to kind of quantify as you see it today, the amount of unmet demand that you would serve if you could serve. In other words, if you were kind of faster if the order times are less, what have you, just the opportunity on your current store base? Yes, John, we don't have the ability today for the in-restaurant, although we're talking about it. We're talking about some of the new tools that there may be some ways for us to capture the data not only in terms of like how many customers are waiting at the end of the 15-minute period, which that would be the opportunity as well as how well we're executing on the front line. So we're talking about developing those tools.
We do know historically, though, when we drive faster throughput, that we do flow more people not just through the 15-minute period but we get a lot of incremental transactions as well. So historically, we know that people do -- they walk away from our lines. You can see it anecdotally. When you're in the Midtown restaurant, when you see a long line and you see somebody walk by, open up the door and then walk away, that's a lost transaction. We're not able to quantify that specifically, but we know it happens a lot. Do you -- I mean we -- do you know that on the digital side, I mean, your transactions that kind of get to the final like percentage of transactions that may be -- that maybe aren't just completed that are right at the point of payment? I don't know if that's exactly the way to look at it, but there must be -- must be a leading indicator to some degree? We do have that on the digital side. And related -- your related question was how many of your restaurants are at capacity? We were able to flex capacity in the restaurant by adding staff. So we will have between 1 and 4 people on the DML and so if you have a very, very busy restaurant on the digital line, you will have as many 4 people -- as many of the 4 people on that line, including 1 dedicated person that's going to run orders back and forth. So we have very few restaurants and very few individual periods within our restaurants that are maxed out from a digital standpoint. Okay. And clearly, you can see the faster you are, the more customers you serve this current set of data proved that once again. Next question comes from Brian Mullan with Piper Sandler. Just a question on loyalty. Could you talk about some of the key near-term objectives the team is focused on with the program over, say, the next 12 to 24 months on the path towards I think the ultimate long-term goal of greater personalization over time, which Brian, I think you've referred to in the past, that's still a big opportunity. Yes, sure. So yes, the team is focused on taking all the analytics and the insights that we are seeing. And figuring out how we commercialize those learnings in a way that's very personalized for the individual. So a simple example, the suggestive sell, when you get ready to check out, if we know historically, you do buy a Mexican Coke and you don't see Mexican Coke in your basket, the suggestive sell will be for Mexican coke. And then we see -- when we do that, we get a higher take, obviously, on the suggestive sell.
So it's simple things that actually we know we can commercialize done in a very personalized way. And that's what the team is centered on is how do we do this throughout the user experience from the moment you enter your ordering process, at the moment you're trying to pay on the [indiscernible]. And the good news is the team has got a lot of analytics that we're cranking through, and we're knocking off the things that we think are the highest leverage points over the next, call it, 18 to [indiscernible]. Okay. And just I wonder if you could just update us on the dual side of grills, maybe how many locations have they been rolled out to? And are the benefits proving to be what you might have hoped inside the stores? And if so, when could this be rolled out more broadly? Yes. So we're still in 10 restaurants. And this is why you use the stage-gate process because we definitely -- one of the things we've learned is the energy needed to run these dual-sided grills is going to require some electrical upgrades that we originally had planned on. So we've got to understand exactly what is the cost of the equipment, not only to purchase, but then to actually install. And so we're still working through how do we make the economics of this makes sense. The crew likes it, the culinary turns out to be great, but we have to do some work on the economics of it. Next question comes from Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley. Yes -- could you maybe just comment on the delivery channel and then also just kind of mobile order and pickup and some of the things you're doing with timing or orders per 15 minutes, if that's kind of affected volumes at all? [indiscernible] of general question there. So I'll see if this maybe answers your question. But what we see is the delivery business is pretty stable. The order ahead and pickup business continues to be something that we are very much focused on being on time and accurate. And that's why we've implemented the Smarter Pickup Times where we are moving how many orders we allow in per 10 minutes as well as the buffer so that our crew can execute those digital orders with excellence without having to impact giving the frontline a great experience.
And we're seeing nice progress on both fronts, which I mentioned earlier. We're more on time, more accurate, and we're seeing gains on the throughput side of things on the front line. And we're not seeing a step back in any conversion rates in that digital business as well. So it's full steam ahead, and we've got to execute the operating platform. Okay. Just on Chipotlanes, is -- are you still seeing kind of the same unit volume uplift that you've previously talked about for those kind of the same impact on returns. Is it, in fact, going up? Any comments on how we think about the Chipotlane impact, especially as we kind of think about next year? Yes. The Chipotlane volumes have gotten closer to the non-Chipotlane volumes. And keep in mind, a lot of these were open during the pandemic when the Chipotlanes was really a premium access channel -- a preferred access channel during that time. But keep in mind, we're comparing a little bit of apples and oranges too because in the early days of Chipotlane, we had a lot of trade areas that could accommodate Chipotlane and yet we weren't putting a Chipotlane in every single restaurant.
Now the only restaurant that don't have a Chipotlane tend to be a downtown area, an in-line location where you can't have a Chipotlane. So we're comparing a little bit of apples and oranges.
Having said that, the margin is much better because you've got a lot more -- you've got more of your business that's going through the digital channel, which is a more efficient channel for us. And the other thing that happens is you still have about a 10% shift where your delivery is dropping by 8 to 10 points or something like that and your order ahead is increasing by 8, 10 points or so. So our customers are choosing the convenience channel, which also is a value channel, which is also an efficient -- a very efficient channel for us to run in that order ahead and they're deselecting the delivery channel. Next question comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. I guess going back to throughput. I know in the past, you've quantified kind of where you are relative to 2019 on peak throughput. I was hoping perhaps we can get an update on that. And then I guess I'm also wondering, is 2019 really the right benchmark anymore, just given how the business has shifted. I mean you're doing double digital versus 2019? And we know that's causing some tension between the front and back line. So is that the right bogey? I mean do you have a slice of restaurants that have exceeded 2019 peak throughput? Or is that not the right answer anymore? Sharon, it's a great question. When we use 2019 as a benchmark, we actually adjusted it for the fact that today's volume, is at -- basically 60%, 62% of the business goes through the front line versus back in 2019, it was about 80% or 81% or 82% or so. So we've adjusted for that volume. So for example, the average throughput in 2019 was in that high 20% range, 28% to 29%. When you adjust it for 62% of the volume going through the front line, that bogey ends up being on an adjusted basis, more like a 25% to mid-20s -- and so we do have the right targets for our teams because we did volume adjusted.
In terms of where we are, we've been making incremental improvements. We are now at right around at 22 but we're still 3 transactions below 2.5 to 3 transactions before our goal. The good news, as Brian mentioned, we're seeing a lot of progress in terms of the right deployment. We're seeing that a lot of our restaurants are executing for a core --  a core 4 meeting they've got at least 4 folks, if not more, on the front line. Previously, we saw most restaurants would have 3 or sometimes even less than that.
And now our teams are focusing on, okay, what are the habits that drive great throughput? Because having 4 people on the front line is an enabler, but it doesn't mean you're going to deliver a great throughput. You have to stay on their front line and then you have to have all the tricks that we're not going to go through right now and all the techniques to deliver great throughput.
We're starting to see individual restaurants or patches of restaurants that are executing core 4 and their throughput numbers are 3 to 4 or more transactions greater in a 15-minute period than restaurants in the same patch that are not executing the core 4. So we're seeing really encouraging results. And it's that 3 or 4 transactions here, and that gets you from the 22 up to the mid-20s. So we do feel like we're triangulating around the right target. Okay. And then, I guess, a question on the guidance for the quarter on comps. I know you had kind of some weather and some disappointment around the holidays last year. I mean, Jack, are you factoring that into the guidance for this year? Or are you just kind of steady state in? What we've done, Sharon, has taken our current trends from October and then pushing them forward. We do take into account what we did last year, but we're -- rather than taking account last year, is that going to affect our comp either up or down. We really take our current trends, which includes carne asada and includes a menu price increase and includes the current underlying transaction trend. We use that trend to turn out for the rest of the year compared to last year to the extent that there was some weather, if we see individual days or weeks for there's weather, our comp is going to bounce up during those periods. But we didn't use last year's weather to say it's going to be any better or worse. Our next question comes from Danilo Gargiulo with Bernstein. First of all, a quick clarification in light of your comments on the Chipotlane. So I'm assuming that the 40% flow-through is the average in your system. So are you seeing any mix benefit in the 40% as you're getting more and more stores with Chipotlanes, any new trade areas? So could we be talking about 42%, 43% flow-through in the near future? That's correct, Danil. In a Chipotlane, the margins are better and then the incremental margins are better. So you should see a few ticks up when we have incremental transactions in the Chipotlane definitely. Great. And then with potential increase in value offerings from some of your large peers, do you see that the industry is moving toward a more elevated level of promotional intensity to attract and retain traffic? And if so, are you expecting Chipotle to be able to leverage the same pricing power that they did last year? No. I mean, what we center on is providing a great experience. And what we've seen is that results in superior value. And unfortunately, we aren't doing it through price promotion, rather we're doing it through great culinary, lots of customization, terrific speed, and that's where our value for the consumer really shines through. And then given the scale that we have, we're able to buy ingredients and provide people a clean eating experience that frankly, can't get anywhere else for the price at which we charge it.
So very affordable, very customizable, super high quality is resulting in really strong value scores for consumers. And then when we look at our relative price position, to competitors. We're anywhere from 15% to 30% discount on an everyday standard.
Some of that was kind of interesting that the team did just to kind of dimensionalize this. They took a look at 18- to 34-year olds that actually have student debt, right? And what we found is Chipotle was the best value proposition among that universe. So one of the things we're seeing is whatever situation you're in, whether it's low income, higher income with some student debt, we continue to be a strong value proposition, regardless where you look across the consumer segments. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Great. Two questions. First, Brian, I'm sure you're getting this question periodically. I think I saw some headlines on CNBC earlier about it, but just the topic of anti-obesity drugs as a headwind. I think you had mentioned that you're not seeing anything to date, but it would seem like you're perhaps more vulnerable than others just because maybe you have a slightly higher income cohort. So I'm just wondering how you assess whether there was any impact or what you might do differently if that was a future headwind maybe get heading of it with focus on the healthier offering that we know you have, just how you think about how it's being impacted and how you would respond. And then I had one follow-up. Sure. So yes, that's right. We've not seen any material impact from it. And as I understand the drug and when I've spoken to people that know a whole lot more about the drug than I do, our food is a good solution because it's clean, it's not fried. It allows people then to customize meal that would fit their diet that they're trying to achieve, whether they're on GLP-1 drugs or whether they're on a keto diet or a whole 30-diet or insert the lifestyle diet that they're on or the lifestyle drug that they might be on. The good news is we're positioned to be able to customize that diet for you with clean food done in a very healthy way.
So longer term, I think we're positioned really well. We'll see how this continues to unfold. But to date, we've seen no real impact. And the best thing we can do is make sure that we stay committed to food with integrity and providing those customized solutions at speed. Got it. And then, Jack, just in terms of the fourth quarter or maybe more importantly, looking to 2024 your commodity and labor inflation. What's kind of the forecast you're assuming when you talk about kind of approaching that 27% restaurant margin? I know you talked about how California labor alone is 250 to 300 basis points. But just wondering what assumption you have for inflation on commodities and labor for next year? Yes. I mean, Jeff, you know this predicting anything, especially inflation in the last few years has been very, very difficult. Right now, it looks like inflation is settling for both our ingredients and for labor in that, call it, 3-ish percent, maybe between 3% and 4%, something like that. That's a very normal environment. If it stays at that 3% to 4% range. I think that's just fine. We can operate very effectively in that environment.
Would we be able to get all the way to 27% without taking any additional pricing? That would be tough unless our transactions accelerate, and we can leverage -- throw some more leverage along our fixed line items. But if it's in that 3% to 4% range, we just took a 3% price increase. I think we'll be just fine. But if it continues at a higher level, obviously, that'd be a little tougher. But anyway, that's -- if it ends up in that 3% to 4% range, if people keep their jobs and if people still want to dine out, we like our chances that they'll keep coming to Chipotle, especially based on the most recent trends that we've seen. Our final question comes from Peter Saleh with BTIG. Great. Brian, I want to come back to your comments on the Hyphen makeline. I think you said it increases capacity, better accuracy and better speed. What are the challenges in some of the hurdles that you think you need to overcome at this point to move it to the next stage in the stage-gate process? Yes. So thanks for the question. So we had our first prototype at our Cultivate Center, and the team did a great job of kind of pressure testing all aspects of it. We learned a lot, right? There's work to be done on how you export things. There's work to be done on how you clean it. There's work to be done on how we actually provide portions.
And the good news is this is why we use the stage-gate process so that we learn, we iterate and then hopefully, we get to a faster solution. So I'm excited to see what the next prototype holds, but the team is working on some of those key things that we learned on.
But yes, look, all signs are really promising that as we continue to work on this in the stage-gate, what we're after is accuracy, speed and then the ability for the team member to execute this, both the export station and then keep it clean and food safe.
So we're working through those things. But for our very first prototype, the team did a great job, and I love everybody's passion to learn so that we get to an even better second generation prototype. Great. And then just my last question would be on -- have you seen any difference in sales performance urban versus suburban stores these days? Is the return to office? Are you seeing any improvement there? Just any clarity around that would be helpful. Yes. The comps have gotten a lot closer. The urban still outperformed the suburban by about 100 basis points or something like that, so it's much, much, much closer. But I would say the central business district are still behind in terms of an absolute sales basis, if you look at pre-pandemic and where we are today, the central business districts are still behind. But from a comp standpoint, they're performing in the same general range. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Brian Niccol for any closing remarks. Yes. Thank you. And thanks, everybody, for the questions and joining the call. Obviously, we're very proud of our teams and the results that we delivered in the third quarter. It's very exciting to see our efforts on throughput driven by having the teams staffed, trained and deployed directly, continuing to make progress. And then with our strong value proposition, seeing that show up in transactions as the driver of growth.
We're going to continue to stay focused on executing great throughput. We're going to continue to stay focused on great culinary, we're going to continue to stay focused on having great people that are trained and know exactly what they need to do in their position.
So very excited about the results we've achieved, but very optimistic about our future, both in building new units and continuing to drive average unit volumes and margins. So thank you for taking the time, and we'll see you in a couple of months. Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

And with that, I will turn the call over to Brian. Thanks, Cindy, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered outstanding results this year driven by our focus on exceptional people, exceptional food and exceptional throughput. This is driving a much better experience for our teams and our guests and resulted in accelerating transaction growth throughout 2023.
For the year, sales grew 14% to reach $9.9 billion driven by a 7.9% comp. Digital sales represented 37% of sales. Restaurant-level margin was 26.2%, an increase of 230 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted diluted EPS was $44.86, representing 37% growth over last year. And we opened a record 271 new restaurants, including 238 Chipotlanes.
We also ended the year with a lot of momentum as demonstrated by our fourth quarter results. Our restaurant teams are making terrific progress in building a strong foundation around throughput, and the return of carne asada as a limited-time offer outperformed our expectations.
For the quarter, sales grew 15% to $2.5 billion driven by an 8.4% comp. Digital sales represented 36% of sales. Restaurant-level margin was 25.4%, an increase of 140 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted diluted EPS was $10.36, representing 25% growth over last year. And we opened a record 121 new restaurants, including 110 Chipotlanes.
As a reminder, we are returning to our prepandemic practice of only providing annual account guidance. While January was impacted by weather throughout much of the country, as weather has normalized, our sales trends have strengthened. For the full year, we anticipate comps in the mid-single digit range as we continue to focus on the same 5 key strategies that help us to win today while we grow our future.
Now let me provide an update on each of these strategies, which include: number one, sustaining world-class people leadership by developing and retaining diverse talent at every level; number two, running successful restaurants with a people-accountable culture that provides great Food with Integrity while delivering an exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences; number three, making the brand visible, relevant and loved to improve overall guest engagement; number four, amplifying technology and innovation to drive growth and productivity in our restaurants, support centers and in our supply chain; and number five, expanding access and convenience by accelerating new restaurant openings in North America and internationally.
Starting with our world-class people. I'm excited to share that Ilene Eskenazi joined my executive leadership team in November as our Chief Human Resources Officer with over 25 years of experience in leading human resources and legal functions across a wide range of industries. I'm confident Ilene will be instrumental in helping Chipotle to develop and retain talent at every level of the organization and enhance the support we provide to our people both in our restaurants and at our support centers, strengthening Chipotle as a best-in-class employer.
As I've said in the past, we want to attract and retain the best people that we can develop and grow. Part of this includes listening to their needs and investing in ways that will help our employees thrive both professionally and personally. This is why we recently added new benefits to our industry-leading benefits platform like enhanced mental health care, a student loan retirement match and additional financial wellness tools for our workforce.
In addition to our benefits, our long-term growth opportunity and promote-from-within culture provides a path for team members to advance quickly within Chipotle. In fact, in 2023, we promoted over 24,000 people and over 90% of restaurant management roles were internal promotions. This includes 87% of field leader positions, which is one of the biggest jumps for our teams, going from running 1 restaurant to an average of 8 restaurants.
The ability to achieve this rate of internal promotions is a result of our strong restaurant leaders, many of whom started as crew members and who are committed to training and developing our future leaders.
A great example is one of our field leaders in New York, who has been with Chipotle for over 16 years. He helped to develop and promote over 40 team members who have grown within Chipotle and have gone on to become some of our best general managers, field leaders, team directors and even one of our regional vice presidents. This is the type of person who will help us to deliver on our goals of running great restaurants, delivering industry-leading economics and expanding to 7,000 restaurants in North America longer term. Great people executing great culinary and throughput results in a terrific guest experience and drives performance.
This brings me to our operations. Strong leadership is the key to running successful restaurants with fast throughput. So it is no surprise that the restaurants with the most tenured general managers are executing the best. The good news is our GM turnover is at some of the lowest levels that I have seen since I joined Chipotle. And over the last couple of quarters, we have put the building blocks in place to deliver great throughput.
As we mentioned last quarter, we have adjusted the cadence of orders on the digital makeline to achieve a better balance of labor between the 2 lines. Additionally, we began collecting data on the execution of the 4 pillars of throughput in our restaurants and providing feedback and coaching on a weekly basis. This is allowing our restaurant teams to see progress, which is energizing and motivating as the experience of winning catches momentum. And finally, our teams now have real-time access to their MAX 15 throughput results in the moment, so our GMs can coach and recognize great throughput while it is happening.
Since we put these coaching tools in place in the third quarter, we have seen the number of restaurants with at least 4 crew members on the frontline during peak periods improve from 30% to around 50%. This is driving an acceleration in our throughput performance as the number of entrees in our peak 15 minutes improved by a full point in the fourth quarter compared to last year.
I'm thrilled to see the progress we are beginning to make, and continuing this momentum is critical as we approach our peak burrito season in mid-March. We will also further strengthen our industry-leading value proposition, which consists of delicious culinary made with real ingredients, most customizable, convenient, served quickly and at an accessible price point.
When we are executing on all parts of our value proposition, we are providing a great customer experience, which helps all other drivers of sales to perform better, such as menu innovation. And last year, Chicken al Pastor and carne asada both surpassed our expectations and drove incremental transactions. This is a testament to the cross-functional effort by our marketing, culinary supply chain and restaurant teams that do an outstanding job innovating as well as bringing back past favorites that are more delicious each time and are executed seamlessly.
2024 will be another exciting year for menu innovation, including 1 to 2 limited-time offers and rolling out creative ways to shine a spotlight on our core menu throughout the year. As part of highlighting the core, we recently launched our latest lineup of Lifestyle Bowls, which shows how the customization of our real ingredients allows Chipotle to embrace all interpretations of wellness, whether it be plant-based, high protein, keto, paleo and more.
In connection with the launch, we announced a partnership with Strava, the leading digital community for active people with more than 120 million athletes to encourage and reward healthy habits with a chance to earn free Lifestyle Bowls. This is giving our fans the right tools to sustain healthy habits in 2024 and beyond.
In addition to menu innovation, our marketing team continues to do a fantastic job of making the Chipotle brand more visible, more relevant and more loved to drive difference, culture and drive a purchase. Our Behind the Foil campaign is a great example that highlights key differentiators of Chipotle. This includes our restaurant teams preparing our real ingredients, made fresh every day using classic culinary techniques, such as dicing onions and jalapenos, hand mashing our signature guac and grilling our adobo chicken, steak and fajita veggies on the Plancha. We will continue to evolve Behind the Foil campaign in 2024. And it's really exciting to see that our best-performing ads are an authentic, behind-the-scenes look into a day in the life of a Chipotle team member. This certainly demonstrates one of our core values, which is authenticity here. Our food is real, and so are we.
Shifting to amplifying technology innovation. We have made a lot of progress this year on improving the digital experience. We made several enhancements to our app functionality, including order readiness messaging, wrong location detection, reminders to scan for points at checkout, prior order history and more. This has helped to reduce friction points and improve the overall experience for guests.
We also launched Freepotle for our Rewards members, which was successful in driving engagement and enrolling new members as we were able to surprise and delight our guests with free rewards, such as guac, a beverage or double meat. From the Freepotle drops, we were able to learn more about our Rewards members to improve our ability to deliver relevant experiences in the future.
Finally, we recently rolled out suggestive upsell on our app at checkout based on data we have on our Rewards members, including prior order history. Going forward, I believe we are in a multiyear path to commercializing our customer data and insights into more targeted marketing campaigns and improving the overall digital experience that will drive increased frequency and spend over time.
I also want to spend a few minutes providing an update on our Cultivate Next Fund, which launched 2 years ago with an objective of making early-stage investments into strategically aligned companies that further our mission to cultivate a better world and accelerate our strategic priorities. Since launching this fund, the amount of innovation that we have seen across the food tech landscape has surpassed our expectations and encompasses everything from farming to supply chain to alternative proteins and oils to in-restaurant automation and more.
We have reviewed hundreds of innovative companies and have made 7 investments, of which there are many opportunities for commercial engagements. This includes Hyphen, which we are partnering with to develop our automated digital makeline; and Vibu, which we are partnering with to develop Autocado that cuts, cores and scoops avocados.
Both Hyphen and Autocado help to improve the overall experience for our teams by removing less favorable tasks and for our guests by providing on-time, accurate and delicious food. We continue to work on iterations of each technology at our Cultivate Center, and the good news is that we plan to pilot the automated digital makeline and Autocado in a restaurant in 2024 as part of our stage-gate process.
Last month, we announced 2 more investments in Greenfield Robotics and Nitricity. Greenfield Robotics provides regenerative agriculture solutions without chemicals using fleets of autonomous robots to weed fields. And Nitricity uses technology to tackle greenhouse gas emissions by creating natural fertilizer products that are better for fields, farmers and the environment. We believe both Greenfield Robotics and Nitricity could play an important role in ensuring a more sustainable future for farms within our supply chain.
Our suppliers are a key enabler of Chipotle's growth and help us to further our purpose of cultivating a better world. We will continue to find innovative ways to support their ability to grow, harvest and supply the high-quality, sustainably raised, real ingredients that Chipotle serves.
Our final strategic pillar is expanding access, and our development team has done an incredible job of meeting our development targets despite the time line challenges we continue to see. In the fourth quarter, we opened 121 new restaurants and for the full year, we opened 271 new restaurants, which is the highest number of openings in the company's history in a single quarter and in a single year.
We have now surpassed 800 Chipotlanes and continue to see very strong results with Chipotlanes driving higher new restaurant productivity, margins and returns. Additionally, this year, we had some fantastic openings in new markets with our first restaurant in Calgary breaking an opening day record and sustaining very high volumes post opening day. When we serve delicious food with exceptional operations and execute great local marketing, our brand gains traction quickly, and Canada is a testament to this. We will continue to accelerate our growth in Canada in 2024 with 10 to 14 new restaurant openings planned, representing 25% to 35% growth for the country. And in total, we continue to target 285 to 315 new restaurant openings in 2024, mostly in North America with over 80%, including a Chipotlane.
So to conclude, I want to thank our 115,000 employees for their hard work, which drove strong results in 2023. We hit some big milestones, including surpassing 3,400 restaurants, 800 Chipotlanes, $3 million in AUVs and forming our first international partnership.
As I look forward, I see the opportunity longer term to more than double our restaurants in North America, increase our penetration of Chipotlanes, surpass $4 million in AUVs, expand our industry-leading margins and returns, and further our purpose of cultivating a better world globally. As I mentioned in the beginning, this ambitious plan will require exceptional people, exceptional food and exceptional throughput. The good news is that I'm certain we have the right people and the right strategy to achieve it.
So with that, I will turn it over to Jack. Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. Sales in the fourth quarter grew 15% year-over-year to reach $2.5 billion as comp sales grew 8.4% driven by over 7% transaction growth. Restaurant-level margin of 25.4% increased about 140 basis points compared to last year, and earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $10.36, representing 25% year-over-year growth. The fourth quarter had unusual expenses related to elevated depreciation and changes to a legal contingency.
Looking to fiscal 2024. We anticipate comps in the mid-single digit range for the full year. As a reminder, we were impacted by unusually cold weather throughout the country in January. As the weather has normalized, our underlying sales trends remained strong, and they support our full year guidance range. Additionally, Q1 will include the benefit of an extra day due to leap year, but this will be offset by Easter shifting into Q1 this year compared to Q2 of last year.
I'll now go through the key P&L line items, beginning with cost of sales. Cost of sales in the quarter were 29.7%, an increase of about 40 basis points from last year, a larger mix shift to be due to the success of carne asada as well as elevated cost across the board, most notably beef, produce and queso was partially offset by the benefit of menu price increases and lower paper costs.
For Q1, we expect our [ 29% ] range as the benefit of the mix shift out of carne asada will be partially offset by higher costs across several line items, most notably avocados and tortillas. We anticipate cost of sales inflation to be in the low to mid-single-digit range for the full year.
Labor costs for the fourth quarter were 25%, a decrease of about 60 basis points from last year. The benefit of sales leverage and better labor execution more than offset wage inflation and higher performance-based compensation. For Q1, we expect our labor cost to be in the low 25% range with wage inflation in the low to mid-single-digit range. And we anticipate wage inflation will tick up to the mid-single-digit range as California wages go up around 20% in April of this year.
Other operating costs for the quarter were 14.7%, a decrease of about 100 basis points from last year. The decrease was driven by sales leverage as well as lower marketing and promo costs, which were 3.1% of sales in Q4, a decrease of about 30 basis points from last year. In Q1, we expect marketing cost to be in the low 3% range with full year to come in right around 3%. In Q1, other operating costs are expected to be in the high 14% range.
G&A for the quarter was $169 million on a GAAP basis or $170 million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding about $1 million change in a legal contingency. G&A also includes $122 million in underlying G&A, $36 million related to noncash stock compensation, $10 million related to higher bonus accruals and payroll taxes on equity vesting and exercises and $2 million related to our upcoming All Manager Conference, which is scheduled for Q1 of this year.
We expect our underlying G&A to be around $127 million in Q1 and step up each quarter as we make investments in people and technology to support our ongoing growth. We anticipate stock comp will be around $32 million in Q1, although this amount could move up or down based on our actual performance and is subject to the final 2024 brands, which are issued in Q1. We also expect to recognize around $7 million related to employer taxes associated with shares that vest during the quarter and $21 million for costs associated with our biannual All Manager conference in March, bringing our anticipated total G&A in Q1 to around $187 million.
Adjusted depreciation for the quarter was $79 million or 3.1% of sales. And for 2024, we expect it to remain right around this level as a percent of sales. Effective tax rate for Q4 was 26.2% for both GAAP and non-GAAP. And for 2024, we continue to estimate our underlying effective tax rate will be in the 25% to 27% range, though it may vary based on discrete items.
Our balance sheet remains strong as we ended the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments with no debt. And during the fourth quarter, we repurchased $144 million of our stock at an average price of $1,936. For the full year, we repurchased a total of $590 million at an average price of $1,827. And going forward, we'll continue to opportunistically repurchase our stock. During the quarter, our Board authorized an additional $200 million to our share authorization program. And at the end of the quarter, we had $424 million remaining.
We opened a record 121 new restaurants in the fourth quarter, of which 110 had a Chipotlane. And as we mentioned last quarter, we anticipate opening between 285 and 315 new restaurants in 2024 with over 80% having a Chipotlane. We continue to see developers delaying projects due to macro pressures and high interest rates, along with permitting, inspection and utility installation delays. The midpoint of our guidance range assumes these challenges persist. And we remain on track to move towards the high end of the 8% to 10% range by 2025, assuming conditions do not worsen.
In closing, Chipotle is a purpose-driven company that's been able to scale over the last 30 years into one of the largest restaurant brands in the world. An exciting part is that we still have a long growth runway in front of us. Our strong economic model gives us a high degree of confidence that our ambitious growth objectives are achievable, if not beatable. And as we continue to protect and strengthen our economic model, our long-term growth opportunity will only expand just as it has over the last 30 years. So thank you to all of our employees for their hard work and their dedication to Chipotle, and let's keep the momentum going in 2024.
With that, we'll open the lines for your questions. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Andrew Charles with TD Cowen. Brian, I appreciate the ambition that you talked about for $4 million AUVs. And I think the same drivers that were used to reach the $3 million level are still the largest drivers to get to the $4 million level, which includes operations, marketing, loyalty, Chipotlane and menu innovation. But if you look back from -- several years from now and you get to that $4 million faster than expected, what driver do you think could work better than it has in recent years? Or maybe if you think about it differently, are there new drivers that will help you get to the $4 million level, such as catering, breakfast or automation? And then, Jack, I have a follow-up. Yes. Thanks for the question. Look, I do believe, at the end of the day, the thing that will get us to $4 million and probably beyond that is going to be great execution in the restaurant, meaning focusing on great culinary, great people and great throughput. I think we're very fortunate that it doesn't require another daypart. It doesn't require something that we aren't currently doing today to achieve that result.
I do think things like automation, like Hyphen and Autocado and continuing to do things with our rewards program, the menu innovation, the marketing, will obviously be things that push us further and further. But one thing I think that we demonstrated this last quarter is when we perform better on the operations front, all those things I just listed off had a, I would call it almost like a multiplying effect. So the good news is we still have a lot of headroom to go on operational execution. And I think we've got the right things in place for the long term to get us to that $4 million and beyond. Helpful. And then, Jack, my question is around the mechanics to get to that $4 million level. I mean, do you expect to sustain mid-single digit same-store sales to get there? Or do you think the law of large numbers kicks in at some point in the out-years that low single digits is the right rate of same-store sales growth? And similarly, what kind of margins do you think the business can support at $4 million volumes, assuming normalized commodity and labor inflation? Yes, Andrew, it's really hard to predict over a long period of time into the future what comps are going to do. I think for the foreseeable future, our guidance next year in the mid-single digit, I think, makes sense. But if you look at our history, we have a history of having outsized comps when the economy is going well and our operations are going well. I would argue even the acceleration we saw in the fourth quarter was we had a great combination of demand being created by carne asada, what's become a favorite of our customers, and throughput allowing those sales to flow through.
And those are the -- and I would expect those things to happen in the future. It's very hard to predict how and when they're going to happen, Andrew. But those are the things that Chipotle has seen in the past. I think that will likely happen in the future as well.
But keep in mind, at these volumes, every time you add in a mid-single digit, you're talking about $150,000 layer, and it keeps growing over time. So the $4 million, while it's an aspirational goal, it certainly is something we think we definitely will get there.
In terms of margins, I would expect margins to continue to expand. We still expect to see a pass-through. Every time we grow our transaction, grow our sales through additional customers, about a 40% flow-through. As said 40% gets average stand against the 26% we delivered last year, I would expect the margins to go up. And as we get up to $4 million, I would expect we'd be in the high 20%, maybe even in the 30% range.
Again, you're talking about predicting something over a very long period of time. But our margins will definitely get stronger over time, which means our returns will get stronger as well as we move from $3 million to $4 million. The next question comes from David Tarantino with Baird. Congratulations on a great 2023. My question is really about the unit growth, and I've got 2 parts to that. I think you've been talking about 7,000 restaurants in North America for a while. And as you build more of -- more and more Chipotlanes and see the returns you're getting, I'm just wondering if that number could prove low in your mind? Is there upside to the 7,000 over time?
And then, I guess, the second part of the question is I know you want to grow faster. And Jack, you mentioned getting to 10% unit growth next year is the goal. I'm just wondering what line of sight you have to that at this point that you can share with us. Yes. Well, why don't I go ahead and start it, David, and then I'll let Jack fill in. Look, the way we've come to the 7,000 number is we've looked at what our penetration levels are. And in some of the places where we have the most penetration, we continue to build restaurants with success, which then gives us the confidence to do the exercise to say, okay, well, if you just apply that math to the rest of the country, we quickly add up to 7,000. So we think it's very practical goal. Some might say conservative, but we definitely think it's a practical goal.
And probably as we get closer, I think Jack has talked about this in the past, I think at one point, we were talking about having 3,000 Chipotles then we said 4,000, then we said 5,000, here we are at 7,000. I hope it does prove to be conservative. I think the brand has got a lot of upside in it, but that's how we get to the 7,000. Yes. And David, on how do you get to 10%, our visibility is quite good. Our inventory building that the teams have been doing is really, really strong. In fact, the team has had to build more inventory than we normally would need to basically offset these time lines. These time lines have really delayed everything. So I think you're talking about instead of 15, 16 months from when you get a deal to open, it's now more like 21, 22 months or so.
But each year, the team builds a stronger inventory. The result of the new openings has been outstanding. So the quality has been very, very high. So the inventory itself looks really, really good. And if we get any break in terms of time lines with developers moving a little bit faster, with local authorities in terms of utility, in terms of permitting, if that was a little bit faster, we actually can get to that clip even a little sooner. But we built in the exact same extended time line that we're seeing today with the current very robust inventory. And that will get us, if not all the way, very close to that 10% figure. And then just a quick follow-up, Jack. Are you seeing any signs at all that the time lines could be getting a little bit shorter? Any signs of life there? Not anything sustained, David. So I mean our teams are working really, really hard at it. The most recent challenge has been developers with high interest rates. They're pausing a little bit. I do think if interest rates improve this year, I do think that will help. But nothing that I would bank on right now. We're certainly working hard at it, though. The next question comes from Lauren Silberman with Deutsche Bank. I wanted to ask one on throughput, clearly a big area of focus driver of traffic this year. Can you talk about how you see the potential traffic opportunity in '24 driven by throughput and just the priorities to get there to further unlock that opportunity? Yes. Well, obviously, we're really delighted to see over 7 points of transaction growth in the fourth quarter. I think that's a testament to our operations teams in the field having a focus on getting great throughput. And we talked about this quite a bit. There's the 4 pillars of great throughput.
I'd say we're kind of still in the early stages of this because we're just getting people in position. So I think you heard my comments about, hey, we now have 4 people on the frontline almost 50% of the time. That's only 1 component of the 4 pillars, you really think about it, right? It's -- that's part of our idea of mesa. Like we want to be prepared, people in position, ready to go.
So we still have a lot of upside on making sure that we have the expo, the linebacker in position and ready to go. So we still think we're early, early days on this. There's a lot of upside to it. I am delighted to see the progress though. We've increased our MAX 15 pretty much every month throughout 2023 and saw some of our best results in December, and those trends continued into January.
So lots of space to still grow into. But the thing I love is that the teams are laser focused on getting after it. I think we've now given them more tools that they have better visibility on how they're performing real time. And when I get to visit restaurants, it's the first thing that's on people's minds: how we're doing on our throughput, how we're doing on culinary and how we're doing with the people and culture. So it's nice to see. Great. And if I could just ask on -- a quick one on menu innovation, how you're thinking about it. I know you mentioned 1 to 2 this year. I know you typically do an LTO on chicken and the spring and then beef later in the fall. Any change to how you're thinking about cadence, especially as you consider sort of throughput in operations? Yes. I mean, look, I think what we've demonstrated this past year is that's definitely a cadence that our operators can execute great throughput with. So they delivered Pollo Asado with excellence. And then we did the same thing -- I'm sorry, Chicken al Pastor with excellence and then followed that up with carne asada.
So we feel really good about doing 1 or 2 a year. I think you're also going to see us this year do a little bit more spotlighting even on the core menu, which we're doing right now with our Lifestyle Bowls. And then you'll see us do that as well during the year.
So we think we've got the right cadence. We think we've got the right innovation pipeline. And also the things that we've done in the past, we've demonstrated we can revisit those with success as most recently with carne asada. The next question comes from Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley. Brian, you mentioned just suggestive upsell at checkout. And I was curious on that theme or maybe just a bar theme. What are some things that you think you could do to drive check, right? I think we've talked a lot about transactions, but what do you think could be check drivers as we think about this year and beyond? Yes. Look, I think one of the things that's been really nice to see is the incidence of our size has continued to go up like queso and chips and salsa. We're continuing to see people adding on to their entrees. And I think that has a lot to do with what we're able to do digitally, both at the point of checking out as well as how we communicate with people through our rewards program, right?
So the suggestive sale example I'm talking about, we've now turned that into a smart suggestive sales. So I'll give you the best example or a really simple one. Historically, you get a Mexican Coke with your order. When you get to check out, if you don't have Mexican Coke in your basket, we will serve your suggestive sale of, hey, you forgot your Mexican Coke versus before, we might have just been saying, hey, maybe you should think about chips and queso.
So what we're seeing is that type of insight into the individual results in more commercialization or higher check as they check out because we're serving a lot of things that they historically have usually added to their ticket. So we're seeing that make great progress. And then obviously, I think our queso, chips and guac are pretty darn special. So the more people learn and experience it, the more they want to add it to their check. Okay. Great. Jack, are you willing to comment just on kind of the levels of -- I guess 1Q, maybe it looks similar to the fourth quarter, but are you willing to comment on the level of pricing you'll see just factoring in kind of California as we start to think about perhaps the second quarter? Yes. Q1 will be similar, call it, in that 2.5% to 3% range in Q1. We haven't made a final decision in terms of pricing with FAST Act. We know we have to take something at a significant increase when you talk about a 20%-ish increase in wages.
And I think we talked in the past that there's one approach where you would cover the profitability so you would break even from a profitability standpoint but not protect margins. So in other words, margins would go down, profitability would not or you take a higher price increase and you protect margins as well. We haven't decided within that range. We'll wait and see just what the landscape looks like, what the consumer sentiment is, what other companies are going to do.
So I would say in terms of the impact, California represents about 15% of our restaurants. So depending on where we end up, there'll probably be an extra 80-ish, 90-ish basis points to maybe something over 100 basis points in terms of additional menu price across all of our 3,400 restaurants, just to give you kind of an order of magnitude. The next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. I was thinking about the amount of time, attention, labor hours that you spend in morning prep every day at the store level. And as the system grows, gains scale, potentially benefits from more equipment, more technology, more automation, maybe some more centralization, I was wondering for you to talk about opportunities to maybe reallocate some of this prep labor that you may have longer term, how big of a bucket is that? And obviously, Autocado was one identified solution. How much more is there? And how much more could that mean to the overall business model of the future? Yes. Look, thanks for the question. Obviously, prep in the morning is a critical piece of the puzzle. If we get our prep done correctly, we usually have a great lunch. Actually, we always have a great lunch when you get the prep time correctly. Usually, where we run into problems is if we're running behind on prep. So things like Autocado, other robotics to help actually cut the onions and the jalapeno, these things would be huge enablers. That's why you continue to see us look at all these cobotic ideas to make prep even more efficient.
One thing I know for sure is if we could get every restaurant 100% of the time to have their prep done on time and ready to roll, our throughput will go up. So we're going to do everything we can to ensure we're investing in prep both more efficiently and then also effectively to get it done.
How you reallocate that time, we'll figure that out as we get closer to it, and that's probably the reason why we're using the stage-gate process. As we put Autocado into stores, we will see how that plays out. But you mentioned centralizing kitchens on this. That's something we're not contemplating. We believe to keep the freshest food, the best culinary, it needs to happen in the restaurant. The next question comes from Sara Senatore with Bank of America. A couple of follow-up questions. The first is I wanted to go back to your comment about restaurants that for the makeline going from 30% to 50% is still a long way to go. I'm wondering if you can maybe quantify what the contributions to that in that increase of transaction growth, which is to say, presumably, it's not like every 20 points of staffing improvement gets you 7 points of transaction growth. But if you could just maybe rank order, is it staffing? Or are there other things that are also going into this? And parallel that, perhaps what you saw in the last decade when you also saw a real focus on the 4 pillars and improvement in throughput. Yes. So great question. Here's what I'll tell you is, for sure, you've got to be staffed, you got to have stability in the teams, right? That's how we get the reps so that we execute better every time. The other thing I'll say is when we looked back and we were doing maybe our best throughput, these numbers can easily go from 50% to 60%, 70-some-odd percent in execution. So it's not unrealistic for us to believe we can get better than where we are today. And I think the teams know that.
The other thing that I think is also helping the teams is to have the visibility so they know how they performed in their 15 minutes allows them to course-correct real-time versus finding out what happened that day. And then they kind of missed out on being able to course-correct for a later part of lunch or dinner time.
How it contributes to the comp, here's one thing I'll tell you is we're executing better. And when we're executing better, people feel better about the food, they feel better about the brand. We just got back some brand metrics that, frankly, are just terrific. And I think that shows up in our value scores, and it shows up in the way that people are feeling about the brand.
So the brand has got really strong perceptions. I think our team members feel really good about the success they're having, which is also really important, right? When the crew feels like they're going fast, they're giving people what they want, they feel better, which then I think in result turns into like kind of this ongoing system where everybody believes they're now achieving and getting what they want.
So our customers are happier, the team members are happier, the brand is stronger. And I think these are all the things that contribute to 7 points of transaction growth or said another way, really strong value proposition that we've got in today's environment. Got it. Okay. And then just on the carne asada, I mean, I know in the past you've gotten questions about how do you lap a really successful LTO, but here you have it for like the third time and it was better than you expected. Is that marketing? Is that digital? Because you actually as a percentage of revenue spent less year-over-year. So I'm just trying to understand again what the runway is for these already very successful LTOs. Yes. Look, I think our teams executed carne asada better than we ever have. I thought the experience of carne asada was terrific. I also do think the advertising and the communication around it was really good. So I think our ads are communicating what makes Chipotle special, which is this team member that's committed to doing great culinary in the restaurant.
And then when you layer in a great product like carne asada that gets executed with excellence, good things happen. And it was kind of, I think Jack mentioned this earlier, great demand generation with the advertising the carne asada initiative. And then the folks in our restaurants were doing a really terrific execution so that people got down the line faster, they experienced great culinary and they got exactly what they wanted. So I think it's the combination of really having compelling menu news with great advertising and our operations team executing the fundamentals really well. The next question comes from Danilo Gargiulo with Bernstein. Can you please provide maybe some color on the key drivers of the traffic comp in 4Q by income cohorts or maybe by channels? And if you can also comment on the ab check, how much was the contribution from pricing versus contribution from mix? And what's your expectation given that the delivery mix impact should be normalizing at this point? Yes. So look, one of the things that we're really delighted to see is every income cohort, we saw sales grow. So whether that's below $40,000 between $40,000 and $100,000, over $100,000, we saw progress with every income cohort. So clearly, the brand is resonating in a meaningful way. What was the other part of his question? The channels and store was by far the strongest channel which supports the throughput that we saw. Yes. In-store was the strongest, order ahead was next and then delivery was third. And I think Jack just mentioned this, the in-store experience, when we have the culinary ready to go and you go down the line, it's tough to beat. I mean there's no better experience in walking down the line, seeing the rise in chicken that you want and then giving one of our team members to look like how about a little more, and they do it. So that's how you end up with these big bowls and big burritos. And so I think the value proposition is just really strong in store, especially when we're executing great culinary and great speed. And then, Danilo, just on the check, the check impact was a 1% -- plus 1%. That's about 2.5% price, offset by about 1.5% on the mix, and the mix is driven by group size. Got it. And then you recently significantly improved the benefits, and you really are offering a very strong employment value proposition to your employees. Can you talk about the labor cost and maybe productivity improvement implications that you're expecting from that initiative? And it would be great if you can maybe frame where you are in turnover levels today relative to the rest of the competition in the fast-casual industry. Yes. Look, I appreciate you taking notice. We -- it's really important to us to make sure that we surround our employees with the right pay, the right growth opportunities and the right benefits. And I do think some of the things that we've added, like being able to help people or incentivize people to pay off student loans and then match them with a 401(k) contribution, I think is a really good for the generation of people that we're hiring, the Gen Zs, and also the growth opportunity. Folks can join our company in crew and in 3, 4 years, quickly find themselves leading one team and in some cases, being a multiunit leader.
So I just had the opportunity to meet a young lady. I think she was like 24, field leader, newly promoted. She was at one of our Cultivate University sessions. And the young lady is very ambitious. I could see she'll be a TD the next time I see her. So I'm excited to have these growth opportunities for people surround with great benefits and I think a great culture.
How does that play out in stability? We're seeing some of the best stability we've seen, frankly, in my time at Chipotle. If you go back and look, the fact that we've got general manager turnover in the low 20s, crew turnover kind of in the low 100s, that's really good. And relative to the industry, I think that's ahead of the industry. But I don't know those numbers for sure. But what I do know is we're getting more stability, we're seeing less turnover. And what we hear back from people is they love the purpose, they love the culture, and they love the growth opportunity. And that's what we're going to continue to provide people. The next question comes from Jon Tower with Citigroup. I'm just curious, Brian, you had mentioned earlier the idea that suggestive selling is starting to work pretty well within the app in terms of getting some incremental attach for orders. But I'm curious if you're doing anything within the stores coaching people up to kind of work that as well, especially, it looks like your digital sales mix, while not slowing remarkably, is coming down quite a bit. So thinking about kind of the check growth from this point forward. Are there means for you to be able to encourage greater attach for consumers in the store? And is there anything you're doing now? Look, I think in the restaurant, just the simple fact that I think our teams are doing a much better job of having chips and queso and guac all the way until close is making a big impact. I think we talked about this, 6, 9 months ago, we weren't as good as we should have been, call it, after 6, 7:00 at night with being ready to go with chips, guac and queso, and now we are. And our teams are very aware that they should be ready to go with those side items. And I think as a result, you're seeing more people attach them.
We aren't doing anything out of the ordinary other than making sure we've got great product ready to go. And when people know it's there, they order it. And when our crew knows they have it, they're more willing to say, hey, they need chips with this order. If it's 7:00, 8:00 at night, you don't have chips, you usually don't say to somebody, do you need chips with that? When you do, it becomes pretty natural in the conversation to say, hey, do you need chips to go with that? Or do you need queso to go like that? So it's really been more focus on executing great culinary available from open to close. Got it. And then just flipping to delivery a little bit. It looks like that might be moving lower as a percentage of your sales as well. And I'm just curious if from your perspective, you're getting any indication from those consumers that this is the way that they're better managing their own spend at the store, effectively trading that higher-cost channel for a lower-cost channel going directly to you. And actually, could you provide the delivery mix as well? Yes. Look, I think intuitively, I think the answer is yes, right? If you're tighter on money, the most expensive way to experience Chipotle is through delivery. So I think consumers know that, and they manage accordingly. But I will say the delivery channel has been pretty stable for the most part. It's in that 14%, 15% range for marketplace and then like 4% or 5% for white label. So you get to like 20% delivery. But it's been pretty stable. And at the end of the day, though, if you need to manage your money, yes, delivery is the most expensive access point. The other one that, Brian, we have is Chipotlane. Chipotlane is one example where when you offer the convenience of Chipotlane and the value that the customization at Chipotle, you normally would expect to get. You do see that the delivery will drop like 10 points, so it will drop to the low, call it, 10%, 12%, something like that, several to 10 points, and then our order ahead and pickup will move up in the high 20s. So to us, that's a clear indication that if we offer extreme convenience along with the value that Chipotle has that people will choose that access channel as opposed to delivery. The next question comes from Dennis Geiger with UBS. Brian, I just wanted to follow up on sort of the strength across income cohorts and the strength in the brand's value scores. Any other commentary sort of on how you think that the strength in those value scores maybe is having, I don't know, an outsized impact perhaps on the customer, on traffic that you're seeing, particularly in this environment where we're hearing about some softness in various parts of the consumer cohort? Any commentary on that based on data that you guys have relative to those value scores? Yes. I mean, look, I think it's the thing we've always talked about, which is relative to, I would say, our peer food offerings, right? So other fast-casual folks have the same or attempt to have the same quality food as us, we're usually 20% to 30% less expensive. And then when you look at some of these other categories where you traditionally view them as more value and convenience, the price delta that you have to pay in order to get our quality, our convenience, our customization, it's not that big of a leap up. So I think that's why we're positioned really well.
If you want to move up, it's not a crazy leap up. And then when you look across, we're at a nice value relative to alternatives. So I think that's why our value scores are as strong as they are. And we're very fortunate that we've been able to maintain that through the last couple of years.
And look, that's why we're maybe a little bit slower sometimes to take price. But when we took it, we thought it was because now the time was right, inflation warranted doing it. But we've always wanted to do it from a standpoint of protecting our value proposition, and I think we've navigated that one pretty well, at least where we are right now. So we'll see what is in store for us, but I think we've talked about this all the time.
Maintaining that value is a really important piece of the puzzle for us. And I just love the fact that we've got quality, we've got value and we've got speed, and we've got customization. We'll protect all those things. And I think we're going to continue to do very well and -- regardless of what the environment is. That's great. And then just quick, Jack, anything more on mix on kind of looking ahead to '24, even at a high level, how to think about the mix component of the check and how that might trend? Yes. Hard to predict because we're in kind of uncharted territory here. I would expect to see a similar mix going forward that the pricing I already talked about what the pricing will be. And I still think there's going to be continued adjustment to the group side for the next several quarters. I would expect it to just ratchet down. It's been ratcheting down over the last several quarters. So I'd expect it to ratchet down from the 1 50, but hard to predict.
I don't know exactly like what quarter will be like at bays and that we won't be seeing the group size decline at all. But it's down to, I think, a very manageable amount, this 1 50. I think the fact that it's combined with a 7.4% transaction growth and we've got very modest pricing, we think it's a really healthy balance right now. The next question comes from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer & Co. On Chipotlanes, I mean, you have over 800 Chipotlanes in your portfolio now. I think you built a record 238 of these in 2023. So the prototype is really starting to gain some scale here, and so now your learnings are so much deeper on these assets. So can you just update us on maybe the margin profile now of the Chipotlane portfolio maybe versus the rest of the system? And are we at a point where there's enough Chipotlanes and enough being built in the future, where as they continue to increase as a percentage of the business that they can actually have an impact on the overall company's restaurant margin? Well, they're already having that impact. But to your point, it's relatively small because 800 is still, what is that, maybe 1/4 of our system. But it's hundreds of basis points of higher margin, if you compare it to our non-Chipotlane.
The volumes have actually come pretty close. They're still a little bit higher for the Chipotlane versus non-Chipotlane. They've closed the gap a little bit. It was much, much higher during the pandemic. But when you combine volumes that are a little bit higher with margins that are hundreds of basis points higher and the investment costs are virtually identical, it's a much higher return. So from a shareholder value standpoint, as we open up, as we grow from the 3,400 towards 7,000, the cash-on-cash returns we're getting from the 80% or 85% of our new restaurants that have a Chipotlane is much, much, much higher.
So it does have an accretive impact on our margin. It has an even more meaningful accretive impact on our returns. And you'll just see it every time we open up new restaurants, you'll see that our margins are going to -- they're going to continue to expand as long as our existing comp transactions grow. And these new restaurants coming on board are just going to add fuel to the fire. And just a follow-up on labor margins. In the fourth quarter, your labor margins ended up being much better than you had guided to originally. So I'm curious what positively surprised you on that line item. Was it just the higher sales and the flow-through from that? And then as we look towards 1Q, you are guiding to some deleverage on the labor line year-over-year. Is that mostly just driven by the softer January? Or is labor leverage just going to be much more challenging this year as we move forward? Yes. No, really, the thing that happens when you turn the calendar, you have taxes because you have people that are getting tax levels. So you kind of reset, and this happens every year where our tax in Q4 are lower then they step up in Q1. So that's the only deleverage that you're seeing.
The leverage that we saw in the fourth quarter is a couple of things. One, when our volumes do -- when our comps accelerate, we do leverage that line as we saw leverage on that line. Two, the ops teams did a good job of managing labor. And then the third thing is our teams did a better job of managing through dealing with like sick time and vacation timing at the end of the year. That was a little bit of a negative surprise to us the year before, and our teams did a much better job this year at just getting ahead of that. So those are the 3 contributors.
But you should expect that as we grow transactions next year, as long as wage inflation stays relatively benign, we should still continue to be able to lever the labor line. The last questioner today will be Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. I guess I wanted to talk about how your most loyal customers are using Chipotle at this point, maybe if there's a way to contrast the frequency of those customers versus 5 years ago when rewards even didn't exist or was very nascent. And then by the same token, kind of talk about how new customers today are entering the Chipotle ecosystem and how they progress in frequency, maybe relative to what you would have seen prepandemic. Yes. Well, the one thing that definitely is clear is if you're in the rewards program, you have higher frequency and higher check. And so obviously, one of the things we're trying to do is both existing customers and new customers continue to drive engagement within our rewards program. And so that continues to work really well. I think we're now like 38 million or almost 40 million people in the program. So that is really powerful.
And we didn't have that 5, 6 -- well, I guess, 7 years ago, we didn't have that. And then when you think about prepandemic, one of the things that was kind of interesting is the pandemic kind of helped us move people into the digital system and get them going in the rewards program.
So over and over again, what we see is whether you're a light, medium or heavy user, when you're in the rewards program, you come more frequently and you spend more. And so it's a really powerful tool. And even when people are redeeming entrees, what we're seeing is they're still buying sites. They're still adding other items. So it's not just one of these things where when you accrue a free entree, you just show up and walk with a free entree. So we're feeling really good about how the rewards program is working with all these, I guess, frequency users.
And then obviously, as we continue to, I think, drive the Chipotle message, we're continuing to attract new users, right? I don't know if you've seen the ads, Sharon, but I think some of the advertising we're running right now is the best we've done, and I think that's also helping to bring in new users. And then these new users are experiencing, I think, is a great experience, great culinary, great throughput, great customization.
So we've kind of got the system still early days. I think it could be better, but the system is working. So we'll probably never be finished working against making everything better, but the system seems to be working right now. Can I ask a follow-up on LTOs? Do those overarch towards kind of improving existing customer frequency? Or are they a real driver of new customers coming to Chipotle? They've actually been a really good driver of new customers. So -- and that's one of the things we look for when we do our testing is how well are they at bringing in new customers. They've been a really nice tool to bring in new customers. And unfortunately, even when we had the LTO walkaway, people are really hooked on the experience, that being culinary, right, that quality, the convenience, the speed, the customization. So it's been a really good tool. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Brian Niccol for any closing comments. All right. Thank you. And thanks, everybody, for joining the call and the questions. I do want to start off with, again, thanking our 115,000 team members. We had an outstanding 2023. And without a doubt, it was because we led with, I think, much better performance in the restaurants. And this is a real testament to our employees staying focused, getting after the basics and working towards hitting our standards.
So we had some really big milestones, right? We surpassed 3,400 restaurants, we opened 800 Chipotlanes, we got past $3 million in average unit volumes. And now we're really excited about where we go next on this journey, which is we'll be even better at throughput, we'll be even faster, we'll be even better on the culinary. And I think that's going to result in us achieving this 4 million average unit volumes and our 7,000 restaurants in the future.
So again, a big thank you to our team. And obviously, we're excited about what's next. So we'll talk to you all here in the next couple of months. Thanks. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

And with that, I will turn the call over to Brian. Thanks, Cindy, and good afternoon, everyone. The momentum in the business continued in the first quarter as we delivered 7% comp sales growth driven by over 5% transaction growth. Our strong sales trends were fueled by our focus on improving throughput in our restaurants as well as successful marketing campaigns, including spotlighting barbacoa and the return of Chicken al Pastor as a limited-time offer.
For the quarter, sales grew 14% to reach $2.7 billion driven by a 7% comp. In-store sales grew by 19% over last year as throughput reached the highest levels in 4 years. Digital sales represented 37% of sales. Restaurant-level margin was 27.5%, an increase of 190 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted diluted EPS was $13.37, representing 27% growth over last year. And we opened 47 new restaurants, including 43 Chipotlanes.
The strength in our business has continued into April. And as a result, we are increasing our annual comp guidance and now estimate comps in the mid- to high single-digit range for the full year.
Now let me shift to an update on our 5 key strategies that help us to win today while we grow our future. These strategies include sustaining world-class people leadership by developing and retaining diverse talent at every level; running successful restaurants with a people-accountable culture that provides great Food with Integrity while delivering exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences; making the brand visible, relevant and loved to improve overall guest engagement; amplifying technology and innovation to drive growth and productivity in our restaurants, support centers and in our supply chain; and finally, expanding access and convenience by accelerating new restaurant openings in North America and internationally.
I'll begin with our world-class people leadership. Last month, we held our All Manager Conference, where we brought together 4,500 of our restaurant and support center leaders to celebrate their success as well as amplify our focus on exceptional people, exceptional food and exceptional throughput. The conference included over 3,200 general managers, 100 apprentices, 450 field leaders, 60 team directors and 11 regional vice presidents.
For the first time, we also included crew members who have worked with us for over 20 years to celebrate their commitment and dedication to Chipotle. In fact, one of our general managers in attendance from Denver, Colorado has been with Chipotle for 23 years, and she also had 4 crew members from her restaurant, who have each been with the company for over 20 years. Collectively, that is over 100 years of Chipotle experience, call it, one restaurant, which is just incredible. And it is no surprise this restaurant has fantastic operations with throughput that is outperforming the overall company.
At our conference, we highlighted the growth opportunity at Chipotle. To reach our long-term target over 7,000 restaurants in North America, we showed our teams that we will need to double the number of field leadership positions we have. And as we target over 90% internal promotions, the majority of these future leaders will come from the GMs and apprentices at this conference. This was a powerful and motivating message and one that is unique to Chipotle given our scale, growth and company-owned model.
And in connection with our 50:1 stock split, we also announced that all of our GMs as well as crew members who have been with Chipotle over 20 years will receive stock grants once the split is effective. This will allow them to participate in the financial success of the company.
Bottom line, Chipotle is changing lives for the better. In fact, one of our restaurateurs and certified training managers spoke at the conference and shared that her experience at Chipotle helped her to overcome financial hardship. Now she was even on the verge of homelessness before she joined Chipotle. She started as a crew member over 10 years ago and has thrived, making her way to the highest-level GM and is now well on her way to becoming a field leader. She was able to leverage our education benefits to earn a college degree, the first in her family. And utilizing the stock she received as a restaurateur, she was able to purchase her first home. She is also one of our team members in our Behind the Foil commercials as she really is a great example of exceptional people that makes Chipotle, Chipotle.
In addition to our world-class people, exceptional food and exceptional throughput are key areas of focus and are both critical to running our successful restaurants. We spent time at our All Manager Conference reminding our teams about Chipotle's culture of Food with Integrity and how there's a direct connection between how food is raised and prepared and how it tastes. We showcased Chipotle's Food with Integrity journey and our strong partnerships with our farmers and suppliers, who take special care in ensuring they are growing our food with the highest standards.
We also emphasized the importance of teaching and tasting Chipotle, which means that our restaurant teams taste the food they prepare multiple times a day to assure it is delicious and meets our high standards. You see, Chipotle was founded on this idea of real food and real culinary. It's not a marketing slogan or a short-term initiative. It's in our heritage. It's in our DNA. Our restaurant teams take pride our food, and our healthy, high-quality eating experience adds value for our guests.
In addition to our delicious food, exceptional throughput or the speed of service in our restaurant also adds to the extraordinary value proposition we offer. I'm thrilled to share that the momentum and throughput continued to build in the first quarter as we improved by nearly 2 entrees in our peak 15 minutes compared to last year with each month showing an acceleration.
At our All Manager Conference, we also focused on coaching the nuances of great throughput or executing what we call the 4 pillars. This includes expo or the crew member between sauce and cash to help expedite the bagging and payment process; linebacker, typically the manager on duty who supplies both lines with freshly prepared food so that the crew on our line can continue to serve our guests without interruption; mise en place or another way of saying that everything that is needed for a lunch or dinner peak is ready and in its place; and aces in their places or having the best trained crew deployed in each position for lunch and dinner peaks.
We are in the early innings of consistently executing the 4 pillars, but when we do, it creates a flywheel effect in our restaurants. The restaurants run more smoothly as our teams are properly trained and deployed, which allows them to keep up with demand without stress. This leads to more stability, and therefore, more experienced teams that execute better every day. And this can be seen in our latest turnover data, which is at historically low levels. And for our guests, faster throughput results in shorter, faster-moving lines and hotter, fresher food, strengthening our value proposition and driving incremental transactions.
Our restaurant in the Financial District in Boston is a great example where a year ago, they were doing mid-20 entrees in their peak 15 minutes. And today, they are doing over 40 entrees in their peak 15 minutes with days that can reach as high as 80, which is among the highest in the company. The restaurant has low turnover and outsized transaction growth, which clearly demonstrates they are creating a better overall experience in the restaurant.
Now turning to marketing. Our marketing team has started the year off strong with outstanding brand advertising and menu innovation. We have continued our successful Behind the Foil brand campaign, showing our real teams prepping our delicious fresh food by hand every day, reinforcing a key differentiator for Chipotle. This ran across all media channels, including high-profile placements in television such as college football and the NFL Playoffs.
We also began to promote our delicious barbacoa as we leveraged our consumer insights that told us that many of our guests did not know that barbacoa was braised beef. So we renamed it Braised Beef Barbacoa and emphasized the culinary recipe, which is slow-cooked, responsibly raised beef seasoned with garlic and cumin and hand-shredded. It was Chipotle's best-kept secret and is now growing in popularity. The campaign was a success, driving incremental transactions and spend, and it was simple for our operations team to execute since it was an existing menu item. This is a perfect example of how our marketing team continues to make Chipotle more visible, more relevant and more loved.
During the quarter, we also brought back one of our most requested new menu items, Chicken al Pastor. Our guests loved our spin on the al Pastor using our adobo chicken, Morita peppers with a splash of pineapple, fresh lime and hand-chopped cilantro. Similar to carne asada, when we bring back a past favorite, we are able to improve the entire experience as we leverage our know-how across culinary, supply chain, marketing and operations to make it more delicious with seamless execution. Chicken al Pastor is off to a great start once again, driving incremental transactions into our restaurants.
Moving on to technology and innovation. Our marketing and digital teams continue to grow and evolve our Rewards program, which recently celebrated its fifth anniversary. It is exciting that we now have a digital reach of about 40 million Rewards members that we can leverage to increase engagement. Through our marketing initiatives, we continue to find successful ways to drive enrollments, and we are leveraging our digital team to create a seamless app experience and deliver more relevant journeys for our Rewards members. The goal is to drive higher engagement in the program, which results in higher frequency and spend over time.
In our restaurants, we continue to explore technology tools that can drive higher productivity and improve the overall experience for our teams. This includes things like forecasting and deploying labor, recruiting new crew members, preparing our fresh food and automating the preparation of digital orders. In fact, at our All Manager Conference, we showed our teams the latest version of our automated digital makeline and Autocado, which cuts cores and peels avocados. And as we discussed last quarter, we are excited to get both into a restaurant later this year as part of the stage gate process.
Our final strategic priority is expanding access and convenience by accelerating new restaurant openings in North America and internationally. We remain on track to open 285 to 315 new restaurants this year, mostly in North America. We continue to see strength in openings across geographies and location types, including urban, suburban and small towns. Additionally, our development team is making progress to smooth the cadence of openings throughout the year with the number of restaurants under construction up meaningfully to last year.
Outside of North America, I'm delighted to share that we opened our first restaurant in Kuwait with the Alshaya Group, which marks the first time we've entered a new country in over 10 years. This was a highly collaborative effort between the Alshaya Group and our Chipotle teams across culinary, food safety, development operations and supply chain to successfully launch Chipotle in a brand-new market with the same food quality standards and customer experience that we have in North America. Although it is very early, the opening was strong, and we look forward to continued success in many restaurants across the region with the Alshaya Group.
Moving to Europe. As you may recall, we brought over one of our top operators about a year ago, who helped to identify areas of opportunity, including better aligning our training tools, systems and culinary with our North American operations where it makes sense and is feasible. We have made nice progress aligning the culinary and are beginning to better align the operations, including a recent change in leadership structure as we expand the role of our Canadian leader to oversee both Canada and Europe.
Over the last 5 years, Canada's economics have improved to be on par with the U.S. In fact, Canada is leading our company in many key operational KPIs, including throughput. The successful approach of aligning the local strategy with our overall operational vision and diligently overseeing execution of Chipotle standards has set up Canada for rapid expansion.
We see many similarities between the European operation today and the Canadian operation 5 years ago. The new leadership team in Europe, including 2 top operators from the U.S., will take a similar strategic approach to improve economics and unlock Europe's growth potential.
In closing, the strength in our business, including transaction-driven comps, is due to the collective hard work of our 120,000 employees, who are results-driven, passionate about our purpose of cultivating a better world and excited for our growth opportunities ahead. At our All Manager Conference, I highlighted the importance of people development as it represents one of our greatest strengths. Seeing our leaders all in one place was inspiring, and their personal growth stories are real and a key ingredient to Chipotle's success and future growth. This makes me more confident than ever that we have the right people and the right strategy to achieve our long-term goals of more than doubling our restaurants in North America and expanding internationally. As I've said in the past, I believe the next Chipotle is Chipotle.
And with that, I will turn it over to Jack. Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. Sales in the first quarter grew 14.1% year-over-year to reach $2.7 billion as sales comp grew 7% driven by over 5% transaction growth. Restaurant-level margin of 27.5% increased about 190 basis points compared to last year. Earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $13.37, representing 27% year-over-year growth. The first quarter had unusual expenses related to an increase in legal reserves.
As Brian mentioned, based on our strong underlying transaction trends, we are raising our full year comp guidance to the mid- to high single-digit range. We anticipate second quarter comps to be the highest of the year, which includes a benefit of an extra day from the Easter shift, and we anticipate comps to continue to be driven by transactions in the back half of the year. We do have some challenging rollover components, including Chicken al Pastor ending, lapping our menu price increase from the prior year and rolling over the very successful carne asada campaign. With that said, we have a strong plan in place for the back half both in terms of operations and marketing.
Additionally, in April, minimum wage in California for restaurant companies like ours increased to $20 an hour. As a result, our wages in California went up by nearly 20%, and we subsequently took a 6% to 7% menu price increase in our California restaurants just to cover the cost in dollar terms. This will add almost 1 full point to total company pricing beginning in Q2. California restaurant cash flow is below the company average, so this increase will allow us to maintain cash flow. However, it will have a negative impact to overall company restaurant-level margin by about 20 basis points.
I'll now go through the key P&L line items, beginning with cost of sales. Cost of sales in the quarter were 28.8%, an increase of about 40 basis points from last year. The benefit of last year's menu price increase was partially offset by inflation across several ingredient costs, primarily beef and produce, and a protein mix headwind and from the successful beef barbacoa marketing initiative. For Q2, we expect our cost of sales to be in the mid-29% range due to higher prices across several items, but most notably avocados as we anticipate a step-up from the low levels we have seen over the past several quarters. We anticipate cost of sales inflation will be in the mid-single-digit range for the remainder of this year.
Labor costs for the quarter were 24.4%, a decrease of about 20 basis points from last year as the benefit from sales leverage more than offset wage inflation and the higher performance-based compensation. For Q2, we expect our labor costs to stay in the mid-24% range with wage inflation stepping up to about 6% as a result of the minimum wage increase in California.
Other operating costs for the quarter were 14.3%, a decrease of about 100 basis points from last year. The decrease was driven by sales leverage, lower delivery expenses and lower marketing and promo costs. Marketing and promo costs were 2.9% of sales in Q1, a decrease of about 30 basis points from last year. In Q2, we expect marketing costs to be in the low 2% range with the full year to come in just below 3%. In Q2, other operating costs are expected to be in the low 13% range.
G&A for the quarter was $204 million on a GAAP basis or $191 million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding a $13 million increase in legal reserves. G&A also includes $126 million in underlying G&A, $34 million related to noncash stock comp, $21 million related to our successful All Manager Conference we held in March and $10 million related to higher bonus accruals and payroll taxes and equity vestings and exercises. We expect our underlying G&A to be around $129 million in Q2 and step up each quarter as we make investments in people and technology to support ongoing growth.
We anticipate stock comp will be around $36 million in Q2, although this amount could move up or down based on our actual performance. We also expect to recognize around $6 million related to higher bonus accruals and employer taxes associated with shares that vest during the quarter, bringing our total anticipated G&A in Q2 to around $171 million. Depreciation for the quarter was $83 million or 3.1% of sales, and we expect depreciation to step up slightly each quarter as we continue to open more restaurants.
Our effective tax rate for Q1 was 22% for GAAP and 22.1% for non-GAAP. And our effective tax rate benefited from option exercises and equity vesting above grant values. For fiscal 2024, we estimate our underlying effective tax rate will be in the 25% to 27% range, though it may vary based on discrete items.
On March 19, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a 50-for-1 stock split, one of the largest in New York Stock Exchange history. We believe this will make our stock more accessible to our employees as well as a broader range of investors. Pending shareholder approval in early June to increase the number of authorized shares, the stock will begin trading on a post-split basis at the market open on Wednesday, June 26.
Our balance sheet remains strong as we ended the quarter with $2.2 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments with no debt. As a result of the timing of our announcement of the stock split, we were unable to repurchase shares for most of the quarter, which limited our share repurchases to just $25 million at an average price of $2,320. At the end of the quarter, we had nearly $400 million remaining under our share authorization program, and we will be able to resume opportunistically repurchasing our shares when the window opens -- reopens in a few days.
We opened 47 new restaurants in the first quarter, of which 43 had a Chipotlane. And we continue to anticipate opening between 285 and 315 new restaurants in 2024 with over 80% having a Chipotlane. And we remain on track to move toward the high end of the 8% to 10% range by 2025, assuming time line conditions do not worsen.
To close, I want to reiterate the message I shared at our recent All Manager Conference. Chipotle started over 30 years ago with a young chef who thought just because food is served fast doesn't mean it has to be a typical fast food experience. That evolved into our Food with Integrity journey, defying the traditional fast food model by investing more in our ingredients and shaping our economic model to help fund that investment. And today, we have a special brand and unique economic model that allows us to spend more on our ingredients yet remain one of the most affordable meals in the industry while also maintaining industry-leading margins.
These 3 characteristics are incredibly difficult to replicate: premium ingredients, affordable prices and attractive margins. And this is a huge competitive advantage. And as we continue to protect and strengthen our economic model, the future looks very bright for Chipotle.
And with that, we're happy to answer your questions. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from David Tarantino with Baird. My question is on speed of service. And Brian, I think you mentioned that you improved in Q1 by 2 transactions, which I think is the biggest improvement we've seen in quite some time. So I guess the first question is, could you maybe elaborate on the factors that drove such a sharp improvement? And then secondly, could you maybe give us an update on where you think you are exiting the quarter, entering the first -- or the second quarter versus where you ultimately want to be? How much progress, I guess, relative to the ultimate goal that you make in the last 3.5 months? Yes. So thanks, David. Well, first, I got to give a big kind of applause to our operators. We've really done a great job, I think, of staffing, scheduling and deploying and then really executing against our 4 pillars of great throughput.
So the nice thing that happened is we saw, frankly, a step-up almost every month. And we continue to see progress as are now in the month of April. In fact, if you remember this, David, we were talking probably in 2023 about being in the low 20s and we want to get into the mid-20s. The good news is we're finally closing in on those mid-20s. And we're starting to see certain days push high 20s.
So still lots of room for improvement. But I really must say that I think the focus, the staffing, the deployment, the scheduling and then also giving our operators the visibility with reporting has really, I think, driven terrific outcomes on this throughput effort. And we're really excited about where we can go from here. And just maybe a quick follow-up on that. So the last year you made this type of progress on throughput that I can remember was all the way back in 2014, and it was a very big comp driver that year. And I just wonder, could this become a big comp driver as you look at the rest of this year and into the next few years? I mean is it possible that this is a big driver as we think about how the next several years plays out? Or is this more of a we're starting to get closer to where you want to be, and maybe it plays out this year, and you normalize versus that base? Yes. No, you're exactly right, David. So 2014 was kind of our high-water mark on throughput. And we believe we've got years of opportunity in this. Just from what we're seeing, we still have a lot of opportunity to execute against the 4 pillars to great throughput. So our teams are doing a much better job than we were just last month or even 6 months ago. But there's still so much upside in what our teams can do and perform.
So this is a multiyear -- you're going to hear us talking about throughput for a long time. And I think you're going to be hearing us talk about how we're getting better as time goes by, assuming we're able to keep the staffing, assuming we're able to keep the deployment, assuming we're able to keep the teams focused on this. But rest assured, it is one of our key drivers of our strategy going forward. And our operators know it's critical.
And the good news is when they have success with throughput, a lot of good things happen for the team. Customer satisfaction scores go up. Bonuses go up. All kinds of good things are happening in the restaurant. The food is better. The experience is better. It's just -- it's one of those things that cascades into everything being a lot better. Great. Congrats on a great start to the year. Yes. Thanks, David. The next question comes from Lauren Silberman with Deutsche Bank. So on traffic, incredible numbers. You talked about this trend continuing into April and particularly impressive when considering what we're seeing in the overall industry. Can you give more color on just the cadence of trends you saw throughout the quarter and into April and color on what you're seeing with the consumer performance at the high-income versus low-income consumer? My apologies, it looks like we've lost connection with our speakers. Please hold while we reconnect.
[Technical Difficulty]
Thank you very much for your patience. We have reconnected with our speakers. We currently have Lauren Silberman from Deutsche Bank asking a question. So if I could just ask about just traffic. Incredible trends during the quarter, strength continuing into April, particularly impressive when considering what's going on in the overall industry. Can you give some more color on the cadence of trends you saw throughout the quarter and into April? And then talk about what you're seeing with the consumer, high-income versus low-income performance. Yes. Sure. So this is Brian. I'll get started, and Jack, feel free to chime in. The good news is, obviously, we had some weather in January, and then we had the timing of the Easter holiday in March and April. But consistently, what we saw was a step-up from that bad weather. And then really our transactions have been running kind of in this mid-single-digit range, which has been, I think, a real testament to the work that's been going on both in the restaurant around throughput and then obviously some of the marketing work that we've got going on both with barbacoa and Chicken al Pastor.
So we continue to see that strength as we entered April. And when we look at where that strength is coming from because I think your question is about consumer/income cohorts, it's really broad based. So from the low-income consumer to the middle-income to the higher-income consumer, we're just seeing gains with all income cohorts. And when we ask the question, why is that, what we hear back from every group is it's a great value proposition. So the speed at which people can get these quality ingredients, customize the way they want for the price points that we provided is playing back -- is just -- create value in this environment. And then, Brian, the only thing to add was transactions were up almost 5.5% during the quarter, and that was offset by check increase by about 1.5%. That was driven by part check and then offset by a little mix -- a little negative mix mostly due to group size. Very helpful. If I could just have a quick one on throughput. Do we expect the throughput efforts to compound over time as consumers recognize the improved operations? Is that what's happening as we move through the quarters? Yes. Yes, that's exactly right. I think we've talked about this in the past. When you know the line moves quickly, you're willing to get in line. And also what happens is the experience is just all that much better, right? The culinary moves faster, and then you get to your experience faster. So our teams run more efficiently. The food, I think, comes across even better prepared. And then you as a customer move through the line faster. So it is one of those things where kind of speed begets speed is the way to describe it. Yes. And Brian, I was just going to ask -- add the -- in terms of the in-store channel, it's the fastest-growing channel during the quarter, and that's coming from 2 areas. One, we've got our in-store customers. Those customers that tend to come in store are coming more often. And it makes sense that when the lines are moving, they're going to come more often. And we're actually also seeing a little bit of shift from some of the order-ahead. Those folks are shifting into the order -- into the in-store channel as well. Again, when the lines are moving well, when the restaurant is running well, people like to come in and select their meal along the front line. Great. Congrats on the quarter. Thank you. The next question comes from Andrew Charles with TD Cowen. I wanted to ask though on transactions. Jack, hoping you can talk about apples-to-apples, the impact on traffic this has had. So if you go back to July 2022, when you guys introduced Project Square One, you talked about hundreds of basis points of transactions that are on the table from reclaiming peak same-store sales or peak transactions. So here we are, you're back to pre-COVID levels. Is there way you can help contextualize the last 1.5 years or so since July 2022 what you've seen from transaction growth, same-store transactions from Project Square One? Yes. Andrew, it's -- so it's hard to parse out the transactions and say how much is due to things like Chicken al Pastor, how much is due to things like barbacoa. Barbacoa, we think, drove some transactions as well and then throughput -- how much is driven by throughput specifically.
I think part of what's happening is they complement each other. And so when we're moving into our peak season right now, and these are our peak sales season, and we've got Chicken al Pastor, which has been -- it's off to a great start, and so you've got seasonally more people coming into the restaurant and more people want to come in and enjoy Chicken al Pastor.
If you don't have throughput, the in-store channel is not going to be the fastest-growing channel or at least it's not going to grow as fast. So is throughput driving the transactions or is it enabling the transaction? So it's hard to sort through whether it's the driver or the enabler. But it really doesn't matter to us because when we've got great LTOs with great advertising and that we're executing great throughput, we know the transactions will flow. And similar to David Tarantino's comment from 2014, that's exactly what was happening, is throughput is an enabler or a driver of transaction growth for not just many quarters but many years. Got it. And then separately, Brian, a philosophical question for you. Just given the strength of the business you're seeing in recent years, which I think is really exemplified in the first quarter given the challenging industry backdrop, just curious how your philosophy on the second concept has perhaps changed. You no doubt have a full plate of exciting opportunities for the brand in the years ahead. But just given the success and the recipe for success that you've seen that you've implemented, does it lead you to believe that you could benefit from a second concept? Obviously, this comes up every once in a while, people bring it up. And the thing I would say is, right now, we're much more focused on just turning Chipotle into an iconic brand that I think it can be not just in the U.S. but outside the U.S. Obviously, if the opportunity presents itself, where it would make sense for us to do something outside of the brand, I never want to say never, but it's just not a focus area for us right now.
We've got so much opportunity in front of us just with what we can do with the brand Chipotle that internally, we're not working on it. But you never know. The external environment changes, and we'd be foolish to say we wouldn't be opportunistic. And luckily, we're operating from a position of strength right now. So I want to be as opportunistic as possible on brand Chipotle. And then if the external environment were to change and present other opportunities, maybe we would consider it, but it's not part of our growth strategy right now. The next question comes from Sara Senatore with Bank of America. Just a quick housekeeping and then another question, please. So just I think, Jack, you mentioned slightly negative mix. Can you clarify what's pricing this quarter? I think it was just under 3%, like 2.8%, something like that. And then what does that mean for Q2 now that you've taken the price increase in California? So that's just the sort of modeling question. Yes. Sara, you're right. Pricing in the quarter was like 2.7%, 2.8%. The only change going into next quarter and the next couple of quarters is we've got the California pricing. That's somewhere around 100 basis points or a little bit less. So Q2 and Q3 will be somewhere in that 3.5% range, and then Q4 will fall off and be more in that 1.5% range because we'll compare against last year's pricing. Great. Very helpful. And then I wanted to ask about sort of the store mix, which is you're seeing a shift towards in-store. Does that have any -- I know you said group size is still falling a little bit, presumably from the lower delivery. But do you see any impact from shifting to in-store? I'm thinking more possibly positive from better attach for like beverages, for example. And I'm curious if -- as you look out ahead, if mix could possibly turn positive from a driver like that. Yes. It's a good question, Sara. We're actually seeing within the, call it, 1.5% of negative -- or it's a 1.5% positive with a mix impact of, call it, about 100 basis points or so. What's happening is the group size is more like declining by about 2%. We actually do have side -- additional side attachment. But we're seeing the side attachment grow in both digital and in in-restaurant, and we are seeing the side attachment increase faster in restaurants than the side. So there is a positive factor there.
It's less from drinks though. It's more with extra meats. It's chips. It's queso. So we're getting a better attachment in both channels, and it is getting better even in the in-store channel. Part of that, we think, frankly, is when we have the line fully staffed, we do think we do a better job of not only making the burrito but making sure when the burrito or the bowl is presented to our cashier that these extras and these sides are more properly run up. Drinks have been relatively steady. We're not seeing a big shift in drinks. Okay. Got it. So kind of the opposite of the check management that we're seeing elsewhere? Correct. The next question comes from Jon Tower with Citigroup. Just a couple. First, maybe as we think about that path to $4 million AUVs that you've spoken about before, can you help us just maybe think about even your average customer frequency today and how that compares to the rest of maybe some of your competitive set out there for just your average customer? Yes. I don't know how to think about our frequency relative to some competitive opportunities out there. What I can tell you is the folks that are in our Rewards program, we see -- with their high engagement, we see higher spend and more frequency. And then also what we're seeing in the business, which I think is really nice to see as a result, I think the efforts both in better operational execution and I think our advertising around just the base business, this idea of real ingredients, real culinary, fast customization. We're just seeing the base business grow.
So obviously, we love what Chicken al Pastor does for us as far as menu variety. Obviously, we love the fact that we're able to rehit barbacoa, which is within our existing business. But I think what's been nice about the cadence of marketing and news combined with, I think, great operational execution is we're just seeing the base business grow. So we're getting more new users. We're getting existing users to come more often. And it's a great recipe to grow your core business in all the various ways we've talked about, right, from marketing to digital to operations. Great. Maybe just pivoting a little bit on you. Can you talk about the Canadian market and specifically about the potential you think for that over the long term? And then expanding, I think you had mentioned earlier the idea that Europe looks a lot like Canada 5 years ago. But do you feel like you can, given everything you've learned in Canada, implement a lot of what you've taken there and apply it to Europe such that the time line around getting growth in Europe will be a lot faster versus what you saw in Canada? Look, I mean, we're delighted with what's happened or what's occurred in Canada 5, 6 years ago. We were struggling to make the unit economics look very compelling. Now they're very compelling. It's right there with the U.S. And as a result, that business is closing in on 50 restaurants. And pretty soon, we'll have 100 restaurants up there. And then I think we'll be talking about having hundreds of restaurants in Canada, which is really exciting.
To answer your question on Europe, yes, look, I think our belief is we've learned a lot on what we've had to do in Canada to get that business to perform. We're taking that leadership there, giving her the opportunity to oversee our Europe business, take those lessons learned and apply it. And then at the same token, we're taking what we think are some of our best operators in the U.S., giving them the opportunity to grow by working in our European business.
So the time line, I don't know what the time line is going to be, but I am feeling optimistic that we've got the right operators, the right leadership. And then look, the proposition is compelling, right? Clean food, great culinary, done fast with high levels of customization that resonates. So I'm optimistic about where we go from here for all the reasons I just mentioned. The next question comes from Dennis Geiger with UBS. Brian, I wanted to follow up on your comment there that the incremental traffic or visits are coming both from existing customers coming more as well as from new customers. I don't know if you have this granular level of detail, but I'm curious if you have a sense maybe from where. Maybe it's everywhere, but if it's QSR, if it's other fast casual. Any sense -- are you picking it up more at lunch, the incremental visits and customers more at dinner? Is there any other level of granularity to kind of help explain some of the success and maybe where it's coming from as it shifts to you folks? No, not really. I mean the good news for us is it's pretty broad based, right? It's coming across all income cohorts. It's coming across lunch and dinner and the afternoon. So it's not like there's one thing that I would identify as like this change in consumer behavior.
I think the one big change for us is we're performing a lot better in giving people the experience that they actually want from Chipotle. I think you've heard us talk about this time and time again, exceptional food, exceptional people, exceptional throughput. And I think we're just getting better at each of those things. And the good news for us is we have an opportunity to be even better than we are today.
And then you layer in what I talked about earlier as it relates to marketing, both talking about the brand itself and then some of this menu news. It's just -- it's one of those things that builds on itself, right? Great digital programs, great marketing programs become much more effective when we're executing operations at a higher level. And I think that's what's happening. That's great. And then just one -- just on the menu innovation follow-up. Just given the success you've seen as you bring back past favorites, as it relates to the go-forward, given the success that you've seen in recent years from that strategy, has that shifted at all how you think about menu innovation going forward as it relates to bringing back past favorites versus some newer items? Any shift there for you and for the team? No, no real shift. I mean I think we like this cadence of 1 or 2 items a year. The good news is we've got now a great proven group of menu news that we can provide. And the good news is we've got a really talented culinary team and a talented marketing team that continues to help us find, I think, new flavors that make sense that can be executed correctly at Chipotle.
So you're going to see us continue to hopefully mix in things that we know have worked in the past and things that will be new but have gone through our stage-gate process so that we have a high level of success or belief in success going forward. So we like the cadence we're in. We can operate really well with it, and it seems to be resonating with our customers. So we want to keep doing what's working. Congratulations. Thank you. The next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. I wanted to get an update on some of the near-term operational initiatives that you've talked about before, the clamshell, Autocado, Hyphen, and just kind of where we are in the stage-gate process. And if you can put that in the context of kind of an updated, I guess, funding of the Cultivate fund, what types of opportunities that you're looking for, for the next phase of opportunities to overall accelerate the Chipotle brand. Yes. Sure. So obviously, all this stuff is really exciting. The dual-sided grill, we've expanded to a few more restaurants, specifically our high-volume restaurants. We think that's not only a great unlock for consistency in the culinary of our proteins and meats, but it's also a nice unlock for high-volume restaurants because you can cook the chicken faster. It allows the teams then to start prep closer to when we want to serve customers, which is really exciting. So we're continuing to test and learn on that front. We've also made some nice progress on the energy usage associated with it, which was something that was a bit of a barrier.
On Hyphen and Autocado, I'm happy to say we've got both of those units back in our Cultivate Center for a couple of prototypes in. And we are feeling really good about getting those into a restaurant probably in the back half of this year.
And then there's a lot of other things happening, too, both on like forecasting, deployment, tools to help our team members cut veggies more efficiently, more effectively. So there's a lot of good things happening behind the scenes. And I'm optimistic about what some of these things can do for our team members to give them a better experience, which then I know translates into better culinary and then ultimately better experiences for our customers.
On the Cultivate Next fund, this continues to be a real, I think, highlight area for us because we're continuing to see great ideas. And these great ideas are all the way from different ways to fertilize, to weeding in the fields, to different ways to actually deliver food or oils. So the thing I know about this is it's perfectly in sync with our purpose of cultivating a better world. And we can use it to really move forward the entire system necessary to give people great culinary, great ingredients, great food, at affordable prices. So you're seeing us invest up and down the supply chain all the way to the point of customer experience. The next question comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. I guess on California, where you took the price increase, I know it's pretty recent. But could you give us an idea of where average ticket now sits in California and whether you've been seeing any resistance within that market as wages have ticked up and you've had to take that price increase? Yes, Sharon. So the average ticket in California is similar to the rest of the country. Until this increase, our menu prices in California were very similar to the averages throughout the country, even though the cost of doing business out in California tends to be higher. After the increase, we still have burritos that are going to be reasonably priced. The chicken burrito is going to be around $10. It's very early, as you mentioned. It's too early to tell. We're not seeing any kind of change in consumer behavior yet, but it's only been a matter of a few weeks so far. So we'll keep a close eye on it.
We still think in California compared to competitors, we're still a terrific value if you look at what others are charging because if you look at others in California before this increase and compare them to average measure prices throughout the country, they tend to be higher. They're passing on a higher cost of doing business. We've tried to keep our pricing very, very affordable in California. So we still think we offer a great value here. So we think we'll fare quite well. As a consumer absorbs and figures out how do they want to balance their budget, we think Chipotle will stay in the budget. Okay. Great. I wanted to ask another question, too, as it relates to Chipotlanes, which obviously have been great. But as you look at kind of the automation and the initiatives you're working on, do you think there's anything that you're looking at or that could come down the pike that would open up kind of the opportunity for a nondigital drive-through, just a regular drive-up and order drive-through? Or is there not something from a robotic assembly standpoint that could answer that for you? Yes. We don't envision that occurring. The thing that makes Chipotle pretty special is all the customization, and we would hate to screw up that experience. And that's why -- you might remember this. I remember when we first did this. Everybody was like, oh, people are going to be confused, how are they going to know how to order, so on and so forth.
And it's turned out to be a really pleasant experience for both our team members and our customers because literally all they have to do is pick up their food. Everything is paid for. The order is accurate. It's on time and on you go. So we think there's other places for us to be more productive, where we're hunting on kind of using robotics and AI and finding other ways to do productivity. But you're not going to see that coming down the pike. The next question comes from Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley. I had a question just on your comments about the Rewards program. Obviously, you continue to add people to that. But the effort to kind of drive engagement on a same-user basis, I know you've worked on personalization of offers and such. Have you seen that kind of showing? Have you seen pretty nice improvements in frequency? Or anything you can say just about what you've observed kind of from the same-user base of Rewards members? Yes. I think one of the things that's pretty interesting that over the last, I'd say, couple of months has really worked well for us is kind of between machine learning and AI. I'm not sure what the right label is here. But we figured out how to identify somebody that might go less frequent so that we can keep them in the mix. And that's proving to be pretty powerful. Still a very small cohort that we're learning on. But the good news is we're seeing nice progress with that cohort that I'm optimistic kind of in our stage-gate process, we'll take that learning and figure out how to apply it on a much bigger scale so that then you can feel it across the digital business.
But it's those types of things where I think the team is doing a nice job of commercializing the data in a very effective way that ultimately for the customer, it feels like more personalization, more relevance. Therefore, you keep the engagement up. And then obviously, when we keep the engagement up, we see the higher spend and the more frequency. Okay. Got it. There is a comment you made, Brian, just about forecasting and deployment in restaurants. So it's not just equipment. It's also kind of that piece of it, which I assume you're referring to kind of the software tools that you've put there. Is that -- what have you seen from that so far? Has that made a big difference, in your opinion, on throughput and kind of staffing? Could you say more about that? Yes, definitely. Look, I think one of the things that's happening is because we're getting better at forecasting, better at deploying, better at the scheduling, the job is becoming a better job, right? And one of the ways you see it is in our turnover numbers, right? Our turnover numbers are the lowest they've ever been. We've got some regions well below 100% turnover at the crew level, which I've never seen in my time in this industry. I think some of the lowest numbers I've ever seen, frankly, at Chipotle.
And to be in that 100% range, I think, is a testament to us making the job a better experience for our team members. I say this all the time to our folks. I said this at our AMC. Our folks show up at work wanting to succeed. The more we can do to surround them so that they have a successful day, the better they feel about the job, the better they feel about the experience that they're giving. Nobody likes to show up and be out of chicken when a customer gets to that point.
And so the more we can do to ensure they prep correctly, they're staffed correctly, they're deployed correctly, the better the experience is going to be. And I think we're starting to see that in the turnover numbers. We're starting to see that in, frankly, just the performance at throughput, right, the ultimate kind of metric to see like is the whole system really working. The whole system is working when we get great throughput.
And I'm just -- I'm delighted to see it happen. I talked about this a little bit in my prepared remarks. You really see it all coming alive at our AMC because when I had the opportunity to talk to people in the hallways or on our way to breakouts, I think people are just energized, man. They're fired up about this idea of being successful in their role, being successful as a leader. And that translates into the team. Everybody likes to be part of the winning team. And I think that's what's happening in our restaurants. We've got leaders that know they're leading winning teams. So we're going to do more of that. The last question today comes from Chris O'Cull with Stifel. I had a follow-up related to execution during peak periods. And in particular, Brian, you've talked about helping teams in the stores have better visibility to know how they're performing in their 15 minutes so they can course-correct, I think, in real time. Is this a fairly new system or a dashboard tool that managers have access to? And then maybe to help us understand the opportunity, I was just wondering if you could tell us what's the difference between the number of entrees during 15-minute peaks for like the top 20% and maybe the bottom 20% performers. Yes. So to answer your first question, it is a new tool that we rolled out in January that gave them real-time visibility, which has been hugely powerful. It's great because now when I visit restaurants and ask people, ""Hey, how are you doing?"" They can tell me what their best 15 has been so far. And a lot of them now are so well aware like, hey, I know we can do better than that. So like we might have did 25 in the last 15, but I think we're going to do 35 in the next 15, which is really exciting to hear them have that type of visibility and have kind of clarity so that as a team, they know what they're all working towards. What was your other question? It was the range on throughput. Oh, the range to the top and bottom? Yes. And I can take that one. We will see at the bottom -- and these tend to be lower-volume restaurants. You'll see restaurants that are doing in the mid-teens, call it. And then I don't think this is maybe the top 20%. But when we look at the top restaurants, which tells us what the potential is, Brian gave an example during the prepared remarks. In Boston, we've seen as high as 80. We've seen some even higher than that. But I would say the top-performing restaurants are consistently -- or at least on a peak day, it's not going to be in that 40, 50 range. So it's a very wide range. And we're still towards the lower end of that range with a lot of potential ahead of us. Great. Congratulations on a great start to the year. Yes. Thank you. Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Brian Niccol for any closing remarks. Okay. Thank you. And thanks, everybody, for the questions. Obviously, I appreciate the kind words of recognizing how we're off to a great start. Very proud of the momentum that the business has and really proud of what our operators are doing in our restaurants.
I mentioned it in my prepared remarks, but it was so much fun to be at our AMC with all of our restaurant general managers, apprentices, field leaders, team directors, regional vice presidents, talking about the business. Everybody was clearly aligned on what the task needs to be at hand, which is great culinary, developing great people, great culture, great teams, right, and then ultimately getting great throughput for our customers.
And I think you're seeing the power of focus, the power of alignment and the power, frankly, of Chipotle's culture and great people in these results in the last quarter. Optimistic about where we go from here. It's exciting to think about how we can double this business, going from 3,400, 3,500 restaurants to 7,000 restaurants, getting to 4 million average unit volumes and then continuing to make great progress on throughput and surrounding this brand, I think, with great digital, great marketing. It's really an exciting moment for the brand and the company.
And we're just getting started, which really makes this a lot of fun. So thanks for taking the time. It's great to see the business respond with transactions driving the comp. And we're going to stay focused on what we know works. So we'll talk to you guys in a couple of months. Thanks, everybody. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

And with that, I will turn the call over to Brian. Thanks, Cindy, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I begin discussing our results, I need to recognize and congratulate Jack Hartung on his nearly 25 years with Chipotle and roughly 80 earnings calls with all of you. I want to thank him for being a great friend, a terrific leader and a champion for our purpose and brand. I'll say a few more words about Jack and Adam before I hand it over to him. .
Now turning to our results. The second quarter was outstanding as successful brand marketing, including the return of Chicken al Pastor as a limited time offer drove strong demand to our restaurants. Additionally, our focus and training around throughput paid off as we were able to meet the stronger demand trends with terrific service and speed in -- driving over an 8% transaction comp in the quarter. For the quarter, sales grew 18% to reach nearly $3 billion, driven by an 11.1% comp. In-store sales grew by 24% over last year. Digital sales represented 35% of sales, restaurant level margin was 28.9%, an increase of 140 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.34, representing 36% growth over last year, and we opened 53 new restaurants, including 46 Chipotlanes.
Before I give an update on our 5 key strategies, I want to take a minute to address the portion concerns that have been brought up in social media. First, there was never a directive to provide less to our customers. Generous portion is a core brand equity of Chipotle. It always has been, and it always will be. With that said, getting the feedback caused us to relook at our execution across our entire system with the intention to always serve our guests delicious, fresh, custom burritos and bowls with generous portions. To be more consistent across all 3,500 restaurants, we have focused in on those with outlier portion scores based on consumer surveys, and we are reemphasizing training and coaching around ensuring we are consistently making bowls and burritos correctly. We have also leaned in and reemphasized generous portions across all of our restaurants as it is a core brand equity of Chipotle. Our guests expect this now more than ever, and we are committed to making this investment to reinforce that Chipotle stands for a generous amount of delicious, fresh food at fair prices for every customer, every visit.
The good news is that we are already beginning to see our actions positively reflected in our consumer scores and our value proposition remains very strong. We believe our focus on operations, including throughput as well as terrific marketing and menu innovation, have strengthened the brand and our value proposition. And we will continue to listen to and treasure our guests to earn every transaction.
Now I will turn to our 5 key strategies that help us to win today while we grow our future. These strategies include running successful restaurants with a people accountable culture that provides great food with integrity while delivering an exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences, sustaining world-class people leadership by developing and retaining diverse talent at every level, making the brand visible relevant and love to improve overall guest engagement, amplifying technology and innovation to drive growth and productivity at our restaurants, support centers and in our supply chain and expanding access and convenience by accelerating new restaurant openings in North America and internationally.
First, I will start with running successful restaurants. As I mentioned, the improvements we have seen in throughput positions us well to meet the strong demand we experienced in the second quarter, driven by what we call burrito season or our peak seasonality as well as the success of Chicken al Pastor. We often are asked why throughput is such an important operational KPI for Chipotle. So I thought I would begin by expanding on this. It is the outcome of a strong operational engine that delivers a great experience for our teams and our guests. In order to deliver exceptional throughput, our restaurants need to be fully staffed and properly deployed. Our crew needs to complete all food prep on time and they need to be well trained to execute the 4 pillars. This results in a better overall experience for our crew, which leads to more stability and, therefore, more experienced teams that execute better every day. And for our guests, faster lines with hotter, fresher food. This type of guest experience strengthens our value proposition and drive incremental transactions. Over the last year, we have improved our tools and training to deliver exceptional throughput. This included rightsizing the cadence of digital orders during peak periods and enabling our restaurants to see in real time at the point of sale, the number of entrees in each 15-minute interval. This has received tremendous feedback from our restaurant teams. It has helped to accelerate momentum as it creates excitement and allows our teams to celebrate in a moment when they achieve their goal. And our GMs can coach in the moment when they fall short. In fact, one of our field leaders in New York have 5 of his 8 restaurants achieved their throughput goal in the second quarter, which compares to just one of his restaurants a year ago.
While we are seeing progress, we still have a lot of opportunity to increase the percentage of restaurants executing the 4 pillars. Expo is a great example as it is the most impactful pillar. As a reminder, Expo is the crew member between Salsa and Kash, who helps expedite the bagging and payment process. restaurants within Expo in place are averaging 5 incremental entrees in their peak 15 minutes, yet we only see a little over half of our restaurants with Expo in place during peak periods. This is certainly better than where it was a couple of quarters ago, but it should be a lot higher. The good news is that I strongly believe we have the right leaders in training in place to keep the momentum going as we continue to gather the data on the execution of the 4 pillars and provide feedback and coaching on a weekly basis, I am confident throughput can go much higher.
This brings me to world-class people leadership. As we mentioned last quarter, crew and GM turnover is at some of the best levels I've seen since I joined the company. And the stability is allowing us to develop and grow our people pipeline to achieve our goal of promoting over 90% from within. We have many inspiring stories at Chipotle of crew members who have grown with the company to become some of our top leaders. In fact, our recently promoted regional Vice President started as a crew member 25 years ago. She moved to the United States at 14 years old without knowing English. At 19, she started working at Chipotle and has moved her way up, including spending time in a language development role supporting other employees at Chipotle to learn English as a second language. Her people-first mentality is what has made her so successful at hiring, developing and retaining many of our best leaders. And she has 2 sisters that have each been with Chipotle for over 15 years and our top-performing field leaders. With the addition of her role, we now have 3 of our 10 regional vice presidents who started as crew members and have made their way up to leading a region and managing over a $1 billion business. These stories really do inspire our entire organization as the opportunity to develop and grow within Chipotle, along with our industry leading benefits and pay, enables us to attract and retain exceptional people. In fact, as we look to expand to 7,000 restaurants in North America, we will be adding an RVP nearly every year along with hundreds of restaurant leadership roles.
Finally, our 50-for-1 stock split, one of the largest in New York Stock Exchange history, enables our employees and others to purchase whole shares at more affordable prices and gives us more flexibility to compensate our top performers in stock, all with the goal to have more employees participate in the financial success of our company. It really is an exciting time to be part of Chipotle.
Now turning to marketing. The Chipotle brand continues to gain momentum as we focus on exceptional operations and making the brand more visible, more relevant and more loved. Chicken al Pastor is a great example as it once again surpassed our expectations, reaching over a 20% incidence rate and more importantly, driving incremental transactions and spend. Similar to carne asada, we proved that when we bring back a limited time offer, we were able to make it more delicious with seamless execution. And while Chicken al Pastor will end later this summer, I am excited to share that we will be bringing back smoke brisket this fall for a limited time. Brisket was among the most requested in many items as our guests love the combination of smoke beef chart on the grill and finish with the brisket as me with smoky chile peppers. It took a huge cross-functional effort across supply chain, culinary finance and marketing to bring back this delicious LTO.
Our marketing team also continues to find creative ways to generate excitement and drive more engagement around our annual promotions. In the second quarter, we had a record-breaking National Burrito Day, where our gamified promotion resulted in Chipotle's best sales and digital sales day ever. It also drove an influx of new and lapsed customers and was the best enrollment day of the year for our rewards program. I'm also thrilled to share that later this week, team Chipotle will be visible on the world stage as we leverage our real food for real athletes platform for those competing in Paris. We highlighted the inspiring journeys of Anthony Edwards, Sofia Smith, Taylor Fritz, Sarah Hughes and Jager Eaton. Their go to Chipotle meals and how our ingredients have been a key component of their training regimens. We will also bring back our gold foil for burritos for a limited time in both North America and France to celebrate all the athletes competing.
Shifting to technology and innovation. I want to provide an update on a few of our in-restaurant initiatives starting with the dual side of Grill. Over the last year, the Grill has been in 10 restaurants, and we have received consistent feedback that our teams and our guests love it. The grill can cook the chicken and steak in under half the time it takes on the Plancha with consistent execution and the same [indiscernible]. It also maintains better moisture resulting in juicier chicken and steak with less waste. And for our teams, it takes one of the most complex positions in our restaurants and significantly improves the learning curve.
Finally, for high-volume restaurants, it opens up capacity and drives efficiency during morning prep as chicken and steak can be closer to serving. We are in the process of rolling out the dual sided grill to an additional 74 high-volume restaurants this year, and we'll continue to evaluate the economics prior to rolling it out further across the organization. Additionally, our automated digital make line in Autocado are making their way through final checks ahead of being pilot tested in their first restaurant. Our food safety and operation teams have worked closely with our technology teams to assure that the design takes into account things like cleaning, speed and accuracy as well as maintaining our high culinary standards.
The next step will be to get each device into a restaurant to continue to learn and iterate as part of our stage gate process. I'm excited about each of these initiatives, and I strongly believe we will see some impactful back-of-house changes in the years to come, that will help to improve consistency in our restaurants and drive a better overall experience for our teams and our guests.
I'm also proud Chipotle continues to be a learning organization. Using the stage gate process is our way to drive discipline around what ultimately gets rolled out. I'm confident this process will further strengthen Chipotle as a leader in technology and innovation.
Now moving to our final strategy, which is to expand access and convenience. In North America, we remain on track to open 285 to 315 new restaurants this year, and our openings remain strong across all markets. While our time lines remain consistent to last quarter, our development team continues to see groundbreaks meaningfully higher compared to last year. which should help smooth the cadence of openings as we get into the back half of the year.
I also wanted to share an update on our partnership with the Alshaya Group. Our first restaurant in Kuwait has been open for several months and continues to have strong performance. The good news is that the feedback from guests is that the culinary experience is right on par with North America, which is fantastic to hear. It also tells me that when we execute our culinary and deliver an exceptional experience for our guests, Chipotle's brand resonates across geographies. We look forward to opening our second restaurant in Kuwait as well as expanding into Dubai with the Alshaya Group later this year.
To close, our crew members, GMs and field leadership delivered an excellent second quarter helped by our committed support centers that enable restaurants to better succeed. We are very fortunate to have a clear purpose and an organization that is full of talented people at all levels. It is exciting to see the progress we have made so far, and I am confident there is much more growth in front of us.
Finally, I want to spend a few minutes reflecting on my time with Jack and his extraordinary 25 years at Chipotle. Jack is just as passionate about our brand and our purpose as he is about protecting our economic model. I know you all agree with me that he is one of the best CFOs in the business and has played an instrumental role in growing Chipotle from under 200 restaurants to over 3,500 restaurants, investing in our premium ingredients, and supply chain, protecting our exceptional value proposition and delivering industry-leading economics and returns. As Jack always says, these 3 characteristics are incredibly difficult to replicate, premium ingredients, affordable prices and attractive margins. Beyond that, he has developed an exceptional finance team, including Adam Rimer, who will become our next Chief Financial Officer. Over the last 15 years, Adam has reported directly or indirectly to and been mentored by Jack in preparation for this role. And importantly, he is just as passionate about our brand, our purpose and protecting our economic model. I'm highly confident he is the right leader to become our next CFO, and that it will be a smooth transition. So again, thank you, Jack, for your friendship, leadership and so many contributions to Chipotle.
And with that, I'll turn it over to you. Thank you, Brian, for those kind words. I'm extremely fortunate to have had the privilege and honor to serve Chipotle, our employees and our shareholders for all these years. While retiring was one of the hardest decisions, it was also one of the easiest I've ever had to make. It was hard because Chipotle is a special brand, a special company and it's full of special people. But it was also easy because I know Chipotle is in great hands with a family of smart, talented people who are committed to our purpose to cultivate a better world. It's also easy because I have a large and growing extended family, and I treasure the time I get to spend with every one of them, and now we'll have the chance to enjoy even more special experiences with them. I'm delighted that Adam Rimer will be our next CFO, and as Brian mentioned, Adam has worked with me for 15 years, and I can tell you he's a very talented leader who knows our brand and our business well, and I'm confident in his ability to help lead Chipotle to the next level. In addition, Jamie McConnell will be elevated to our Chief Accounting and Administrative Officer. And since joining Chipotle 6 years ago, Jamie has provided great leadership, built strong teams and is well prepared to serve in our new role.
With that said, I'll turn now to our quarterly results. Sales in the second quarter grew 18.2% year-over-year to reach about $3 billion as comp sales grew 11.1%, driven by 8.7% transaction growth. Restaurant-level margin of 28.9% increased about 140 basis points compared to last year. Earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $0.34, representing 36% year-over-year growth. The second quarter had unusual expenses related to unrealized loss on investment and an increase in legal reserves, which negatively impacted our earnings per share by $0.01, leading to GAAP earnings per share of $0.33.
Sales comps were highest in April, driven by the Easter shift, a strong reaction to the return of Chicken al Pastor and several successful activations, including National Burrito day. Comps settled back to around 6% in June, and continue to be driven by positive transactions. July has been more difficult to read so far due to the 4th holiday, weather disruptions in Texas and the impact from a recent technology outage, but we believe the underlying trend remains similar to June. We are maintaining our full year comp guidance of mid- to high single digit. And as a reminder, we will roll off about 3 points of pricing in early Q4 as we lap our menu price increase from last year.
Before I go through the individual P&L line items, I want to give an overview of what to anticipate. We expect our margins will be under pressure for the next couple of quarters. Most, if not all of this pressure is seasonal, temporary, or it's an investment that we can offset through efficiencies, and we believe our industry-leading margin structure is still intact. I'll now go through each of the key P&L line items, beginning with cost of sales. Cost of sales in the quarter were 29.4% in line with last year. Benefit of last year's menu price increase was offset by inflation in avocados, increased oil usage and higher incidence of beef as a result of the continued success of Braised Beef Barbacoa marketing initiative.
For Q3, we expect our cost of sales to be just below 31%. About 1/3 of the step-up is due to the higher protein costs as we roll out Chicken al Pastor and then launched Smoke Brisket later in the quarter. About 1/3 is due to an uptick in dairy and avocado prices and the final 1/3 are about 40 to 60 basis points is an investment we are making as we focus on outlier restaurants to ensure correct and generous portion. We expect this investment will ease from these levels somewhat. We also believe that we can offset the remaining investment with efficiencies and innovation over time. While avocado prices are higher than the very favorable levels we have seen over the past several quarters, this is in line with our expectations from earlier this year.
Additionally, we are less impacted by the recent volatility in the Mexican avocado market as our supply chain team has done a fantastic job of diversifying our exposure. And in the third quarter, the majority of our avocados come from Peru. Outside of avocados and the protein mix shift, we anticipate underlying cost of sales inflation will be in the low single digits range for the remainder of the year. Labor cost for the quarter was 24.1%, a decrease of about 20 basis points from last year as the benefit from sales leverage more than offset wage inflation. For Q3, we expect our labor cost to be in the low 25% range due to seasonally lower sales with wage inflation to remain at about 6%. And as a reminder, about half of the wage inflation is due to the nearly 20% step-up in wages in California as a result of the increase in minimum wage for restaurant companies like ours that took effect in April.
Other operating costs for the quarter were 12.9%, a decrease of about 100 basis points from last year. The decrease was primarily driven by sales leverage. Marketing and promo costs were 2.1% of sales in Q2. And in Q3, we expect marketing costs to remain in the low 2% range with the full year to be in the high 2% range. In Q3, other operating costs are expected to be in the high 13% range due to seasonally lower sales and higher seasonal expenses like utilities and maintenance and repair. Based on these expectations provided, we anticipate restaurant level margin to be around 25% in Q3. As I mentioned earlier, some of the pressure is seasonal, like the shift from Chicken al Pastor to Brisket. Some is temporary like the higher prices in avocados and dairy, which if they persist, we can address with menu prices over time. And finally, we're confident that the investment we're making to ensure we are delivering correct and generous portions can be offset by efficiencies and innovation over time.
G&A for the quarter was $175 million on a GAAP basis or about $171 million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding $4 million increase in legal reserves. G&A also includes $122 million in underlying G&A, $43 million related to noncash stock compensation and $6 million related to higher bonus accruals and payroll taxes and equity vesting and exercises. We expect our underlying G&A to be around $128 million in Q3 and step up each quarter as we make investments in people to support ongoing growth. Anticipated stock comp will be around $40 million in Q3, although this amount could move up or down based on our actual results. We also expect to recognize around $6 million related to higher bonus accruals and employer taxes associated with shares that vest during the quarter, bringing our anticipated total G&A in Q3 to around $175 million.
Depreciation for the quarter was $84 million or 2.8% of sales, and we expect depreciation to step up slightly each quarter as we continue to open more restaurants. Effective tax rate for Q2 was 25% for GAAP as well as for non-GAAP. Our effective tax rate benefited from option exercises and equity vesting above the grant value. And for fiscal 2024, we estimate our underlying effective tax rate will be in the 25% to 27% range thought it may vary based on discrete items. On June 26, we successfully completed our 50-for-1 stock split, one of the largest in New York Stock Exchange history. We believe this will make our stock more accessible to our employees as well as a broader range of investors.
Our balance sheet remains strong as we ended the quarter with $2.5 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments with no debt. During the quarter, we repurchased $151 million of our stock at an average price of $63.52. At the end of the quarter, we had nearly $650 million remaining under our share authorization program. We opened 53 new restaurants in the second quarter, of which 46 at Chipotle. We continue to anticipate opening between 285 to 315 new restaurants in 2024 with over 80% having at Chipotle, and we remain on track to move towards the high end of the 8% to 10% range by 2025, assuming time line conditions do not worsen.
To close, I also want to thank our employees for all their hard work in driving our strong results and for continuing to build and grow Chipotle. I also want to reflect how our historic 50-for-1 stock split. When Chipotle went public at $22 per share, I was very optimistic that we have a special brand with a tremendous growth opportunity. I'm not sure I could have ever imagined then that we would split the shares at just over $3,200 per share, but I did envision that we would reach over 3,000 restaurants as we have today in the U.S. And today, I know we have a special brand with industry-leading economics and returns. I'm also just as optimistic about our growth opportunity to reach 7,000 restaurants in North America and to expand internationally. And as we further our purpose of cultivating a better world, we'll continue to drive extraordinary value for our guests, our employees and our shareholders. It's truly an exciting time to be part of this purpose-driven company with seemingly limitless opportunity.
And with that, I'll open the lines to your questions. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from David Tarantino with Baird. First, Jack, congratulations on an amazing career at Chipotle. And you're going to be missed, and we look forward to working with Adam going forward. So my question is about the sales trends you called out, I think you said the comps moderated into the kind of 6% ballpark in June, and you think that underlying trend is carried over into July. While that's very good relative to what we're seeing from a lot of brands. It is slower than what you were running previously. So I just wanted to get your thoughts on why you think you saw that slow down, whether it's macro or something inside the business that may have caused that. Why don't we start and then Jack can fill in. The -- look, first of all, David, I would tell you the quarter was really spectacular. And when we look at brand metrics, they've never been stronger. So value, food scores all the key metrics to make sure that the brand is in a good spot really continue to improve throughout the quarter. And then from an operating standpoint, I don't know if you've been to our restaurants recently, but I think the teams are doing a terrific job on continuing to deliver quick culinary grade throughput. And then, obviously, we mentioned in our earlier comments, we've doubled down on making sure we're also providing great portions, which is, I think, a key equity for this business as well. One of the things we've seen, which is consistent with what we saw last year, is this kind of seasonal move with kind of the summer change of behaviors. And so obviously, we're trying to understand what that looks like because it appears to be new trends. since coming out of COVID. So that's one piece of the puzzle. And then obviously, we're trying to understand if there are any macro things going on as well. But the one thing we know for sure is the feedback on the business from our customers has been great value, great culinary and improving speed. And those are the things we can control, and those are the things we're going to stay focused on delivering going forward. Jack, I don't know if you want to add anything. No. I mean, just to add some more text things like July 4 used to be like a weekend and now it looks like it's 2 weekends. So it looks like the combination of there's a holiday and then work from home is more acceptable. Now it just seems like the holidays, it used to be 3 or 4 days or so. It seems like they're stretching out a little bit. We even saw for the first time ever on Juneteenth, we saw a little softness there as well. So we wonder if that's also kind of a work-from-home environment as well. So the last couple of summers have been very hard to predict. And so we think that's definitely a big part of what we're seeing. The next question comes from Sara Senatore with Bank of America. Just -- first of all, congratulations to both Jack and Adam. I've enjoyed working with both of you. But the question I have first is just a quick follow-up. If you could just maybe talk a little bit about the composition of the comp price mix and how you're thinking about that going forward, given some of the reinvestments that you're making. And then also wanted to get a sense of store growth and how that is progressing. Just I know there have been sort of endemic problems across the industry. but the goal was to get the growth rate higher and perhaps into that 10% range next year. So any update there? Yes, I'll start with the components of the comp, Sara. Transactions were up 8.7% during the quarter. We also had a menu price increase effectively was 3.3%. That was 3% that we took -- effectively a 3% that we took last year, and then we had the -- the 1% effective that we took for the FAST Act as well. And we did have a negative mix. And the negative mix was based on group size, the negative mix was 1%. Group size was down about 2%, but that was offset by -- we did have some add-on mostly in chips queso and extra meat as well. What we're seeing as we moved into June, we're still seeing transactions be the main driver. So transactions were in the 3%, 3.5% during the month of June. So -- and then on the openings. I mean we're still on track, Sara. We're not seeing the time line really change at all. We did see some modest improvement so far this year, but the pipeline is very robust, and we feel good about the openings for this year. If that continues, just based on the inventory building alone and a time line don't worsen, we think we can get close to, if not all the way to that 10% in the next year. Got it. And just pricing for the rest of the year? So we have the 3% from last year that runs out in the middle of October. We'll continue to have California. Right now, we have no plans for further pricing. I mean, we'll look at how the rest of the next few months unfold. We'd love to get through the rest of the year based on what's going on. And again, we don't know how much is seasonality, whether there's something bigger going on. But it would be great to not have to take any price for the rest of this year. The next question comes from Dennis Geiger with UBS. Great. Jack and Adam, congratulations to you both. Just wanted to ask, Jack, a little bit more on the margin commentary that you made, specifically as it relates to some of that pressure over the coming quarters. If you could dive in a little more to some of the moving pieces there and maybe some of the efficiency offsets that you spoke to? Yes. So there's 3 main buckets. We've got inflation. Inflation generally has been relatively benign. We have 2 items. We called it out, avocado and dairy. Both of those ingredients, we do expect either near the end of the year or into early next year, we think those will normalize. Avocados, as you guys know, has been really a benefit. It's -- we've had great avocado price over the last several quarters. And so even the current avocado prices we're seeing right now, are more in the normal range. But we think that those will ease through the end of the year or into next year. So both of those, we feel good about. We do have pricing power. So we'll watch it very closely. And at some point in the future, we'll be able to offset that. The other item that we talked about, Brian mentioned, we decided that this brand equity called Generous Portions is something that we don't want to take for granted. We don't want to take something that's been a positive for all these years and then have it turned out to be a negative because of some of the social media comment. So we've made this investment, we'll continue to make the investment. We already have a number of initiatives underway. Some of them are operational. Some of those are supply chain efficiencies. We won't go into details of what those are, but we do think over the next couple of quarters that we'll be able to see some of those efficiencies. And I think that's really it in terms of where our margins are and what we think... Just the move from Chicken al Pastor. Yes, I mean, that's clearly temporary. Yes. I mean you have the mix shift. Clearly, that's going to be an LTO once we move from brisket into the next LTO, especially if it's a chicken, not only will that reverse, but it will turn into a positive for us. The next question comes from Peter Saleh with BTIG. I did want to ask about labor, if I could. I think, Brian, I think you mentioned a little over half of the units with an expeditor during peak hours. What's the holdup in terms of expanding the expeditor to more units? Because it feels like that's a key driver of throughput. Is labor just really tight? Is there a lot of turnover? Just any thoughts around that would be helpful. Yes, sure. So look, the good news is we've made progress to get to the 50%. The other piece of good news is we've got experienced in the past, we've been able to get to that number closer to 70-plus percent. So I'm confident with our operational leadership that's going on in the field right now, and here's a key piece of us think that gives us the ability to improve from where we are. We have really great staffing levels right now with turnover at some of the best levels it's been to date. And so the fact that we're getting these teams to be, I would say, more cohesive, more centered on the culture of great throughput, combined with great culinary, I'm confident that these teams will continue to improve. The other thing, too, you guys might have seen is we talked about this, giving our teams the visibility through reporting has really enabled them to enhance their performance. And I think just repetition using the tools that we have, and then just making sure that we don't have any real disruption to what the organization needs to be focused on. And I think we've done a nice job of keeping the teams focused. If you look at our leadership hierarchy, I think you talked to anybody in the operational leadership hierarchy. They all know we want great deployment. We want great culinary. We want great throughput. We want great culture. And -- like you, I wish it would go faster. I'm sure the good news is that we're making progress. And that's what I continue to keep an eye on, and I continue to make sure that we're staying consistent with our message, and we're supporting the teams with tools to set them up for success. The next question comes from Christine Cho with Goldman Sachs. Congratulations Jack and Adam and congrats on a great quarter. I just wanted to get -- to pick your brain on the overall industry trying to win traffic share with discounts and promotions. And I think you mentioned that -- to pull a value proposition is still very strong. But do you see any shift within the consumers that you can highlight? And specifically, I think a question for Brian. I think the last instance when we had this pretty fierce price competition, you were kind of on the other side of the fence. So any key -- key lessons you would take away from that experience back then? And how that applies to your plans going forward in navigating through this environment. Yes. So look, there's a lot there, but I'll start with -- I think I've said this over and over again. The thing that we need to make sure we do really well is great culinary, great burritos and bowls and treasure every single guest that comes into our restaurants, whether it's in line or online. And when we do that, we see our value scores and our brand become more loved. And one of the things that I keep an eye on closely is are we gaining market share? And what's great to see is we're gaining market share every month, okay? So as we stay focused on executing Chipotle's core business, we see the results not only in the comp and transactions that we're delivering but also the market share gains that we're making. And I've said this before, Chipotle is not built on this idea of promotional footballing prices, okay? Chipotle is built on this idea of great culinary, exactly how you want it and with great speed. And look, Steve had a simple idea. Great food done fast. We keep executing against that simple idea. I think we'll continue to get market share. And I think our value scores will continue to go up and our team will continue to be successful. And -- obviously, we've got to let other people play how they want to play. We're going to play our offense throughout this whole process. The next question comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. I guess just following up on that. I think in the prior few quarters, you had talked about kind of outperforming amongst lower-income consumers. And I apologize if you mentioned that, it's a really choppy connection on my end. But are you still seeing that kind of strength across income cohorts? And on the Brisket, is that something we should expect, Jack, to impact the fourth quarter as well? So I'll answer your first question. The good news is we are seeing transaction growth from every income cohort, which I think speaks to the strength of our brand and our value proposition. And then as we continue to march forward, our goal is to continue to give people the bowls and burritos that they want at the speed that really delights them. So hopefully, that continues to resonate with every income cohort. To date, it has -- and from what we see in our consumer research, it will continue to delight every income cohort. On your brisket question, I'll let Jack jump in on that. Yes. Sharon, what I can tell you is there will be an impact, but there's other things going on as well. So our food costs -- we expect our food cost to be similar in Q4 as Q3. So not another step up. The next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. The question was on the automated digital make line. Just in terms of what you've seen in your cultivate center and your culinary center, how scalable is this machine? In other words, if you do decide and like what you see in the stage gate process, how fast could this potentially be nationally? Does your equipment supplier have the capacity to kind of get up and running for the entire system is kind of the first question. And then secondly, related to that, if we are talking about consistency and speed as being 2 things that you want to do really well, it does seem like an automated make line would be perfect for that, not just on digital make line, but even putting it into the front counter as well, whether kiosk ordering or app ordering or whatever that case may be, would that be considered as part of an early stage gate process as well once you establish it on the back make line. Yes. And thanks for the question. Obviously, we're really excited about Python and the automated digital make line. We will have that in a restaurant probably here at the end of August, early September, somewhere around there, which will be really exciting to see. Look, obviously, we want to stay after consistency and speed. Those are 2 equities of the brand that are really important. The good news is we've got a bunch of different initiatives in the stage gate process. So look, I never like to have all my eggs in one basket, right? And what I'm really delighted about is we've got things that make us more efficient with prep, whether it's Autocado, a veggie slice or a dual sided grill looking at modifications to our rice cooker, our prior equipment. So there's a lot of things going on back of house to make us more effective culinary wise, prep wise, which then sets us up to be successful consistently on the front line and the digital make line. I've talked about these things also where we're also experimenting with AI and vision to ensure that our teams get the support I'm actually reading a great book that is called co-intelligence. It talks about how you use AI as a partner. And that's really what you've heard us talk about this, is cobotics, right? I think now this is -- I like this term co-intelligence to help our teams be more effective with forecasting, executing every single bowl correctly bringing things up. Exactly correctly.
So look, I'm really excited about all the things we have in the pipeline. Obviously, we spent a lot of time talking about how you think it is probably the most visible it looks pretty darn cool, too. But I just want to make sure it's important we talk about like we've got a lot of things from an innovation standpoint that really understand the operating model to make us more efficient, better culinary every single time, consistent every single time, and frankly, makes the job easier for our team members to be successful which then results in, I think, great outcomes for our customers. So a bit more answer to your question, but I think it's important to just highlight Python is a great tool, but there's a lot of tools we're working on that I think are going to make us better in the future. The next question comes from Andrew Charles with TD Cowen. Great. And just everyone else, congrats to both Jack and Adam, Jack [indiscernible] has been. Jack, curious just with the guidance, why keep the mid-single-digit part just given the blowout from 2Q as well as the fact that it sounds like July [indiscernible] but around that 6% trend that mid-single-digit piece suggests a pretty wide range of outcomes for the back half of the year, it implies some deceleration potentially coming. So can you just talk more about the guidance philosophy? Yes. I mean there's 2 things going on. One is, like we said, since the pandemic, the summer months have been more difficult to predict like the first year when you have the normal going back-to-school and leaving school and then going back to school, that was very, very different last year. Vacations really were pulled forward. This year, vacations were pulled forward again, it looks like they've even stepped up again. So there's difficulty in predicting the seasonality. The other thing keep in mind is we do have 300 basis points of pricing rolling off. So now what we hope to do is hopefully in a couple of quarters, we're talking about how the guidance ended up being perhaps on the conservative side. But right now, with everything that's going on, whether it's seasonality or something that's more of a bigger approach or a bigger impact on the consumer. We think this is the right guidance level. And our intent is giving you a little bit more granularity in terms of what the months are looking like to give you kind of idea an idea of what we're seeing right now. And I think with risk coming up, we're very optimistic that was a big demand the first time. We actually just couldn't even keep it in stock it. We ran out of it so fast. We're optimistic, but we also want to be cautious in this environment. That's helpful. And in past years, before the inflation issue, we saw that there was typically about a 2% price increase, 2.5% price increase taken in December. what's the likelihood we see that again for next year? I know you're seeing some temporary margin headwinds. But as we think about pricing levels for next year, I mean what's the likelihood we see something coming in December? Well, that's a long time away. I assume you're thinking December 2025. That's a long ways away. In this environment, we love the idea of being able to get through the rest of this year without a price increase. Where we would feel better in terms of the timing of a price increase is in an environment where the economy is robust and healthy. The consumer is feeling very, very healthy, and they're spending and the restaurant industry in general is going well. And transactions are accelerating, not decelerating. That's a great environment when you use inflation to take a modest increase 2%. Our price increases have gone well, but we would not want to take that for granted. So I think it would be really data dependent like what's going on in inflation. But as importantly, what's going on with the consumer, what's going on with transaction trends. The next question comes from Lauren Silberman with Deutsche Bank. I wanted to ask on the LTO strategy. You have one in spring, one in fall. It just seems like you generally comped the LTO comp for lack of a better phrase pretty consistently. What enables you to keep growing LTOs year-over-year incidence rates growing each year? And do you tend to see like during the periods of LTOs that comps actually accelerate even though it's off a higher base? Yes. So look, the good news is we have a nice mix with our menu news of items that we've done in the past as well as completely new menu items. And I think what we've demonstrated is when we go back to something like a Chicken al Pastor or carne asada, we seem to be able to talk about it in a much more exciting way maybe than we did the original time because we learned some things on it. We execute better because we know how to train on it. The teams are familiar with the execution. So that's been really nice to see. The one thing I want to remind everybody on all these things, though, is one of the ways to make all these initiatives much more effective, great operational execution. If we have terrific throughput terrific deployment, and we execute culinary really well. The menu innovation gets amplified because we give our guests a great experience. So it does a great job of bringing in incremental customers, incremental transactions. But if we have soft operations, these efforts won't be nearly as effective. So I really think it's a combination of stronger operations than maybe the last time when we executed this program combined with, I think, a more informed marketing program than we did at the prior time. So that's one of the things I love about this organization. We're committed to learning. We're committed to always figure out how we can be better. And I think that's what you see coming out of Chipotle time and time again. Great. If I could just do a quick follow-up on the 3Q guide. I understand a lot of noise, but can we -- is it safe to assume that the 25% restaurant level margin guide implies about a 6% underlying comp for the quarter? That's -- that's a fair assumption. Yes, you're in the ballpark. The next question comes from Jon Tower with Citi. Congrats, Jack and Adam. Maybe just a quick follow-up and then a question. First, you had mentioned earlier the generous portion stuff that you're going to be doing in the short term. Are you doing anything to message that to the consumer maybe something beyond what Brian you've already done on social media. And then I guess my question is more along the lines of -- there's obviously been a fairly significant price increase in California because of the wage rate hikes. Any sort of or change in consumer behavior in that market that you're seeing at your stores or perhaps more broadly across the industry that you could speak to? So look, your first question, part of the reason why we went and looked across the system was when we got the feedback on the portion sizes, we've always felt the key equity of Chipotle is these generous portion sizes. So we wanted to make sure we're executing consistently across the system. And we've probably found about 10% or more of restaurants that we really view as outliers that needed to be retrained, recoached to be executing against what we believe are the right standards. At the same time, we collectively said, look, we do not go back 1 inch on our -- on that equity of generous portion sizes. So we communicate to the entire system. And look, I'm already seeing it in social media, people commenting on the burritos, the bowls that they're getting. And I think that is the best source of marketing is the word of mouth as people have these experiences with Chipotle. But the thing I want to emphasize is for 90% of our restaurants, they're doing business as usual. So I don't want it to be lost on the fact that this really was something where we doubled down as a system, but we really needed to kind of train up roughly 10% of the system. So I think it's going to continue to be a key equity of ours. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, it's an equity we care about. So we'll invest in it, and we'll figure out how to make sure we consistently do it every time. Yes. And then -- and then on California, so I'll make a comment or two. So yes, what we've seen is really across the entire state, we've seen a step down in the industry we've seen individual data points within the individual restaurants. And we've seen reports that there really has been a pullback in spending we've seen it as well. We've also seen that when we've seen individual restaurants. There's not a correlation between the step back in the spending versus the major price increase that was taken. And so it looks like there's just kind of a macro impact of less spending in the restaurant. We saw the same thing. Unfortunately, we raised prices by 100 basis points. We normally don't see much resistance. We still resistant to the point where we didn't get the 100 basis points at all. So we saw a pullback that equal the effect of menu price increase that we took. And it looks like that's about equal to what the pullback in the industry is. The next question comes from Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley. Jack and Adam, congratulations as well. the barbacoa kind of marketing initiative, could you just comment on that? Was it kind of a pretty material driver did people respond as you expected? Are there kind of other opportunities to do that sort of thing? Yes. Look, that was really effective. I think the marketing team did a great job of informing people of a great product that we have on our menu all the time. And as a result, we saw incidents go up. And I think it's going to be something we'll revisit in the future. The good news is we get another hidden gem, I think, with carnitas, that we'll evaluate as well. But you'll probably see us do that again because it worked really well for us. Okay. Great. And Brian, your comments on automation, but also some of the other kind of initiatives that you mentioned. How fast do you think some of those can show up? Is this a sort of thing or we start to see it in a year or 2? Are some of these longer term, do we see it in the form of kind of continued margin upside? Like how should we kind of assess some of those as outsiders? Yes. Look, I think like you would expect with any good portfolio of ideas, we have short term, medium term and longer term, right? And some of those things are much closer in versus something like a hype and is a little bit further out. And the thing that's great is we're validating all of it through the stage gate. This is one thing that I love about the stage-gate process is it doesn't slow things down. It just ensures we don't have any unintended consequences. So that as we roll things out, we're informed with what we're executing. But yes, some of those things can happen on much faster time lines and some of the other things take a little bit longer. So it's a really nice way, if I would say, near term, midterm and long term. The next question comes from Danilo Gargiulo with Bernstein. Last time we discussed, you were talking about throughput that was in the mid-20s. Where do you stand today? And can you maybe help us understand the major catalyst of throughput acceleration from here on? Yes, sure. So the -- obviously, we saw our biggest improvement in throughput during the month of April, which was great to see. And we continue to see great throughput execution from folks. The thing that's going to push the throughput forward even further is ultimately the deployment being done correctly, right? So if we get that expo number to a higher percentage, not surprisingly, that expo position is the biggest impact on throughput gains. And so that's why you hear us talking about that position as kind of like the key metric of are we deployed correctly to execute create throughput during peak. So I'm optimistic that we're going to move that 50% number up, and I'm optimistic that we'll be able to move from the mid-20s to the high 20s in the not-too-distant future. Great. And can you please provide an update on the restaurant level margins and demand that you're seeing in European markets. I mean you're making some bold investments over there change in leadership as well. So when do you think it's going to be realistic to expect an acceleration in units in Europe as well? Yes. Look, I'm really excited about the progress that our team has made over in Europe in really short order. They've taken a lot of the tools in the U.S. We put them into place in Europe. I think we're managing food better. We're managing the supply chain better, managing deployment better. The culinary, I think, has really improved. So not surprising, you're seeing -- we're seeing nice improvements both in top line and bottom line. So I'm optimistic that we're going to be proving those as investable markets to kind of go even faster down the road, similar to what happened in Canada. So the team has made nice progress. I'm sure they'll be busy in Paris with the Olympics coming up, but I'm really -- really delighted with [indiscernible] have done in kind of short order. And our last question will come from Chris O'Cull with Stifel. Congratulations Jack and Adam. I just wanted to ask, Brian, do you see any signs that the increase in value promotions by the QSR chains have had any impact on the company's results? We really haven't. And I kind of point to the fact that we're gaining market share according to the data we get back. And the brand metrics continue to strengthen, and one of those key strength components is our value proposition. So when I kind of connect all the dots of market share gains, strength in the brands, strengthen our operational execution, it appears some of these promotions are not having an impact on our business as of this moment. So again, the thing we have to do is play our offense. And our offense, as I mentioned earlier, is great culinary, great teams, great throughput and that results in great burritos and bowls for our customers. So we're going to stay after it. And if the environment gets tougher, the good news for us is if the prior macro issues or recessions that we face, Chipotle is one of the last ones impacted, and we were one of the first ones out of the slowdown. So it gives me confidence that we've got the right focus, the right operating model. And I think it's going to continue to resonate with customers. That's helpful. And just as a follow-up. You talked a lot about product innovation, obviously, that has been very successful. And one 1 of the factors, I think, Jack, you mentioned benefiting April sales was the marketing activation event. And I'm just wondering, can you help us understand how impactful these events can be and whether this is something the company could consider using more frequently if the -- if the consumer spending environment were to become more challenging? Yes. Look, it's a great question. And this is really, I think, the power of our combination of our digital marketing/tr consumer database, combined with what I think are some really clever marketing moments, right, like National Burrito Day, National Avocado Day. Obviously, we have the ability to turn on block mode. We have the ability to do other things that I think are very insight-based that we know resonate with the Chipotle customer. And I think that's one thing that's great about having such a big kind of base on our customers and then doing, I think, a really effective job using digital marketing or traditional marketing tools to communicate these unique opportunities with our customers. So you'll continue to see us use it, and I think it's a huge advantage that we have, the strength of this loyalty program combined with a really talented marketing team. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Brian Niccol for any closing remarks. All right. Thank you. And thanks, everybody, for all the questions. Again, I do want to recognize Mr. Jack Hartung on having the privilege to work with Jack as well as, I think Chipotle and everybody involved with Chipotle has a huge thank you from Mr. Hartung. So thank you again, Jack. Thank you. And obviously, we're excited for Adam to step into the CFO role and then obviously, Jamie McConnell stepping up into her Chief Accounting role. So terrific leaders under, again, Jack's leadership that are going to get the opportunity to make even bigger contributions to this great brand. So congratulations, everybody.
And then on to the business, obviously, it was an outstanding quarter. I couldn't be prouder of the results the organization and what we accomplished. We get 8% transaction growth in any environment is pretty special. And I think it's a testament, great operations, great marketing, great digital. I mean we just -- we've got a lot of things going the right way. And as a result, the brand metrics have never been better. The value proposition is super strong. And whatever is in store for us. I'm sure we'll have our ups and downs. I always go back to having a strong brand with a strong organization sets you up for success. And I'm confident that we are building from a position of strength. And I look forward to finishing the year strong. Obviously, we've got a couple of more quarters to go. But I just want to reemphasize what a great quarter. What a great team and really proud of where we are and where we're headed. So thank you, everybody. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.","a reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found via the link included on the presentation page within the Investor Relations section of our website . the second quarter was outstanding as successful brand marketing, including the return of Chicken al Pastor as a limited time offer drove strong demand to our restaurants . for the quarter, sales grew 18% to reach nearly $3 billion .",0.0
